President Trump's racist tweets and comments are drawing support in Montana, where Trump won by 20 percentage points in the 2016 popular vote against Hillary Clinton.

Sen. Steve Daines, Republican from Montana, tweeted in support of Trump on Monday, writing: ""Montanans are sick and tired of listening to anti-American, anti-Semite, radical Democrats trash our country and our ideals. This is America. We're the greatest country in the world. I stand with @realdonaldtrump.""

In a tweet on Sunday, the president called for four freshmen Democratic House members to ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."" Trump's series of tweets incorrectly states the women of color all came from other countries. Three were born in the United States, and all four are American citizens.

Daines is running for re-election in 2020, and the Montana GOP featured his tweet in an fundraising email.

Many Montanans who support Trump are joining Daines in standing with Trump.

At Black Butte range in Billings, Mont., gunsmith Jerome Hall, a veteran who describes himself as a Trump supporter, says he thinks Trump's tweets and the reaction to them were funny, not racist.

""It just makes me giggle that everybody's all up in arms about this,"" he says. He doesn't think Trump made a racial comment, rather one about the places these congresswomen represent.

""Trump saying they need to go back to their country is pretty much him saying 'go back to California, go back to New York,' "" he says. He believes Trump may have misspoke and meant to say ""state"" instead of ""country.""

""Social media is social media. Everybody takes it as the word of God, and it's not,"" he says. ""I post stupid stuff on Facebook all the time and that's because it's funny. I'm more worried about what he plans on spending the budget on. That's what I'm looking at. Where is he putting the money for the state? Is it going to stupid stuff, is it going to make the state better? Everything like that.""

As for Daines' support of Trump's comments, Hall says the senator was ""doing what he was hired to do by the police of Montana.""

""The people that voted him in are now the ones saying he needs to leave because he supports Trump all because he supports Trump,"" Hall says. ""If it would have been a different candidate, then if Hillary would have posted that, everybody would be freaking out cheering her on.""

Montana native and Black Butte Range co-owner Andrew Stapleton doesn't agree with everything Trump does but says he saw the tweets as a criticism of the congresswomen's work in their own districts.

""Essentially, as I read this is 'Don't throw rocks if you live in a glass house,' "" he says. ""It just has to do with, go back and fix your areas, and then you can try to fix my area.""

Tanner Lineberry, who sells building supplies and stopped into the range, says Trump's comments and the reaction are just a distraction from the president's accomplishments. He praised Trump's work on the economy and foreign policy.

And he agrees with Trump's tweets. ""It doesn't sound like [the congresswomen] really want to be here ... so, if they don't want to be here, they should probably go somewhere else.""

Lineberry says Trump will have his support in 2020, as long as the president doesn't go after gun rights.

Many Montanans, however, are joining the outrage against Trump and including Daines in their criticism.

Helena, Mont., Mayor Wilmot Collins, a Liberian refugee who's vying for the Democratic nomination to challenge Daines in 2020, tweeted, ""I served this country for over 20 years in the U.S. Armed Forces. Does @SteveDaines think I should 'go back to where I came from' too?""

Collins later posted a video recounting one of his early days in Montana, when he says a vandal spray-painted on his door, ""Go back to Africa.""

""This kind of behavior is inevitable from vandals in the night, or anonymous online commenters, but not from a U.S. senator,"" Collins said.

Collins is calling on Daines to apologize for questioning the loyalty of the four Democratic representatives.

John Mues, a veteran and engineer from Loma also seeking the Democratic nod, called Daines a ""divider whose policies weaken America"" and likened him to regime leaders in North Korea and Saudi Arabia.

Collins and Mues are using the tweet to leverage donations.

Late Monday afternoon, Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester tweeted, ""We should be able to disagree on policy and politics without devolving into divisive, hateful rhetoric. President Trump's comments were reprehensible and far beneath the office of the presidency.""

An email sent from the Montana GOP account on Tuesday says the party and Daines stand behind the president's tweets.

A spokesperson for Daines told Yellowstone Public Radio that Americans agree with Daines' take and that he values feedback from all Montanans."
Rand Paul angles to become Trump's emissary to Iran,https://www.politico.com,"['Eliana Johnson', 'Nahal Toosi']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/17/rand-paul-iran-talks-donald-trump-1418075,"Sen. Rand Paul has been among the most prominent voices warning against military intervention. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images White House Rand Paul angles to become Trump's emissary to Iran The senator pitched the idea during a recent round of golf with the president.

Over a round of golf this past weekend, Sen. Rand Paul asked President Donald Trump’s blessing for a sensitive diplomatic mission.

Paul proposed sitting down with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to extend a fresh olive branch on the president’s behalf, according to four U.S. officials. The aim: to reduce tensions between the two countries. Trump signed off on the idea.

Story Continued Below

With Zarif in New York City this week for U.N. meetings and private sitdowns with journalists and think-tank experts, the prospect of the dovish Kentucky senator serving as the administration’s chief diplomatic emissary has rankled many administration officials, who are expressing concern that Paul’s intervention threatens to scuttle the president’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran.

It is unclear whether the senator will meet with Zarif. He and his office declined multiple requests for comment. But the president’s willingness to tap Paul as the go-between with a top Iranian official is a demonstration both of his unorthodox approach to foreign affairs and his continuing desire, even as his aides threaten to squeeze Iran until it capitulates to U.S. demands, to entice the Islamic Republic’s leaders to the negotiating table.

Trump has been attempting to start negotiations with Iran for months, a campaign that has included letters to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, an attempt to use Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as an emissary to Tehran, and public comments expressing his desire to talk. Some Iranian officials have said that they are open to negotiations, but only after the administration removes sanctions. Khamenei, however, has likened talking with the U.S. to drinking “poison.”

Paul, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.), played a round of golf with the president on Saturday at his club in Sterling, Va.

The libertarian-leaning Paul has long been wary of U.S. foreign intervention, and he’s clashed with Trump administration officials over the possibility of a military conflict with Iran. When Trump last month called off retaliatory military strikes against Iran after an Iranian military official downed a U.S. drone over international waters, Paul went on the president’s favorite television network to offer unqualified praise. ""It really takes a statesman to show restraint amidst a chorus of voices for war,"" Paul told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/2944/1155968404_6051695176001_6051691232001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

He also criticized the administration’s policy, arguing that Iranians view the punishing sanctions imposed by the Trump administration as “an act of war.”

Paul has long been at odds with the team of hawks serving at the top echelons of the Trump administration, including National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. At the outset of the administration, he led a public campaign against the administration’s current special envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, when his name was floated as a candidate for deputy secretary of state — and helped to scuttle his candidacy by bashing his hawkish views in an appearance on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show, according to a source directly familiar with the events.

Earlier this year, Paul pressed Pompeo on whether the administration believes it has the authority to battle the Iranian regime under a 2001 law that allowed the U.S. to pursue the fight against al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups in Afghanistan and beyond.

When Pompeo tried to sidestep the question, Paul warned the administration not to pursue such a conflict, at least not without Congress’ imprimatur.

“You do not have the permission of Congress to go to war with Iran,” Paul told Pompeo during the April hearing on Capitol Hill. “Only Congress can declare war.”

The move smacks of desperation, said Mark Dubowitz, head of the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which has pushed for a hard line on Iran.

""It’s a fine idea to make it clear you’re interested in negotiating and a diplomatic path, but you have to be selective and circumspect,"" Dubowitz said. ""Right now, Trump has tapped everybody and their mother to be an emissary.""

""The one thing that these guys don’t understand is the more desperate they look for a deal the more the Iranian regime will play hard to get,"" he added. ""Then when it comes to the table it will be even more inflexible in its negotiating position. And the final result will end up looking like Obama 2.0.""

When told that the president had blessed an outsider to reach out to Zarif, a Trump administration official familiar with Iran issues laughed and quipped: ""He's given up on all of us!""

Iranian officials did not reply to requests for comment.

"Pelosi rips Trump bid to link Dems to ‘Squad,’ vows not to ‘waste our time on that’",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-rips-trump-bid-to-link-dems-to-squad-vows-not-to-waste-time-on-that,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back hard Wednesday against President Trump’s efforts to cast New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s progressive “squad” as the face of her party, now that the fractious caucus has united to condemn the president's racially charged tweets.

“With all due respect, let’s not waste our time on that,” Pelosi said during a Capitol press conference when asked about the president’s efforts to tie Democrats to the progressive lawmakers.

Speaking of Trump, she said, “We are not having him set our agenda. We are setting our own agenda.”

OCASIO-CORTEZ GETS NEW 2020 CHALLENGER: A REPUBLICAN IMMIGRANT FROM JAMAICA

In recent days, the president and the Republican National Committee have made a concerted effort to tie the entire Democratic Party to freshman lawmakers Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. This, after Democrats came to their defense over the president’s tweets saying they should ""go back"" to the countries they came from (despite all but Omar being from the United States) and then return to show everyone how to fix things.

Trump on Wednesday tweeted: “The 'squad' has moved the Democrat Party substantially LEFT, and they are destroying the Democrat Party.” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel drew attention to the lawmakers' left-wing stances on issues, tweeting, “Listen to what we hear from the Squad: It’s abolish ICE, it’s calling law enforcement Nazis. It’s anti-American and anti-Semitic rhetoric.”

During the press conference, Pelosi dismissed Trump’s actions as a designed distraction.

""You have to give him credit, he’s a great distractor, that’s what this is about,” Pelosi said. “So let’s just take it to a better place: America.”

She also repeatedly cited the late Republican President Ronald Reagan in condemning Trump for his comments.

“He is denigrating all the newcomers who come to our country in complete opposition to the beautiful words of Ronald Reagan in the last speech he made to the country as president of the United States,"" Pelosi said.

Last week, the four congresswomen had an ongoing public spat with Pelosi, which got heated after Ocasio-Cortez suggested that the speaker was ""singling out"" them because they were ""women of color."" Pelosi previously dismissed their vocal opposition to a House-approved border funding bill.

Their feud, however, seemed to have evaporated on Sunday after Trump targeted them on Twitter, suggesting they should ""go back"" to the countries they came from despite three of the four congresswomen being born in the U.S. and all four of them being U.S. citizens.

Trump's tweets on Tuesday were formally condemned by the Democratic-controlled House, resulting in a 240-187 vote.

But while Trump’s comments are still dominating headlines, Pelosi and the progressive lawmakers are still working through their issues.

During a sit down with ""CBS This Morning"" host Gayle King on Tuesday, Tlaib sent a warning message to Pelosi: ""Acknowledge the fact that we are women of color, so when you do single us out, be aware of that and what you're doing, especially because some of us are getting death threats, because some of us are being singled out because of our backgrounds, because of our experiences and so forth.""

King followed up with Ocasio-Cortez, asking if she was ""interested in having a conversation"" with Pelosi, to which Ocasio-Cortez responded, ""Absolutely.""

On Wednesday, Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement they “received a request from the Office of Rep. Ocasio-Cortez for a one-on-one meeting. We are working to ... schedule this meeting.”

Pelosi, during Wednesday's press conference, also signaled she isn’t embracing a renewed effort from Texas Rep. Al Green to launch a fresh bid to impeach Trump because of his comments about the progressive lawmakers, suggesting she wants any effort to come out of the already-established process on Capitol Hill.

“With all due respect in the world for him, we have six committees that are working on following the facts in terms of any abuse of power, obstruction of justice and the rest that the president may have engaged in,"" she said. ""That is the serious path that we’re on.”

Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area,https://www.npr.org,['Merrit Kennedy'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/07/17/742519999/future-of-key-farming-research-uncertain-as-2-3-of-usda-staff-say-they-wont-move,"Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

Two vital research agencies at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are hemorrhaging staff as less than two-thirds of the researchers asked to relocate from Washington to the Kansas City area have agreed to do so.

When U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the planned new location of the research agencies last month, he said it ""will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders"" and ""increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture.""

But groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists call it a ""blatant attack on science"" that will ""especially hurt farmers, ranchers and eaters at a particularly vulnerable time.""

The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA's Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, said the relocation ""has resulted in catastrophic attrition at USDA's top research agencies.""

""Evidence suggests that the relocation of these agencies is an attempt to hollow out and dismantle USDA science that helps farmers and protects our food supply,"" the union added.

The USDA gave employees until just before midnight on Monday to notify their employers whether they planned to accept the relocation.

On Tuesday, a USDA spokesperson told NPR that at ERS, 72 employees accepted relocation and 99 declined or did not respond. At NIFA, the spokesperson said 73 accepted and 151 declined or did not respond. That means the total number that accepted is about 36% of those reported.

The USDA spokesperson said that these numbers may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the date employees are expected to report to the area, and employees can change their statuses until then.

They added that the USDA is working ""to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA's work.""

Last month, the USDA said that of the 644 jobs in the two agencies, 544 would be relocated and 100 would remain in the D.C. area. The numbers reported on Tuesday by the USDA do not appear to account for some 150 positions that the USDA initially announced would be relocated.

The department did not immediately respond to explain the difference, though the employees' union has reported high rates of ""retirements, employees securing new jobs, and employees choosing to be terminated."" A statement last month from three Democratic senators said that ERS had a vacancy rate of 20% and NIFA had a vacancy rate of 26.4%.

NIFA provides grants for research on agriculture-related science, and the ERS conducts research and analysis on topics such as outlooks on major crops and livestock, how much food is going to cost and whether U.S. households will be food secure.

It's not yet clear whether the research agencies will be located in Kansas or Missouri, according to The Kansas City Star.

Lawmakers from both states, including Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, have supported the move. ""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" the Republican said, as NPR's Frank Morris reported.

An ex-employee of ERS recently told Morris that ""efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale."" He said the way the agency is run has become increasingly partisan, and he resigned after the surprise announcement about relocations.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee told Morris.

Some of ERS' recent studies, as Morris noted, may be politically uncomfortable for the Trump administration:

""ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.""

Perdue said last month that the move would save the USDA some $300 million. That number has been met with skepticism by some analysts. The Agricultural & Applied Economics Association estimated the relocation would actually cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million, partially due to the lost value of the research from staffers who decide not to move."
"Donald Trump is not America's first racist president, but hopefully he'll be our last",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Paul Brandus', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/17/donald-trump-racist-president-hates-what-makes-america-great-column/1743525001/,"CLOSE

Why does Trump hate the things that make our country great? And how do the rest of us get beyond this hatred and ignorance?

It was amusing at the start of the great racist tweet controversy to hear the media asking, “Is President Donald Trump a racist?” We are well beyond such questions.

“I am the least racist person you have ever met,” he has said on numerous occasions. If you were living solo on a deserted island and he showed up, that might be true, but for everyone else, it’s just another one of his delusional claims. In fact, I have met the president myself, and he’s off by one word. He is not the least racist person I’ve ever met — he is the most.

Trump supporters reading this will probably get upset and melt like snowflakes.Yet since October 1973, when Richard Nixon’s Justice Department sued Trump and his father Fred for barring blacks from their apartment buildings, it has been known that the president is a racist — and a congenital one at that.

Trump racism goes back decades

The least racist person you have ever met? You don’t know the history of the Central Park Five (Trump called for the death penalty for the accused teens), or the history of blacks who worked at his casinos (fine paid for discrimination, and much more) in Atlantic City.

The least racist person you have ever met? “Laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control,” he said in a 1997 Playboy interview.

The least racist person you have ever met? Mexicans? “they’re rapists.” White supremacists waving swastikas in Charlottesville? “very fine people on both sides.” On and on and on.

Before we move on, here’s my favorite. Remember when Trump (you know, the least racist person you’ve ever met) said that Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS” and that many African nations were “s---hole countries?”

One country he has singled out is Nigeria; he said once Nigerians have seen the United States, they would never “go back to their huts.”

His base loves this stuff, but guess what? The joke’s on them. According to Trump’s own Census Bureau, Nigerian immigrants are far better educated than white Americans. For instance, 17% of Nigerians who are here have a master’s degree; just 8% of whites do. And 4% of Nigerians who are here have a Ph.D. Just 1% of whites do.

Holding these figures down are lesser educated white folks like Trump himself and his relatives. None of them have an advanced degree — though Tiffany Trump, a second-year law student at Georgetown, may be the first to earn one.

Racism from Andrew Johnson to FDR

Americans have survived racist presidents before. Woodrow Wilson, a southerner, opposed postwar Reconstruction because ""the dominance of an ignorant and inferior race was justly dreaded."" He opposed giving blacks the right to vote, claiming “it was a menace to society,” and as president he oversaw the re-segregation of the federal government. He lived in the White House a century ago.

Calvin Coolidge signed an immigration bill aimed at keeping out “the yellow peril” — i.e. Asians, along with Africans and Arabs. “America must be kept American,” he said in 1923.

Trump's tweets: Bullies told me to go back to my country. At first it silenced me, now it spurs me on.

And everyone knows that after Pearl Harbor was bombed, Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, leading to the forced relocation of 117,000 Japanese Americans from the West Coast to inland internment camps. FDR’s defenders pointed out that we had just been bombed by Japan and were at war.

But few know that in 1925, Roosevelt wrote that “Japanese immigrants are not capable of assimilation into the American population...Anyone who has traveled in the Far East knows that the mingling of Asiatic blood with European and American blood produces, in nine cases out of ten, the most unfortunate results.”

FDR led us through the Great Depression and World War II. He was one of our greatest presidents. Yet those words cannot be ignored.

Visions of racial superiority

There are other examples — Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was probably the worst of all — but you get the idea. American history is dotted with presidents who harbored visions of racial superiority.

But not in the modern era, at least not to the degree that we have seen with Trump. He went from bad to worse just the last few days with his attacks on ""The Squad"" -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar, D-,Minn., Ayanna Pressley D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., all young freshmen congresswomen of color. And then he doubled down Monday, saying they hate America?

Actually, Trump seems to hate America himself. After all, he has complained about several amendments to our Constitution. He has complained about our system of checks and balances, our judicial system, our free press, people who are different than him.

Why does he hate the things that make our country great? And how do the rest of us get beyond this hatred and ignorance?

Donald Trump is not our first racist president. Let us hope, however, that he will be our last.

Mark Esper headed for quick confirmation after acing largely bipartisan Senate hearing,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/mark-esper-headed-for-quick-confirmation-after-acing-largely-bipartisan-senate-hearing,"ON THE GLIDE SLOPE: Mark Esper, President Trump’s fallback nominee to head the Defense Department, did everything he needed to do yesterday to win quick and easy confirmation. With one notable exception (more on that below), he cruised effortlessly through his 2 hour, 45 minute hearing before the Armed Services Committee, telling the senators just what they wanted to hear, reassuring them he would work on their concerns, and generally showing a deep understanding of the issues facing the U.S. military.

For the most part the hearing was a bipartisan lovefest, beginning with the introduction of the nominee by Democratic former vice presidential candidate Sen. Tim Kaine, who compared Esper to Jim Mattis, the widely-respected previous defense secretary, who resigned last December over policy differences with the president.

“Most of us were very discouraged by the resignation of Secretary Mattis. And what we've hoped for is a successor who could show the same level of candor and principle and a willingness to remain independent even in the most challenging circumstances,” Kaine said at the start of the hearing. “I believe that Dr. Esper has those traits.”

IN THE MOLD OF MATTIS: Though lacking Mattis’ résumé as a decorated general and legendary commander, Esper does have a solid military background, having spent 10 years on active duty and another 11 years in the Guard. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, he served as an infantry officer with the Army’s 101st Airborne Division.

And while Esper was not exactly a protégé of Mattis, he has adopted his positions , including Mattis’s three “lines of effort” to move the Pentagon into the 21st century, namely to build a more lethal force, strengthen alliances, and reform the Pentagon to free up resources.

Michigan Democrat Gary Peters asked Esper point-blank, “Would you be a secretary of defense with views more aligned with Secretary Mattis or more aligned with President Trump?”

“I don't know where to pick between the two,” Esper said, “but clearly I shared Secretary Mattis’ views and I've expressed that publicly.” Pressed by Peters about whether he might also consider resigning on principle if asked to support a policy counter to his values, Esper said, “Absolutely,” adding “In the Army, I grew up with this view that you're asked to do anything that is illegal, or immoral, or unethical, then that would be the point at which you have to consider resignation and you'd be willing to do that.”

WARREN’S CRUSADE: The one tense part of the hearing came when Massachusetts Democrat and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren began aggressively grilling Esper on one of her pet issues. Warren has proposed legislation to tighten the rules designed to avoid conflict of interests when members of the administration come from, or move to, private industry.

Warren pressed Esper repeatedly to agree to voluntarily extend the period in which he is required to recuse himself from matters affecting his prior employer, Raytheon, from two years to the rest of his term. And she wanted a promise he would never ask for a waiver that is provided for under law in extreme circumstances. Both go beyond current ethics requirements.

But it was Warren’s prosecutorial tone, demanding yes-or-no answers and refusing to let Esper give nuanced answers, that rubbed a lot of her colleagues the wrong way.

Committee chairman Jim Inhofe had to intervene to allow Esper to answer Warren’s question, and he later apologized for the exchange, which he called “unfair.” Democrat Joe Manchin also expressed consternation, telling Esper: “I hope you realize that this is part of this process.”

“I’m very disappointed that Sen. Warren would demonize you after you decades of service simply because you served in the private sector,” said Rick Scott, a Florida Republican. “There’s a lot of us who have been in the private sector and that doesn’t take anything away from our ability to do our job. I guess she just needed a moment for her presidential campaign,” Scott said.

HAPPENING TODAY: The annual Aspen Security Forum begins tonight in Aspen, Colorado, with a discussion on the future of NATO with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. The three-day event features a who’s who of national security luminaries, including Adm. Philip Davidson, commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command; Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, director, Defense Intelligence Agency; Zalmay Khalilzad, U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation; and Adm. Karl Schultz, commandant, U.S. Coast Guard. Video from the various panels will be broadcast live today through Friday. The full agenda is posted here .

WILL TRUMP SANCTION TURKEY? The Pentagon, the State Department, and the Congress have repeatedly said over the last year that Turkey cannot have both the U.S. F-35 fighter and the Russian S-400 missile system designed to shoot it down.

Now that Turkey has begun accepting delivery of the sophisticated Russian air defenses, we’ve been waiting for a formal announcement about whether the U.S. will make good on its threat, as well as whether it will impose additional economic sanctions against Ankara as mandated in the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).

While there is still no formal announcement, yesterday President Trump reluctantly conceded that the U.S. can’t give Turkey the 100 F-35s it’s ordered, or allow them to build parts for them, even though he says Turkey is the victim here.

“We have a situation where Turkey is very good with us, very good, and we are now telling Turkey that because you have really been forced to buy another missile system, we're not going to sell you the F-35 fighter jets. It's a very tough situation that they're in, and it's a very tough situation that we've been placed in, the United States,” Trump said. “With all of that being said, we're working through it. We'll see what happens, but it's not really fair.”

IT’S ALL OBAMA’S FAULT: Trump blames the Obama administration for allegedly refusing to sell U.S. Patriot missiles to Turkey, and thereby “forcing” the NATO ally to go with Russia. But one reason Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signed a deal with Moscow is that it includes a co-production agreement that would eventually allow Turkey to produce its own surface-to-air missile defenses, based on Russian technology.

The U.S. was willing to sell Turkey Patriot missiles, but not to give up the technology behind them. In the end it was that, along with Erdogan’s increasing tilt away from NATO and toward Russia, that killed the Patriot sale.

ARE SANCTIONS COMING? Congress has called on Trump to follow the law and punish Turkey beyond just booting it out of the F-35 program. “The Secretary and the President are examining all of the options that are in the CAATSA legislation,” said State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus, adding they “will make a decision based off what they're required to do according to U.S. law.”

IRAN SUSPECTED IN SHIP SEIZURE: A Panamanian-flagged oil tanker last seen near the Strait of Hormuz may have been seized by Iranian naval forces.

The MT Riah went missing after entering Iranian waters over the weekend, according to ship tracking data. U.S. intelligence officials believe it may have been forced into Iranian territory by members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy, according to CNN’s Barbara Starr. Some reports claim the Riah belonged to the United Arab Emirates, but a UAE official denied that claim on Monday.

McKENZIE IN GULF REGION: This latest incident comes as U.S. Central Commander Gen. Frank McKenzie is traveling in the region, reviewing the U.S. plans to deter Iran from threatening international shipping.

“Obviously we would take that very seriously,” McKenzie told CBS’s David Martin, who is traveling with him.

McKenzie is reviewing plans for the U.S. to conduct what Defense Secretary-nominee Esper told Congress yesterday would be “passive patrols,” under a mission dubbed “Operation Sentinel.”

“I think our ability to bring forces into the theater has acted to deter them. And I think we're in a period right now frankly where they're sort of recalculating and they're trying to sort of gauge our intent,” McKenzie told CBS.

MORE DIPLOMACY NEEDED: ""We do not want war with Iran. We are not seeking war with Iran. We need to get back on the diplomatic channel ,” Esper testified at his confirmation hearing yesterday.

He also said a future nuclear agreement with Iran should include a more permanent end to Iran’s nuclear activities and address its ballistic missile program. ""I do think we need to get back to a negotiated path with them,"" Esper said. ""Preferably an updated version of the [2015 nuclear deal] if you will, that addresses, with finality, a verifiable, irreversible, and permanent prohibition on their nuclear work and efforts.""

""So that would be number one, and then, we also need to address the means to deliver them, ICBMs,"" he added.

THEY’RE AT IT AGAIN: It was just over three weeks ago that President Trump and North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un were all smiles at their historic meeting at the DMZ, but now North Korea media is ramping up the rhetoric again, complaining about the latest round of U.S. and South Korean military exercises.

“This is clearly a breach of the main spirit of June 12 DPRK-U.S. Joint Statement and an undisguised pressure upon us,” said a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.

“The suspension of joint military exercises is what President Trump, commander-in-chief of the U.S., personally committed to at the DPRK-U.S. summit talks in Singapore under the eyes of the whole world,” the statement said, according to an English translation.

The complaint came with a threat to resume tests of missiles and possibly nuclear weapons. “With the U.S. unilaterally reneging on its commitments, we are gradually losing our justifications to follow through on the commitments we made with the U.S. as well.”

A MOMENT MEMORIALIZED: In other Korea-related news, a photograph of Trump and Kim is one of four new photos hanging in the White House. The photos were added to the West Wing on Monday, according to Bloomberg White House correspondent Jennifer Jacobs.

The photo is of Trump and Kim at the DMZ last month. Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to visit North Korea when he stepped across the DMZ into the country for a few moments.

Other photos show Trump with soldiers at the DMZ, the president with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, and Trump with French President Emmanuel Macron in Normandy.

DANGEROUS LIAISONS: The Center for Strategic and International Studies has released a new brief: “ Dangerous Liaisons: Russian Cooperation with Iran in Syria .”

The key takeaway: “As tensions escalate between the United States and Iran in the Middle East, Russia is engaged in covert and overt cooperation with Iran in ways that undermine U.S. national security interests. This analysis of commercial satellite imagery at Tiyas Airbase in Syria indicates the scope and proximity of Russian and Iranian military ties. If Washington wants to contain Tehran and prevent further Iranian expansion, U.S. policymakers will need to increase pressure on Moscow to curb Tehran’s activities in countries like Syria.”

A lack of charges in the case, which appeared to languish at the Justice Department over the years, underscores the ongoing turmoil and unusual divide at the DOJ, experts say."
Chaos reigns in Washington,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/donald-trump-racism-democrats-2020-election/index.html,"A Trump-induced midsummer madness enveloped the capital Tuesday, melting down some of the last bonds of civility needed for a functioning governing system.

The uproar set off by Trump's racist tweets echoed from the White House to Capitol Hill, confirming the truism that no one who chooses to go into battle alongside or against this street fighting President ever emerges truly unscathed.

The House erupted in bitter recriminations as Democrats passed a resolution condemning Trump for telling four minority lawmakers to ""go back"" to their ""crime infested"" countries. Three of the four women were born in the US. The other is a naturalized citizen.

Only four Republicans voted with the Democrats. The rest of their party instead tried to censure Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- surreally accusing her of breaking the chamber's arcane manners when she said Trump's rhetoric was ""disgraceful and disgusting"" and ""racist.""

At one point, the presiding officer, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Missouri, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, laid down his gavel and walked out in frustration.

Republicans twisted themselves in knots to avoid angering constituents by condemning the President's tweets, and sought to rebrand them as a patriotic denunciations of the extreme socialism they say is infecting the Democratic Party.

""I think this party has been very clear, we are the party of Lincoln,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said.

The Republican strategy was a reminder that most lawmakers in divided, gerrymandered America are more concerned about being primaried by a more radical activist than seeking the disappearing political center ground. It also underscored the omnipresent power of a President who warned colleagues whose history shows no previous sign of being reluctant to condemn racism not to show ""weakness.""

In an incongruous moment, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was stumped when asked what he would do if someone told his Taiwan-born wife to go back to the nationalist island.

In the twilight zone of the White House, the man who unleashed the fury, Trump, expressed disgust at the ""vile, horrible statements"" said by the women he targeted over the color of their skin.

In a bizarre moment outside, senior Trump aide Kellyanne Conway demanded to know the ethnicity of a reporter who asked her which country the four American lawmakers should return to.

In a later Fox News interview, Conway said the women represented ""the dark underbelly"" of disrespect for America's military.

And in another surreal twist to the situation, Conway's husband George earlier penned his latest devastating op-ed blasting his wife's boss as a ""racist President"" beyond the bounds of human decency.

But white nationalist Richard Spencer complained to CNN that Trump wasn't going far enough, saying he gave the movement nothing ""outside racist tweets"" that seem like the came from ""a drunk uncle.""

The price of division

At times, it was hard to believe such scenes -- inciting buried hatreds and toxicity that only racial politics can provoke -- were taking place one-fifth of the way through the 21st Century.

Yet this is what the Trump presidency has wrought. There is a price for the constant tearing of some of the nation's deepest divides. Some of it was on display in the rising tensions and distemper in Washington on Tuesday.

The lasting impact of such conscious polarization on the part of a President -- an office holder who is normally looked on to heal national wounds -- is not yet clear. But it is likely to be discombobulating and to leave the country more torn and difficult to govern whenever it is that Trump leaves the political scene.

Even Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived former White House communications director and longtime Trump friend, rebuked the President's ""bully-ish, Neanderthal-ish"" racist comments.

And Tuesday is only the beginning. Since Trump has put white nationalist fear mongering at the center of his reelection campaign, the atmosphere will surely worsen as 2020 looms.

""This is not going to be the last time this happens. We are going to be having this discussion a lot in the next 17 months because he thinks it is to his advantage to do it,"" David Axelrod, a CNN senior political analyst and former Barack Obama strategist said on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper.""

""And, yes, it is important for us as a country to express our moral outrage about these tactics, but at some point, they have to be discussed as tactics.""

Under normal circumstances, it would be a legacy-defining moment if a President was rebuked for racist language by the one half of a rival branch of government.

That it is not is a measure of how Trump broke the political mold, enjoys impunity for his boundless conduct and has utterly co-opted his party.

In the warped political calculations of the Trump era, the developments in the last few days might even come to be seen as some kind of political victory for the President.

By singling out Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan , he hoped to make some of the most radical Democrats the face of the party ahead of 2020. They have promised not to take Trump's ""bait"" but conservative media is making sure that Trump's base sees plenty of the quartet. It's also painting the President's racism as an example of liberal hysteria and yet more victimization of Trump by critics who are obsessed with identity politics.

And the President is not going to lose any sleep about being censured by the House. He's always framed himself as the scourge of the Washington elite and he knows GOP control of the Senate means he won't be embarrassed in the other chamber.

And for a day at least, the Democrats were distracted from their plans to pass a positive agenda on issues like health care, education and climate change that preoccupy their voters.

Normally, at moments of Trump-induced dysfunction, commentators note that the President engineers chaos as a master stroke to keep his political foes off balance.

His instinctive, incessant stoking of his base is interpreted as an effort to emulate his shock 2016 election win. Yet the President's inflammatory rhetoric during the midterm elections seemed to alienate many more moderate voters who he will still need to win a second term.

He's playing a risky political game -- though it may be the only one he really knows how to play.

Looking for cover

Even in the most distasteful Washington storms, political leaders grope for whatever incremental cover they can find.

By presenting herself as the face of the resolution condemning Trump, Pelosi was able to mend bonds with the four congresswomen with whom she was involved in a spat last week about their flouting of party discipline as she seeks to protect the more moderate caucus members who won her the House in 2018.

It seems more than a few days ago that Ocasio-Cortez claimed the speaker was ""singling out"" freshmen women of color.

For a few days at least, Pelosi's steps to confront and condemn the President could alleviate some of the pressure building up from restive Democrats angry that she has slow walked impeachment.

And she succeeded in getting Republicans on the record denying that Trump's suggestion that the four American lawmakers ""go back"" to their ""broken and crime infested"" countries is racist.

McConnell, who has no appetite to anger the Trump base as he seeks to hold onto the Senate next year, attempted to ease the political pressure on his own troops.

""I think there's been a consensus that political rhetoric has really gotten way, way overheated all across the political spectrum,"" he said, mostly blaming Democrats and not at all blaming Trump.

""We all know politics is a contact sport, but it's about time we lowered the temperature all across the board. All of us ought to contribute to a better level of discourse.""

Asked by CNN's Manu Raju what he would say if someone told his wife, Elaine Chao, Trump's Transportation secretary to ""go back"" to where she came from, McConnell took refuge in a non sequitur argument about how he was a fan of legal immigration."
U.S. State Department official suspected of DUII in Bend,https://www.oregonlive.com,['Bend Bulletin'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/07/us-state-department-official-suspected-of-duii-in-bend.html,"A senior official with the U.S. State Department was arrested this month on suspicion of drunken driving after crashing her vehicle while returning from a wedding.

Susan A. Phalen was arrested July 6 on suspicion of DUII and reckless driving near Central Oregon Community College. As of Tuesday, she had not been charged with a crime, according to the Oregon Judicial Information Network.

At 10:39 p.m., dispatch received a report of a single-vehicle rollover crash on Mt. Washington Drive. Bend police Officer Matthew Baldwin arrived to find a 2019 Land Rover Discovery on its side in the middle of the northbound lane and Phalen sitting on the curb with a COCC campus security officer standing near her, according to court documents.

Baldwin said he “immediately” noticed numerous signs of impairment in Phalen, such as watery and bloodshot eyes, slurred and slow speech.

She allegedly needed help standing, according to court records.

Phalen reportedly told the officer she had been returning to her Airbnb after a wedding in Tumalo. Unfamiliar with the area, she attempted to follow her navigation by making a left turn when she rolled her vehicle.

The nearest road was Regency Drive, about one-eighth of a mile up the road, Baldwin said.

Phalen reportedly admitted to drinking margaritas at the wedding, but refused to perform roadside sobriety tests or take a breath test for alcohol, according to court records.

“I have no comment,” Phalen told The Bulletin when reached.

Phalen, 49, of Alexandria, Virginia, is listed as a senior adviser for external affairs for the State Department, according the department’s current directory. Her career in government stretches to the 1990s and has included stints as communication director for the House Homeland Security Committee and before that, the House Intelligence Committee. More recently, she was director of external affairs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to her LinkedIn page.

Phalen made headlines last year when a fellow press secretary left FEMA, citing in his resignation letter a “boys club” mentality that excluded Phalen.

Phalen resigned from FEMA in early 2018.

Do Service Dogs Help Treat PTSD? V.A. Still Doesn’t Know,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jasper Craven'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/magazine/service-dogs-veterans-ptsd.html,"[Sign up for the At War newsletter for more stories about veterans and V.A. policy.]

The V.A. is currently conducting research into the effectiveness of service dogs, but the process has been slow. Research started in 2011 was supposed to wrap up in 2015 but has repeatedly been stalled by problems with the study’s design and execution. In May, the V.A. said the findings of the study, which has cost $16 million to date, would be released to the public in 2020.

Meanwhile, some lawmakers are growing impatient with what they perceive as a lack of initiative at a time when there is a growing mental-health crisis in America’s veterans community. In June, Representative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican, reintroduced the PAWS Act, to establish a $10 million grant program through the V.A., which would give qualified nonprofit organizations up to $25,000 for each veteran they pair with a service dog. The stipend would cover the canine’s training, and the training of the recipient with his or her service dog. The bill is sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans, pitting lawmakers against the V.A., which is refusing to endorse any new stopgap service-dog program before its internal research is completed.

Stuck in the middle are the veterans themselves. Among those receiving disability benefits from the V.A., more than one in five suffers from PTSD. Veterans who have responded poorly to conventional treatments have had to improvise, sometimes by paying thousands of dollars up front to acquire service dogs, then covering the significant costs of feeding and caring for them. To make matters worse, veterans seeking service dogs without any support from the V.A. are forced to wade into a largely unregulated industry: Some end up with a dog that provides few benefits because it isn’t properly trained. Veterans advocates say access to a psychiatric service dog without the associated financial burden can’t come soon enough.

In January 2009, Al Franken, fresh off his winning campaign for a Senate seat, met Luis Montalván, a medically retired Army captain who had served two tours as an intelligence officer in Iraq, and his golden retriever named Tuesday. Montalván had returned home with a shattered leg, spinal damage, a brain injury and PTSD symptoms that included vivid nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks and a fear of public spaces. The only therapy that eased Montalván’s symptoms was Tuesday, whom he received from a group called Educated Canines Assisting With Disabilities. Tuesday sensed if Montalván’s breathing sharpened or he began to perspire, and then intervened with a nuzzle. If Tuesday noticed Montalván thrashing while asleep in bed, he would wake the former soldier from his nightmare with a series of sloppy face-licks. Tuesday was even trained to direct the Army veteran from his bed to his pill bottles each morning."

"Justice Department ends inquiry of hush-money payments in final months of Donald Trump's campaign, judge says",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kristine Phillips', 'Kevin Johnson', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/17/doj-ends-investigation-hush-payments-involving-donald-trump-michael-cohen/1755046001/,"CLOSE President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid money to women to be quiet about alleged affairs with Trump during his 2016 campaign. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Federal prosecutors in New York concluded their investigation of hush-money payments Donald Trump's former personal lawyer orchestrated to quiet potential sex scandals in the final months of his presidential campaign, a judge said Wednesday.

The notice, contained in a brief order issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge William Pauley, was an unceremonious end to an inquiry that implicated the president.

Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he engineered payments to two women who claimed to have had extramarital affairs with Trump to silence them before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors in New York said those payments violated federal campaign finance laws, and they and Cohen said Trump directed his lawyer to arrange the payments.

Pauley revealed the end of the investigation as part of an order in which he instructed the government to make public some of the search warrants it used when investigating Cohen, who pleaded guilty to two campaign finance violations for the payments, as well as a set of other felonies. He is serving a three-year prison sentence.

“We are pleased that the investigations surrounding these ridiculous campaign finance allegations is now closed,” Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said Wednesday. “We have maintained from the outset that the president never engaged in any campaign finance violation.”

Between the New York inquiry and the special counsel investigation of Russian election interference, which concluded in March, Trump has spent nearly all of his presidency under scrutiny from federal prosecutors. Now that the campaign finance inquiry is closed, Sekulow said he knew of no other federal investigations in which Trump is a subject.

Pauley's announcement signals the end of a criminal investigation in which authorities examined Trump and his private business, the Trump Organization. Typically, prosecutors do not announce the end of an investigation or agree to provide details about their work if they intend to pursue additional charges.

One of Cohen's lawyers, Lanny Davis, reacted with dismay. ""Why is Michael Cohen ... the only member of the Trump company to be prosecuted and imprisoned?"" he said. ""Especially since prosecutors found that virtually all of Michael’s admitted crimes were done at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald Trump? Why?”

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Prosecutors had asked to keep documents under seal, indicating that the investigation into the campaign finance violations was ongoing. Pauley said they changed that position in a sealed filing Monday, and as a result, the search warrant materials should become public.

“The campaign finance violations discussed in the Materials are a matter of national importance. Now that the Government’s investigation into those violations has concluded, it is time that every American has an opportunity to scrutinize the Materials,” Pauley wrote.

Pauley ordered the government to make the information public Thursday morning.

Cohen and federal prosecutors said he arranged payments to two women in the final months of Trump's 2016 campaign: Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal and pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.

Trump denied the affairs and said he did not know about the payments.

Prosecutors said in a court filing Cohen participated in an agreement involving a tabloid to “suppress” McDougal’s story and “prevent it from influencing the election.” The agreement involved “Corporation-1,” which agreed in August 2016 to buy McDougal’s story for $150,000. The description of ""Corporation-1"" matches public description of the National Enquirer

The Enquirer's parent company acknowledged in an agreement with prosecutors that it made the payment because McDougal's story could have jeopardized Trump's campaign.

Cohen arranged a separate payment – spending $130,000 out of his own pocket – to Daniels, who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Trump in 2006. Prosecutors said Trump’s business reimbursed Cohen for his payment to Daniels, added $130,000 to pay for Cohen’s taxes and $60,000 as a bonus. Prosecutors said the payments were disguised as legal bills.

Cohen said during congressional testimony in February that his former boss masterminded the “cover-up” of the payments to Daniels and directed him to lie about them, including to first lady Melania Trump. He presented the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee with a copy of a personal check that he said Trump signed during the first year of his presidency to reimburse him for the payments. Cohen said the check, which was for $35,000, was one of 11 installments.

Cohen said the other checks were signed by Donald Trump Jr. and Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's finance chief.

During an FBI raid in April 2018, investigators sought bank records and other information on payments to Daniels and McDougal. Court records revealed that the investigation went far beyond the hush-money payments and that the FBI had been looking broadly into financial crimes by Cohen.

Cohen's statements to Congress led to a congressional investigation of Trump's finances. The oversight committee sought to obtain copies of Trump's financial records in its investigation on whether Trump incorrectly reported his finances in government disclosure forms, whether he has undisclosed conflicts of interest and whether he complied with the emoluments clause, which prohibits a president from receiving payments from foreign governments.

Cohen, who had vowed to ""take a bullet"" for Trump, called his former boss a ""racist,"" a ""con man"" and a ""cheat.""

""I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your fixer, Mr. Trump,"" Cohen said.

The president castigated Cohen, saying he was lying to reduce his prison time.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed concern about sending one of his top arms control negotiators, Andrea Thompson, to head a U.S. delegation meeting with Russia’s deputy foreign minister this week after it was revealed that she had failed to disclose her ties to the boyfriend of Russian foreign agent Maria Butina.

So Pompeo dispatched his deputy, John Sullivan, to lead the delegation instead. The delegation, which now includes Sullivan, Thompson and other senior U.S. officials, is attending the strategic security dialogue in Geneva, where American officials are set to talk with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov about arms control, including what sort of arrangement might replace the International Nuclear Forces treaty that the Trump administration scuttled earlier this year.

Thompson’s presence at the meeting raised concern in some quarters of the administration after the Washington Post reported last month that she had not disclosed her personal and financial ties to Paul Erickson, the veteran GOP operative who worked with Butina to establish a Kremlin backchannel to the Trump campaign in 2016.

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a private letter to the State Department in recent days regarding Thompson’s “apparent failures to disclose required and material information to the SFRC during her nomination process,” according to Juan Pachon, Menendez’s communications director on the committee.

A State Department spokesman confirmed receipt of the letter, but declined to comment on Pompeo’s last-minute decision to send Sullivan to Geneva, or on whether the department was satisfied with Thompson’s disclosures during her confirmation process.

Thompson failed to alert her superiors that Erickson officiated her 2017 wedding, according to two U.S. officials, and did not disclose during her Senate confirmation that her husband, David Gillian, a retired Australian Army officer, had wired Erickson $100,000 for an allegedly fraudulent investment scheme in which Gillian and others were allegedly defrauded by Erickson -- a transaction laid out by the FBI in court filings.

The failure to disclose could have serious repercussions for Thompson, former officials said, though it is not necessarily fatal to her career.

“All senior officers have to report on their finances and any connections to overseas interests. Diplomatic Security should review her clearance,” said John Sipher, who spent nearly three decades working in the CIA’s clandestine service, including a stint in Moscow. “When Erickson and Butina were all over the news, she should have reported her connection. At the very least it now puts the administration in a bind where critics can question her competence, professionalism and judgment.”

At the time of her wedding and her then-fiance’s investment in Erickson’s business four months prior, Thompson was working as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. A year later, in April of 2018, she was confirmed by the Senate as undersecretary for arms control and international security.

At the time, Gillian was complaining to Erickson that he hadn’t seen the promised return on his investment, the FBI said, and received what agents described as a “lulling payment” of $5,000 -- intended to allay Gillian’s concerns -- on March 29, 2018, the month after Thompson’s Senate Committee hearing and the month before her confirmation vote.

Thompson’s alleged failure to disclose her relationship with Erickson, who was by then the subject of national news stories detailing his relationship with Butina, during her Senate confirmation has raised anxiety among Russia hawks in the Trump orbit who fear that Thompson, one of the last remaining acolytes of the president’s first national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, is insufficiently hard-headed and enters this week’s talks in a compromised position.

One of these officials said that Thompson’s failure to disclose her connection to Erickson indicates that her “judgment is in question.”

“She either didn’t understand what she was doing … or she did and she tried to conceal it,” this person said.

Flynn was pushed out of the administration in February of 2017 after news reports indicated he had misled senior White House officials about the substance of his conversations with Russian officials during the transition period. He stands accused of lying to the FBI about the nature of those interactions, though he has suggested that investigators tricked him into making false statements.

In March of 2017, Thompson filed a public financial disclosure report after joining the vice president’s office. Prosecutors in the Erickson case note that her then fiancé, Gillian, had wired $100,000 to Erickson on February 28, 2017. That was just days before her paperwork was submitted, but neither Erickson’s nor Butina’s role in the presidential campaign had yet been reported.

A subsequent financial disclosure would have been due in May 2018, according to a source in the vice president’s office, but by then, Thompson was at the State Department.

In the interim, Erickson became the subject of national headlines when reports surfaced that he had made overtures to the Trump campaign offering to establish a backchannel to the Kremlin. Erickson was engaged in a romantic relationship with Maria Butina, who has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an unregistered Russian agent.

Throughout the 2016 campaign, prosecutors argued, Butina, a 30-year-old graduate student, worked to forge relationships with influential Republican political organizations, including the National Rifle Association, in an attempt to create backchannels to the Russian government. She worked both to organize trips for influential GOP operatives to visit Moscow and to get access to government officials for Russian delegations visiting the U.S.

A former GOP operative and fundraiser, Erickson was indicted in February on fraud charges in February and pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege that he swindled upwards of $2 million from investors for three business propositions, including one to invest in a chain of elder care facilities, and did not spend the money on any of them.

Though the charges were not directly related to Erickson’s relationship with Butina, the FBI alleged that “some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina."""
"Sanders, Omar call for Labor Department investigation of all US Amazon warehouses",https://www.cnet.com,['Ben Fox Rubin'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnet.com/news/sanders-omar-call-for-labor-department-investigation-of-all-amazon-warehouses/#ftag=CAD0610abe0f,"Ben Fox Rubin/CNET

A group of 13 members of Congress on Tuesday asked the Department of Labor to investigate all of Amazon's US warehouses, citing a long list of concerns about working conditions, labor violations, injuries and mistreatment.

The group is led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic candidate for president, and Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The members are all Democrats except Sanders, who's an independent, and include prominent Democrats including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard.

In a statement Tuesday, Sanders called on the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration to open an investigation immediately and ""prosecute those responsible to the fullest extent of the law.""

""People who work for a company owned by the wealthiest person in America should not have to risk their lives, health or well-being on the job,"" he said, referring to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. ""They must be treated with dignity and respect.""

Amazon shot back Tuesday, saying Sanders has an open invitation to visit its warehouses ""but to date has never stepped foot in one of our buildings."" The company said if Sanders had seen the facilities, he'd have learned that the company already implemented multiple layers of safety protocols at its warehouses. That work includes monthly employee surveys of safety, more than 1 million hours of safety training last year, and $55 million in safety improvement investments in the past year.

""The allegations outlined in this letter are not an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings,"" Amazon said, adding that people as young as 6 can tour the buildings to see for themselves.

Sanders rejected Amazon's suggestion, saying in a tweet Tuesday afternoon he preferred surprise inspections be conducted by the Labor Department.

""I am not interested in a photo op at an Amazon warehouse,"" Sanders' tweet said. ""I am calling for Labor Department inspectors to come in, unannounced, and do thorough investigations of the facilities where hundreds of workers have told me about horrendous conditions and abuse.""

The congressional request continues long-running criticisms of how Amazon operates its warehouses, with years of news reports detailing employees being overworked, closely monitored and forced to move faster. While Amazon has faced heavy criticism in the press and from several members of Congress, a comprehensive government report on its warehouse conditions hasn't happened.

Now playing: Watch this: For these women, working at Amazon while pregnant ends...

Sanders' criticisms follow his repeated attacks against Amazon last year, when he called on the company to raise its minimum wage. When it did in October, he congratulated it for making that change.

The congressional group sent a letter requesting an investigation during Prime Day, Amazon's annual summer sale. In its fifth year, Prime Day has started to garner plenty of negative attention, with protests going on across the US and Europe on Monday.

On Wednesday, a Department of Labor spokesperson said: ""OSHA has confirmed receipt of the letter. The agency is still reviewing the letter at this time.""



I stand in solidarity with the courageous Amazon workers engaging in a work stoppage against unconscionable working conditions in their warehouses. It is not too much to ask that a company owned by the wealthiest person in the world treat its workers with dignity and respect. https://t.co/GxagHx70pb — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) July 15, 2019

Amazon said Monday that Prime Day has ""become an opportunity for our critics, including unions, to raise awareness for their cause, in this case, increased membership dues."" The company has often mentioned that it raised its minimum wage to $15 last year and offers a comprehensive benefits package that includes paid education, parental leave and opportunities for promotion.

Amazon's roughly 300,000 US employees aren't represented by unions.

In Tuesday's letter to OSHA, the members of Congress outlined several workplace problems they want investigated, including a report from Mother Jones that highlighted hazardous warehouse floor conditions that can cause long-term injuries. The group said they've heard hundreds of stories directly from people who worked for Amazon that present extremely poor conditions for employees, including high temperatures, closely monitored productivity that causes workers to avoid bathroom breaks for fear of falling behind, mental health issues, and calls for a faster pace that ultimately lead to injuries.

One former worker, a Navy veteran, said, according to the letter: ""There was a point where I would find myself crying on my shift ... I really felt like I just didn't wanna be alive anymore.""

""This work environment creates a high risk of physical injuries, a risk increased by Amazon's intentional disregard for the health and safety of their employees,"" the letter said.

In addition to Omar, Sanders, Gabbard and Ocasio-Cortez, Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Deb Haaland, Ayanna Pressley, Barbara Lee, Jan Schakowsky, Ro Khanna, Al Green, Debbie Dingell and Andy Levin joined the call for an investigation and signed the letter to OSHA.

"Former Interior scientist calls out ‘culture of fear, censorship, and suppression’ under Trump",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/former-interior-scientist-calls-out-culture-of-fear-censorship-and-suppression-under-trump-2b8813e95b18/,"There is a “culture of fear, censorship, and suppression” within the Trump administration that is impeding government scientists from doing their best work, former Interior Department policy director and scientist turned whistleblower Joel Clement warned on Wednesday.

Speaking to lawmakers on the House Science Committee, scientific experts spoke about the need for stronger rules to support the integrity of their research and ensure that political agendas don’t dictate or interfere with the data.

“There is not Democratic science, there is not Republican science, there is just science,” said Michael Halpern, deputy director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Halpern pointed to instances under current and previous administrations, including under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, of scientific assessments being either watered down or language softened. He pointed to past research on lead in school lunchboxes and on the impact of fracking on drinking water.

But the scientists said that under President Donald Trump, political interference had reached a new level.

As Clement highlighted, a study into the rules needed to protect the health and safety of offshore oil rig workers was canceled right before a set of measures to protect the workers was rolled-back. Similarly, a study into the health impacts of surface coal mining was canceled right before making moves to support the coal industry.

Other studies have been delayed, such as one on the health impacts of PFAS chemicals in drinking water for fear of a “public relations nightmare,” while agencies have seen some scientists self-censor their work out of fear, such as removing the words “climate change” from reports.

“The American people lose when we end up with manipulated, suppressed, or distorted information,” Halpern said. After all, as multiple experts testified, it’s taxpayer money that funds government scientists — the public paid for that research and deserves to see it.

The result is “dirtier air, dirtier water,” added Clement, who resigned from his post at the Interior in July 2017 after being reassigned to “an unrelated job” by former Secretary Ryan Zinke. Clement saw the move as an attempt to push him out for speaking out about the impacts of climate change on Alaskan native communities.

The hearing on Wednesday follows the release of a bill by committee member Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY), called the Scientific Integrity Act, earlier this year. The bill, which has the support of nearly 200 House members, is intended to insulate “public scientific research and reports from the distorting influence of political and special interests” according to Tonko.

While Tonko reminded everyone at the hearing that he began working on the bill in 2016 under the Obama administration, he added, “The abuses directed by this President [Trump] and his top officials have brought a new urgency to the issue.”

While more than 20 federal agencies have some type of scientific integrity policy, not all of these policies are successfully or fully implemented. As an April report by the Government Accountability Office found, of the nine agencies reviewed, seven have “specific, documented procedures” for identifying and addressing alleged violations. The report also made 10 recommendations to agencies for addressing the need to better educate staff on the issue, provide greater oversight, and develop procedures to identify and address potential violations.

Last year, the EPA announced it would begin an investigation to see whether its scientific integrity policy was being properly implemented. This came after a survey was released by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which showed that government scientists across 16 agencies and departments had concerns with the degree of political influence over their work.

Specifically, the annual survey for 2018 showed that a third of the nearly 449 EPA respondents worried about the “influence” of political appointees or White House officials over “science-based” decisions. Less than 30% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “My agency adheres to its scientific integrity policy.”

In addition, roughly a third of EPA respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they had either been asked directly to omit or independently decided to avoid the use of the term “climate change” in their work.

There is technically nothing stopping an agency from dismantling its scientific integrity policy, said Halpern. That’s why a bill such as the one proposed by Tonko would go a long way to buttress, or add “statutory heft,” to agency policies as Clement described.

Clement called the Scientific Integrity Act a good first step, but noted that in order to be truly effective, broader ethics and integrity standards were needed across agencies.

Indeed, many of the individuals overseeing agencies come from the industry they are now responsible for regulating. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Interior (DOI) have faced numerous ethics scandals regarding potential conflicts of interest and alleged industry influence.

In March, for instance, The New York Times revealed documents showing DOI Secretary David Bernhardt intervened to block a study showing pesticides might threaten the existence of 1,200 endangered species; Bernhardt has a history of lobbying against the Endangered Species Act.

But due to the “hostile leadership situation,” there are many scientists who are simply keeping their heads down and staying quiet about issues surrounding scientific integrity under the current administration.

“I’d love if every policymaker thought of science as the North Star,” said Clement, “but I hope it’s part of the constellation.”"
"Veterans Affairs abandoned 200,000+ health care applications this year",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/veterans-affairs-abandoned-200-000-health-care-applications-this-year/VR5zYSyyBn0LnTndnE2x1L/,"An arm of the Veterans Affairs Department in Atlanta eliminated 208,272 applications from across the country for health care early this year amid efforts to shrink a massive backlog of requests, saying they were missing signatures or information about military service and income, according to records reviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Veterans groups say the VA should have done more to communicate with the veterans before closing their applications, some of which date back to 1998. Troops face additional challenges in applying for VA health care, they said, as they grapple with reentry into civilian life, change addresses following overseas deployments and suffer from combat stress.

In the middle of the controversy is the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, the Atlanta office that oversees the process by which veterans seek access to the VA medical system. It and its parent agency have come under intense scrutiny in recent years for mismanagement and delays in providing medical care, presenting a thorny challenge for the administration of President Donald Trump, who focused on veterans’ care during his presidential campaign.

As of April, 8.8 million veterans were enrolled in the VA’s health care system, the agency’s records show. The VA said it enrolled 395,417 people in its health care system and rejected 98,897 in the fiscal year ending in September. Its backlog of pending applications totaled 317,157 in April, down from a high of 886,045 last year, according to records the VA sent the AJC.

That current backlog is still “way too high,” said Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based advocacy group. He suggested additional collaboration between the VA and veteran service groups could shrink it more.

“Something is not quite working right if we are not getting that number lower than it is,” he said. “We need to be working together to get that number down.”

Butler joined Adrian Atizado, deputy national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity based in Kentucky, in criticizing the VA’s efforts to reach the veterans before rejecting and closing their 208,272 applications.

The VA sent out one rejection letter to each of those applicants in 2016. In 2017, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers — including Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson — urged the VA to send the applicants an additional letter clarifying what missing information they needed to turn in. The lawmakers were responding to allegations that a coding error caused the VA to send veterans incorrect letters about what they still needed to submit.

The VA said it opted against sending an additional letter after its Office of Inspector General determined there was no such error and that the letters it sent in 2016 were appropriate and complied with federal law.

Isakson, who leads the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, was unavailable for an interview, according to an aide. But his spokeswoman said the VA took Isakson’s recommendation to have the inspector general review the issue and then briefed the senator’s committee about its decision to close the applications.

Atizado called the VA’s decision to send just one letter to the applicants in 2016 before closing their cases this year “quite unfortunate.”

“When we hear about the VA not taking a more thoughtful approach to a situation like this — when they only send one letter because they have an incomplete application — I think we all should be expecting our government and this administration to do better by our veterans,” he said.

The VA said veterans may reapply for health care. The agency said it is now striving to contact people about incomplete applications up to six times each with phone calls and letters. Its Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, meanwhile, has added 115 employees since July of 2016.

The 208,272 eliminated cases didn’t receive such treatment, though. That also has drawn renewed criticism from Scott Davis, a VA employee and whistleblower who testified before Congress in 2014 about problems at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, located off Clairmont Road.

“This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits,” Davis wrote in an article for the Washington Examiner in May.

Defending its decision, the VA pointed to a federal law that says applications that remain incomplete for a year cannot be approved.

“In accordance with federal law, VA closed 208,272 incomplete health care enrollment applications between January and February,” the VA said in a prepared statement. “It would have been illegal for VA to keep the applications open.”

Davis disputed that, saying the law doesn’t say anything about closing applications. In an interview, he accused the VA of “purging applications under a law that does not give them the authority to do so.”

Asked how many of the 208,272 applications the agency closed were from former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients and combat veterans, the VA told the AJC that the newspaper would have to file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for that information. The AJC did that last month and its request is still pending.

Why the Justice Department Waved Through the CVS-Aetna Merger,https://prospect.org,[],,,,https://prospect.org/article/why-justice-department-waved-through-cvs-aetna-merger,"Gene J. Puskar/AP Image A CVS Pharmacy in Pittsburgh

This week, Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is holding a Tunney Act hearing, which allows courts to scrutinize merger approvals by the Department of Justice (DoJ), on the CVS-Aetna merger. Judge Leon’s evidentiary hearing with testimony from concerned parties is a first of its kind.

In sharp contrast to the AT&T/Time Warner deal, another vertical merger that the DoJ sought to block, the antitrust agency waved through CVS-Aetna, with a modest requirement to spin off Aetna’s Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. Now, the DoJ is being forced to defend itself in court. Why did the antitrust division engage in a seeming double standard, when the cases share particular similarities?

By happenstance, Judge Leon also adjudicated—and eventually rejected—the DoJ’s attempt to block the AT&T/Time Warner merger. In that case, the vertical stacking involved two layers: the distribution unit that delivers cable programming to subscribers (AT&T); and the content division that produces cable programming (Time Warner). By comparison, the vertical stacking in CVS-Aetna involves three layers: the health plan takes premium dollars from the member and provides insurance in return (Aetna); the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) negotiates with pharmaceutical companies and pharmacies, administers the pharmacy network, and designs the formulary for the health plan (Caremark); and the pharmacies serve as the physical interface between patient and pharmacist (CVS).

The pharmacy was already integrated into PBM services via the CVS/Caremark merger; the fresh integration here is the pharmacy/PBM into a health plan, yielding control of the entire stack. It would form the only vertically integrated pharmacy/PBM/health plan currently in the U.S. marketplace.

As the D.C. Circuit explained in its decision in AT&T/Time Warner, “Vertical mergers can create harms beyond higher prices for consumers, including decreased product quality and reduced innovation.” However, most plaintiffs aim to show concrete and measurable harms such as higher prices, using what are called “foreclosure” theories. For example, a vertically integrated firm may foreclose rivals from access to its content (“input foreclosure”) or from access to customers (“customer foreclosure”). As I have shown in prior research, along with Kevin Caves and Chris Holt, regional sports networks affiliated with cable companies can credibly threaten to withhold content from a rival distributor, because lack of local sports would mean defection to cable provider with access.

This is the theory of harm that the DoJ pursued (unsuccessfully) in its attempt to block the AT&T/Time Warner merger. The DoJ believed that the newly merged entity would withhold Time Warner content from distribution rivals, or extract a higher price for said content. Judge Leon concluded that Time Warner content was not must-have; he found no compelling evidence to suggest that customers of rival cable operators would leave to follow Time Warner content like CNN or TNT or TBS. So the threat to withhold content from rivals wouldn’t be as powerful as withholding sports or some other must-have input.

ALTHOUGH FORECLOSURE is most frequently studied and litigated in cable television, healthcare economists are starting to focus on the same phenomenon. For example, Professor Neeraj Sood of the University of Southern California estimates that for a vertically integrated healthcare provider, each insurance customer is worth $300 in margins, each PBM customer is worth $23 in margins, and each retail pharmacy customer is worth $40. It follows that a vertically integrated insurer/PBM/pharmacy such as CVS/Aetna might be willing to engage in certain tradeoffs in order to advantage its affiliated (high margin) insurer at the expense of its (low margin) PBM or retail pharmacy division.

Vertical foreclosure strategies in concentrated markets with high barriers to entry are more likely to generate anti-competitive effects than the same strategies employed by firms that lack market power. And the supply of health insurance in the United States is highly concentrated. Data from Kaiser indicate that in most states the market share of the three largest insurance companies—UnitedHealth, Anthem, and Aetna—is more than 50 percent, and in some states the market share of the three largest insurance companies is around 90 percent. Local geographic markets are similarly highly concentrated. There are high barriers to entry in health insurance, including market expertise: how to build networks, knowing how to file products, and meeting compliance burdens.

The supply of PBM services in the United States is also highly concentrated. The three large PBMs—Express Scripts, CVS Health Caremark, and Optum Rx—account for almost 70 percent of the entire market. Pharmacies habitually complain that they have no alternative but to contract with specific PBMs. Again, there are natural barriers to entry in PBM services, including economies of scale in negotiating favorable discounts from manufacturers, operational expertise, and regulatory barriers, as well as artificial barriers, such as vertical integration with a health plan or a pharmacy network or both, which makes competition by a standalone health insurer more daunting.

Finally, the supply of pharmacy services in the United States is highly concentrated. The largest three pharmacies account for more than 50 percent of prescription revenues. Local markets are similarly highly concentrated; according to Business Insider, CVS and Walgreens together control between 50 and 75 percent of the drugstore market in each of the country’s 14 largest metro areas. Barriers to entry also prevent new pharmacy firms. For example,CVS chief executive officer Larry Merlo is not afraid of Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy business because “there’s a migration to more value-based care, those clinical capabilities are going to continue to grow in importance. It’s highly regulated, so the barriers to entry are high.”

What would input foreclosure mean in this setting? The vertically integrated firm could deny an input—here, CVS pharmacy services—to a rival health plan such as UnitedHealth. The DoJ’s vertical theory fell apart in its challenge of AT&T/Time Warner because the merging parties lacked a must-have input. In this case, would CVS’s network of pharmacies be considered must-have for rival health plans?

CVS is uniquely positioned in the pharmacy marketplace due to its ubiquitous coverage of the U.S. population. According to comments filed by the AMA, “CVS pharmacy chains may be considered ‘must have’ pharmacies. They are ‘must have’ because health plan sponsors prefer geographically comprehensive networks—pharmacies located in close proximity to their patient population.” Indeed, CVS claims to cover 76 percent of the population in the United States within a five-mile drive.

If a rival health plan lost access to CVS’s network of pharmacies, it could find itself unable to patch together other pharmacies to serve customers, and could even lose its license to serve certain areas as a health provider. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will not contract with a Medicare plan unless it can meet certain time-and-distance requirements. For non-Medicare plans, local state agencies such as California’s Department of Health Care Services and Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration review a plan’s network adequacy using their own time-and-distance requirements.

Using mapping data of all U.S. pharmacy locations from Healthcare Ready, Augustus Urschel, Omer Gold and I identified several areas of the country in which a rival plan would not be able to meet CMS’s coverage requirement without access to CVS’s network of pharmacies. CMS’s Medicare Part D Manual, states: “In urban areas, at least 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in the Part D sponsor’s service area, on average, live within 2 miles of a retail pharmacy participating in the sponsor’s network. In suburban areas, at least 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in the Part D sponsor’s service areas, on average, live within 5 miles of a retail pharmacy participating in the sponsor’s network.” Using those constraints, we conservatively identified localities where CVS was the only pharmacy within a ten-mile radius.

The first figure shows the area immediately south of Chicago, spanning parts of Illinois and Indiana. Ten localities appear beholden to CVS for pharmacy services.

The second figure shows the area outside of Tallahassee, spanning parts of Florida and Tennessee. Two localities appear beholden to CVS.

For rival health plans seeking to serve those areas, CVS would easily qualify as a must-have input. Without access to CVS’s pharmacy in that area, the rival health plan likely could not contract with CMS (for a Medicare plan); similarly, the rival plan likely would not meet the coverage requirements of state licensing agencies (for non-Medicare plans).

In addition to the ten-mile radii used in the two figures, a radius of five miles was drawn around each CVS location nationwide to identify must-have inputs; in 93 locations, CVS is the only pharmacy within a five-mile radius. CVS could simply refuse rival plans access to these (or any) CVS pharmacies, impairing the reach of those health plans and forcing patients to sign up with CVS/Aetna. Less extreme forms of input foreclosure would include CVS Caremark developing formularies for health plan rivals that do not include important drugs that are in demand by their subscribers; offering pharmacy networks that do not provide important options (for example, independent specialty pharmacies) or forcing rival insurers into CVS mail-order pharmacy services; or charging rival plans higher administrative fees to provide services like formulary maintenance or claims processing. For example, CVS currently charges PBMs to fill prescriptions; CVS could demand, post-merger, a higher dispensing fee for performing the same task.

OF THE FOUR POTENTIAL input-foreclosure strategies outlined above, the DoJ failed to address anyin its complaint. In its Questions and Answers for the General Public, the DoJ stated it “thoroughly considered whether the merger would raise the costof (i) CVS/Caremark’s PBM services or (ii) retail pharmacy services to Aetna’s health insurance rivals.” So it appears most foreclosure strategies were ignored completely, or considered and dismissed.

If the merged firm found it profitable to engage in input foreclosure against rival health plans, the anti-competitive effects would be straightforward under antitrust law. This could diminish competition in the market for health plans, as rival plans lose access to CVS pharmacies or incur a higher cost for such access, which could lead to higher premiums or higher deductibles or less coverage.

The DoJ could have assured prevention of the harms from input foreclosure. In particular, the merging parties could have been subject to a non-discrimination regime, as Georgia and New York imposed in their merger reviews. That would mean that no health plan could be prevented from accessing CVS’s pharmacy network, or forced to pay an exorbitant fee for access. This kind of non-discrimination regime actually appears in the 2011 DoJ Policy Guide to Merger Remedies.

The DoJ and Federal Trade Commission have a history of using behavioral remedies to address potential harms in vertical mergers: the Anheuser-Busch InBev-SABMiller and AOL-Time Warner mergers, for example, or Ticketmaster-Live Nation, which bans Ticketmaster from using the threat of withholding shows from venues in retaliation for their signing with a competing ticketing service. The DoJ also employed a non-discrimination remedy in Comcast-NBCUniversal.

Yet in October 2018, Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Makan Delrahim announced that DoJ would withdraw its 2011 Policy Guide. The guidelines prescribed behavioral remedies in vertical mergers to police discriminatory conduct. Delrahim announced his lack of faith in behavioral remedies, calling them “regulatory” in nature, and embracing structural approaches.

As an expert for an online video distributor (OVD) that brought one of the first challenges under the NBCU Order, I am professionally familiar with the efficacy of behavioral remedies in the context of vertical merger enforcement. Bloomberg was the first to sue Comcast under the NBCU protections, and it secured better placement on Comcast’s dial. Per the DoJ’s annual reports monitoring the merger conditions, an unnamed OVD also sued and settled with Comcast. Finally, my OVD client sued and we prevailed before an independent arbitrator, who ruled that our estimate of fair market value was closer than Comcast’s (that case is pending appeal). Based on these three cases, it is fair to say that the behavioral remedies under the NBCU were largely effective in constraining Comcast’s worst impulses.

The DoJ was attempting to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger at the time it retracted the Policy Guide to Merger Remedies. By disavowing behavioral remedies in general, the DoJ must now choose between approving the merger without behavioral conditions (as it did in CVS/Aetna) or blocking it outright (as it tried and failed in AT&T/Time Warner). Even if waving through the merger is slightly preferred to blocking the merger outright, losing the flexibility to deal directly with input foreclosure was a loss from a public policy perspective. Instead of preventing discrimination against rival health plans in CVS-Aetna, the DoJ did basically nothing to address the potential harm. Judge Leon could right this wrong and fix the DoJ’s error."

The State Department said it has issued sanctions to four top military leaders in Myanmar over what it called ""gross human rights violations"" during the ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Rohingya Muslim minority.

Targets of the sanctions include the military's commander in chief Min Aung Hlaing, his deputy Soe Win, Brig. Gen. Than Oo and Brig. Gen. Aung Aung. The sanctions, which were announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday, mean the leaders and their immediate families are barred from entry into the United States.

""With this announcement, the United States is the first government to publicly take action with respect to the most senior leadership of the Burmese military,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""We designated these individuals based on credible information of these commanders' involvement in gross violations of human rights.""

A U.N. fact-finding mission said last year that the military ""took the lead in killing thousands of Rohingya civilians, as well as forced disappearances, mass gang rape and the burning of hundreds of villages."" It recommended that Min Aung Hlaing and other top leaders be tried for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

A spokesperson for the Myanmar military, Brig. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, told The New York Times that the new travel ban won't have much effect on the leaders.

""It doesn't matter that they banned travel to the United States for the generals,"" said the spokesperson. ""But it does insult the Myanmar military's dignity.""

Pompeo's statement said that Min Aung Hlaing ordered the release of his men convicted of killing a group of Rohingya men in Inn Din, which was the subject of a Reuters investigation that won the Pulitzer Prize. ""The Commander-in-Chief released these criminals after only months in prison, while the journalists who told the world about the killings in Inn Din were jailed for more than 500 days,"" Pompeo said. He called it an ""egregious example of the continued and severe lack of accountability for the military and its senior leadership.""

Fortify Rights, a human rights organization based in Southeast Asia, said the sanctions alone are ""not sufficient but a step toward more justice and accountability.""

""It is the military as an institution which needs to be targeted,"" Mark Farmaner, director of the advocacy group Burma Campaign UK, said in a tweet. ""The military will not change its behavior because a small number of its members have reduced holiday options."""
"Blue states sue Treasury, IRS over rules blocking Trump tax law workarounds",https://thehill.com,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/453566-blue-states-sue-treasury-and-irs-over-rules-blocking-trump-tax-law-workarounds,"New York, New Jersey and Connecticut on Wednesday announced a lawsuit challenging IRS and Treasury Department regulations that block workarounds to a controversial provision in President Trump Donald John TrumpPompeo changes staff for Russia meeting after concerns raised about top negotiator's ties: report House unravels with rise of 'Les Enfants Terrible' Ben Carson: Trump is not a racist and his comments were not racist MORE's 2017 tax law.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, is the latest example of leaders from blue states seeking to push back on the Trump tax law's $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said in a statement that the lawsuit challenges ""the IRS's final rule that undermines states' efforts to protect our taxpayers against the unprecedented, unlawful and politically motivated capping of the SALT deduction.""

The SALT deduction cap has been one of the most controversial portions of Trump's tax law. Politicians on both sides of the aisle from high-tax, Democratic-leaning states have argued that the SALT deduction cap hurts their constituents and challenges their jurisdictions' ability to provide public services to their residents.

Following the passage of the GOP tax law in late 2017, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut made changes to their own tax laws in an effort to allow their residents to circumvent the SALT deduction cap.

The workarounds involved allowing residents to make donations to state and local funds in exchange for receiving state tax credits. The intention was for the residents to be able to deduct the donations as charitable deductions on their federal tax returns.

But last month, Treasury and the IRS issued final rules designed to block the workarounds. Under the regulations, taxpayers will only be able to take federal charitable tax deductions for contribution amounts that exceed the amounts of state tax credits they received.

New York, New Jersey and Connecticut argue in their lawsuit that the rules violate the Administrative Procedure Act because they are inconsistent with the section of the federal tax code about deductions for charitable contributions. The states also argue that the rules violate the Regulatory Flexibility Act because the IRS didn't publish a regulatory flexibility analysis.

The states are asking a judge to set aside the rules.

""The final rule is contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious,"" they said in their lawsuit.

New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, along with Maryland, also filed a lawsuit last year challenging the constitutionality of the SALT deduction cap. That lawsuit is ongoing.

Local governments in the New York City suburbs are also challenging the Treasury and IRS regulations. The village of Scarsdale, N.Y., with the backing of a host of other suburban municipalities, filed its own lawsuit on Wednesday challenging the rules, a lawsuit which has similarities to the one filed by New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

The lawsuits were filed one day after a group of Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerLawmakers pay tribute to late Justice Stevens Trump administration denies temporary immigrant status to Venezuelans in US Colombian official urges more help for Venezuelan migrants MORE (D-N.Y.), filed a resolution to disapprove of the IRS rules under the Congressional Review Act (CRA).

Senators can make a motion to proceed on a CRA resolution if it has written support from at least 30 senators. But the resolution is unlikely to be adopted, since the Senate is controlled by Republicans who support the SALT deduction cap.

Republicans included the SALT deduction cap in their 2017 tax law in order to raise revenue to pay for tax cuts elsewhere in the legislation and to limit the tax code from subsidizing high state taxes. They have encouraged blue-state politicians who dislike the cap to cut state and local taxes.

Key GOP lawmakers have expressed support for the IRS regulations on the workarounds. And they have noted that most people in high-tax states received a tax cut under Trump's law, even with the SALT deduction cap.

The Trump administration plans to relocate most of the Bureau of Land Management’s D.C. workforce to west of the Rockies, part of its broader push to shift power away from Washington and shrink the size of the federal government.

The proposal to move roughly 300 employees from a key Interior Department agency — among them the majority of top managers — comes as Trump officials are forcibly reassigning career officials and upending operations across the federal government. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue finalized plans this summer to move about 550 jobs at two of his department’s scientific agencies from the nation’s capital to greater Kansas City. The White House is trying to abolish the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources agency, and has threatened to furlough as many as 150 employees if Congress blocks it.

“The problem with Washington is too many policy makers are far removed from the people they are there to serve,” Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said in a statement supporting the land agency’s move. “Ninety-nine percent of the land the BLM manages is West of the Mississippi River, and so should be the BLM headquarters.”

But opponents argue that abrupt decisions to relocate or reassign federal workers have not been justified by sufficient analysis, can disrupt families’ lives and already have cost the government valuable expertise. BLM has about 360 employees in Washington, many of them supervisors, with 95 percent of its 9,260 employees working in the field.

“If I wanted to dismantle an agency, this would be in my playbook,” said Steve Ellis, who retired as BLM’s deputy director in 2016 after nearly four decades in government service. In a phone interview Monday, he said that transferring so many employees out of Washington could complicate the agency’s relationship with Capitol Hill, budget officials and other federal entities.

He noted that BLM dispatched all of its wildfire and aviation staff to Boise, Idaho, in the 1990s only to reestablish a wildland fire office in the District when lawmakers expected briefings after fires broke out in the West.

“It’s important for these agencies to have a meaningful footprint in D.C.,” Ellis said.

Margaret Weichert, Office of Management and Budget deputy director for management, said in a statement that the move will make the government more efficient and “better serve the American people.”

In a shift long sought by conservatives, Trump’s government has shed thousands of employees overall since he took office, with gains at the Defense Department and Department of Veterans Affairs but an exodus of civil servants at several other agencies, including Labor, Education, and Housing and Urban Development.

Jason A. Briefel, head of the Senior Executive Association that represents 6,000 top government leaders, said it is worth having a public conversation about how to reorganize different agencies. But he questioned whether the Trump administration has made a solid business case for some of these decisions.

“This isn’t just an Interior issue,” he said in an interview. “This is a government-wide issue.”

Interior’s plan for BLM, according to two people briefed on it who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, proposes dispersing about 225 staffers who report to headquarters to states including Colorado, Nevada and Utah over time, while reassigning another 75 to the bureau’s state offices. The rest of employees would remain in Washington to work on issues such as the bureau’s budget, regulations and Freedom of Information Act requests.

Some of the BLM top employees slated for a job transfer will move to Grand Junction, Colo., according to three federal officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the decision has not been formally announced. But many affected workers — who include some top officials, Senior Executive Service staffers and low-level managers — will move to other cities in the West.

Interior officials have been eyeing a possible move for BLM, which manages more than 10 percent of the nation’s land, for more than two years. A handful of Western states, such as Colorado and Utah, have sought to recruit the agency.

While administration officials defend the Agriculture Department and BLM moves as an effort to spread the federal workforce around, 85 percent of the 2.1 million federal employees already live outside the Washington area.

The idea of shifting the bureau west has received the support of some lawmakers, including the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, Rob Bishop (Utah), as well as Gardner and Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.). In March 2018, the two senators from Colorado urged then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to look at Grand Junction, roughly 280 miles west of Denver.

Bishop said Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is “promoting a thoughtful, methodical approach that is a true win for the West. I’m pleased that a significant number of personnel will be coming to Utah and other Western states.”

But House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) accused Bernhardt of being secretive about his plans. Bernhardt’s hometown of Rifle, Colo., is not far from Grand Junction.

“Putting BLM headquarters down the road from Secretary Bernhardt’s hometown just makes it easier for special interests to walk in the door demanding favors without congressional oversight or accountability,” Grijalva said. “The agency will lose a lot of good people because of this move, and I suspect that’s the administration’s real goal here.”

Interior declined to comment on the relocation.

It remains unclear whether Congress would have to explicitly authorize the shift in personnel. The first stage of the move is expected to cost about $5 million, according to two government officials.

This is not the first time Interior has reassigned senior executives with little notice. In June 2017, political appointees reshuffled the assignments of more than three dozen career executives, with just 15 days’ notice of their job change. Interior’s Office of Inspector General investigated the matter but did not determine whether the moves were justified, citing the department’s incomplete records.

Denise Sheehan, who worked at Interior for 33 years before retiring last month from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said in an interview that the round of reassignments had a “chilling effect,” limiting what career officials are comfortable saying to political appointees.

“I don’t know if that was intended or not, but that was definitely the effect. It’s the most toxic thing in the senior executive corps I have ever seen,” she said.

In many cases, reassigned federal staffers have chosen to leave the government because they hail from two-career families or for other personal reasons. A majority of scientists and researchers at the USDA agencies slated to move to Kansas City are choosing not to move, and Perdue’s plan has been dogged by questions about its cost and the motivation behind it.

“When you move large numbers of employees from one part of the country to another, you’re going to lose a lot of institutional knowledge,” said Ward Morrow, assistant general counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union — with 530 members at BLM.

In other instances, the administration has shuttered parts of agencies altogether. The small Federal Labor Relations Authority, which adjudicates disputes between federal employees and their agencies, has closed regional offices in Dallas and Boston, citing declining workloads.

Under federal law, BLM will have to pay all relocation and real estate costs for employees who choose to move west, including what it takes to sell their homes in the Washington region and purchase a new one. Employees and their families will be entitled to four months of hotel stays on the government’s dime, federal personnel experts said, which could cost as much as $100,000 per employee.

The agency probably will offer retirement and buyout packages to employees who decide not to move, which could equal as much as a year’s salary depending on their age and years of service.

DOJ calls Qualcomm antitrust ruling a threat to national security,https://9to5mac.com,['Apple Watch Series'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/17/threat-to-national-security/,"The Department of Justice is arguing that the Qualcomm antitrust ruling back in May poses a threat to national security. It is calling for the remedies issued by the court to be put on hold pending an appeal.

Although Apple settled its civil lawsuit against Qualcomm, the exact same evidence put forward for that case was earlier used by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to take the radio chipmaker to court — with judgement awarded against Qualcomm …

NordVPN

Background

Apple’s evidence in the case was key to the FTC victory. The court ruled that Qualcomm’s contracts with the iPhone maker and other smartphone companies were unfair, and evidence that the chipmaker held an effective monopoly on essential wireless technologies.

Judge Koh ordered three remedies. First, Qualcomm must renegotiate existing licensing terms, ensuring that customers can choose to license patents without being forced to buy their chips from the company. Second, it must license those essential patents on FRAND terms – Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory. Third, it cannot enter into any exclusivity agreements: all its chips must be available for sale to any company that wishes to buy them.

Qualcomm appealed the case, arguing that the judge misapplied a rather obscure legal precedent involving a ski company.

The DOJ intervention

We learned back in May that the DOJ might seek to intervene in the case, expressing concern about the impact of the remedies on Qualcomm’s future. In particular, it was concerned that Qualcomm is the US leader in the development of 5G technology, and anything which damaged the company’s business model could leave it with less incentive to invest in research and development. That could leave the US dependent on Chinese 5G tech.

CNET reports that it has now done so.

The Justice Department on Tuesday filed an amicus brief with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking the judges to grant Qualcomm a reprieve. The filing followed a request by Qualcomm last week that the appeals court grant a stay in remedies ordered by US District Court Judge Lucy Koh in May after she declared the wireless chip provider to be a monopoly.

An amicus brief — literally a submission from ‘a friend of the court’ — is an argument put forward by a third-party, not directly involved in the case, but which has a point it wishes the judge to consider in reaching a decision.

The DOJ makes two arguments. First, it agrees with Qualcomm that the precedent was misapplied and that the chipmaker is likely to win its appeal. Qualcomm says the remedies would do irreversible damage to the company, and it is therefore right that they should be put on hold until the appeal is heard.

“Unless stayed, the injunction will significantly impair an American company that is the worldwide leader in the development of cellular technologies, at a critical moment in the development of the worldwide standards for next-generation 5G cellular systems, thereby forfeiting the lead to foreign interests,” Qualcomm’s filing said.

Second, says the Justice Department, the ruling poses a threat to national security.

The threat to national security arguments

If Qualcomm is able to make less money from licensing its patents, and selling chips, it may well decide that expensive investment in 5G R&D no longer makes financial sense. Since Chinese companies currently dominate the production of 5G tech, that would leave both US companies and the government forced to use Chinese technology for crucial infrastructure.

Additionally, says the DOJ, Qualcomm is a key supplier to the Defense Department, and it is in the national interest that the company remains motivated to invest in R&D.

The risks to national security include the disruption of DOD’s supply chain and unsure US leadership in 5G, said Ellen Lord, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. She added that the Defense Department believes Qualcomm is the market leader in wireless chips because of its expertise and R&D expenditure and that Qualcomm holds important Defense Department security clearance and contracts. “A hobbled Qualcomm, without the ability to make significant investments in R&D, presents a serious threat to DOD’s extensive networks, advanced telecommunications systems, and ultimately its ability to control the battlespace,” Lord said.

At around 4:00 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note , which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 2.052%, while the yield on the 2-year Treasury note yielded 1.82%.

The Commerce Department said in a report on Wednesday that U.S. homebuilding fell for a second straight month in June and permits slumped to a two-year low, hinting at a softer housing market despite lower mortgage rates.

The government said that housing starts decreased 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.253 million units last month as a plunge in multi-family homebuilding dragged on the data. The sector has hit a soft patch in recent quarters and likely subtracted from GDP in the second quarter.

Builder confidence, meanwhile, ticked up just one point in July to 65, according to a Tuesday report from the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI).

""Builders report solid demand for single-family homes. However, they continue to grapple with labor shortages, a dearth of buildable lots and rising construction costs that are making it increasingly challenging to build homes at affordable price points relative to buyer incomes,"" said NAHB Chairman Greg Ugalde, a homebuilder and developer from Torrington, Connecticut.

Trade worries have also kept Treasurys in demand after President Donald Trump raised doubts on the trade progress between China and the U.S. and renewed threats to slap tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods."

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration failed to follow ethics rules last year when it dismissed academic members of Environmental Protection Agency advisory boards and replaced them with appointees connected to industry, a federal watchdog agency concluded Monday.

The agency, the Government Accountability Office, found that the administration “did not consistently ensure” that appointees to E.P.A. advisory panels met federal ethics requirements. It also concluded that Trump administration officials violated E.P.A. guidelines by not basing the appointments on recommendations made by career staff members.

Scott Pruitt, President Trump’s first E.P.A. administrator who resigned last year amid ethics scandals, remade the agency’s science advisory panels because he said they did not fairly represent the United States geographically, or the industries affected by regulations.

The percentage of academic scientists serving on one E.P.A. panel, the Scientific Advisory Board, dropped 27 percent during the first year of the Trump administration. Academics on the agency’s Board of Scientific Counselors dropped 45 percent. Investigators found that the percentage of academics on E.P.A. advisory boards remained stable around 83 percent during the first year President Barack Obama was in office ."

There's more upheaval at the Minnesota Department of Human Services, with the department's chief of staff out and two deputy commissioners who resigned last week back in.

Minnesota's largest state agency has resembled a revolving door this week, with the planned resignation of deputy commissioners Charles Johnson and Claire Wilson followed by the resignation of DHS Commissioner Tony Lourey on Monday and Chief of Staff Stacie Weeks on Tuesday.

ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website

But on Wednesday, it was announced that both Johnson and Wilson have rescinded their resignations, according to a memo sent to staff by interim DHS Commissioner Pam Wheelock.

Wheelock says the pair agreed to stay on at the department after meeting with her, something she said she welcomes ""as a way to ensure continuity that will benefit the organization during this transition period.""

A reason hadn't been given when Johnson and Wilson announced their intentions to step down last week, though it's worth noting that their decision to stay has only come out after the departure of Lourey and subsequently Weeks.

Weeks' decision to step down comes as little surprise given she was appointed by Lourey to be his chief of staff in February.

She had previously served as the director of public policy and advocacy at Hennepin Healthcare, as well as an earlier stint at the DHS where she was director of health care policy and federal waivers.

""Stacie brought tremendous energy, dedication and productivity to the organization and on behalf of the department I want to thank her and wish her all the best,"" Wheelock wrote.

The DHS, which accounts for about a third of Minnesota's $50 billion state budget, has been in turmoil since earlier this year, when a report came out criticizing its handling of child care benefit fraud, which subsequently saw the DHS Inspector General Carolyn Ham placed on paid leave while a complaint was investigated."
State Dept. urges Sweden to treat arrested rapper ASAP Rocky fairly,https://www.politico.com,['Daniel Lippman'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/14/asap-rocky-arrested-sweden-state-department-1415839,"Swedish prosecutors must decide by Friday whether to charge A$AP Rocky with any crimes. | Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP File Photo foreign policy State Dept. urges Sweden to treat arrested rapper ASAP Rocky fairly

The State Department is raising concerns about the arrest and detention of an American rapper in Sweden and is urging the Swedish government to treat him fairly, according to a statement shared exclusively with POLITICO.

ASAP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was arrested July 2 after voluntarily going to the police in Stockholm for questioning about a street fight he was involved in.

Story Continued Below

A State Department spokesperson said that the department is aware of the case and that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been briefed. Top officials at the department, including Robert O’Brien, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, are also closely monitoring the situation and working to make sure the rapper is treated fairly.

“There are certainly some facts about the arrest and detention that raise concerns,” the spokesperson said. “We expect all governments, including Sweden, to treat American citizens fairly and with respect. … We hope to see ASAP Rocky and his colleagues back on tour and reunited with friends and family soon.”

Swedish prosecutors must decide by Friday whether to charge Rocky, who is being held in solitary confinement, or ask a court to let them hold him longer.

Rocky and his entourage, who were in Stockholm for the Smash music festival, were walking around the city “minding their own business” on June 30 when they were verbally harassed by two men who had started following them, according to a person close to the rapper.

Eventually, after one of them took “a fighting stance and then threw a punch” at Rocky’s bodyguard and hit him, the two sides soon started fighting.

“They were obviously spoiling for a fight,” said the person close to Rocky. The person added that the rapper and his crew “had no choice but to defend themselves” and that the two men who had been accosting Rocky and his colleagues got physical first. The person also said Rocky is “eager to defend himself and his name” in court if charges are filed.

A TMZ video shows Rocky throwing across the street one of the men who had been following him and his entourage. The video also shows some members of Rocky’s group kicking and hitting the person.

Rocky posted a video on Instagram with his side of the story, which showed his bodyguard telling the men to quit following them.

“So a few drug addicts are not my fans, we dont know these guys and we didnt want trouble, they followed us for 4 blocks, and they were slapping girls butts who passed, give me a break,” he wrote. Another video Rocky posted shows one of the men fighting with his bodyguard and throwing his headphones at him.

Alan Jackson, a lawyer for Rocky, told POLITICO: “President Trump has made bringing home unjustly held Americans a top priority for his administration. The State Department’s interest in the case gives us great hope for Rocky’s situation.

“Secretary Pompeo and Ambassador O’Brien have been relentless in their diplomatic efforts on behalf of American citizens being held all over the world. Rocky’s millions of fans worldwide are putting their trust in the State Department to get Rocky home.”

Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations requires signatory countries to immediately notify consular officials upon arresting a foreign citizen, but that didn’t happen for hours in Rocky’s case, according to the person close to Rocky.

A State Department official was also initially denied access to Rocky but upon being granted access, the official couldn’t have a private conversation with the rapper because two Swedish security guards were within earshot.

The Swedish Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.

Rocky was initially held for four days in a facility that had “relatively fetid conditions” with a “terrible stench” that was “dirty, filthy and disgusting,” according to the person close to the rapper. He was later moved to a detention facility where the conditions are “markedly better.”

Celebrities, including Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes, sent out social media posts in support of Rocky, and more than 580,000 people have signed a ""#JusticeForRocky"" petition on Change.org to urge Sweden to release him.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), whose district includes Harlem, where Rocky is from, said he’d “seen the tape of what occurred, and clearly, he was provoked, and harassed, and followed, and accosted, and I think he acted in self-defense.” Espaillat also raised concerns about the conditions of Rocky’s jail and told Complex.com that he would “fight until he’s brought back home.” The lawmaker has sent letters on the case to the State Department, the U.S. Embassy in Sweden and the Swedish ambassador to the U.S., Karin Olofsdotter."
Trump Fans the Flames of a Racial Fire,https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/trump-twitter-race.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump woke up on Sunday morning, gazed out at the nation he leads, saw the dry kindling of race relations and decided to throw a match on it. It was not the first time, nor is it likely to be the last. He has a pretty large carton of matches and a ready supply of kerosene.

His Twitter harangue goading Democratic congresswomen of color to “go back” to the country they came from, even though most of them were actually born in the United States, shocked many. But it should have surprised few who have watched the way he has governed a multicultural, multiracial country the last two and a half years.

When it comes to race, Mr. Trump plays with fire like no other president in a century. While others who occupied the White House at times skirted close to or even over the line, finding ways to appeal to the resentments of white Americans with subtle and not-so-subtle appeals, none of them in modern times fanned the flames as overtly, relentlessly and even eagerly as Mr. Trump.

His attack on the Democratic congresswomen came on the same day his administration was threatening mass roundups of immigrants living in the country illegally. And it came just days after he hosted some of the most incendiary right-wing voices on the internet at the White House and vowed to find another way to count citizens separately from noncitizens despite a Supreme Court ruling that blocked him from adding a question to the once-a-decade census."
US Treasury has 'serious concerns' Libra could be used for terrorism,https://www.engadget.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/15/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-us-treasury-department-concerns/,"According to Mnuchin, the US has been at the forefront of regulating entities that provide cryptocurrencies. It has also seen cryptocurrencies exploited to support illicit activities including cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, human trafficking and more. Still, Mnuchin said the US ""welcomes responsible innovation, including new technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system and expand access to financial services.""

""With respect to Facebook's Libra and other developments in cryptocurrencies, our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse,"" Mnuchin said. He noted that Facebook (and any other cryptocurrency providers) will have to meet the same safeguards as traditional financial institutions, including those put in place by the Anti-Money Laundering Council, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Bank Secrecy Act.

That should come as no surprise to Facebook. While it's likely prepared to meet those standards, it will have to navigate pushback like this from the Treasury Department and the President himself, who claims cryptocurrencies are ""highly volatile and based on thin air."" Some lawmakers have called for Facebook to halt Libra's development, and others want to block all big tech companies from providing cryptocurrencies. Facebook is scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing tomorrow, and it has said it won't launch Libra until all of the regulatory issues are addressed."

EPA orders closures of 15 cesspools in Arizona national forests,https://ktar.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://ktar.com/story/2656284/epa-orders-closures-of-15-cesspools-in-arizona-national-forests/,"PHOENIX — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday that more than a dozen cesspools must be closed in Arizona national forests.

The agency said 15 campground pit toilets in the Apache-Sitgreaves, Tonto, Coconino and Kaibab national forests are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s 2005 ban on large-capacity cesspools.

The cesspools discharge untreated raw sewage into the ground, which can cause pathogens to contaminate bodies of water, the agency said.

The U.S. Forest Service will have until December 2024 to close the areas and comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act.

The agencies’ agreement also includes reporting requirements and fines for the Forest Service if it doesn’t meet deadlines.

“Closing cesspools in national forests is important to protect the drinking water resources and the health of those using our public lands,” Mike Stoker, EPA Pacific Southwest regional administrator, said in a press release.

“We are pleased that the Forest Service helped to identify the cesspools and committed to address these violations.”

The public is able to submit comments on the agreement through Aug. 15.

USDA Identifies Two Monsanto Strains in Rogue GMO Wheat in Washington State,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/usda-identifies-two-monsanto-strains-in-rogue-gmo-wheat-in-washington-state,"The GMO wheat discovered growing wild in a Washington State field this spring actually sprouted from two different strains developed by Monsanto, the USDA announced over the weekend. Genetically engineered wheat is not approved for cultivation anywhere in the world, yet volunteer herbicide-resistant plants have been confirmed four times in the U.S. Northwest more than a decade after field trials ended.

In the latest case, USDA said “thorough testing” identified the wheat as Monsanto strains MON 71300 and MON 71800. The MON 71800 strain also was identified in the first U.S. case of rogue GMO wheat, in eastern Oregon in 2013. The same strain was found growing wild in 2014 at a Montana State University research farm in Huntley, Montana. A different strain, MON 71700, was found in 22 wheat plants in a field in Washington State in 2016.

“There is no evidence that any GE wheat has entered commerce or is in the food supply,” said USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in an update of the new case. It has issued similar conclusions on the past incidents. And, as in the past, it cited the FDA position that there would be no safety concerns if low levels of the wheat varieties were present in the food supply.

A test kit will be offered to U.S. trading partners to identify MON 71300, said the APHIS. Previously, the USDA has provided test kits for the two other strains. Japan and South Korea, two major importers of wheat from the U.S. Northwest, have tested wheat shipments for GMO content since 2013 and have not found issues with the U.S. grain.

Unlike previous incidents, neither Japan nor South Korea interrupted purchases of U.S. wheat following the announcement of rogue wheat in Washington State. Last year, the two countries halted purchases of Canadian wheat for a month due to confirmation of GE wheat along an access road in southern Alberta.

Washington State often is the fourth-largest wheat-growing state in the nation. The Washington Grain Commission says 85% to 90% of the state’s wheat is exported, mainly to Pacific Rim nations.

In the three other U.S. incidents, the USDA did not identify the source of the wheat seeds or how a GMO variety survived in the wild. In all of the incidents, the plants attracted attention because they did not die when sprayed with a weedkiller. Monsanto genetically modified wheat to tolerate doses of Roundup herbicide.

The Trump administration is a supporter of U.S. agricultural biotechnology. President Trump signed an executive order in mid-June to modernize ag biotech and, referring to gene-edited crops and livestock, told the USDA, FDA, and EPA to use their existing powers “to exempt low-risk products of agricultural biotechnology for undue regulation.”

Senior state department official arrested for alleged DUII in Bend,http://www.bendbulletin.com,['Garrett Andrews'],07-16-2019,2019,7,http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/7298820-151/senior-state-department-official-arrested-for-alleged-duii,"A- A+

A senior official with the U.S. State Department was arrested this month on suspicion of drunken driving after crashing her vehicle while returning from a wedding.

Susan A. Phalen was arrested July 6 on suspicion of DUII and reckless driving near Central Oregon Community College. As of Tuesday, she had not been charged with a crime, according to the Oregon Judicial Information Network.

At 10:39 p.m., dispatch received a report of a single-vehicle rollover crash on Mt. Washington Drive. Bend Police officer Matthew Baldwin arrived to find a 2019 Land Rover Discovery on its side in the middle of the northbound lane and Phalen sitting on the curb with a COCC campus security officer standing near her, according to court documents.

Baldwin said he “immediately” noticed numerous signs of impairment in Phalen, such as watery and bloodshot eyes, slurred and slow speech.

She allegedly needed help standing, according to court records.

Phalen reportedly told the officer she had been returning to her Airbnb after a wedding in Tumalo. Unfamiliar with the area, she attempted to follow her navigation by making a left turn when she rolled her vehicle.

The nearest road was Regency Drive, about one-eighth of a mile up the road, Baldwin said.

Phalen reportedly admitted to drinking margaritas at the wedding, but refused to perform roadside sobriety tests or take a breath test for alcohol, according to court records.

“I have no comment,” Phalen told The Bulletin when reached for comment.

Phalen, 49, of Alexandria, Virginia, is listed as a senior adviser for external affairs for the State Department, according the department’s current directory. Her career in government stretches to the 1990s and has included stints as communication director for the House Homeland Security Committee and before that, the House Intelligence Committee. More recently, she was director of external affairs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to her LinkedIn page.

Phalen made headlines last year when a fellow press secretary left FEMA, citing in his resignation letter a “boys club” mentality that excluded Phalen.

Phalen resigned from FEMA in early 2018.

"BLM moving headquarters to Colorado from D.C., dashing Utah’s hopes",https://www.sltrib.com,"['Bmaffly Sltrib.Com', 'Brian Maffly']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2019/07/15/federal-bureau-land/,"Following through on one of his predecessor’s key initiatives, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is expected to announce Tuesday that he will move the Bureau of Land Management’s headquarters from Washington, D.C., out West.

While Salt Lake City and Ogden would have been centrally located cities for the agency’s national office, Utah was not selected, although some BLM staffers could be transferred to offices here.

The headquarters will be established in Grand Junction, Colo., an oil and gas industry hub, according to Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, who praised the move because it will bring the agency closer to the lands it administers.

“The problem with Washington is too many policymakers are far removed from the people they are there to serve. Ninety-nine percent of the land the BLM manages is west of the Mississippi River, and so should be the BLM headquarters,"" Gardner said in a prepared statement. ""This is a victory for local communities, advocates for public lands, and proponents for a more responsible and accountable federal government.”

Ryan Zinke, a onetime Montana congressman, had proposed moving the BLM headquarters from his first day as President Donald Trump’s interior secretary, as part of a larger effort to reorganize Interior’s various agencies. Zinke left office under a cloud of ethics investigations early this year and was succeeded by his No. 2, Bernhardt, a native Coloradoan who had previously worked for the BLM and later as an oil and gas industry lobbyist.

According to reporting by The Washington Post, Bernhardt plans to relocate 77 staffers, or one-fifth of the BLM’s 350-member Washington workforce, to Western cities, mostly to Grand Junction, at a cost of about $4 million. E&E News broke the story Monday, identifying Grand Junction as the likely headquarters site.

The BLM administers 42 percent of the land in Utah, or 23 million acres, plus the minerals under 8 million acres of national forest. Nationally it oversees 245 million acres, nearly all of it in Western states, and many more acres of offshore oil and gas reserves. After 2½ years of the Trump administration, the BLM has yet to have a permanent director. Casey Hammond is the latest in a string of acting directors to head the agency.

Already the vast majority of the BLM’s 9,260 employees work in state headquarters and field offices, such as those in Salt Lake City, Vernal, Moab and Richfield.

Where Western politicians see greater efficiency and responsiveness in pushing even more BLM staff into the West, environmental activists see political theater and waste.

“This move is a solution in search of a problem,"" said Athan Manuel, director of public lands protection for Sierra Club. “Spending millions to relocate when there are existing regional offices, billions in park maintenance backlog on the books, and costs still rolling in from Trump’s Independence Day extravagance is just foolhardy.”

Like Gardner, Utah’s political leaders had viewed the BLM’s proposed move favorably, especially if the new headquarters wound up in Salt Lake City or Ogden.

Article continues below

“Moving the BLM [from Washington] to Utah will be far more than a symbolic gesture. It will actually generate better policy,” Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said last year at a forum on Interior reorganization hosted by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah. “It will alleviate the anger and anxiety we have out here. It will change the nature of the discourses and relations the Intermountain West has with the rest of the country.”

A spokeswoman for Herbert declined comment until Interior makes an official announcement. The Interior Department did not respond to a request for comment.

Bishop on Monday praised Bernhardt’s “thoughtful, methodical approach,” calling it “a true win for the West.”

“I’m pleased that a significant number of personnel will be coming to Utah and other Western states,"" he said. ""The BLM personnel will be moved where they will have a greater impact on, and input by, the people who live in the regions where their influence is greatest. Not by bureaucrats from thousands of miles away.”

Critics, however, were quick to denounce BLM’s relocation.

Rep. Raul Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who heads the House Natural Resources Committee, linked the move to the Trump administration’s American energy dominance agenda, which he argues is geared more toward pandering to industry and cutting staff, rather than serving the public.

""Putting BLM headquarters down the road from Secretary Bernhardt’s home town [of Rifle, Colo.] just makes it easier for special interests to walk in the door demanding favors without congressional oversight or accountability,"" he said in a prepared statement Monday. ""The BLM officials based in Washington are here to work directly with Congress and their federal colleagues, and that function is going to take a permanent hit if this move goes forward.""

Grijalva is also concerned that the BLM will lose many valued employees who might not want to leave Washington. “I suspect that’s the administration’s real goal here,” he said.

Environmental activists also eye the move with skepticism.

“Bringing jobs to a Western community like Grand Junction is a laudable goal, but this announcement is nothing but a P.R. stunt,"" said Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities.

“More than 90 percent of BLM staff already work outside of Washington, D.C., and the agency has dozens of offices across the West,” she said. “Moving senior BLM leadership would only turn the agency into an afterthought, rather than a core piece of the Interior Department.”"

DHS inspector general confirms investigation into leaked ICE raids,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-inspector-general-confirms-investigation-into-leaked-ice-raids,"The Department of Homeland Security's independent Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement to call off a nationwide operation, according to the federal agency.

“Last month, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) became aware of an apparent leak related to a planned enforcement operation. Leaks of law enforcement sensitive information jeopardize the safety of ICE officers and agents who have sworn an oath to uphold the law. ICE referred the incident to its Office of Professional Responsibility, which, in accordance with its normal procedures, referred it to the DHS Office of Inspector General,"" ICE said in a statement issued Monday morning.

The Washington Examiner was first to report on Friday that then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team had reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak.

""Everyone knows who they are investigating. Why didn't the acting secretary call for an investigation?"" a senior official told the Washington Examiner on Monday.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak. These sources charged he wanted to sabotage ICE’s months-long plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham two weeks ago, but last Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which Border Patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE carried out raids nationwide this past weekend, though reports suggested they were not of the magnitude anticipated."
Trump administration denies possible ouster of Commerce Secretary Ross,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-census-ross/trump-weighs-ousting-commerce-secretary-ross-nbc-idUSKCN1UA0VD,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday denied a media report nbcnews.to/2XPQJ4B that President Donald Trump is considering removing Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after a Supreme Court defeat on adding a citizenship question to the census.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks next to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during a Cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 12, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo

Trump retreated on Thursday from adding a contentious question on citizenship to the 2020 census, but insisted he was not giving up his fight to count how many non-citizens are in the country and ordered government agencies to mine their databases.

Although Trump has previously been frustrated with Ross, in particular over some failed trade negotiations, the 81-year-old commerce secretary has so far kept his job.

Since late last year other media outlets have reported at different times that Trump, whose administration has been characterized by high turnover in top posts, was considering replacing Ross.

Mnuchin told reporters that Trump remained satisfied with Ross in his role. “I have every reason to think Secretary Ross is doing a good job. I’ve never heard anything otherwise,” Mnuchin said.

The Commerce Department said in a statement Monday that Ross was currently overseeing the department’s response to Hurricane Barry and noted that he had joined Trump on his trip to Wisconsin and Ohio on Friday.

Ross “will continue to work on behalf of the American people and the President’s America First agenda,” the department said.

However, NBC reported early Monday that Trump has been making calls to “allies outside the White House about replacing Ross.”

The White House declined to comment on Monday. Trump is set to have a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

On Friday, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigned amid fresh scrutiny of his handling of a sex abuse case when he was a federal prosecutor in Florida more than a decade ago. Trump, who had supported the labor secretary amid calls for him to resign, said it was Acosta’s decision to step down.

Late on Friday, Trump said he disagreed with the findings of a Commerce Department investigation that found uranium imports threaten to impair U.S. national security and instead ordered a 90-day review by federal agencies, saying “a fuller analysis of national security considerations with respect to the entire nuclear fuel supply chain is necessary.”"
Scientists flee USDA as research agencies move to Kansas City area,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453193-scientists-flee-usda-as-research-agencies-move-to-kansas-city-area,"A Trump administration decision to move researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the Kansas City area is threatening to spark the flight of more than half of the staff selected to move, gutting the agency of its top scientific voices.

Staff have until midnight Monday to decide whether to uproot and join the department as it moves its research branches from Washington, D.C., lured by $26 million in promised incentives from state and local officials.

Critics see the move, set to be completed by Sept. 30, as yet another example of the Trump administration looking to sideline scientists and researchers, keeping them away from the corridors of power. Administration officials deny that, calling it a cost-saving move intended to have researchers closer to farmers.

The decision comes as other agencies are also planning to relocate parts of their teams amid suspicions about the move. For example, the Interior Department is expected to announce new headquarters for the Bureau of Land Management on Tuesday.

“Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers. A lot of the research that scientists and economists do at [the USDA] has policy implications, and members of Congress need this information and need to have face-to-face meetings with these researchers,” Rebecca Boehm, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Hill.

“It keeps science out of the policymaking process. And we’ve seen many times that this administration doesn’t like facts or research that isn’t convenient or [is] an impediment to their agenda, so I think moving them away helps accomplish that,” she added.

The move affects two wings of the USDA. Economic Research Service (ERS) employees analyze the agricultural market, but their research is much broader, including looking at food stamps, rural poverty and conservation.

National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) employees work with universities to fund research and coordinate the process that issues research grants on agriculture-related subjects, including climate change adaptation.

The two agencies voted to unionize in response to the move, as Democrats in both chambers and a number of groups that regularly work with the two agencies lobby to keep them in Washington.

Estimates tallied by employees show 70 percent of ERS employees designated for the Kansas City office will not be moving. For NIFA, 45 percent of those surveyed said they will not move. Overall, the move was expected to impact 547 staff between the two agencies.

But the numbers of staff refusing to move may grow. Some employees said staff at both agencies are trying not to tip their hands, saying they will move only if they do not find another job in the D.C. area.

So far, just 27 ERS staff out of 250 have committed to moving to the Kansas City area, according to the employee tallies.

The UDSA argues the move will save $300 million over 15 years, but critics have said their cost-benefit analysis was shoddy and did not follow guidelines.

A different cost-benefit analysis from the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association found the move would cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million.

Democrats have blocked USDA funding from supporting the move and asked the agency to turn over information about its decisionmaking process, and they have sponsored legislation to keep the two agencies in Washington.

“I am appalled with the Trump administration’s decision to force hundreds of Washington-based USDA research staffers to uproot their lives to Kansas City in order to keep their livelihoods,” Rep. Chellie Pingree Rochelle (Chellie) PingreeScientists flee USDA as research agencies move to Kansas City area Federal employees turn their backs on Agriculture secretary after relocation plans announced Congress should make Interior's Bernhardt 'manage the land to stop climate change' MORE (D-Maine), who sponsored the legislation, said in a statement when the move was announced.

“Many of these staffers believe their relocation is an effort to silence their research into topics that do not align with the Trump administration’s political agenda, including the study of climate change and benefits of low-income food assistance,” she added.

Employees had a list of complaints about a move they have likened to Amazon’s search for a second headquarters, as the USDA examined bids from 139 cities.

That process was put on pause during the government shutdown, but on June 16 employees were told they had a month to decide whether they’d like to move to the Kansas City area or leave the agency.

Employees would then have two months to move to Kansas City — they must be there by the end of the fiscal year — but school in the area is slated to start Aug. 12, putting added pressure on those with families to quickly make a move.

Employees say they are getting conflicting information about how much of their moving costs will be covered by the government. Other key details about the move are also unknown so far, according to the employees.

The USDA said it was working to make the move as smooth as possible but did not respond to several specific questions about the move from The Hill.

“USDA has determinedly worked to ensure employees have the resources they need to make informed decisions about their employment and to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible,” the agency said in a statement.

Employees say morale is at an all-time low and they worry about the future of an agency that is already hemorrhaging staff and having trouble completing its work.

“Honestly, I’m not sure how we’re going to bounce back or if we will,” said Laura Dodson, an agricultural economist with ERS who is now a union steward. “This agency is the product of like 50 years of institutional knowledge and gathering up researchers who are very specialized in their fields.”

Employees also say there are contradictions between what the USDA says it hopes to achieve with the move and how it would actually impact the department.

“It was sort of get fired or go,” said Ariela Zycherman, a national program leader with NIFA who is still weighing a move to Kansas City.

“People keep saying, ‘Those East Coasters don’t want to come to Kansas or Missouri.’ The fact of matter is that’s not really the issue,” she said. “Many of us would move to Kansas City, but there are questions about future of agency and its effectiveness and questions about the way this was hastily rolled out and whether it will have long-term effects on our families’ well-being.”

The USDA has argued the move will allow employees to be closer to farmers — something employees say shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what they do.

“I think the biggest misconception around this is, we don’t serve individual farmers,” Dodson said. “Our stakeholders are primarily Congress and program leads and agencies and nonprofits in D.C. or people that come to meet with multiple entities in D.C.""

“I think our presence will be very much diminished. I think we’ll be quite literally out of sight and out of mind,” Dodson added.

The bipartisan Kansas and Missouri delegation pushed hard to bring the offices to the Kansas City area, calling it a hub for research and a talented workforce and touting the lower cost compared to Washington, D.C.

But employees say the hectic way the move has been handled has soured many about the USDA.

“I’ve never experienced morale like this in any job,” said Wesley Dean, a national program leader in sociology for NIFA. “My colleagues are deeply committed to the mission of the agency and see their positions as an opportunity to both shape the future of their scientific disciplines and to serve the American people.

“These highly motivated civil servants feel as if their expertise and dedication to the agency and the public has been undermined and dismissed by the department,” Dean added."

The layoffs are expected to hit Futurewei Technologies, a Huawei research and development unit with divisions in California, Texas, and Washington state that employs roughly 850 people, per the Journal. Sources told the paper that hundreds of jobs are expected to be lost, although some Chinese nationals are “being given the option of returning home and staying with the company”:

Futurewei employees have faced restrictions communicating with colleagues in Huawei’s home offices in China following the May 16 Commerce Department decision to put Huawei on its so-called entity list, which blocked companies from supplying U.S.-sourced technology to Huawei without a license, according to these people. Several employees have already been notified of their dismissal, while additional planned cuts could be announced soon, these people said.

In May, the Trump administration added Huawei and 68 affiliates to an “entity list” that restricted transfers of U.S. technology to the company without government approval amid warnings from the intelligence community that the company, the world’s largest telecommunications gear supplier, could be acting as a proxy for Chinese espionage agencies. Other U.S. moves against Huawei have included allegations of trade theft, fraud, and violations of sanctions on Iran—all of this occurring alongside a brewing U.S.-China trade war that has resulted in economic damage to both sides. Huawei obviously denies the allegations and claims that the U.S. is resorting to unfair trade practices because it is outcompeting American firms.

While Donald Trump recently said after a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, that he would relax sanctions on Huawei, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has clarified that the department would only issue licenses where “there is no threat to U.S. national security.” Huawei chairman Liang Hua recently told reporters in Shenzen, China that there has not been “any tangible change” to the situation. According to the Journal, the U.S. layoffs are in part because Futurewei’s R&D efforts “could amount to U.S.-sourced technology under Huawei’s entity listing,” and its ability to coordinate with its ownership in China has been seriously damaged.

Huawei Chairman Ren Zhengfei has also said that the company stands to lose $30 billion in revenue in 2019 and 2020 due to the restrictions, which have caused many American suppliers to sever ties and damaged the viability of its product lineup (including the cancellation of a new model of laptop and forcing it to quickly develop an alternative to Google’s official Android mobile OS). According to the Journal, Ren told a French newspaper that its own mobile OS, dubbed Hongmeng, was originally designed for use in telecom networks and “we don’t have a clear plan yet” for populating it with apps.
