Michelle Obama seemingly swipes at Trump amid 'send her back' controversy,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michelle-obama-trump-ocasio-cortez-ilhan-omar,"Former First Lady Michelle Obama has seemingly taken a shot at President Trump amid his ongoing feud with four progressive congresswomen, saying ""there's a place"" for natural-born citizens and refugees alike.

Tensions escalated this week when the president blasted the Democratic ""squad,"" Reps Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., suggesting on Twitter that they ""go back"" to the countries they came. All four women are U.S. citizens, with Omar being the only one who was born outside of the U.S.

After exchanging several barbs during the week, Trump continued his attacks during Wednesday's rally, during which a ""send her back"" chant aimed at Omar broke out from his supporters.

On Friday, the former first lady tweeted what seemed to be a rebuke of the remarks -- while stopping short of mentioning the president directly.

MICHELLE OBAMA: THE NIGHT BEFORE TRUMP'S INAUGURATION WAS 'VERY EMOTIONAL'

""What truly makes our country great is its diversity,"" Mrs. Obama tweeted. ""I’ve seen that beauty in so many ways over the years. Whether we are born here or seek refuge here, there’s a place for us all. We must remember it’s not my America or your America. It’s our America.""

Her husband, former President Barack Obama, has not commented in on the feud.

While the Obamas have largely avoided weighing in on political matters since leaving the White House, Friday's comments are not the first time the former first lady has seemingly tweaked Trump.

“The leader of the free world with a tweet can start a war, can crush an economy, can change the future of our children,” she told Gayle King of CBS News at the Essence Festival in New Orleans earlier this month.

She added the next president needs to have “deep seriousness and focus” and operate “with a clear base of facts and ideas."" She also said she thinks her husband sometimes made the presidency look easy.

“I guess it's kind of like if the black guy can do it, anybody can do it -- and that's not true. It's a hard job.”"
"Trump’s Electoral College Edge Could Grow in 2020, Rewarding Polarizing Campaign",https://www.nytimes.com,['Nate Cohn'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/upshot/trump-electoral-college-edge-.html,"And just because racial polarization could work to the president’s advantage in general doesn’t mean that his particular tactics will prove effective. The president’s campaign rally on Wednesday night seemed, for a time, to go too far even for him: on Thursday he disavowed the “send her back” chants that supporters directed toward a congresswoman who immigrated to the United States as a refugee. (By Friday, he was declining to condemn the chants.)

But Mr. Trump’s approval rating has been stable even after seemingly big missteps. And if it improves by a modest amount — not unusual for incumbents with a strong economy — he could have a distinct chance to win re-election while losing the popular vote by more than he did in 2016, when he lost it by 2.1 percentage points.

The president’s relative advantage in the Electoral College could grow even further in a high-turnout election, which could pad Democratic margins nationwide while doing little to help them in the Northern battleground states.

It is even possible that Mr. Trump could win while losing the national vote by as much as five percentage points.

The state of the Electoral College, 2018

The best available evidence on the president’s standing by state comes from the large 2018 election surveys. Their quality is generally high, and unlike most surveys, they have been adjusted to match actual election results, ironing out many potential biases of pre-election polls. Although these surveys are nearly nine months old, the stability of the president’s overall approval ratings means, for our purposes, that they remain a decent measure of the distribution of his support.

Taken together, the president’s approval rating among midterm voters stood at about 45.5 percent, excluding the voters who did not express an opinion (for comparability, measures of the president’s approval will exclude voters without an opinion)."
Trump Seizes On Soggy Paper Straws As Campaign Issue: 'Make Straws Great Again',https://www.npr.org,['Jessica Taylor'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/19/743683131/trump-seizes-on-soggy-paper-straws-as-campaign-issue-make-straws-great-again,"Trump Seizes On Soggy Paper Straws As Campaign Issue: 'Make Straws Great Again'

President Trump appears to have identified his newest American enemy — paper straws.

His reelection campaign is now selling reusable and recycled straws in their 2020 online store, and Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale blasted out the slurping non-soggy alternative in an email titled ""Make Straws Great Again,"" a play on the president's famed slogan.

""I'm so over paper straws, and I'm sure you are too. Much like most liberal ideas, paper straws don't work and they fall apart instantly. That's why we just launched our latest product - Official Trump Straws,"" Parscale wrote late Friday. ""Now you can finally be free from liberal paper straws that fall apart within minutes and ruin your drink.""

Journalist Yashar Ali appears to have been the first to notice the new merchandise in Trump's campaign store. A pack of 10, which are red and emblazoned with ""TRUMP"" in silver, is available for $15. However, they currently take almost two weeks for shipping.

Parscale had registered his frustrations with the newest eco-friendly fad earlier this week on Twitter.

And earlier on Friday, Trump himself weighed in on the issue during a gaggle with reporters, saying ""I do think we have bigger problems than plastic straws, arguing that plates and wrappers are also made of plastic but aren't receiving as much attention or disdain.

""Everybody focuses on the straws. There's a lot of other things to focus [on],"" he said.

Many environmental groups have been pushing for alternatives to plastic disposable straws, which gained traction in the wake of a video showing a sea turtle with a plastic straw stuck up its nose. However, the paper alternatives many restaurants have begun using often quickly become mushy and unusable as the liquid permeates them. There are other non-paper, non-plastic alternatives which are slowly gaining steam, including hay straws, bamboo straws, reusable metal straws, glass straws, or encouraging patrons not to use straws, as Starbucks has with new lids.

This is hardly the first time Trump has tried transform such an issue into a partisan wedge, and has especially taken glee time and time again in mocking environmental initiatives, such as the Green New Deal, or has cast doubt on the reality of climate change. And it could also be his way of trying to distract from yet another rough week politically in the wake of his racist attacks on four Democratic freshmen congresswomen of color.

The scourge of paper straws, however, isn't just a conservative issue, as Trump's campaign wants to frame it. Earlier this week, Sacha Haworth of the liberal opposition research group American Bridge tweeted her own frustrations with paper straws.

(Full disclosure: This journalist, and many others, have also often tweeted about paper straw grievances).

This also isn't the first time that efforts to make disposable dinnerware greener have been used as a political cudgel. After Democrats flipped the House in 2006, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed to phase out styrofoam in the Capitol cafeterias, bringing in ""corn-based, compostable dishes and utensils,"" according to The Hill. But when Republicans won back the House in 2010, they brought back the non-recyclable styrofoam."

WASHINGTON – Nadia Murad, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and refugee of the Yazidi region of Iraq, this week personally asked President Donald Trump to step in to help her community -- in an appeal that was emotional, almost desperate at moments.

But Trump seemed aloof throughout the exchange, which quickly went viral.

During a visit to the Oval Office, Murad recounted how although ISIS is gone, the Kurdish and Iraqi governments are fighting for control of the region indigenous to the Yazidi people. She called on Trump to intervene between the two governments.

Murad, who is in her mid-20s, survived sex slavery and torture from ISIS. She went on to be an advocate to end sexual violence in war and armed conflicts, which is how she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The young woman, who was standing behind Trump for the meeting, was one of 27 survivors of religious persecution that visited with Trump on Wednesday.

""Today you can solve our problem. Now there is no ISIS but we cannot go back because Kurdish government and the Iraqi government, they are fighting each other (over) who will control my area,"" Murad explained. ""And we cannot go back if we cannot protect our dignity, our families.""

""But ISIS is gone,"" Trump replied. Then the president clarified that he now understands it's the Kurdish and Iraqi governments that are the issue.

She also explained how she and 95,000 other Yazidis became refugees due to the area still being in turmoil despite ISIS being gone.

""They emigrated to Germany through a very dangerous way. Not because we want to be a refugees, but we cannot find a safe place to live,"" she said. Her comments come as Trump is trying to limit the number of migrants coming to the United States, mostly from Central America. Many migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras are fleeing economic poverty and gang violence.

Murad also explained how the terrorist group also killed her mother and six brothers.

""All this happened to me. They killed my mom, my six brothers. They left behind them,"" Murad said.

""Where are they now?"" Trump asked.

""They killed them,"" Murad quickly replied. ""They are in the mass grave in Sinjar, and I'm still fighting just to live in safe. Please do something.""

""I know the area very well,"" Trump replied. ""I'm going to look into it very strongly.""

Trump also noted that Murad received a Nobel Prize, but asked her to explain why she had been given the prestigious international award.

""For, after all this happened to me, I didn't give up,"" she said. ""I made it clear to everyone that ISIS raped thousands of Yazidi women. This was the first time a woman from Iraq she get out, and she spoke about what happened.""

""Oh really, is that right?"" Trump replied. ""So you escaped?""

""I escaped, but I don't have my freedom yet,"" she replied. Murad added that about 3,000 Yazidi women and children that were being held by ISIS are still missing, which include her niece, nephew and sister-in-law.

""Let me look, we'll look,"" Trump said.

Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET

More than 3,100 people will leave Bureau of Prisons custody starting Friday, part of what Justice Department officials call ""a truly monumental effort"" to comply with the First Step Act, a criminal justice law passed by Congress last year.

Most of the offenders being freed have been convicted of drug-related crimes and have been living in halfway houses across the United States in preparation for their release, acting BOP chief Hugh Hurwitz told reporters at a news conference in Washington.

About 900 of the inmates are subject to detention by local authorities or immigration officials, and their fate will be up to states or the Department of Homeland Security, he said.

The Justice Department announced that 250 more inmates who are elderly or terminally ill have transitioned into home confinement or compassionate-release programs since President Trump signed the law last December.

Those programs existed in some form before the First Step Act, but advocates for prisoners and their families said they were used only sparingly and now are somewhat easier to access.

""The department intends to implement this law fully and on time, with the goal of reducing crime, enhancing public safety and strengthening the rule of law,"" said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen.

Authorities also unveiled a new risk assessment tool designed to identify prisoners who could benefit from prison programming that would allow them to win credits that count toward early release under the law.

Inmates will be reassessed every six months under that new program.

In a joint statement, Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said they would ""vigilantly"" review the new risk assessment system.

""It's critical that the assessment does not disproportionately designate minorities as having a higher risk of reoffending,"" the senators said.

Questions about implementation

The Justice Department enlisted a think tank, the Hudson Institute, to assist with the assessment effort. But that decision has come under fire from key Democrats in Congress.

""The Hudson Institute and its leadership have opposed sentencing reform, opposed the First Step Act's reforms, and authored an article entitled 'Why Trump Should Oppose Criminal Justice Reform,' "" as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and subcommittee chairwoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., said earlier this year.

""We are concerned that the selection of a biased organization lacking requisite expertise may reflect a lack of intent to diligently and effectively implement the bipartisan criminal justice reforms,"" they said.

Advocates seeking to overhaul the federal system welcomed news Friday that the Justice Department is moving ahead to implement the First Step Act. But they said they have ongoing concerns about funding and oversight, and they want Congress to hold the administration accountable.

Attorney General William Barr has been the subject of criticism that he holds outdated views about crime and punishment from the earlier era when he served as attorney general.

""There's a lot of skepticism over whether this Justice Department is going to fully implement the law,"" said Inimai Chettiar, legislative and policy director for the Justice Action Network.

""We definitely believe that Congress needs to step in and ensure that this is happening and to also fully fund the law because the only way that these recidivism reduction programs are going to be effective is if they are fully funded.""

Still, groups that work with inmates and their families said that whatever its failings, the First Step Act is making a difference.

""Every day of freedom is important,"" said Kevin Ring, president of the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. ""We're happy for the families who get to welcome home their loved ones a few weeks or months early."""
It’s time to break up DHS.,https://slate.com,['Fred Kaplan'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/aoc-dhs-break-up.html,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images and Win McNamee/Getty Images.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got at least one thing right this week: The Department of Homeland Security should be abolished.

Ocasio-Cortez proposed breaking up DHS in a radio interview with New Yorker editor David Remnick, after which several Republicans began hammering her for the idea. “Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney exclaimed to a reporter. “Moronic, stupid, naïve, and dumb,” GOP strategist Karl Rove sputtered on Fox News.

It’s unclear why Dick Cheney’s daughter and George W. Bush’s former White House deputy chief of staff should find AOC’s suggestion so outrageous. A Democrat, then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, first proposed creating DHS in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, to show that his party could get serious about terrorism too—and then-President George W. Bush initially opposed the idea, saying that it would just pile on another layer of bureaucracy. That proved to be an understatement.

Bush finally relented after the 9/11 Commission concluded that the attacks happened, in part, because the FBI and the CIA hadn’t shared intelligence about the hijackers’ movements prior to the attack. This overstated the case, but suddenly consolidation became a popular nostrum to our problems, and in 2002, Bush signed Lieberman’s idea into law.

The organizations that didn’t consolidate—the CIA and FBI, the culprits that mishandled intelligence about al-Qaida in the first place—elevated their counterterrorism units, redirected their focus, and strung new lines of communications between them. Meanwhile the Department of Homeland Security subsumed 22 agencies from eight federal departments—with a combined budget of $40 billion (back then) and a payroll of 183,000 employees—into one hydra-headed, crossbred, poorly conceived monstrosity.

It wasn’t just the size that was the problem: Most of these agencies had been performing distinct functions; shmooshing them together wouldn’t necessarily make them more cohesive or efficient. In fact, it made each component less effective. Several of those agencies had been headed by officials with the standing of Cabinet secretaries, who could focus laser-like on their specific domains and had the clout to request direct access to the president. This is no longer true. The Secretary of Homeland Security, even a very good one, has the time and bandwidth to focus on maybe two or three of the department’s 22 areas. The other areas are now handled by undersecretaries or assistant (or deputy assistant) secretaries—people with less clout and less access, leaving issues less attended.

The place is a well-known mishmash unable to attract top talent in the upper tiers, where policy is made, and unable to retain top talent in the middle tiers, where operations are managed.

Here’s one example: In the early 1990s, when the U.S. government started addressing cybersecurity, the Defense Department created a specially staffed joint task force for “computer network defense.” It had bureaucratic clashes with similar but separate units in the Air Force and the National Security Agency, but those in charge were beginning to figure out how to work together.

DHS is unable to attract top talent in the upper tiers, where policy is made—and unable to retain top talent in the middle tiers, where operations are managed.

Then, after 9/11, it was decided that DHS would be responsible for defending the nation from cyberattacks (though the Pentagon and the NSA would remain in charge of protecting defense networks). The system of interagency arrangements, which had slowly been evolving, fell apart. DHS lacked the resources and know-how for its mission. During the early Obama administration, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano signed a memorandum of understanding allowing the DHS and NSA to work together in crises, but it was sabotaged by a DHS deputy who opposed any plan that helped turn the internet into a “war zone.” (The deputy was a few years late on trying to stop that development.)

DHS has probably also had a deleterious effect on protecting security and civil liberties on the southern border, the main topic of Ocasio-Cortez’s concerns. Before 9/11, border matters were handled by the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Services, which the DHS fused into a new agency, Customs and Border Patrol.

Customs and the INS were run as fairly professional law enforcement agencies, with varying degrees of laxity or fervency, depending on the times. Under a more normal administration, CBP might still operate in that manner. But lassoed into a political department and run by a handpicked operative, it has turned into an enforcement squad for Trump’s obsessively anti-immigrant agenda. Even under Trump’s orders, would the competent bureaucrats of the old Customs Service have herded children into cages? Maybe. But they might have handled things in a more professional fashion because it would have been an independent agency following its own rules and codes, rather than a subset of a super-agency run by a political appointee.

Bureaucratic routines and regulations sometime serve a laudable purpose.

It’s very hard to turn back the clock to 2001 and dissolve DHS into its once separate components, especially since most people don’t remember or even knowthat it wasn’t always this way. But maybe we should try. Republicans talk about dissolving federal agencies all the time. As Ocasio-Cortez put it in a clarifying tweet: “Discussing reorganization shouldn’t be out of the question.”"
"E.P.A. Won’t Ban Chlorpyrifos, Pesticide Tied to Children’s Health Problems",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/climate/epa-chlorpyrifos-pesticide-ban.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took a major step to weaken the regulation of toxic chemicals on Thursday when the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would not ban a widely used pesticide that its own experts have linked to serious health problems in children.

The decision by Andrew R. Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, represents a victory for the chemical industry and for farmers who have lobbied to continue using the substance, chlorpyrifos, arguing it is necessary to protect crops.

It was the administration’s second major move this year to roll back or eliminate chemical safety rules. In April, the agency disregarded the advice of its own experts when officials issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, a known carcinogen. Agency scientists and lawyers had urged the E.P.A. to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

In making the chlorpyrifos ruling, the E.P.A. said in a statement that the data supporting objections to the use of the pesticide was “not sufficiently valid, complete or reliable.” The agency added that it would continue to monitor the safety of chlorpyrifos through 2022."

House Democrats want to know whether a decades-old Justice Department prohibition on indicting a sitting president played a role in federal prosecutors’ decision not to criminally charge President Donald Trump over hush money payments that he directed his fixer to pay to women.

The prohibition, laid out in a 2000 memo by the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, was also a key factor in former special counsel Robert Mueller’s decision to refrain from considering whether to charge Trump with obstruction of justice for his repeated attempts to thwart the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Story Continued Below

Now Democrats on the House Oversight Committee say the federal prosecutors based in the Southern District of New York should disclose whether they made a similar analysis. The president’s longtime lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen was jailed earlier this year, in part for his role in hush payments to women accusing Trump of extramarital affairs, and he implicated the president in the scheme. Documents made public Thursday showed contacts between Cohen and Trump surrounding the hush money payments and were part of prosecutors’ evidence that Trump directed Cohen to make the payoffs.

“If prosecutors identified evidence of criminal conduct by Donald Trump while serving as President — and did not bring charges as they would have for any other individual — this would be the second time the President has not been held accountable for his actions due to his position,” committee chairman Elijah Cummings wrote in a 12-page letter to the deputy U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York. “The Office of the President should not be used as a shield for criminal conduct.”

Cummings noted that he wrote directly to the SDNY prosecutors because of concerns about the accuracy of information provided to Congress by Attorney General William Barr in characterizing Mueller’s findings in March — a month before it became public.

Cummings has asked for SNDY to provide by Aug. 2 “all evidence collected about the role of any other individual in connection with the campaign finance charges against Cohen, including any evidence relating to the President, and copies of all immunity deals granted, or informal immunity agreement letters or non-prosecution agreements entered into, in this investigation.” The committee is also asking whether Barr or any other senior Justice Department officials weighed in on the case.

Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to two campaign finance violations for arranging payments to two women who were preparing to accuse Trump of extramarital affairs in the weeks leading up to the 2016 election. One of them, porn actress Stormy Daniels, received $130,000 through a shell company that Cohen opened. The other, Karen McDougal, received a $150,000 “catch-and-kill” contract from Trump associates at the National Enquirer to bury her story just before the election. Cohen, who is currently serving a three-year prison sentence, admitted he played a role in that arrangement, as well.

Republicans on the Oversight Committee quickly rejected Cummings’ inquiry as a political attack on Trump and argued that Cohen’s history of lying undercuts the Democrats’ inquiry.

“Everyone knows that convicted felon Michael Cohen is a habitual liar. But still Chairman Cummings continues to use Cohen — the Chairman’s first announced witness this Congress — to attack the President for political gain,” said a spokesperson for Oversight Committee Republicans. “Democrats in Congress should be solving real problems instead of indulging their obsession with impeaching the President.”

Thousands of prisoners released as new reform effort takes effect,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/19/politics/first-step-act-prisoners-released-doj/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nearly 3,100 federal inmates will walk out of prison on Friday as a provision of the sweeping criminal justice reform act passed by Congress takes effect.

The mass release -- the largest since the First Step Act was signed into law after a rare bipartisan push last year -- applies mostly to drug offenders and inmates serving sentences for weapons charges. It was initiated by a recalculation of the number of days inmates accrue each year for good behavior that was applied retroactively under the new law.

At a news conference at the Department of Justice Friday morning, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen also announced that $75 million was being redirected from existing Justice Department programs to fund the First Step Act for the remainder of the fiscal year that goes through September, a move that could begin to allay the fears of some advocates who had questioned the department's commitment to reform.

""The attorney general and I both recently toured federal prisons and we saw first-hand the tremendous value in quality programs for inmates,"" Rosen said. ""Using top-of-the-line research, people and technology, the Department intends to implement this law forcefully, fully and on time, with the goal of reducing crime, enhancing public safety and strengthening the rule of law.""

So far, approximately 1,100 inmates that had been imprisoned on crack cocaine offenses have been released early as a result of sentence reductions brought about by the First Step Act, and hundreds more convicted of that crime are now looking towards a shorter prison term.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told lawmakers there is an ""aggressive"" ongoing investigation into the secret Facebook group of current and former Border Patrol agents that sparked outrage earlier this month, responding to a question from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) during a contentious House Oversight Committee hearing.

US environment agency allows use of controversial pesticide,https://www.aljazeera.com,[],,,,https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/environment-agency-controversial-pesticide-190719021212099.html,"The United States' Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Thursday it will not ban the use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos - which has been linked to health issues in children - from its use on US-grown fruits and vegetables.

The agency denied the petition by a dozen environmental groups, led by Earthjustice, to ban the pesticide. They said studies show that exposures to the pesticide is linked to low birth weight, reduced IQ, attention disorders and other issues in infants and children.

The Obama administration's EPA had banned the use of chlorpyrifos in 2015 after it decided it could not be certain whether exposure to the chemical in food and water would be harmful. But US President Donald Trump's first EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, reversed that decision in 2017, prompting an ongoing legal battle.

In April, the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the EPA had until mid-July to decide whether to reverse Pruitt’s overturn of the ban on chlorpyrifos.

The pesticide is made by Corteva Agriscience, formerly part of DowDuPont.

""We are committed to working with the Agency as it seeks to make an accurate assessment and, if necessary, reduce potential exposures, while also ensuring that growers for whom chlorpyrifos is a critical tool can continue to use the product safely,"" wrote Gregg Schmidt, a spokesman for the firm in an email to the Reuters news agency.

In its denial order submitted to the court, the EPA's assistant administrator for chemicals said the agency denied all of the objections listed by the environmental groups and said there was not enough evidence to link exposure to chlorpyrifos to children's health issues.

""After reviewing the objections, EPA has determined that the objections related to Petition claims regarding neurodevelopmental toxicity must be denied because the objections and the underlying Petition are not supported by valid, complete, and reliable evidence sufficient to meet the Petitioners’ burden,"" wrote Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator for chemical safety.

The denial also said that chlorpyrifos is ""currently the only cost-effective choice for control of certain insect pests.""

The environmental groups said on Thursday they will continue to fight the decision until chlorpyrifos is banned.

“Every day we go without a ban, children and farmworkers are eating, drinking and breathing a pesticide linked to intellectual and learning disabilities and poisonings,” the groups said in a joint statement.

Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said current EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler ignored the advice of EPA scientists who supported a ban.

“If the Trump administration had followed the advice of its scientists, chlorpyrifos likely would not be in the food and milk kids eat and drink today,” he said.

It's unclear if all the payments are related to Hicks, but CNN has reached out to the firm for comment. The RNC declined to comment on the payments.

The House Judiciary Committee is now examining the truthfulness of Hicks's statements after newly unsealed court documents revealed she was in close contact with Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen as he was negotiating a hush money payment with the adult-film star Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged affair with Trump.

The FBI documents released earlier Thursday revealing that one day after the tape came out, Cohen spoke on the phone with then-campaign spokeswoman Hicks and Trump. Last month, Hicks said ""no"" when asked multiple times by Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee whether Hicks was ever present when Trump and Cohen discussed Daniels , according to a transcript released of the closed-door interview.

With Emily Davies

THE BIG IDEA: President Trump has soured on hiring generals, whom he stocked his administration with at the beginning. Remember John Kelly, Jim Mattis, Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster.

But the billionaire’s fondness has grown for stocking the Cabinet with lobbyists, lawyers and executives from the corporate class. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt was an oil industry lobbyist. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler was a coal lobbyist. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar was a pharmaceutical executive. Personnel is policy, and these men are pursuing for Trump what Steve Bannon famously called “the deconstruction of the administrative state.”

Trump’s announcement last night that he will nominate Eugene Scalia to replace Alex Acosta as the next labor secretary offers the freshest, and maybe even starkest, example. Scalia, the son of the late Antonin Scalia, has spent most of his career at a white-shoe law firm helping Corporate America thwart federal regulations and fighting various organizing efforts by employees. The 55-year-old is active in the Federalist Society and a partner in the D.C. office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.

His biography on the law firm’s website touts legal work he’s done on behalf of Ford Motor, Steve Wynn’s casinos, UBS, UPS, MetLife, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute, the Business Roundtable, plus the main telecommunications and retail industry trade associations. His bio also outlines some of the fights he’s waged, often successfully, against regulations or enforcement actions by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Labor Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.

In a 2012 profile, the Wall Street Journal called Scalia “one of the industry's go-to guys for challenging financial regulations.”

In a review of his record, today’s New York Times highlights three other cases: “In 2006, he helped Walmart triumph in a prominent fight against a Maryland law that would have required companies with more than 10,000 workers to either spend at least 8 percent of their payroll costs on health care, or pay into a state Medicaid fund. He argued that allowing individual states to establish health care mandates would create chaos and that the federal government should address the issue of rising health care costs. Mr. Scalia also defended Boeing in a politically charged case. A union representing the company’s workers in Washington State argued that Boeing had violated labor law by threatening to open another assembly plant in South Carolina unless the union agreed to a no-strike clause in its contract.”

-- The impetus for Acosta’s resignation last Friday was his 2008 plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein, but another huge factor was that corporate chieftains didn’t think the secretary was being aggressive enough in trying to roll back protections for their workers. It has been widely reported that acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who confessed last year while speaking to Wall Street bankers that as a member of Congress he did not meet with lobbyists unless they gave him money, chewed out Acosta during a meeting earlier this year and subsequently sought to oust him.

-- Scalia will almost certainly be confirmed easily by the Republican-controlled Senate. In 2002, however, George W. Bush used a recess appointment to subvert the opposition of the Senate and install Scalia as acting solicitor at the Labor Department. The Democratic-controlled chamber blocked Scalia’s nomination because of his outspoken antagonism toward unions and opposition of the ergonomics rule, which protected workers from repetitive stress injuries on the job. It had been a priority for Bill Clinton during his final year in office.

“Ergonomic regulation will force companies to give more rest periods, slow the pace of work and then hire more workers (read: dues-paying members) to maintain current levels of production,” Scalia wrote in an op-ed for the Journal in 2000.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a veteran of that battle, lamented last night that “Trump has again chosen someone who has proven to put corporate interests over those of worker rights.” He added that “union members who believed candidate Trump when he campaigned as pro-worker should feel betrayed.”

The younger Scalia, who graduated from the University of Chicago Law School and studied at the University of Virginia as an undergraduate, also worked as a special assistant to Bill Barr during his previous tour of duty as attorney general under George H.W. Bush. And he wrote speeches for Ronald Reagan’s education secretary William Bennett.

-- Meanwhile, Trump’s pending nominee for secretary of defense, Army Secretary Mark Esper, spent years as a top lobbyist for Raytheon, which received $18.1 billion in unclassified defense contracts last year. He was elevated to acting secretary last month after Patrick Shanahan, a former top Boeing executive, withdrew after details emerged about a contentious divorce, including an incident in which his son attacked his ex-wife with a baseball bat.

At his confirmation hearing this week before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Esper declined to extend a 24-month ethics commitment he signed upon joining the administration in 2017. That means that, after November, he will no longer need to steer clear of decisions involving Raytheon. Esper also declined to commit to not working for a private defense company for the four years after he leaves the Pentagon. (The Center for Responsive Politics has a lengthy list of lobbyists who got sub-Cabinet jobs in the Trump administration.)

-- There are daily proof points that the former lobbyists in the administration are advancing Trump’s quest to eviscerate the administrative state. Just last night, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency quietly rejected a petition by environmental and public health groups to ban a widely used pesticide that has been linked to neurological damage in children, even though a federal court said last year there was “no justification” for such a decision.

“The Obama administration had proposed in 2015 to revoke all uses of chlorpyrifos after EPA scientists determined that existing evidence did not meet the agency’s threshold of a ‘reasonable certainty of no harm,’ given exposure levels in Americans’ food supply and drinking water,” Brady Dennis and Juliet Eilperin report. “EPA staffers cited studies of families exposed to it in apartment buildings and agricultural communities that found lower birth weight and reduced IQ, among other effects. But before the ban was finalized, in March 2017, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt rejected the agency’s own analysis, saying the agency would reassess the science underpinning that decision. … That action, welcomed by the pesticide industry and Agriculture Department officials who had questioned the EPA’s findings, led to the latest court fight.”

-- Part of the battle to deconstruct the administrative state is a war of attrition. Two research agencies at the Agriculture Department are uprooting from D.C. to Kansas City this fall, for instance, but many staffers have decided to give up their jobs rather than move, prompting concerns of hollowed-out offices unable to adequately fund or inform agricultural science. “About two-thirds of the USDA employees declined their reassignments,” Ben Guarino reports. “Ninety-nine of 171 employees at the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency, will not move. At the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio in scientific funding, 151 of 224 employees declined to relocate. … Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, warned that the hemorrhage of employees will devastate ERS and NIFA. ‘This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,’ Payne said.”

-- The Trump administration has been chipping away at post-9/11 programs designed to prevent terrorism in the United States. A new Los Angeles Times investigation found that multiple programs under the Department of Homeland Security, aimed at detecting and preventing terrorism, have been cut back or dismantled entirely without rigorous risk assessments.

-- As a result of retirements and a federal hiring freeze, the number of compliance safety and health officers tasked with conducting workplace inspections at OSHA – which is part of the Labor Department – has been falling since Trump took office, despite public pledges from Acosta that he’d boost the number of such officers on the beat.

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris speak simultaneously during the Democratic primary debate in Miami on June 27. (Wilfredo Lee/AP)

-- Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will face off again in the next two-night debate at the end of July, while the ideologically aligned Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren will appear together the other night. CNN, which is hosting the debate, held a televised, live drawing last night to determine the lineups. Joining Sanders and Warren on the first night, July 30, will be Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Steve Bullock, Tim Ryan, John Hickenlooper, John Delaney and Marianne Williamson. The next night, July 31, with Biden and Harris, will be Julián Castro, Andrew Yang, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bill de Blasio, Michael Bennet, Tulsi Gabbard and Jay Inslee.

“The Democratic field is the most diverse ever and yet all five minority candidates ended up on the same night,” Colby Itkowitz notes. “Who is matched with whom can shift the trajectory of the race, as Harris showed in the first debate when she went after Biden on the issue of busing. The aftershocks of that moment were felt for days later, culminating in Biden giving a major speech defending his civil rights record. A rematch gives Harris another shot to handicap Biden, while Biden gets an opportunity for a do-over after his fumbling performance last time. … For socialist democrat Sanders and capitalist Warren, who are vying for many of the same far-left voters, their matchup allows them the chance to differentiate. It also denies Sanders a chance to go after Biden, whom he competes with for the populist and working-class vote. In the past week, Sanders has targeted Biden for not embracing Medicare-for-all, providing a preview of how hard he planned to go after Biden if given the opportunity.”

-- The debate in Detroit could be a season finale for as many as half the candidates who have made the stage, as they struggle to meet the higher qualification requirements that will go into effect for later televised gatherings. (Annie Linskey and Michael Scherer)

-- Unionized campaign organizers working for Sanders are clashing with the campaign manager, according to internal communications leaked to Sean Sullivan: “Campaign field hires have demanded an annual salary they say would be equivalent to a $15-an-hour wage, which Sanders for years has said should be the federal minimum. The organizers and other employees supporting them have invoked the senator’s words and principles in making their case to campaign manager Faiz Shakir. A review of emails, instant messages and other documents obtained by The Post show that the conflict dates back to at least May and remains unresolved. … The Sanders campaign made history in March when it announced that all employees below the rank of deputy director would be represented by a union. The Warren and Castro campaigns followed suit.”

The Sanders campaign responds that it’s offering wages and benefits competitive with other campaigns, pointing to the latest fundraising reports. “Bernie Sanders is the most pro-worker and pro-labor candidate running for president,” Shakir emails. “Bernie and I both strongly believe in the sanctity of the collective bargaining process and we will not deviate from our commitment to it.”

-- A new Pew poll finds that Democratic voters are relatively satisfied with their choices for president. The level of excitement is comparable to 2008 and significantly higher than in 2016.

A U.S. naval ship downed an Iranian drone that flew too close and ignored multiple calls to turn away. Speaking at the White House, Trump said the drone came within 1,000 yards of the USS Boxer in the Strait of Hormuz before the crew “took defensive action” and “immediately destroyed” it, per Dan Lamothe and Liz Sly. In New York, meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that if Congress lifts sanctions against the country, Tehran will commit firmly to allowing international inspections of its nuclear program, per Carol Morello. An alleged Islamic State fighter and American citizen has returned to the United States, transported by the U.S. military to face terrorism-related charges. He was previously held by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, which has custody of more than 2,000 foreign Islamic State fighters. (CNN) Millions of opioid pills found their way to the remote city of Norton in southwestern Virginia’s coal country. Over the course of seven years, from 2006 through 2012, the local Walmart received more than 3.5 million opioids. The CVS received more than 1.3 million. Those numbers come from a Washington Post analysis of a newly released Drug Enforcement Administration database that shows that the pharmaceutical industry pumped out 76 billion pills over that seven-year period. (Joel Achenbach) The New Jersey judge who said a 16-year-old boy accused of sexual assault should not be tried as an adult because he came from a “good family” resigned under pressure.

DIVIDED AMERICA:

-- The newest rallying cry for Trump supporters — “Send her back!” — is reverberating across a divided nation fraught with racial tension. We deployed reporters in 10 states to collect reactions from voters to the president’s racist tweets and the chants from an almost entirely white crowd at his rally in North Carolina. Toluse Olorunnipa weaves the choice quotes together to paint a portrait of an America riven by racial discord:

“Mary Thomas, who works at a restaurant near Wayne State University in Detroit, says the country’s racial climate is the worst she’s seen in her 60 years — a period that includes Detroit’s 1967 race riots when the National Guard was deployed. Thomas, who is black, blames Trump. ‘I think he’s racist,’ she said. ‘I really think he is.’

“Dan Wendel, a Boston contractor, had a different view about Trump’s attacks on Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and three other congresswomen. ‘You really want to know? I love it!’ he said outside a building he was working on in Southie, a gentrifying working-class neighborhood of Boston. A 10-minute drive from Southie, in the racially mixed neighborhood of Dorchester, Trish Mullen said she has never felt as unsafe as she does with Trump as president. ‘It’s just embarrassing that we have someone representing our country that’s just foul,’ said Mullen, who came to the United States from the Philippines when she was 5.

“In Baton Rouge, Tammy Harrison said Trump’s comments were being exaggerated by the media. The 60-year-old Republican said she agreed with the president’s comments. … In Harrison’s view, Trump’s remarks targeting the four congresswomen were about ideology, not race.

“In Colorado, Diana Higuera said the chants that emanated from the North Carolina rally reminded her of the fraught political situations in country she left to come to the United States. ‘The situation in my country right now is not in good shape, and now I’m not so sure how safe this country is becoming,’ said Higuera, 47, who came to the United States in 2005 from Venezuela to study for a master’s degree. ‘As a foreigner, now I don’t feel safe — even though I’m naturalized — I still have an accent, and I speak Spanish to my kids.’

“Robert Hall, 33, who designs Blackfeet language curriculum for schools on the nation’s reservation in northwestern Montana, said he was entirely unsurprised by way the crowd responded at the rally. ‘We know it’s racism,’ Hall said. ‘To me it’s baffling. I don’t understand why racist people don’t just look us in the eye and say, ‘Yes, I’m racist.’ Liberate yourselves, then we can have an honest conversation.’”

-- More coverage:

-- Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who was at the rally, defended the president. He said he had no control over the crowd and likened it to a rock concert. (Felicia Sonmez, Rachael Bade and Seung Min Kim)

-- The Marine Corps confronted Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) over his use of its official emblem and slogan in a mailer that targeted three Muslim officials. Through a cease-and-desist letter to Hunter, the Marine Corps demanded that he no longer use its official emblem nor the motto “No better friend, no worse enemy” in campaign ads. The advertisement included photographs of Omar (D-Minn.), Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ammar Campa-Najjar, who is challenging Hunter for his seat. (NBC News)

-- ESPN’s Dan Le Batard, ripping Trump, derided his network’s no-politics policy: “There’s a racial division in this country that’s being instigated by the president, and we here at ESPN haven’t had the stomach for that fight,” Le Batard said Thursday on his daily radio show. (Des Bieler)

-- The Philadelphia Police Department will fire 13 officers who paired endorsements of violence with racism and homophobia in a slew of derogatory Facebook posts unearthed by an advocacy group. Reis Thebault reports: “The officers, one of whom was a sergeant, were among the 72 removed from street duty and placed on administrative leave in June, when the department announced its sweeping investigation into social media activity published by the nonprofit Plain View Project. The group examined Facebook pages of 3,500 current and former officers at eight departments across the country, and its findings spurred internal investigations from Phoenix to Lake County, Fla. In Philadelphia, the Plain View Project identified some 3,100 offensive or potentially offensive posts from 328 active-duty police officers. Of that number, the most offensive were placed on leave while a department-hired law firm probed the matter, Commissioner Richard Ross said at a news conference. In addition to the officers that will be dismissed, four others will be suspended for a month.”

-- Trump has helped to unite House Democrats, who are moving to quiet the searing internal feud that threatened to spin out of control last week — starting with the deletion of explosive tweets that helped spark the infighting. “The detente is expected to continue next week, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tentatively scheduled to meet Thursday with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.),” Mike DeBonis reports. “The leaders of the House Democratic Caucus and three ideological subcaucuses — the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the New Democrat Coalition and the Blue Dog Coalition — issued a joint statement Thursday calling their united ranks a ‘diverse, robust and passionate family’ that is ‘dedicated to making life better for everyday Americans.’” A House Democratic aide calls it a “collective de-escalation.”

TRUMP’S CREDIBILITY CHASM:

-- Newly unsealed court documents show that Trump communicated repeatedly with his lawyer Michael Cohen amid the election year scramble to keep quiet allegations that Trump previously had an affair with an adult-film actress. Devlin Barrett, Rosalind S. Helderman and Tom Hamburger report: “The documents were released … at the direction of a federal judge in New York, who disclosed a day before that an investigation into suspected campaign finance violations had ended. Trump and those close to him long said they were unaware that Cohen had bought the women’s silence, but phone calls and text messages documented by the FBI suggest they were closely involved. Prosecutors submitted a search warrant from 2018, with newly unredacted sections describing the FBI’s investigation into payments Cohen arranged to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump: the porn star Stormy Daniels and a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal. …

“When Hope Hicks testified before the House Judiciary Committee last month, she said she was ‘never present’ at a time when Cohen and Trump discussed Daniels. … The House Judiciary Committee is investigating whether Hicks lied to Congress, according to an official with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. The committee’s chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) wrote to Hicks late Thursday demanding that she appear again to clarify the discrepancies between her prior testimony and what was unsealed earlier in the day. A lawyer for Hicks declined to comment. … Four days before the search warrants were executed, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he had been unaware of the payments. … During congressional testimony in February, Cohen released copies of checks he received to reimburse him for the payment, including a check signed by Trump while he was serving as president.”

-- House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said the documents prove definitively that “Trump was intimately involved in devising and executing a corrupt scheme to prevent his affair … from being revealed in the final weeks of the 2016 election.”

-- Cohen issued a statement from prison, where he’s serving a three-year term after pleading guilty to arranging the illegal payments at Trump’s direction: “I and members of The Trump Organization were directed by Mr. Trump to handle the Stormy Daniels matter; including making the hush money payment.” He added that the investigation ending without charges for those at Trump’s business “should be of great concern to the American people and investigated by Congress and The Department of Justice.”

-- The president’s current lawyer Jay Sekulow had little to say. He sent a terse, two-word statement: “Case closed.”

-- Read the 269 pages of search warrants for yourself.

-- Looking to Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers hope to use former special counsel Bob Mueller’s public testimony to revisit dramatic episodes in which Trump attempted to derail or interfere with the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. (Helderman and Hamburger explore the strategy.)

THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- “A Spanish-language journalist covered ICE detention. Then he lived through it,” by Marisa Iati: “There were bugs, and the showers were cold. Air conditioning was not available, but the heat was turned on inexplicably. If you didn’t have family in the United States to send money for food, you would go hungry. Those are just some of the conditions Manuel Duran described after he was released from a U.S. immigration detention center. As a journalist in Memphis, Duran had been reporting on immigration enforcement officials and sordid conditions for more than a decade by the time they took him into custody last year.

“Duran, a native of El Salvador, had been working for the Spanish-language news outlet Memphis Noticias. On April 3, 2018, Duran was reporting on a demonstration against local police helping Immigration and Customs Enforcement when Memphis police arrested him while they were trying to clear people from the street. Instead of releasing Duran from jail, his attorneys said he was turned over to ICE and brought on an eight-hour bus ride to the LaSalle detention center in Jena, La. — without access to a bathroom and with his wrists, ankles and waist in shackles.

“Migrants did not get enough food at any of the four facilities where Duran was held, he said. … They had to buy rations with money sent by their families, and if they didn’t have relatives in the United States, the migrants would go hungry. The holding facilities were infested with cockroaches and spiders, Duran said. At Etowah County Detention Center in Alabama, he said he had to bathe with cold water from hoses for two months. The air conditioner was being repaired for most of the spring, Duran said, and the heat was turned on at one point for no clear reason, making it difficult for the migrants to sleep.”

-- While an undocumented Guatemalan woman waited to see her 12-year-old son in U.S. custody, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent allegedly asked her to watch a live video of him masturbating. Abigail Hauslohner and Maria Sacchetti report: “‘I felt like the world was falling on top of me,’ said the 48-year-old woman, an undocumented immigrant who came to the country from Guatemala and now lives in California. She spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution from the agent and other immigration authorities. ‘I felt my son is in the hands of a bad man.’”

-- After losing her mother and grandparents in Honduras, 13-year-old Heydi Gámez García waited and waited for her father to join her in America. But by the time her father was granted two-week parole from an ICE detention center, his daughter was in a hospital bed, brain-dead from a suicide attempt. The New York Times reports: “Heydi’s short life story is much like those of thousands of Central American families who have been making their way to the United States over the past five years, petitioning for asylum from the turmoil of their homelands and hoping that the challenges of building a new life in an unfamiliar country will not be greater than the ones they left behind.”

-- “The Trump administration is considering a virtual shutdown of refugee admissions next year — cutting the number to nearly zero — according to three people familiar with the plan,"" Politico reports.

-- Severe dehydration is devastating migrants in South Texas. The Texas Tribune reports that the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley Sector has encountered 64 migrants with rhabdomyolysis this year — a condition that can break down muscle tissue and lead to renal failure. Last year, the same sector encountered half as many cases as rhabdomyolysis, and there are over two months left in the period. “Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Rodolfo Karisch said agents in his sector, who spend about 60% of their time on humanitarian response duties — as opposed to border enforcement — are taking about 30 migrants per day to the emergency room. He has also set aside one of his Border Patrol stations — in Weslaco — as an infirmary where patients can be quarantined,” the Tribune reports.

-- The Lord’s Prayer filled the marble dome of the Russell Senate Office Building on Thursday as 70 Catholic sisters, clergy and parishioners were led away in handcuffs. “Forgive us our trespasses,” the demonstrators recited, “as we forgive those who trespass against us.” On a “Catholic Day of Action,” hundreds of Catholics gathered outside the Capitol to protest Trump’s treatment of migrants.

"Trump approval rating jumps, just shy of locking in reelection",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/trump-approval-rating-jumps-just-shy-of-locking-in-reelection,"President Trump’s approval rating has been improving and now is at his all-time high and just a few points shy of what’s needed to guarantee him a second term.

In the latest SurveyMonkey/NBC poll out Friday, Trump is at 48% and he reached 49% in a daily YouGov.com poll this month.

And while both polls of registered voters are at or near the highs of is presidency, polling experts said that Trump is actually a bit higher in the polls of likely voters.

“Although almost all the media polls are conducted among adults or registered voters, President Trump does better usually among LIKELY VOTERS — people who actually vote,” said the Trump campaign pollster John McLaughlin.

This YouGov poll from this month was his best since Feb. 28, 2017

Moving to and past 50% is key because presidents at that level typically win reelection.

“Our opposition knows that if the president crosses 51% in his job approval he’s very likely to be re-elected. In 2004 on Election Day George W. Bush had a 51% job approval. He was reelected with 51%. In 2012 on Election Day President Obama had a 51% job approval. He was re-elected with 51%,” said McLaughlin.

He and others said that Trump’s slow rise in approvals is why the Democrats are working overtime to stop the White House agenda.

“President Trump receiving 51% job approval or higher in these media polls will freak out the already deranged Democrats. It’s why they have consistently opposed every positive piece of legislation the president has proposed,” McLaughlin told Secrets.

“However, the majority of voters are seeing through their hyper-partisan attacks. As the president’s policies succeed keeping America strong and prosperous, expect his job approval to keep rising,” he added."

Rosen, center, flanked by Hugh Hurwitz, left, the acting director of the Bureau of Prisons, and David Muhlhausen, director of the National Institute of Justice, speaks during a news conference at the Justice Department on Friday. (Susan Walsh/AP)

Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen had calmly fended off more than a dozen questions — some of them about the criminal justice reform legislation he had planned to discuss, others on various controversies of the day — and begun to walk away from the stage. His first news conference as the Justice Department’s No. 2 official was nearly behind him.

Then a Fox News reporter asked how he felt about the House of Representatives’ vote this week to hold Rosen’s boss, Attorney General William P. Barr, in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena related to the administration’s failed effort to include a question about citizenship on the 2020 Census.

Rosen returned to the lectern.

“We’re talking about what is, unfortunately, the crassest form of political theater, and from where I stand, I’m deeply disappointed that the House leadership would proceed in that way, with something that is so obviously beneath the dignity of the offices they hold,” Rosen said. “It’s really a new low for the current House of Representatives.”

The forceful comments were notable for an understated official who — since being confirmed to his post in May — has largely steered clear of the political drama that seems to constantly envelop the department. Throughout the news conference, Rosen had assiduously avoided saying anything revelatory on topics other than the one he was there to discuss: implementation of the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill.

But on contempt, he leaned in.

“It’s not too late to reverse course,” he said. “The House of Representatives could reconsider, revoke its action and apologize to the attorney general, and that’s what they should do.”

[3,100 inmates to be released as Trump administration implements criminal justice reform]

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the chair of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement: “Subpoenas are not optional. The Attorney General and Commerce Secretary violated a criminal statute when they refused to comply with a bipartisan subpoena from Congress. The Oversight Committee is trying to determine how and why the Trump Administration spent more than two years trying to add a citizenship question to the census based on a false pretext. The Supreme Court ruled that this effort was illegal, and we intend to get to the bottom of what happened.”

The relationship between Congress and the Justice Department had been fractured long before Rosen stepped to the stage Friday. Lawmakers have repeatedly accused the department of supporting the Trump administration’s bid to stonewall their requests for documents.

Tensions reached a boiling point this week when the House of Representatives voted along party lines to hold Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt over the census controversy .

The vote will have little practical effect. Those found in criminal contempt are referred to the Justice Department for prosecution, and it is not likely to prosecute its own boss. But the move has nonetheless rankled department leaders, who assert they have turned over thousands of documents to lawmakers and are withholding only those deemed privileged.

[House votes to hold Attorney General Barr, Commerce Secretary Ross in contempt for failing to comply with subpoena on 2020 Census]

Rosen noted Friday that the Supreme Court already stopped the citizenship question from being added to the census, and asserted the House had no real reason to investigate further.

“We’re talking about a matter, the census, in which the Supreme Court has already ruled and we’re done,” Rosen said. “So, the House has not identified some compelling legislative need for this. To the contrary, this makes no sense at all.”

On other contentious topics, Rosen was far more circumspect.

Asked if prosecutors’ closing the investigation into former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s campaign finance violations meant that Trump had been “cleared of any wrongdoing,” Rosen responded, “The only thing I can say about that is that it was handled by experienced prosecutors who looked at the law and the facts and made their conclusions on the merits.”

Asked if he or Justice Department leadership in Washington had played a role in the prosecutors’ conclusion of the case, and whether Justice Department guidance that sitting presidents cannot be indicted had any impact, Rosen said, “I don’t have anything to add to what I just said.” The House Oversight Committee on Friday requested similar information from federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, which handled the Cohen case.

[Trump spoke repeatedly with Cohen, aides amid scramble to pay Stormy Daniels, court documents show]

Of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s testimony next week, Rosen merely pointed to what Mueller has said publicly.

“Special counsel Mueller held a news conference some weeks back where he indicated his report was his testimony, so I think it would be reasonable to assume or expect that he meant what he said,” Rosen said.

Notably, Rosen would not commit to making public the results of an internal Justice Department investigation into the handling of financier and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s 2008 plea agreement, which has come under significant scrutiny in recent weeks as Epstein has been indicted on new sex trafficking charges. “I don’t have anything I want to share on that today,” Rosen said.

The agreement allowed Epstein to plead guilty to two state charges and spend just 13 months in jail, with work release privileges. It was approved by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, who resigned as Trump’s labor secretary amid new controversy over the arrangement.

A Justice Department official said after the news conference that the results of such investigations are generally made public when they are complete, and officials did not “see any reason” that would not be the case here. Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd wrote in a letter to Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) in February that the department would share the results with him “as appropriate.”

Rosen spoke on the contempt vote for about two minutes, and then — after calling on Congress to apologize — left the stage for a second time. Again, he was tailed by a question, this one from a CNN reporter.

“Or, you could hand over documents, right?” the reporter asked.

Rosen did not respond."
Ellucian Banner security flaw highlighted by Education Department,https://www.insidehighered.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/07/19/ellucian-banner-security-flaw-highlighted-education-department,"The U.S. Department of Education has warned of “active and ongoing exploitation” of a security flaw in Ellucian’s Banner system that may have given hackers access to student data such as grades, financial information and Social Security numbers.

A security alert, published Wednesday by the department’s Office of Federal Student Aid, said 62 colleges and universities using Banner had already been targeted. The alert indicates that criminals have been “scanning the internet looking for institutions to victimize” and drawing up lists of colleges to target.

Institutions that have transitioned to Banner 9, the latest version of Ellucian’s enterprise resource planning system, are not thought to be affected. But users using older versions of two Banner modules called Web Tailor and Enterprise Identity Services could be vulnerable.

According to Ellucian’s website, more than 1,400 institutions worldwide use Banner to manage student grades, staff payrolls, course schedules, admissions and student financial aid, among other tasks. Web Tailor and Enterprise Identity Services can be used by system administrators to get access to sensitive data protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

The student aid office encouraged institutions that have not recently upgraded Web Tailor or Enterprise Identity Services to do so and to contact the FSA incident team to determine whether there has been a data breach. Ellucian published a patch on May 14 that fixed the security flaw but has not shared how many institutions have installed it.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology described the Banner security flaw as an “improper authentication vulnerability” that enabled attackers to take over users' sessions when they attempted to log in. Depending on the administrative privileges of the user, and the way data are organized by individual institutions, attackers could use this access to move laterally through administrative systems and access sensitive information. Attackers could also potentially manipulate this information, perhaps changing personal information or grades, dropping students from their courses or denying them student financial aid.

According to FSA, affected institutions reported that attackers used the security flaw to manipulate admissions and enrollment systems and create thousands of fake student accounts over the space of a few days. “Some of these accounts appear to be leveraged almost immediately for criminal activity,” the office said.

Josh Sosnin, chief information security officer at Ellucian, said in an emailed statement that there is no connection between the security flaw and the generation of the fake student accounts. “Ellucian has confirmed internally that the two issues outlined in the Department of Education report are separate, unrelated issues,” he said. “There is no connection between these two issues and Ellucian has communicated this to the Department of Education.”

If your campus uses Banner/Ellucian as a SIS, I hope you install updates in a timely manner. So far 62 campuses have reported they were affected by exploitation of a vulnerability in the product by ""criminal elements."" Patch was released May 14. #emchat https://t.co/SwIkZvdZaN — Dr. Liz Gross (@lizgross144) July 18, 2019

Institutions being targeted by bots that submit fraudulent admissions applications are “an industry issue and not specific to Ellucian or Banner,” said Sosnin. He added that Ellucian’s customer service employees are “standing by to help” customers with questions about patches or updates.

Why the FSA office is reporting on the Banner security flaw two months after it was patched by Ellucian is unclear. It is also not clear how the flaw was discovered, though the NIST advisory links to a document suggesting that it may have been identified as early as December 2018 by Joshua Mulliken, a member of IT staff at the University of South Carolina.

In a GitHub post, Mulliken outlines a “disclosure timeline” indicating that Ellucian took several months to address his concerns. Mulliken said via email that he was the first person to identify the security flaw.

""Ellucian has not been proactive in ensuring that its customers understand the seriousness of CVE-2019-8978,"" said Mulliken. ""Several institutions have reached out to me today and informed me that the had deferred updating for some time. The official messaging was not able to convey the urgency required, which more than likely contributed to the current situation.""

Scott Shackelford, professor of law and cybersecurity program chair at Indiana University at Bloomington, said it is not uncommon for organizations to take several months to release patches addressing security issues, particularly if they “don’t think it’s particularly troublesome.”

Moving forward, Shackelford encouraged colleges and universities to pay attention when companies release updates and install them “as quickly as possible.”

“This really boils down to basic cyberhygiene,” he said. He encouraged institutions to limit the number of users with administrative privileges for Banner and other enterprise resource planning software.

Both Shackelford and Emory Roane, privacy counsel at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization that tracks data breach disclosures and advocates for consumer data protection, said it could take weeks before more information about the data breach is made public.

Depending on where institutions are located and what type of data were affected, there are different reporting requirements for disclosing breaches, said Shackelford. In Georgia, for example, there is no state-enforced timeline for reporting data breaches, he said. Roane would like to see that change -- he thinks the U.S. should move closer to Europe’s 72-hour disclosure requirement under the General Data Protection Regulation.

Without disclosures, it is difficult to determine how serious the Banner data breaches are, said Shackelford.

Charlie Moran, senior partner and CEO of Moran Technology Consulting, described the breach as “bad, but only for a small number of schools.”

Most of the 1,400 institutions using Banner have already made the transition to Banner 9 modules, said Moran. “Most schools moved to Banner 9 this past year in a forced march because of a major software change that Ellucian was forced to make, so there are not a lot of schools running this old software,” he said."
DHS warns of Russian efforts to divide America over pineapple pizza -- sort of,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-warns-russian-efforts-divide-america-pineapple-pizza/story?id=64444702,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is warning that Russian agents could seek to further divide Americans by exploiting U.S. passions over whether pineapple belongs on pizza.

Interested in Russia? Add Russia as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Russia news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

It's a cheesy, playful warning -- but it's trying to deliver a serious message. Posted online Wednesday by the department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the tongue-in-cheek warning aims to help Americans identify and protect against propaganda campaigns from Russia and other foreign adversaries.

After all, the DHS warning says, Russian agents are capable of simultaneously insisting online that ""Being anti-pineapple is un-American!"" while also pushing out posts saying ""Millennials are ruining pizza!""

""Foreign influencers are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to inflame hot button issues in the United States,"" the new DHS warning says. ""They don’t do this to win arguments; they want to see us divided.""

According to the warning, foreign interference usually follows certain patterns.

First, foreign agents identify a divisive issue to target -- though likely not an issue as silly as whether pineapple is an appropriate pizza topping.

""No matter how you slice it, Americans disagree on the fruit topping,"" the DHS document notes with a pun.

Department of Homeland Security

After targeting a controversial issue, foreign agents then make sure social media accounts are in place, often reusing or renaming accounts ""to pollute those debates with bad information and make our positions more extreme by picking fights, or 'trolling' people online,"" according to the DHS warning.

The ""most extreme version of arguments on both sides of an issue"" often then become framed ""as legitimate information sources,"" pushing them ""into the mainstream"" and carrying them to larger audiences, the DHS warning says.

The final step of foreign interference is for agents to take what started in cyberspace and turn it into something ""very real, with Americans shouting down Americans because of foreign interference,"" DHS warns.

""In the past, Kremlin agents have organized or funded protests to further stoke divisions among Americans. They create event pages and ask followers to come out,"" according to DHS.

DHS offered this example: If the ""war on pineapple"" was a more serious issue, a foreign agent might tell unwitting followers to ""JOIN YOUR FELLOW PIZZA LOVERS AT THE TOWN CENTER TO MARCH FOR PINEAPPLE!""

Nevertheless, in its warning on Wednesday, DHS made clear -- in jest -- that: ""To date, we have no evidence of Russia (or any nation) actively carrying out information operations against pizza toppings.""

Russia's wide-ranging interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, from stealing and releasing thousands of Democratic National Committee emails to waging disinformation campaigns online, has U.S. authorities bracing for what could happen in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.

Russian President Vladimir Putin not only wants to ""weaken"" the United States in the years ahead, but he also wants to keep his grip on power, according to Suzanne Spaulding, a former senior official at DHS who helped lead U.S. efforts to mitigate Russian cyber operations.

""He doesn't want [Russian citizens] to see ... the United States and liberal democracy as something they should long for. So what he wants to portray to them is democracy in chaos,"" Spaulding said Friday at the annual Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado.

And when it comes to cyber-operations against foreign adversaries, Russia ""is practicing jiu jitsu,"" trying to use the First Amendment and American free speech ""against us,"" Spaulding said.

Many USDA workers plan to quit as research agencies move to Kansas City,https://www.pressherald.com,['Email Writer'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/07/18/many-usda-workers-plan-to-quit-as-research-agencies-move-to-kansas-city/,"WASHINGTON – Two research agencies at the Agriculture Department will uproot from the District of Columbia to Kansas City in the fall. But many staffers have decided to give up their jobs rather than move, prompting concerns of hollowed-out offices unable to adequately fund or inform agricultural science.

About two-thirds of the USDA employees declined their reassignments, according to a tally the department released Tuesday. Ninety-nine of 171 employees at the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency, will not move. At the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio in scientific funding, 151 of 224 employees declined to relocate.

Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, warned that the hemorrhage of employees will devastate ERS and NIFA. “This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Payne said.

Workers who agreed to move must do so by Sept. 30, although USDA has not established permanent office space and has not said whether the agencies will be located on the Missouri or Kansas side of the Kansas City area. Workers who were asked to move but declined “will be separated by adverse action procedures,” per letters the employees received in June.

The department expects relocation numbers may “fluctuate” until the Sept. 30 cutoff, according to a statement provided by USDA. “These anticipated ranges were taken into account in the department’s long-term strategy, which includes both efforts to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA’s work.”

Tim Cowden, president of the Kansas City Area Development Council, which advocated for the relocation to Kansas City, said in a statement that “just over 36 percent of those given the option to relocate have accepted, which is very strong for any HQ relocation. We remain committed to working with all USDA employees interested in relocating to KC.”

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, D-Mo., along with Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., and Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., was an early supporter of the move to Kansas City. Cleaver said in a statement he empathized “with not wanting to uproot your family.” But if the move “has to happen,” he said, “then Kansas City is the best place in America for these agencies’ new home,” because it can “fill the void with competent and qualified individuals.”

“This kind of staff loss will completely gut the ERA and NIFA, and will ultimately prevent the USDA from conducting critical research that helps grow the food our families eat,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.) told The Washington Post.

Sonny Ramaswamy, the NIFA director from 2012 to 2018, said he was aware of $50 million in grants, slated to be distributed over the next three months, for research areas identified as priorities in the 2018 farm bill. Those grants would have funded studies into subjects as diverse as disease-resistant cotton in Mississippi and hail-damaged corn in Nebraska.

Now, that science is “not going to happen,” Ramaswamy said, because the planned move has disrupted the agency. A senior NIFA scientist familiar with the grants, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, confirmed that these grants are on hold and in danger of never being distributed.

NIFA, when fully staffed, employs about 400 people. As it becomes more diminished, the agency’s ability to review grant proposals, manage awards or hold grant recipients accountable is threatened, Ramaswamy said. He predicted tens of millions of dollars in grant funding will be in jeopardy. Most money earmarked for NIFA grants, if unspent, returns to the Treasury Department.

Katherine Smith Evans, the ERS administrator from 2007 to 2011, reviewed a list of employees who are leaving. Four of five economists working on bees and pollination at ERS have left or will leave, she said. Ten of 12 economists working on trade and international development have retired, already left or plan to do so. None of the farm finance and tax experts will remain with the agency. “I agree with people who say it will take 10 years to recover,” Smith Evans said.

Gale Buchanan, the USDA chief scientist and undersecretary for research, education and economics in the George W. Bush administration, said employees face “an almost impossible task” by trying to do their jobs with reduced numbers.

The decision process, he said, has been flawed. “I could live by whatever blue-ribbon committee recommended to do to address some of the concerns the secretary had,” Buchanan said. But, he added, “you don’t just pull an idea out of the air and, for some political reason, make a decision.”

The agencies were understaffed even before Tuesday’s tally of those who will not relocate. Employees at the agencies quit in large numbers before the department issued reassignment letters. In early June, vacancy rates at the agencies were around 20% to 25%.

“Both agencies already have experienced significant losses of skilled personnel, beginning back when the proposed move was announced,” Payne said. “The percentage of employees moving is even smaller when the denominator is the full staff level.” During fiscal year 2018, ERS had 320 employees. Unless a wave of new hires fills the deserted desks, by this fall, ERS will be half the size it was two years ago.

When Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the relocation in August, he said it would “provide more streamlined and efficient services.” A cost-benefit analysis released by the department in June suggests moving to Kansas City will save up to $300 million over 15 years.

An organization of economists, the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, disputed the projected savings; the move may cost taxpayers money, the group said, because the analysis overestimated the expense of retaining the agencies in the capital and did not calculate the value of lost research."
"For 50 Years Since Apollo 11, Presidents Have Tried to Take That Next Giant Leap",https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/us/politics/apollo-11-anniversary-presidents.html,"WASHINGTON — At his star-spangled Independence Day extravaganza this month, President Trump singled out Gene Kranz, the legendary Apollo flight director. “Gene,” the president said, “I want you to know that we’re going to be back on the moon very soon — and someday soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars.”

What could be more American than vowing to go to the moon and beyond on the Fourth of July? For Mr. Trump, it was a chance to channel his inner John F. Kennedy, who first made the moon the nation’s goal — to make the sort of bold promise that appeals to his own sense of greatness and to wrap himself in a part of Americana akin to baseball and apple pie.

But Mr. Trump is the 10th president since Kennedy to put his stamp on the space program and the latest to aim for the stars with more brio than blueprint. After the Apollo program ended, other presidents promised to go back to the moon — or send humans to Mars or even land astronauts on asteroids. None did, unwilling or unable to obtain the financing necessary, and it remains uncertain whether Mr. Trump will, either.

As the nation on Saturday celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, the story of presidents and space exploration in the subsequent five decades is one of fascination, frustration and futility, an unrequited romance as star-struck chief executives dreamed of recapturing the magic of Kennedy’s moonshot without summoning the resources or the national will that made it possible in 1969, almost six years after his death."
Pentagon contractor threatened to murder Rep. Frederica Wilson over vaccine bill: DOJ,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/19/pentagon-contractor-threatened-to-murder-rep-frederica-wilson-over-vaccine-bill-doj/,"An anti-vaxxer from Maryland who works as a cybersecurity contractor for the Department of Defense was charged this week for “threatening to murder” Florida Congresswoman Frederica Wilson — after she introduced a bill requiring all public schools to vaccinate their students in exchange for federal funding.

Darryl Varnum, 42, of Westminster, allegedly left a voicemail with Wilson’s office, which included the “violent threats,” according to DOJ officials.

Wilson’s name is not actually listed in the criminal complaint — only “Person #1” — but sources tell the Daily Beast that she is the individual authorities are referring to.

“I will f—ing come down and kill your f—ing ass,” Varnum allegedly said on his voicemail.

“And you’re a congressperson,” he added, according to the Daily Beast. “That is fine. I hope the f—ing FBI, CIA and everybody else hears this shit.”

Varnum, at one point, told Rep. Wilson to “get the f–k out” of the Unites States — saying this is “America.”

“I’ll tell you what I’ll come down to Miami bitch. I’ll f–k you up,” he allegedly told the Democratic lawmaker. “Like the Cubans don’t even know.”

Varnum’s temper tantrum reportedly stemmed from Wilson’s introduction of The Vaccinate All Children Act, which would require all public schools to vaccinate their students in order to get federal funding.

The Pentagon contractor has been vocal in the past about his anti-vaxxer beliefs — posting regularly on Facebook.

“Holocaust has begun!” he said in June after Wilson introduced the All Children legislation. “I’m done with this bulls–t. Time to step up or ship out!”

Varnum later commented on the post, telling users: “All of our guns are next. Been trying for years!”

He followed up the message with another FB status a minute later, saying: “WAKE UP AMERICA!”

“Wake up in prison,” a user replied Thursday, calling Varnum a “weirdo.”

The senior cyber systems engineer is employed by Sealing Technologies Inc., according to his LinkedIn page. Federal officials said he’s “currently working at the Defense Information Systems Agency Headquarters.”

Varnum was indicted this week after being arrested on July 8. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, if convicted."
The Energy 202: EPA's new 'no surprises' inspection policy has some critics worried,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy', 'July At Am']",07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-energy-202-epas-new-no-surprises-inspection-policy-has-some-critics-worried/2019/07/19/8b404945-e507-484a-b311-bb59ba661e4d_story.html,"THE LIGHTBULB

Environmental Protection Agency at its Washington headquarters. (Reuters/Ting Shen)

The Environmental Protection Agency will no longer have inspectors drop by power plants and other potential illegal polluters without giving states notice, a move Trump administration critics say will limit the agency's ability to enforce environmental laws.

A July 11 memo from Susan Bodine, the EPA's top enforcement official, to regional administrators spelled out the agency's new “no surprises” policy as an effort to better cooperate with state and local regulators.

“With increased EPA cooperation and transparency, the EPA expects the states to respond in kind,” Bodine writes.

The memo is the latest move by President Trump's environmental deputies to vest more power in the states when it comes to ensuring companies are following the nation's clean air and water laws. But the administration's critics say the EPA is helping polluters by deferring to state regulators, who often tread more lightly when dealing with local employers.

Under the new policy, the agency will provide states “with advance notice of inspections” and “will generally defer to a state as the primary implementer of inspections and enforcement.” Bodine also asked regional offices to avoid inspections that overlap with ones states have already conducted within a 12-month time period, though the EPA said in an emailed statement that multiple inspections during that timeframe are not entirely prohibited.

“Taking the element of surprise away from inspections decreases their effectiveness, for obvious reasons,” Tim Whitehouse, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and a former EPA enforcement attorney, said in a statement. “I fear that EPA’s 'no surprises' posture masks a ‘see no evil’ approach to corporate polluters.”

The new policy, however, does not close the door on whether inspections will be a surprise for the companies themselves. But Whitehouse worries state regulators could tip off companies about ones that are coming.

“Some states are more cooperative with industry, do not conduct or want surprise inspections in their states, or have used EPA' s possible surprise inspections as a hammer,” Whitehouse said. “Some states do discourage EPA inspections and the possibility that facilities will be notified is a real concern.”

In an emailed statement, however, the EPA countered that it anticipated ""any disagreements with respect to giving advance notice to a facility would be worked out"" between federal and state regulators.

Trump officials have defended the agency's approach to law enforcement even as its enforcement numbers have dropped since the president took office. The number of civil cases started and completed in 2018 hit a 10-year low while the amount of money sought through civil penalties plummeted to the lowest average level since 1994 during the past fiscal year.

Testifying before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February, Bodine said the agency has reduced the need for as many annual inspections by becoming better at finding instances of noncompliance.

“Some are judging our work on a narrow set of parameters and then drawing the conclusion that EPA is somehow soft on environmental violators, that the EPA doesn’t care about compliance with the law,” Bodine told lawmakers. “I’m here to tell you that is absolutely not true.""

— EPA won’t ban use of a controversial pesticide: The agency dismissed a petition by environmental and public health groups to prohibit chlorpyrifos, a pesticide that has been linked to neurological damage in children. The agency questioned data pointing to health problems in children and said the Obama-era ban was based on “epidemiological studies rather than direct tests on animals, which have historically been used by the EPA to determine a pesticide’s safety,” The Post’s Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis report.

“This is the entry ticket into the actual main event”: “Still, the decision to deny the petition could bring the country closer to final resolution of a decades-long battle over a pesticide used on fruits, vegetables and cereals that Americans eat every day. Kevin Minoli, a partner at the Alston & Bird law firm, said agency critics can now challenge the EPA’s conclusion that the pesticide is safe.”

— Big climate moves in New York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has signed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, an ambitious climate plan mandating that the state eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “To deny climate change is to deny reality,” Cuomo said before signing the bill, the Democrat & Chronicle reports. “All credible scientists agree.” In a statement, NY Renews, the coalition of environmental, justice, faith, labor and community groups that backed the measure, called it a “nation-leading law, but we can and must do more to decarbonize our economy, make sure green jobs are good jobs, and invest in communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis. The fight for true climate justice demands transformative change, and we will bring that fight until we build a just, renewable economy that works for all.”

Winding up: The state said it has reached an agreement to award two contracts for wind farm projects off the cost of Long Island that are set to be the largest in the country. It’s part of the state’s aim to reach 70 percent renewable energy in just over a decade. “They will have the capacity to produce 1,700 megawatts of electricity and will account for about 20 percent of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s overall goal for offshore wind, an energy source that has been slow to take off in the United States,” the New York Times reports. In a statement, the Democratic governor said the projects will help New York “lead the way in developing the largest source of offshore wind power in the nation.”

— Rob Bishop now says he may not retire: The Utah congressman and top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee signaled he’s reconsidering his decision to retire, but won’t announce a decision until the end of the month. “The surprise reconsideration comes after Bishop said he was approached by a number of people to stay on, with reasons he said made sense,” the Deseret News reports. “Internally, I want to do what I think is the right thing for the state of Utah. I don’t want people to think I am reconsidering because I have an ego and I think I am indispensable,” he said.

— “This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies”: That’s what Jack Payne, the University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, told The Post’s Ben Guarino could be the upshot from the exodus of employees from two research agencies at the Agriculture Department. Rather than accept the transfer from Washington to Kansas City, about two-thirds of USDA's workforce decided to forfeit their jobs. Gale Buchanan, who was the department’s chief scientist and undersecretary for research, education and economics during the George W. Bush administration, told Ben the agencies’ employees face “an almost impossible task” with the dwindling numbers.

What lawmakers are saying: During a hearing before the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Democratic lawmakers challenged the USDA over the relocation. “It is still unclear to me what problem the USDA is trying to solve with this move,” said Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), the committee’s top Democrat, according to The Hill. Some Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, praised the decision. “It makes sense to be in the middle of where the breadbasket is. And when it comes to the talent pool I’ve got to believe there is more of it in the universities that specialize in ag in that area as well,” Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said.

— Another coal plant shutters: A federal judge has signed off on the closure of one of two units at the Rockport coal plant in southern Indiana. American Electric Power agreed to close the unit by 2028, a move that “represents another significant step in AEP's ongoing shift away from coal-fired power. The utility, which serves 5.4 million people in 11 states, will have retired more than 9,700 MW of coal-fueled generation between 2011 and the end of 2020,” E&E News reports.

The reaction: The Sierra Club welcomed the closure, which it hailed as the “single largest power plant closure since the group launched its Beyond Coal campaign to force the shutdown of coal-fired power plants.” Meanwhile, the EPA sent out a press release making clear it ""did not seek retirement of any of AEP’s facilities.""

THERMOMETER

— Man, it’s a hot one: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed that last month saw an average temperature of 60.6 degrees, reaching the planet’s hottest June on record, the Associated Press reports: “Europe shattered June temperature records by far, while other records were set in Russia, Africa, Asia and South America. France had its hottest month in history, which is unusual because July is traditionally hotter than June. The Lower 48 states in America were near normal.” “Earth is running a fever that won’t break thanks to climate change,” North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello told the AP. “This won’t be the last record warm summer month that we will see.”

— There’s been an unusual spike in Arctic blazes: A fire was detected in the Sisimiut community in southwest Greenland, and may have ended between Sunday and Wednesday, The Post’s Andrew Freedman reports. “It comes amid an unusually warm and dry stretch in the area, with melting on the vast Greenland ice sheet commencing a month earlier than average,” he adds. While there’s no reliable long-term data on Greenland wildfires, in part because satellite detection is a recent development, Freedman adds the blaze “fits a broader pattern that is raising alarms in the climate science community. According to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), the European science organization tracked more than 100 ‘intense and long-lived wildfires’ above the Arctic Circle since June. Calculations show these fires emitted enough carbon dioxide to be the equivalent of Sweden’s total annual emissions.”

Feds Say Former VA Employee Used Vets’ Ailing Kids to Scam Millions,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Lachlan Markay', 'Seamus Hughes']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/feds-say-former-va-employee-used-vets-ailing-kids-to-scam-millions?source=politics&via=rss,"A Department of Veterans Affairs employee used a network of shell companies to steal millions of dollars from a VA program to provide health services to children of veterans who are suffering from a debilitating spinal condition, federal prosecutors say.

The Justice Department lodged 23 federal criminal charges late last year against Joseph Prince, a former Veterans Affairs employee who prosecutors say used his position to steer almost $20 million in taxpayer money to companies run by family members and associates. Those companies then provided huge kickbacks to Prince, his wife, and other family members, the government alleges.

The previously unreported criminal case appears set to go to trial in Colorado in November. Prince has pleaded not guilty. An alleged co-conspirator, Roland Vaughn, initially did the same, but recent federal court filings indicate he is set to change that plea to guilty at a hearing early next month. Neither of their attorneys responded to requests for comment on the case.

Before he was fired late last year, Prince worked at a VA facility in Denver, where he oversaw a program that provides health benefits to the families of Vietnam and Korean War veterans with children who suffer from spina bifida, a debilitating spinal birth defect. Part of Prince’s job entailed counseling those families about the treatment options available to them through the VA. Prosecutors say he exploited that position of trust to steer patients to seven different home health agencies that subsequently kicked back money to Prince and his family.

The scale of the alleged fraud was extraordinary, according to data filed by federal prosecutors in search warrant affidavits. Of the $25.2 million the VA paid to home health agencies through the spina bifida program from June 2017 through June 2018, $18.9 million, or 75 percent, was paid to the seven companies implicated in the indictment against Prince.

Prince’s alleged scheme involved selling VA patients on home health services offered through the department’s spina bifida program. Certain services can be performed by family members and others without medical training provided they register with the VA ahead of time. Those services include basic assistance with daily tasks such as meal preparation and home care, but home providers can also be certified by medical professionals to help with bladder and bowel care often required for spina bifida patients. They can then submit invoices for services provided for reimbursement at a preset hourly rate.

According to the indictment, Prince sold patients on the benefits of doing that home health work themselves and recouping the hourly payments that the VA provided. He even allegedly encouraged them to falsely inflate the number of hours they worked, and falsely told some that there were minimum hourly billing requirements.

Prince then referred the patients to one of seven home health companies, assuring them that the companies could secure them the best reimbursement rates and assist with VA red tape. One of those companies was run by Prince’s wife. Others had reached pre-arranged deals with Prince under which he would steer them VA patients in exchange for referral fees. In many cases, Prince even sent patients prepopulated VA forms with his preferred home health agency.

Prince vouched for the companies’ track records even though, according to prosecutors, none were run by medical professionals. He used terms like “preferred,” “handpicked,” and “vetted,” and promised that the companies would assist with the red tape and would take the smaller fees than their competitors off of VA reimbursement checks.

In fact, the companies were taking huge premiums—paying home health caregivers between $16 and $20 per hour while filing for VA reimbursement at hourly rates between $86 and $141.

When patients found out about that discrepancy, they were livid. After receiving a regular statement of benefits from the VA, one beneficiary referred to a Prince-affiliated agency wrote to Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI) in April 2018. “Our daughter is in the Spina Bifida Program,” the unnamed parent wrote, according to documents filed in court. “The program has a provision to provide health care for her at home for the rest of her life. We were told that we would be paid for this. We signed a contract with a company that would take care of getting us paid, but they didn’t tell us that they got to keep 82% and pay us 18% for doing all the work. This is highway robbery.”

The scheme was extremely lucrative for both Prince and the home health agencies with which he worked. Prosecutors say his wife’s Advantage Home Health Agency alone received more than $4.3 million in VA payments as part of its work for the spina bifida program. Three agencies owned by Prince’s half-sister received more than $7.1 million.

Together, all seven agencies kicked back roughly $1.5 million to Prince individually, according to the indictment, and hundreds of thousands more to members of his family.

Some of the money went directly into Prince’s bank account, while some was paid to a consulting firm he owns. He used the funds to buy a house and a car, pay down student loans, fund plastic surgery procedures (for whom it’s not clear), and even to donate to his and his wife’s church, according to documents filed by federal prosecutors.

In an emailed statement, the church said Prince “has not been associated with our congregation for quite a while,” but that “we are saddened to learn of these allegations, and our prayers are extended to all who may have been victimized by the crime alleged.”

Prince was arrested last summer after an investigation by the FBI and the VA inspector general's criminal investigations division. The evidence against him appears to be considerable, due in large measure to the official record of his time at the VA. Because he worked in a call center, all of Prince’s phone conversations were recorded. And his emails were preserved as required under the Federal Records Act. Federal prosecutors have amassed an evidentiary record consisting of at least 6,000 printed pages and 1,414 audio files.

“Evidence at trial will include the testimony of numerous witnesses, including VA employees, at least 16 caregivers… as well as the playing of recorded phone calls between Mr. Prince and the beneficiaries, which will be time consuming,” according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have also filed more than 40 federal seizure notices on the bank accounts of those involved in the scam, hoping to get back nearly $3.2 million taken by Prince and his associates.

During questioning after his arrest, Prince denied any wrongdoing, and said “he thought he was providing more benefit to the beneficiaries and caregivers by sending them to companies that were going to pay them more for the same services.”

Privately, his tone was far different. The FBI recruited the owner of one of the implicated home health agencies to conduct a monitored phone call with Prince, during which he admitted receiving kickbacks from the agencies to which he referred patients. “It may not be” legal, Prince admitted.

“All it takes is one person to say something and that’s the end of it for everybody,” he added. But “everything is fine if nobody finds out.”"
U.S. Hits Hezbollah Operative With Sanctions,https://time.com,['Associated Press'],,,,https://time.com/5630430/us-sanctions-hezbollah-iran/,"(WASHINGTON) — The United States is targeting a senior operative of the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group with sanctions as part of its pressure campaign against Tehran. The government is also issuing a $7 million reward for information leading to the capture of the operative, Salman Rauf Salman.

The action by the Treasury Department falls on the 25th anniversary of an attack Salman is said to have coordinated on a Jewish center in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The attack killed 85 people and wounded hundreds of others. The Treasury Department’s action freezes all assets that Salman has within U.S. jurisdiction. Treasury says Salman is also accused of planning other terror attacks abroad from a base in Lebanon.

Antonio Brown and Tyrell Williams crack NFL.com's top duos list,https://www.raiders.com,['Kyle Martin'],,,,https://www.raiders.com/news/antonio-brown-and-tyrell-williams-crack-nfl-com-s-top-duos-list,"It seems like lately the sports talk surrounding “best duo” has been reserved for the NBA; Russell Westbrook and James Harden joining forces, for instance. However the NFL still has an abundance of talented pairs.

Earlier this week, former NFL wide receiver and NFL Network analyst James Jones decided to rank his top five wideout duos from around the league, and the Oakland Raiders’ tandem cracked the list.

When Jon Gruden and Mike Mayock traded for Antonio Brown, it was clear the Silver and Black meant business. The team followed up the blockbuster trade by signing Tyrell Williams away from the Los Angeles Chargers, which solidified the Raiders wide receiving corps as a bonafide threat, and Jones thinks the duo of Brown and Williams have the best chance to coexist.

“Of all my top duos, Brown and Williams best complement each other,” Jones said via NFL.com. “Brown has been by far the most productive pass catcher in the NFL since 2013, leading the way with 686 receptions (Julio Jones is second with 565), 9,145 receiving yards (Jones is second with 8,574) and 67 receiving touchdowns (DeAndre Hopkins is second with 47). The former Steeler's dynamic and well-rounded skill set makes him dangerous anywhere on the field, and the addition of Williams gives Derek Carr a big, strong, deep target. The 6-foot-4 wideout has the speed to blow the top off defenses and routinely make the tough catch. Expect Jon Gruden to give this tandem a lot of opportunities in 2019.”

The Raiders historically have had a handful of dynamic duos with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown in the early 2000s — and don’t forget Fred Biletnikoff and Cliff Branch in the mid-70s. AB and Williams have a long way to go if they want to be remembered as one of the best Raiders duos of all-time, but on paper, there’s every reason to believe they’re capable of etching their names in Raiders lore."
"After census debacle, White House to knock out senior Commerce official",https://www.politico.com,"['Nancy Cook', 'Margaret Harding Mcgill']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/18/white-house-earl-comstock-out-1600269,"Commerce policy director Earl Comstock clashed with Trump administration officials on a number of policy issues. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo White House After census debacle, White House to knock out senior Commerce official Senior Trump aides have sparred with the policy director for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over the census, 5G and other issues.

The White House is pushing a top aide to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross out of the Trump administration, the first round of house-cleaning after the 2020 census debacle and clashes over tech policy.

In recent months, Commerce policy director Earl Comstock has angered Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, White House lawyers, members of the National Security Council and officials at the National Economic Council, according to five current and former administration officials. The irritation extends to the highest staff level of the White House, several officials stressed, citing both Comstock’s handling of the 2020 U.S. census’s citizenship question and the internal debate over spectrum policy as key areas of disagreement.

Story Continued Below

One former administration official said he could not think of anyone who “had pissed off as many senior White House officials” as Comstock, who critics allege often tried to exceed his own authority as a top Commerce policy staffer. Comstock also clashed with officials across federal agencies, according to one administration official.

While officials said the process of forcing out Comstock through a firing or resignation is underway, the date of his actual departure remains unclear. He was at the agency until the end of the day on Wednesday.

The White House referred questions about Comstock to the Commerce Department. A Commerce spokesperson said “there is no truth to these rumors. Earl Comstock is an instrumental and valuable member of the Commerce team. He has a keen understanding of the functions of the federal government and has spearheaded multiple departmental initiatives as the deputy chief of staff for policy. Earl will continue to work tirelessly on behalf of the Secretary, the Department of Commerce and the American people.”

As Mulvaney has sought to exert greater control over federal agencies, Comstock’s performance has come under far greater scrutiny — similar to how the White House also has paid close to attention recently to top officials at the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services.

Comstock’s role in failing to put the citizenship question on the U.S. census was just the latest high-profile blow for him, since it’s an issue the president cares about deeply — adding to widespread views inside the White House that Commerce is not effectively executing the president’s agenda.

Administration officials said Comstock’s eventual departure is not necessarily a foreshadowing of Ross’s own tenure in the Cabinet — though the president has been frustrated over the past year with his Commerce secretary’s negotiating prowess in trade talks and the census question.

And Commerce officials don’t see Ross, an 81-year-old investor and longtime friend of the president, leaving imminently despite months of speculation and ongoing sparring with lawmakers. “He likes doing the job,” said a personal familiar with Ross.

Comstock, who acted as Ross’s sherpa during the confirmation process, clashed with other Trump administration officials on a number of policy issues, including spectrum and net neutrality.

A feud among Trump's advisers over 5G wireless — a technology crucial to U.S. competition with China over the future of the internet — spilled into public view in March, when Commerce raised concerns that FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's effort to free up more 5G airwaves for the wireless sector would interfere with the government's use of nearby airwaves for weather forecasting. The White House ultimately sided with the FCC in that debate.

But that did not end the internal infighting. Pai accused the department of “blocking our efforts at every single turn” during a Senate oversight hearing in June. He said the relationship between his agency and Commerce has deteriorated since David Redl abruptly resigned his post as head of Commerce’s NTIA in May.

Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with support from NASA, has raised concerns that using 24 GHz airwaves for 5G services could degrade weather forecasting systems’ ability to make predictions. The FCC concluded its auction of the airwaves in May.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in June warned Ross that a senior adviser “may be placing personal animosity ahead of our country's 5G goals.” Ross responded by saying officials had reached a “workable compromise” — an assertion the FCC denied. The issue also arose in a House hearing Tuesday on spectrum policy.

Comstock has not been in lock-step with the FCC in other policy areas. Early in his tenure at Commerce, he quietly opposed the FCC’s repeal of Obama-era net neutrality regulations by backing a congressional effort to restore the rules. The one-time Republican Senate staffer believes telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon need firm oversight, and had previously challenged the Obama-era rules in court because he did not believe they went far enough in reining in broadband providers.

Democrat rips DHS head over child separation policy,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Alexander Nazaryan', 'Yahoo News']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/18/democrat-rips-dhs-head-over-child-separation-policy/23772608/,"WASHINGTON — Democrats blamed the Trump administration, Republicans blamed Democrats and the Department of Homeland Security blamed Congress for what all parties agreed, at a tense and sometimes contentious hearing on Thursday, was an intractable crisis on the U.S. border with Mexico.

The day’s sole witness at the House Oversight Committee hearing was Kevin McAleenan, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. While he is not the architect of the Trump administration’s policy of detaining asylum seekers, McAleenan is now its top executor. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, the two agencies largely responsible for handling the flow of Central American migrants into the United States, are under his jurisdiction.

In his opening remarks, McAleenan acknowledged that conditions at the border had become “unprecedented and unsustainable,” adding that what was taking place was “nothing short of a border security and humanitarian crisis.” While the most potent images from that crisis have been of children in cage-like detention facilities, legislators and journalists have documented other shocking details, including detainees allegedly being told to drink toilet water and obscene and offensive social media posts by border agents.

The hearing reached its emotional crescendo as the committee’s chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., delivered a furious indictment of the Trump administration, accusing it of an “empathy deficit.” As the two began to argue over whether Homeland Security has adequately kept track of parents and children in a unified database (it has not, according to multiple reports), McAleenan’s explanations seemed to only anger Cummings further. “These are human beings,” he said at one point. “Human beings, just trying to live a better life.”

Growing increasingly outraged, Cummings spoke of “a child sitting in their own feces,” referencing some of the more dire reports from the border. “Come on, man,” Cummings said, his voice quavering. “What’s that about? None of us would have our children in that position.”

Cummings said that the trauma of detention would linger with the children long after they were released back to their parents. So would the collective trauma, Democrats have warned, of Trump’s hard-line policies. “We are the United States of America, we are the greatest country in the world,” he said, adding a little later, “We’re better than that.”

Even as he was repeatedly challenged by Cummings and his fellow Democrats, McAleenan tried to make the case that he was hamstrung by law, repeatedly challenging Congress to change policy by, in effect, doing its job. Congress did recently pass a bill approving $4.59 billion in border-related funding, but only after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi managed to fend off the progressive wing of the Democratic conference that wanted the funding to come with stronger protections for migrants.

At the same time, McAleenan did not shy away from praising what he called the “extraordinary humanitarian actions” of border agents. And he very carefully defended the Trump administration’s policy of separating children from their parents.

“This is in the interest of the child,” he said, asserting that such separations now take place only if parents were suspected of criminal activity, or if the children were believed to be the victims of human trafficking (President Trump is fond of invoking the image of merciless traffickers, or “coyotes,” in his statements about the border). Immigration advocates have challenged the reasons for continuing to separate children from families.

Democrats were unconvinced. They frequently resorted to moral appeals, as opposed to policy arguments, making the case that the Trump administration’s immigration policy was beneath American ideals.

“We can't treat people like this,” said Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., as she showed photographs from her recent visit to the border. For his part, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., asked McAleenan a simple question: “Are you a dad?” McAleenan acknowledged that he was. The exchange came days after another Oversight hearing, one at which a Guatemalan mother, Yazmin Juárez, testified about the death of her 19-month-old daughter after a harrowing several weeks in U.S. custody at the border.

McAleenan made the case that U.S. officials had simply been overwhelmed at the border, with what he said were more than 800,000 individuals attempting to enter the United States through the border with Mexico since Oct. 1 of last year, 90 percent of them without proper documentation. During that time, he said a total of 300,000 children were apprehended by U.S. authorities.

McAleenan defended his handling of the crisis, reiterating the number of times he had asked Congress for more help. Despite that, he argued, conditions had been improving, especially since the new funding had been approved. He said that only 350 children are presently in U.S. custody, and that most of them spent about a day and a half in detention.

But he placed the blame on lawmakers. “A durable solution to this crisis lies with Congress,” he said, asking for “targeted changes to our immigration laws” and for lawmakers to “eliminate the gaps in our legal framework that incentivize families and children to take this dangerous journey.” Moderate members of Congress attempted such a fix in 2013, only to be stifled in their effort by Republican hard liners.

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the committee’s ranking member, repeatedly defended McAleenan against Democratic attacks, arguing that the party’s increasingly leftist base had hampered a timely handling of the crisis.

Two of those progressives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, are members of the Oversight Committee and took turns questioning McAleenan.

“Did you consider the dehumanizing effect on the officers, specifically, in child separation, in forcing them to take children away from their parents?” Ocasio-Cortez wondered.

“Enforcing the law often has emotional impacts,” McAleenan acknowledged.

Ocasio-Cortez also asked McAleenan if the president had asked him to close the border entirely to asylum seekers in exchange for a pardon, should he face prosecution for doing so. McAleenan did not answer the question directly, though he said Trump had not asked him to do anything “unlawful.”

During a break in the hearing, Rep. Tlaib told Yahoo News that Democrats were not to blame, nor were the widely recognized imperfections in the nation’s immigration framework.

“Let’s recognize there’s a crisis, and that’s the separation policy,” Tlaib said.

She described touring the border with a high-level U.S. official who made a frank admission: “It’s not working.”

Two vital research agencies at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are hemorrhaging staff as less than two-thirds of the researchers asked to relocate from Washington to the Kansas City area have agreed to do so.

When U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the planned new location of the research agencies last month, he said it ""will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders"" and ""increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture.""

But groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists call it a ""blatant attack on science"" that will ""especially hurt farmers, ranchers and eaters at a particularly vulnerable time.""

The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA's Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, said the relocation ""has resulted in catastrophic attrition at USDA's top research agencies.""

""Evidence suggests that the relocation of these agencies is an attempt to hollow out and dismantle USDA science that helps farmers and protects our food supply,"" the union added.

The USDA gave employees until just before midnight on Monday to notify their employers whether they planned to accept the relocation.

On Tuesday, a USDA spokesperson told NPR that at ERS, 72 employees accepted relocation and 99 declined or did not respond. At NIFA, the spokesperson said 73 accepted and 151 declined or did not respond. That means the total number that accepted is about 36% of those reported.

The USDA spokesperson said that these numbers may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the date employees are expected to report to the area, and employees can change their statuses until then.

They added that the USDA is working ""to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA's work.""

Last month, the USDA said that of the 644 jobs in the two agencies, 544 would be relocated and 100 would remain in the D.C. area. The numbers reported on Tuesday by the USDA do not appear to account for some 150 positions that the USDA initially announced would be relocated.

The department did not immediately respond to explain the difference, though the employees' union has reported high rates of ""retirements, employees securing new jobs, and employees choosing to be terminated."" A statement last month from three Democratic senators said that ERS had a vacancy rate of 20% and NIFA had a vacancy rate of 26.4%.

NIFA provides grants for research on agriculture-related science, and the ERS conducts research and analysis on topics such as outlooks on major crops and livestock, how much food is going to cost and whether U.S. households will be food secure.

It's not yet clear whether the research agencies will be located in Kansas or Missouri, according to The Kansas City Star.

Lawmakers from both states, including Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, have supported the move. ""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" the Republican said, as NPR's Frank Morris reported.

An ex-employee of ERS recently told Morris that ""efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale."" He said the way the agency is run has become increasingly partisan, and he resigned after the surprise announcement about relocations.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee told Morris.

Some of ERS' recent studies, as Morris noted, may be politically uncomfortable for the Trump administration:

""ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.""

Perdue said last month that the move would save the USDA some $300 million. That number has been met with skepticism by some analysts. The Agricultural & Applied Economics Association estimated the relocation would actually cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million, partially due to the lost value of the research from staffers who decide not to move."
U.S. Air Force to begin transferring space situational awareness data to Commerce Department,https://spacenews.com,['Caleb Henry'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://spacenews.com/u-s-air-force-to-begin-transferring-space-situational-awareness-data-to-commerce-department/,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Commerce Department is “imminently” close to receiving a repository of satellite and space debris tracking data from the Air Force, a Commerce official said Wednesday.

Kevin O’Connell, director of the Commerce Department’s Office of Space Commerce, said the repository, called the Unified Data Library, is the first step in the transfer of some space situational awareness responsibilities as requested by the White House last year.

President Donald Trump, in signing Space Policy Directive 3 in June 2018, directed the Defense Department to give the publicly releasable portion of its space situational awareness data to the Commerce Department.

O’Connell said there is a growing urgency for the Commerce Department to begin handling that responsibility, driven particularly by the deployment of megaconstellations that could add thousands of new satellites in low Earth orbit.

“We had an approach that served us well for decades,” O’Connell said July 17 during a panel organized by the International Astronautical Congress here. “That approach won’t serve us well for the next decade, or the decades to come, given even our most modest expectations about the space economy.”

Satellite operators have relied on the U.S. Air Force for notifications when other satellites or debris are on a possible collision course. The White House wants the military to shed that responsibility so it can focus on “maintaining access to and freedom of action in space,” according to Space Policy Directive 3.

As the Commerce Department prepares to carry that mantle, it is looking to commercial companies to play a big role, O’Connell said.

The Commerce Department issued a request for information to industry in April that received 42 responses, O’Connell said. That response rate led the department to extend the comment window until the end of July, he said.

“I’m amazed at what’s come back,” O’Connell said. He estimated another 20 responses will likely come in before the process is completed.

O’Connell said companies not traditionally associated with the space industry, such as those involved in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and machine-to-machine communications, are presenting ideas on how to improve space situational awareness.

“We are going to get to work with some of these companies when we get access to this iteration of the Unified Data Library,” he said.

O’Connell said the Commerce Department has had extensive conversations with U.S. allies about their participation in the department’s new responsibilities. The Unified Data Library will be their first opportunity to get involved, he said.

The Commerce Department has not finalized the framework for handling its new responsibilities. George Nield, the former FAA associate administrator for commercial space transportation, suggested the government initiate a civil space traffic management pilot program as soon as possible.

“Ideally, this would be a whole of government effort with participation by interested stakeholders who are industry, academia and the international community,” Nield said during the panel. “Initial activities could take advantage of existing hardware, software and observations.”

Nield said the purpose of the pilot program would be to measure the new system against what the Air Force currently provides.

The Commerce Department is making progress bringing commercial and allied stakeholders together, O’Connell said, which he described as promising, though not at the level Nield suggested.

“We are seeing that kind of discussion,” O’Connell said. “It’s probably not as ambitious as a pilot, but it’s what is being done today.”

Members of the Satellite Industry Association are developing policy suggestions as well, according to Therese Jones, the trade group’s senior director of policy. She said the association, whose members include spacecraft operators such as Intelsat and Spire, as well as commercial space situational awareness companies AGI and ExoAnalytic Solutions, want to work on sharing data and improving data quality, among other things.

“I would encourage everyone to think not as much about prescriptive technical solutions as I would suggest thinking about what sort of outcome you want from whatever technical solution is currently at hand,” she said."
Trump hammers Fed after confusion over rate cut predictions,https://www.politico.com,['Caitlin Oprysko'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/19/donald-trump-federal-reserve-1422639,"President Donald Trump has been fixated in recent months on the Federal Reserve's moves. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo White House Trump hammers Fed after confusion over rate cut predictions

President Donald Trump on Friday picked up his attacks on the Federal Reserve, faulting the central bank for a slowdown in economic growth.

Trump went after New York Fed President John Williams, who in a speech the day before had appeared to suggest the Fed needs to cut interest rates at the first sign of a slowdown.

Story Continued Below

Williams’ comments, which many took as a sign the Fed will cut rates later this month, sent markets moving before a spokesperson clarified that Williams' view is based on “research” and is ""not about potential policy actions at the upcoming FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting.”

Trump weighed, tweeting, “I like New York Fed President John Williams first statement much better than his second. His first statement is 100% correct in that the Fed 'raised' far too fast & too early.”

The president has been fixated on the Fed’s moves for months, leveling constant criticism at Chairman Jerome Powell for a series of rate hikes and for not moving to cut rates sooner. On Friday, he criticized “crazy quantitative tightening” coming from the central bank, arguing that the economic success his administration has seen is in spite of fiscal policy.

“We are in a World competition, & winning big,” he said, “but it is no thanks to the Federal Reserve. Had they not acted so fast and 'so much,' we would be doing even better than we are doing right now. This is our chance to build unparalleled wealth and success for the U.S., GROWTH, which would greatly reduce % debt. Don’t blow it!”

In an earlier tweet, he whacked the “faulty thought process we have going for us” at the Fed. Because of that, he asserted, “we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically. In other words, our interest costs are much higher than other countries, when they should be lower. Correct!”

Trump has argued that Powell's policy moves have hamstrung growth as his administration grapples with a series of trade wars and a growing deficit, and he has frequently pointed to the looser monetary policy of central banks of countries like China and maintained that the the U.S. is not on a level playing field with other economic powers.

Science committee chair threatens EPA over 'stonewalled' answers to lawmakers,https://thehill.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453893-science-committee-chair-threatens-epa-over-stonewalled-answers-to,"Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson Eddie Bernice JohnsonScience committee chair threatens EPA over 'stonewalled' answers to lawmakers Democrats, scientists slam Trump administration actions on scientific boards Returning to the moon to gain soft political power MORE (D-Texas), the chairwoman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said she is “deeply troubled” by the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) lack of cooperation with lawmakers in a letter sent Thursday to EPA chief Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: USDA expected to lose two-thirds of research staff in move west | EPA hails Trump's work on reducing air pollution | Agency eyes reducing inspections of nuclear reactors EPA hails Trump's work on reducing air pollution Overnight Energy: Critics worry Trump ignoring plight of honeybees | EPA employee protests union contract while receiving award from Wheeler | Green groups team up to host presidential climate summit MORE.

Johnson said the EPA's failure to provide requested information to her committee represented an “obstruction of Congress,” and she threatened “compulsory measures” if it does not provide previously requested information by July and August deadlines.

“Over the past five months, EPA has stonewalled this Committee — preventing a coequal branch of government from conducting constitutionally-mandated oversight,"" Johnson wrote.

“I am deeply troubled by this lack of cooperation with our efforts to evaluate a program so vital to ensuring the health and safety of the American people, and this behavior fits into a disturbing pattern of obstruction and disrespect of Congressional authority.”

The EPA in a statement said the letter included a number of ""inaccurate statements and mischaracterizations."" It also said it had made efforts to send officials to the committee to answer its questions.

“The Committee’s letter includes a number of inaccurate statements and mischaracterizations, including that of the Agency’s interaction with the Committee and Committee staff,"" the statement from EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said.

""The Agency previously worked with the Committee to provide our top career science official within the Office of Research and Development to testify on the IRIS program.""

The IRIS program is the EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System, which is at the center of the panel's fight with the agency.

Lawmakers have put the chemical program under a microscope following reports that the agency suppressed a 2017 report outlining the health risks associated with formaldehyde. The program within the EPA is responsible for conducting many chemical risk assessment reports. These reports often underpin federal health protections.

Johnson’s committee has been pressing the EPA to explain why in December 2018 it removed formaldehyde and nine other chemical assessments from its program outlook.

“The agency has rebuffed the committee’s attempts to understand the prioritization process and how the benefits of eliminating several late-stage chemical assessments, including formaldehyde, outweigh the benefits,” Johnson wrote.

Johnson listed four instances where letters had been written to the EPA with questions or requests for briefings with agency officials, to little or no response.

She also cited the committee’s March 27 hearing on IRIS, where Kristina Thayer, the head of the program, was requested to testify. EPA instead sent another employee, Dr. Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, who Johnson said was not involved in certain decisions the committee was keen to learn more about.

“At the hearing it became clear that Dr. Orme-Zavaleta was not involved in many of the decisions at the core of the committee’s investigation of the program, and she was not prepared by the agency to answer basic questions about relevant events about the past year,” Johnson wrote.

Abboud said Orme-Zavaleta was the EPA's science adviser and principal deputy assistant administrator, and ""was capable of adequately informing the Committee on the IRIS program and did so for as long as the Committee members had questions during the Committee’s March 27th hearing on the IRIS program.""

He accused panel members of mischaracterizing statements Orme-Zavaleta made in her testimony.

""As for the Committee’s repeated complaints this week about the Agency’s decision on who to provide on behalf of the EPA to testify, it is disappointing that the Committee refuses to acknowledge the extensive qualifications of Dr. Orme-Zavaleta and her ability to speak knowledgeably on all issues within her office and that the Committee continues to insist on dictating to the Agency who they believed is qualified to speak on issues, rather than agreeing to work with the Agency,"" Abboud said.

He added that Wheeler had agreed to testify in front of the committee on Sept. 19.

Johnson in her letter said EPA’s continued attempts to obfuscate details related to the IRIS program amounts to an “obstruction of Congress.”

She said the panel wanted by the end of the business day Friday one specific document related to IRIS.

“Your staff in congressional affairs has made every effort to obstruct the committee’s oversight, going so far as to attempt to change the substance of the record. At this point, the committee has exhausted all non-compulsory means of conducting oversight over EPA. The agency’s obstruction of Congress is particularly disturbing considering the implications of the matter at hand for children’s health,” she wrote."

Homeland Security has gutted programs aimed at stopping WMD terrorism,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-07-17/times-investigation-homeland-security-gutted-programs-aimed-at-stopping-wmd-terrorism,"The Trump administration has quietly dismantled or cut back multiple programs that were created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to help detect and prevent terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction, a Times investigation has found.

The retreat has taken place over the last two years at the Department of Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block potential chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

The changes, not previously reported, were made without rigorous review of potential security vulnerabilities, The Times found, undermining government-wide efforts aimed at countering terrorist attacks involving unconventional weapons, known as WMD.

More than 30 current and former Homeland Security employees and contractors voiced concern that the changes — including the cancellation of dozens of training exercises and the departure of scores of scientists and policy experts — have put Americans at greater risk.

“What we had done in the past was analytically based: Where are the threats? Where can we get the most return on the taxpayers’ investment for security?” said Paul Ryan, who until mid-2017 helped lead Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was merged with another office last year.

“We’re not as secure as we were 18 months ago,” said Ryan, a retired Navy rear admiral.

The cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, who has been appointed by President Trump to successive posts at Homeland Security, a long-troubled department that has seen waves of leadership changes and policy upheaval since 2017.

McDonnell declined through a Homeland Security spokeswoman to be interviewed for this report, and the department did not answer written questions submitted on June 27.

On July 15, the spokeswoman, Ruth Clemens, emailed a three-sentence statement, saying that the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads, “is focused on preventing WMD terrorism by working with federal, state, and local partners across the nation.”

It also said, “some programs were realigned or restructured to better address threats, remove bureaucratic redundancy, and fully align with [Trump’s] National Security Strategy.”

Trump pledged in that 2017 document to “augment measures to secure, eliminate, and prevent the spread of WMD and related materials … to reduce the chance that they might fall into the hands of hostile actors.”

Among the programs gutted since 2017, however, was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” whose specialists conducted dozens of drills and assessments around the country each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing “dirty bomb.”

Another Homeland Security unit, the Operations Support Directorate, had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The directorate participated in less than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year, according to internal Homeland Security documents.

Experts at Homeland Security’s National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center had worked with counterparts throughout the federal government to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

The center has been reduced to a shell: Its leadership is out and its staff has shrunk to three positions from about 14.

A separate Homeland Security component, the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

Also cut back was the use of specialized, mobile detection units to help protect large public events from nuclear and radiological threats. The deployments have helped train local and state responders for a potential emergency.

For the first time in years, Homeland Security did not send a unit to protect the NCAA Final Four college basketball championship in April in Minneapolis or to an annual hot air balloon festival last fall in Albuquerque.

Homeland Security also has halted work to update a formal “strategic, integrated” assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks.

The assessment had previously analyzed millions of potential WMD threat scenarios. Under a directive President George W. Bush signed in 2007, the assessment is supposed to be updated at least every other year to provide objective guidance for the government’s purchases of detection-related technologies and medications for use following an attack.

“These risk assessments are how we stay ahead of the game,” said a former Homeland Security official, one of many who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing a security clearance or other retaliation. “If we don’t keep updating those assessments, then we essentially lose the little bit of focus that we have on the problem and we really risk a strategic surprise.”

The risk assessments provide “an understanding of where to make investments that are targeted to reduce the risk of terrorism,” a current Homeland Security official added. If effective detection technologies are not put in place and if the right medications are not procured for the nation’s emergency stockpile, “that’s putting people at risk,” the official said.

Overall, more than 100 scientists and policy experts specializing in radiological and nuclear threats have been reassigned or left to take jobs unrelated to their expertise, The Times found, undermining the department’s ability to protect the nation from devastating attacks.

Similar turmoil has unfolded among those who had specialized in countering such biological threats as airborne spores of anthrax.

In the worst biological attack in U.S. history, letters laced with powdered anthrax spores were sent through the U.S. mail soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Five Americans were killed and 17 others were infected. In July 2008, an Army scientist, Bruce E. Ivins, killed himself after he learned he was about to be indicted for the anthrax deaths.

Current and former Homeland Security officials warned in interviews that cutting back training around the country could erode readiness among those who would first confront a WMD terrorism attack.

“You keep the country safe by empowering state and local first responders who are out and about 24/7, 365 [days a year],” said one former Homeland Security official.

“The real thing could happen tomorrow with no warning,” another former official said. “And the only practice our defenders are going to have is through these ‘red team’ studies and actual exercises. That activity is necessary to ensure even basic competence.”

The changes have undermined the U.S. government’s multi-agency commitment since 2006 to build and maintain a “global nuclear detection architecture,” according to the present and former officials.

The goal, specified in legislation, was a layered network — from locations overseas to inside U.S. cities — to detect and assist the seizure of radiological or nuclear materials that could be wielded by terrorists.

McDonnell has become a formidable figure at the Department of Homeland Security since Trump named him director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in early 2017. In May 2018, the president promoted him to be an assistant secretary of Homeland Security, heading the new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

Trump signed the legislation that formally merged the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was responsible for reducing the risk of radiological and nuclear terrorism, with the Office of Health Affairs, which had run BioWatch, the nation’s system for detecting potential airborne biological terrorism threats.

McDonnell has used broad discretion over the last two years to shift priorities and policies regarding WMD terrorism. Some of the changes are at odds with priorities authorized by formal presidential directives and by legislation enacted into law, The Times found.

The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center, for example, was established in 2006 under Bush, and affirmed by legislation signed by President Obama in 2010, to help counter smuggling of nuclear materials that could be used in an attack. It has now been effectively gutted.

Separately, the presidential directive that Bush signed in 2007 required Homeland Security to update the integrated assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks “not less frequently than every two years.” The directive remains in force, along with two related mandates, but the update is incomplete and is more than two years overdue, The Times found.

Michael Grossman, who collaborated with Homeland Security specialists during his six years as chief of the Los Angeles County sheriff’s anti-terrorism section, said any slippage in attention to the WMD threat concerns him, in part because regaining readiness would take time.

“If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready,” he said.

Current and former Homeland Security officials said they have struggled to grasp McDonnell’s rationale for cutting back training and other efforts intended to improve readiness, detection and tracing. They cited instances when specialists were removed from their areas of expertise in apparent retaliation for raising concerns about his policies.

Although the mobile detection units were deployed 70 or more times a year in response to requests from state and local officials, for example, McDonnell told subordinates he wants them used chiefly to support other Homeland Security operations and agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard.

Those agencies already have nuclear-detection equipment and procedures in place, according to congressional testimony and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

In 2016, Customs and Border Protection deployed specialized equipment to scan almost 100% of the cargo bound for and arriving at U.S. ports of entry, for example. It uses 1,400 giant radiation portal monitors to scan vehicles and cargo at land-border crossings, seaports, airports and mail facilities, the GAO reported that October.

Trump has repeatedly vowed to prevent terrorists from gaining access to unconventional weapons. In December, he said the “efforts will require close collaboration with and support to” the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency, based in Vienna.

But McDonnell has disbanded the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with the IAEA to help ensure dangerous nuclear material is seized overseas before it could be smuggled into the United States.

An IAEA official said “numerous” collaborations with Homeland Security over the years had bolstered nuclear security worldwide but that the joint efforts had come to a near-standstill.

“We hope that they would join in again,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

The Homeland Security division had participated in exercises with other IAEA member nations and helped generate “guidelines and best practices” that were adopted by 42 nations, according to one of McDonnell’s predecessors.

“This strategic partnership will continue to serve as a force multiplier for nuclear security efforts for years to come,” Huban A. Gowadia, then director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, told the House Homeland Security Committee in February 2015.

To aid the collaborations, Homeland Security embedded a specialist at IAEA headquarters for several years. McDonnell eliminated the position.

Asked about the now-canceled position, an IAEA spokesman said in an email that the specialist had assisted member states “in strengthening their efforts to detect nuclear and radioactive material.”

Officials participating in a program known as Securing the Cities, which was intended as Homeland Security’s last layer of defense against radiological or nuclear terrorism, also have raised concerns.

Securing the Cities was supposed to fortify defenses in five major urban areas — greater Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Long Beach; New York City and nearby Newark, N.J.; Chicago; and Houston.

Overall, Homeland Security has provided the cities with training assistance and direct financial grants totaling about $145 million for detection equipment from 2007 to mid-2018. (The Los Angeles-Long Beach area was made part of Securing the Cities in 2012.)

But a GAO report dated May 13 described “confusion and uncertainty” among city officials participating in the program. According to the report, the chaotic circumstances have arisen, in part, because McDonnell has said he wants Homeland Security to reduce its participation and let other federal agencies play a larger role.

The GAO report said, however, that the agencies McDonnell had cited — the FBI and the National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the Energy Department — didn’t intend to do so.

Homeland Security officials told the GAO “that they have not conducted any studies or analyses that would justify making changes to the program,” the report states.

“We asked, `Why are you making changes and what are these changes going to look like?’” David Trimble, the supervising analyst for the report, recalled in an interview. “The details were very light. [Homeland Security] couldn’t really provide us a road map of where they were going. We found no analysis behind it.”

McDonnell’s overall objectives are unclear.

According to congressional budget experts, $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for his office — went unspent. The unspent funds reflect indecision surrounding the shifted priorities and staff departures, current and former Homeland Security officials said.

On Dec. 18, dissatisfaction at the changes erupted at an “all-hands” staff meeting convened by McDonnell and attended by Kirstjen Nielsen, then-Homeland Security secretary, along with scores of subordinates from the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

A supervisor, responsible for ensuring that operational expenditures are based on validated needs, stood and voiced concerns about McDonnell’s leadership and asked Nielsen to intervene, according to people who were in the room.

McDonnell sat silently and did not respond.

Soon after, Nielsen’s office instructed a personnel official, Sharon M. Wong, to conduct a “workplace climate assessment” to elicit opinions from current and recent staff members. Many of those who spoke with The Times said they also shared their misgivings with Wong.

One official said he had raised concerns about McDonnell’s efforts to install BioDetection 21, a controversial nationwide system intended to replace BioWatch for detecting airborne infectious agents such as anthrax. The replacement technology McDonnell is backing failed repeatedly in field testing sponsored by Homeland Security scientific staff.

The Times disclosed the test results and McDonnell’s support for BioDetection 21 in February, prompting a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation that is ongoing.

In early May, after Nielsen resigned, Wong submitted her results to the office of the acting Homeland Security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, according to people familiar with the matter. The results have not been released publicly.

Although morale at Homeland Security has long ranked lowest of all federal departments, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office had routinely scored much higher, according to surveys conducted by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.

In 2014, the office ranked 11th among similar “subcomponent” offices. Last year, it ranked 415th — last among its peers."
Why the V.A. Won’t Pay for Service Dogs to Treat PTSD,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jasper Craven'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/magazine/service-dogs-veterans-ptsd.html,"[Sign up for the At War newsletter for more stories about veterans and V.A. policy.]

The V.A. is currently conducting research into the effectiveness of service dogs, but the process has been slow. Research started in 2011 was supposed to wrap up in 2015 but has repeatedly been stalled by problems with the study’s design and execution. In May, the V.A. said the findings of the study, which has cost $16 million to date, would be released to the public in 2020.

Meanwhile, some lawmakers are growing impatient with what they perceive as a lack of initiative at a time when there is a growing mental-health crisis in America’s veterans community. In June, Representative John Rutherford, a Florida Republican, reintroduced the PAWS Act, to establish a $10 million grant program through the V.A., which would give qualified nonprofit organizations up to $25,000 for each veteran they pair with a service dog. The stipend would cover the canine’s training, and the training of the recipient with his or her service dog. The bill is sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans, pitting lawmakers against the V.A., which is refusing to endorse any new stopgap service-dog program before its internal research is completed.

Stuck in the middle are the veterans themselves. Among those receiving disability benefits from the V.A., more than one in five suffers from PTSD. Veterans who have responded poorly to conventional treatments have had to improvise, sometimes by paying thousands of dollars up front to acquire service dogs, then covering the significant costs of feeding and caring for them. To make matters worse, veterans seeking service dogs without any support from the V.A. are forced to wade into a largely unregulated industry: Some end up with a dog that provides few benefits because it isn’t properly trained. Veterans advocates say access to a psychiatric service dog without the associated financial burden can’t come soon enough.

In January 2009, Al Franken, fresh off his winning campaign for a Senate seat, met Luis Montalván, a medically retired Army captain who had served two tours as an intelligence officer in Iraq, and his golden retriever named Tuesday. Montalván had returned home with a shattered leg, spinal damage, a brain injury and PTSD symptoms that included vivid nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks and a fear of public spaces. The only therapy that eased Montalván’s symptoms was Tuesday, whom he received from a group called Educated Canines Assisting With Disabilities. Tuesday sensed if Montalván’s breathing sharpened or he began to perspire, and then intervened with a nuzzle. If Tuesday noticed Montalván thrashing while asleep in bed, he would wake the former soldier from his nightmare with a series of sloppy face-licks. Tuesday was even trained to direct the Army veteran from his bed to his pill bottles each morning."
EPA announces new program designed to clean up Great Lakes,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Mary Kilpatrick', 'Mkilpatrick Cleveland.Com']",07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2019/07/epa-announces-new-program-designed-to-clean-up-great-lakes.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio — EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler visited Cleveland Friday to announce a new program designed to help remove trash from the Great Lakes and its shores.

The Trash-Free Great Lakes grant program will provide about $2 million in grants to clean up waste along Great Lakes beaches, shorelines, harbors and rivers. The money will also support trash and litter prevention efforts in the Great Lakes, as well as educational projects.

""We are here today because the health of the Great Lakes is a top priority for President Trump and his administration,” Wheeler said during a news conference along Lake Erie. “We are committed to protecting and restoring one of America’s greatest natural resources.”

The program is part of the EPA’s Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which the Trump administration proposed cutting from $300 million to $30 million earlier this year. The administration less than a month later reversed course and supported fully funding the GLRI.

State and local agencies, tribes and non-profits can begin applying for Trash-Free Great Lakes grants in October. Applicants will find out they received grants in February. The program could pay for up to 12 grants — potentially enough to support two large projects and 10 smaller projects. The program could award grants up to $500,000.

The lake’s annual harmful algal bloom is forecasted to be more severe than last year, but on par with 2017. The bloom affects Toledo to the islands, contaminating drinking water, and turning it pea green. The size of the annual spread depends on how much rain falls on Northeast Indiana, Southeast Michigan and Northwest Ohio between March and July and how much phosphorus runs off farms into the Maumee River which feeds into the lake.

Wheeler said the EPA has recently announced $14 million in grants to help reduce nutrients, which include phosphorus, in the Great Lakes.

“We also recognize that marine litter is just one of the challenges facing the future of the Great Lakes,” he said.

Before announcing the trash cleanup program, Wheeler joined U.S. Rep. Dave Joyce, of Chagrin Falls, aboard the EPA’s largest research vessel, the Lake Guardian, and heard from scientists about their work studying the Great Lakes.

The EPA each year surveys all of the Great Lakes, once in the spring and once in the summer. In addition, the agency studies the dead zone in Lake Erie annually.

The agency also annually spends an intensive period studying one of the Great Lakes, rotating each year between each of the bodies of water. This year, it’s Lake Erie’s turn.

Wheeler and Joyce surveyed how the vessel sampled water and mud samples in Lake Erie. The scientists said they’ve seen areas in the lake that appear to have lots of mayfly boroughs, a positive indicator of the lake’s health. The officials also saw the equipment the scientists used to take photographs and film underwater, to see, for example, how many invasive mussel species there are. One instrument, a sled constructed using snow mobile parts, is dragged along the lake floor to take videos of the lake bottom.

Scientists are also studying naturally occurring manganese levels, a metal found in Lake Erie’s sentiment. The metal can unbind from sentiment in low oxygen areas, creating foul-smelling, yellow water, that’s expensive to treat. Scientists are trying to come up with a model to predict these spikes in manganese for water treatment plants.

Wheeler, an Ohio native and a graduate of Case Western Reserve University, remarked that he believes he’s the only EPA administrator to go swimming in the Great Lakes.

“I’ve been swimming in Lake Erie and I want to make sure that future generations can continue to go swimming in Lake Erie,” he said during the news conference."
Live updates: Iran says it has captured a British-flagged oil tanker,https://www.cnn.com,"[""Cnn'S Chris Isidore""]",07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/iran-british-tanker-july-2019/index.html,"What happened: Iran seized a British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, while it was sailing in the Strait of Hormuz on Friday. UK and US officials quickly denounced the move as a reckless violation of international norms.

Iranian media reported Saturday the Stena Impero had been involved in an accident with a fishing boat, and that the ship had been taken to Bandar Abbas Port. The 23-man crew -- made up of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Philippines nationals -- will remain on board until Iranian authorities finis investigating the incident, Iran's Fars news agency reported.

What the UK said: Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called the seizure ""unacceptable"" and said ""it is essential that freedom of navigation is maintained and that all ships can move safely and freely in the region.""

The UK Foreign Office also advised ships to ""stay out of the area"" for the time being.

Why it matters: The seizure comes amid a dangerous standoff between Iran and the US.

The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important points of traffic for the world's oil supply chain. If this standoff were to continue to affect traffic in the strait, it could seriously hamper the global economy.

Richard Meade, the managing editor of the influential shipping industry publication Lloyds List, said the Stena Impero's seizure is ""probably the highest level security threat that we have seen in the region since the late 80s."""
"Donald Trump is not America's first racist president, but hopefully he'll be our last",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Paul Brandus', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/17/donald-trump-racist-president-hates-what-makes-america-great-column/1743525001/,"CLOSE

Why does Trump hate the things that make our country great? And how do the rest of us get beyond this hatred and ignorance?

It was amusing at the start of the great racist tweet controversy to hear the media asking, “Is President Donald Trump a racist?” We are well beyond such questions.

“I am the least racist person you have ever met,” he has said on numerous occasions. If you were living solo on a deserted island and he showed up, that might be true, but for everyone else, it’s just another one of his delusional claims. In fact, I have met the president myself, and he’s off by one word. He is not the least racist person I’ve ever met — he is the most.

Trump supporters reading this will probably get upset and melt like snowflakes.Yet since October 1973, when Richard Nixon’s Justice Department sued Trump and his father Fred for barring blacks from their apartment buildings, it has been known that the president is a racist — and a congenital one at that.

Trump racism goes back decades

The least racist person you have ever met? You don’t know the history of the Central Park Five (Trump called for the death penalty for the accused teens), or the history of blacks who worked at his casinos (fine paid for discrimination, and much more) in Atlantic City.

The least racist person you have ever met? “Laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control,” he said in a 1997 Playboy interview.

The least racist person you have ever met? Mexicans? “they’re rapists.” White supremacists waving swastikas in Charlottesville? “very fine people on both sides.” On and on and on.

Before we move on, here’s my favorite. Remember when Trump (you know, the least racist person you’ve ever met) said that Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS” and that many African nations were “s---hole countries?”

One country he has singled out is Nigeria; he said once Nigerians have seen the United States, they would never “go back to their huts.”

His base loves this stuff, but guess what? The joke’s on them. According to Trump’s own Census Bureau, Nigerian immigrants are far better educated than white Americans. For instance, 17% of Nigerians who are here have a master’s degree; just 8% of whites do. And 4% of Nigerians who are here have a Ph.D. Just 1% of whites do.

Holding these figures down are lesser educated white folks like Trump himself and his relatives. None of them have an advanced degree — though Tiffany Trump, a second-year law student at Georgetown, may be the first to earn one.

Racism from Andrew Johnson to FDR

Americans have survived racist presidents before. Woodrow Wilson, a southerner, opposed postwar Reconstruction because ""the dominance of an ignorant and inferior race was justly dreaded."" He opposed giving blacks the right to vote, claiming “it was a menace to society,” and as president he oversaw the re-segregation of the federal government. He lived in the White House a century ago.

Calvin Coolidge signed an immigration bill aimed at keeping out “the yellow peril” — i.e. Asians, along with Africans and Arabs. “America must be kept American,” he said in 1923.

Trump's tweets: Bullies told me to go back to my country. At first it silenced me, now it spurs me on.

And everyone knows that after Pearl Harbor was bombed, Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, leading to the forced relocation of 117,000 Japanese Americans from the West Coast to inland internment camps. FDR’s defenders pointed out that we had just been bombed by Japan and were at war.

But few know that in 1925, Roosevelt wrote that “Japanese immigrants are not capable of assimilation into the American population...Anyone who has traveled in the Far East knows that the mingling of Asiatic blood with European and American blood produces, in nine cases out of ten, the most unfortunate results.”

FDR led us through the Great Depression and World War II. He was one of our greatest presidents. Yet those words cannot be ignored.

Visions of racial superiority

There are other examples — Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was probably the worst of all — but you get the idea. American history is dotted with presidents who harbored visions of racial superiority.

But not in the modern era, at least not to the degree that we have seen with Trump. He went from bad to worse just the last few days with his attacks on ""The Squad"" -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar, D-,Minn., Ayanna Pressley D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., all young freshmen congresswomen of color. And then he doubled down Monday, saying they hate America?

Actually, Trump seems to hate America himself. After all, he has complained about several amendments to our Constitution. He has complained about our system of checks and balances, our judicial system, our free press, people who are different than him.

Why does he hate the things that make our country great? And how do the rest of us get beyond this hatred and ignorance?

Donald Trump is not our first racist president. Let us hope, however, that he will be our last.

"House votes to hold Attorney General Barr, Commerce Secretary Ross in contempt for failing to comply with subpoena on 2020 Census",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team""]",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-to-vote-to-hold-barr-ross-in-contempt-over-2020-census-citizenship-question/2019/07/17/8dbeb35c-a89c-11e9-a3a6-ab670962db05_story.html,"President Trump, joined by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, left, and Attorney General William Barr, speaks during an event at the White House on July 11, 2019. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)

The House on Wednesday voted to hold Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt for failing to provide documents related to the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, escalating the fight between Democrats and the White House over congressional oversight.

The 230-to-198 vote along party lines came one day after the House approved a resolution condemning President Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority congresswomen.

After a string of legal defeats, Trump last week abruptly retreated from his efforts to add the question to the census, announcing that he will instead order federal agencies to provide the Commerce Department with records on the numbers of citizens and noncitizens in the country.

But lawmakers continue to demand answers about the motivations behind the administration’s 19-month effort to ask about citizenship status on the decennial survey. In May, new evidence emerged suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to Republicans and whites. The Trump administration has said it needs the information to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.

Barr and Ross wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) earlier Wednesday saying they “strongly oppose” the resolution and asked her to postpone the vote so they could continue working through a legally mandated process toward a compromise.

“By taking this action, the House is both unnecessarily undermining inter-branch comity and degrading the constitutional separation of powers and its own institutional integrity,” the two Cabinet members wrote.

In a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the vote “ridiculous” and said it was “yet another lawless attempt to harass the president and his administration.”

“House Democrats know they have no legal right to these documents, but their shameful and cynical politics know no bounds,” she said.

Ross said in a statement that the vote was a “PR stunt” and that Democrats “made every attempt to ascribe evil motivations to everyday functions of government.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec defended the department’s efforts and said that “holding the Attorney General in contempt for working in good-faith with Congress marks a new low for Speaker Pelosi’s House of Representatives.”

The impact of the contempt vote is largely symbolic. Those found in criminal contempt are normally referred to the Justice Department for prosecution; in this instance, the Justice Department would not prosecute itself.

During Wednesday’s floor debate, Republicans cast Democrats’ holding of the vote as merely a political show.

“We may be in July, but it’s Groundhog Day all over again,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. Pointing to the contempt vote, a Democratic resolution on impeachment and Tuesday’s resolution condemning Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority Democratic congresswomen, McCarthy said Democrats are consumed with passing measures “attacking Trump” while voters are more concerned with kitchen-table issues.

Rep. Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) defended the administration’s efforts to inquire about citizenship, contending that asking such a question is “standard operating procedure” in other countries, including Canada and Australia. “Knowing who is in our country should not be controversial,” she said.

Some Democrats responded by arguing that the administration’s efforts were part of a broader pattern of seeking to dilute the power of minority voters. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) said the push for the citizenship question was “disturbing” because “it’s in a context of voter suppression that’s all across America.”

“Asking the citizenship question on the census is part and parcel of that scheme to discourage minority voting in America, to frighten immigrant communities,” Connolly said.

Others, such as Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), said the battle was about congressional oversight of the executive branch, noting that the Trump administration had “already lost” the policy battle in the courts.

“They lost because their justification was ‘contrived,’ according to Chief Justice Roberts,” Raskin said, adding: “This is about congressional power.”

Trump’s order came after the Supreme Court ruled that the administration cannot move forward on adding the question without providing a solid justification for its plan.

In their letter, Barr and Ross wrote that their departments had made “significant efforts” to accommodate Congress’s requests, and they disagreed that they had tried to obstruct lawmakers’ inquiry. They claimed that the “limited materials still at issue are subject to a number of legal privileges that have been upheld in the pending litigation, as well as the president’s assertion of executive privilege.”

“There is no information to hide; there are institutional integrities to preserve,” they wrote.

In April, the Oversight Committee authorized its chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), to issue subpoenas for a deposition of John Gore, principal deputy assistant attorney general, and to Barr and Ross for documents related to the 2020 Census decision. But the Justice Department said it would not comply with the subpoena for Gore to testify about the question, and the administration has vowed to stonewall all House subpoenas.

In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox Business Network, Ross maintained that the administration will push ahead on gathering citizenship data through other means.

“Well, I think it’s just gamesmanship on their part,” he said of the continued opposition by Democrats. “They know we’re going to come much closer to the answer than we ever have before, because with the president’s executive order, we’re having much better access to federal documents than we ever had before.”

Wednesday’s vote is only the latest attempt by House Democrats to force the administration to submit to congressional oversight. Last month, the House voted to seek court enforcement of subpoenas for Barr and former White House counsel Donald McGahn.

A move by the House to hold a sitting attorney general in contempt of Congress is rare but not unprecedented: In 2012, the Republican-led House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt over his failure to provide material in the probe of Operation Fast and Furious, a federal government program targeting gun trafficking by Mexican cartels.

"Controversial agency relocation slammed as attack on science by lawmakers, employees",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/agriculture-usda-blm-move-dc-climate-trump-protests-science-e8e534ec12fc/,"Employees and Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on the Trump administration’s plans to relocate hundreds of positions within two agencies outside of Washington, D.C. — a move some see as an effort to clamp down on science.

While the planned moves of both the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and parts of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) differ in their scope and rationale, resistance to both plans has shaped up similarly.

Critics are expressing concern over the motivations behind the efforts, which would lead to a mass-exodus of agency experts unwilling to relocate. This would spur a science brain drain in line with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on reports and research from within his own government.

“These decisions… are meant to displace seasoned scientists and regulators who have honorably served Republican and Democratic Administrations alike,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) in a statement to ThinkProgress responding to both the BLM and USDA relocation plans. Van Hollen sits on the Interior and Environment Appropriations subcommittee.

Responsible for administering public lands, BLM has become a battleground under the Trump administration as the White House has rolled back the boundaries of national monuments and advocated for fossil fuel drilling on U.S. acreage.

Now, the bureau is sparking controversy again. Administration officials confirmed this week that the overwhelming majority of BLM positions in D.C. are set for relocation. Around 84% of BLM staffers will be asked to relocate by the end of next year to areas outside of the nation’s capital, mostly to western states.

That announcement comes a month after Secretary Sonny Perdue mandated that over 500 USDA employees move en masse to Kansas City — located in both Missouri and Kansas — by Sept. 30, and gave them a deadline of July 15 to respond.

In the case of BLM, the Interior Department (DOI) plans to concentrate many of the positions in Grand Junction, Colorado, in addition to a range of western states stretching from Arizona to Alaska. Joe Balash, DOI assistant secretary for land and minerals, called the decision “demonstrably cost-effective” in a July 16 letter to Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), ranking member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and Environment.

The Trump administration argues that the move would both cut expenses and shift workers closer to the public lands they focus on, an argument supported by many Republicans including Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), who sits on the Natural Resources Committee.

But Democrats immediately raised objections. Udall said he had “serious reservations” about the move, as did his subcommittee counterpart in the House, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN). Democrats in both chambers of Congress indicated this week that they feel the plan is largely an effort to push out the D.C.-based senior staff who do not want to relocate.

Many of those employees are experts in their field, including scientists. “It’s a way for them to get rid of a lot of professional staff here in Washington,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) in a statement.

Many BLM employees are already located in other parts of the country and support for moving the bureau has been somewhat bipartisan over the years. But the latest push for relocation by the Trump administration coincides with a heated clash between USDA and its employees.

Given until this past Monday to make their decision, scores of USDA workers have opted out of moving. Of the employees with the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), more than half declined to relocate, according to Politico.

ERS workers in particular argued that the move would disrupt their work and efforts to publish important scientific reports. NIFA, meanwhile, is responsible for grant funding that touches climate, economic, and agricultural work that uses D.C. as a home base.

Many USDA employees have also argued that the move is politically motivated. ERS has recently released reports critical of Trump’s escalating trade war with China and its impact on farmers.

Experts also worry the move is a warning shot with implications for climate science. An investigation by Politico last month found that USDA has repeatedly sought to bury studies showing the danger of climate change. That report noted that some scientists see the ERS move as a foreshadowing of wider repercussions for research that doesn’t align with the administration’s broader “energy dominance” agenda.

USDA workers have fought through their union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), to dispute the move, but the department has rejected those efforts. Moreover, there is concern that other departments could face similar moves, like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, both of which are under DOI’s jurisdiction.

But Democrats asserted that they are looking into measures to combat the relocations, emphasizing that the move could be costly to taxpayers in addition to dramatically shifting the wealth of knowledge offered by current government staffers.

Lawmakers indicated they might seek to halt the relocation by blocking its funding in the upcoming appropriations bill that covers both the DOI and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A group of senators, including Van Hollen, have meanwhile introduced legislation to keep ERS and NIFA in the D.C. metro area, a move that was made before the BLM move was announced.

“This Administration is acting to undermine the subject-matter experts at many of our federal agencies,” said Van Hollen, who added that his office would “continue to use every tool available to push back against these actions.”

This article has been updated to note that only USDA would be impacted by the Senate legislation due to timing."
