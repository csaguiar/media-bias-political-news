His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-democrats-full-health-benefits-illegal-immigrants-trump,"In a stance to distance itself from President Trump’s administration, California is set to become the first state in the country to pay for tens of thousands of illegal immigrants to have full health benefits.

Under an agreement between Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democrats in the state legislature, low-income adults between the ages of 19 and 25 living in California illegally would be eligible for California’s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. The deal emerged as part of a broader $213 billion budget.

The plan would take effect in January 2020, the Sacramento Bee reported.

State officials have estimated the benefits would be available to about 90,000 low-income illegal immigrants at a cost of $98 million per year.

“While it’s not all we sought, it will provide a real tangible difference for people, especially for those around and below poverty and for middle income families who don’t get any help under the federal law,” Anthony Wright, executive director of advocacy group Health Access, said. Indeed, a family of four earning as much as six times the federal poverty level -- or more than $150,000 a year -- would be eligible to get about $100 a month from the government to help pay their monthly health insurance premiums.

To pay for part of it, the state agreed to start taxing people who don’t have health insurance. It’s a revival of the individual-mandate penalty that had been on the books nationwide under former President Barack Obama’s health-care law until Republicans in Congress eliminated it as part of the 2017 overhaul to the tax code.

The budget agreement still must be approved by the full state legislature; a vote is expected this week. State law requires lawmakers to enact a budget by midnight on June 15. If they don’t, lawmakers would lose their pay.

"Trump Lawyer’s Message Was a Clue for Mueller, Who Set It Aside",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Michael S. Schmidt', 'Charlie Savage']",06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/us/politics/john-dowd-voice-mail.html,"WASHINGTON — As the special counsel’s investigators pursued the question of whether President Trump tried to impede their work, they uncovered compelling evidence — a voice mail recording and statements from a trusted witness — that might have led to him.

A lawyer for Mr. Trump, John M. Dowd, reached out to a lawyer for a key witness who had just decided to cooperate with the government, Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Dowd fished in his message for a heads-up if Mr. Flynn was telling investigators negative information about Mr. Trump — while also appearing to say that if Mr. Flynn was just cutting a deal without also flipping on the president, then he should know Mr. Trump still liked him.

But the president’s role, if any, remains a mystery. Mr. Dowd never said whether Mr. Trump directed him to make the overture. And investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, declined to question Mr. Dowd about his message, citing “attorney-client-privilege issues.”

The release of the recording last week served as a reminder that despite the considerable evidence laid out in the 448-page Mueller report, some tantalizing questions about the president’s conduct went unanswered because investigators encountered obstacles or backed off on pursuing leads."
Markets can cheer: China appears to finally be addressing its US trade surplus,https://www.cnbc.com,['Dr. Michael Ivanovitch'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/china-appears-to-be-cutting-its-us-trade-surplus---commentary.html,"Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a Russian-Chinese energy and business forum on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), Russia June 7, 2019. Maxim Shemetov | Reuters

China will not allow the U.S. to interfere in its legislative process and economic policies, but it seems to be showing a readiness to keep its sales in American markets on a steep and steady downward path. According to data released June 6 by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Chinese goods exports to the U.S. in the first four months of this year declined 12.8% from the same period of 2018, driving the trade surplus down 10%. Although Chinese data released Monday morning point to a widening Chinese surplus on U.S. trade in the course of May, that wasn't directly comparable to U.S. figures because of differing methodologies. Regardless, the trend of more balanced trade will — and must — continue if Beijing wants to return to normal trade relations with Washington. Indeed, the signal is clear that China has decided to operate a radical change in its U.S. trade. Taken at an annual rate, China's trade surplus with the U.S. in the January-April interval would be 23.5% below China's surplus for all of last year. It is a great pity the U.S. and China missed a chance to initiate such a rebalancing trend of their bilateral trade accounts when the Trump administration took office in January 2017. China's leaders were warned during the U.S. presidential campaign in 2015 and 2016 that Donald Trump, if he became president, would not tolerate excessive and systematic Chinese trade surpluses on their U.S. trades. As the saying goes, China could read the writing on the wall.

China's finally made a wise move

Why Beijing decided to aggravate its trade case with a $901.7 billion merchandise trade surplus during the tenure of an administration virulently opposed to such trade developments is a mystery. Washington, therefore, could be forgiven for seeing such Chinese policy behavior as a brazen provocation that required a strong American response. And that's what the U.S. did by building a trade complaint including intellectual property violations, forced technology transfers, illegal industry subsidies, non-tariff trade barriers, restricted access to American firms on Chinese markets, Beijing's exchange-rate manipulations and more. Briefly put, China found itself in a situation where the U.S. called for far-reaching legislative changes in Beijing and closely scrutinized monetary policies as conditions for balancing U.S.-China trade accounts and a continuation of fair, free and reciprocal trade relations. And as China balked at Washington's demands — while continuing to accumulate nearly a trillion dollars of U.S. trade surpluses on Trump's watch — America stepped up pressure with trade tariffs, adopted an increasingly firm negotiating stance and limited access to U.S. markets and technologies for Chinese companies. By appearing to ignore Washington's trade warnings, China just made things difficult for itself. Beijing is now doing, under duress, what it should have done three years ago under much more favorable conditions, if it genuinely wanted to promote its policy of harmonious ""great power relations."" It is, therefore, pleasing to read the reported comments, made last Friday, by Chinese President Xi Jinping at an international economic forum in Russia: ""It's hard to imagine a complete break of the United States from China or of China from the United States. We are not interested in this, and our American partners are not interested in this. President Trump is my friend and I am convinced he is also not interested in this.""

The Fed has plenty of room to support the economy

A very welcome sea of change indeed, and an auspicious sign for Xi's meeting with Trump during the G-20 meeting in Osaka, Japan later this month. China has definitely decided, at the highest levels of state, that a balanced trade relationship with the United States is in the best interest of its economy, its tenuous security ties in Asia and the major role it wishes to play on the world stage. Such a policy always made sense. As big as China's exports to the U.S. are — $422.4 billion at an annual rate in the first four months of this year — that is small change compared to what its companies can earn by focusing on vast programs of, what Xi called, ""the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."" China's estimated 300-plus million middle class citizens represent a formidable market to serve with increasingly sophisticated products and services. And they now seem to be more interested in lucrative investments at home, instead of dropping their millions on overseas trophy purchases. The only thing I don't like about those new China numbers on U.S. trade are Beijing's precipitously falling purchases of American goods. China's imports from the United States in the January-April interval were a pitiful $34 billion, a whopping 21% decline from the year earlier, and only 24% of what China sold to the U.S. during the same period. That's got to change. Washington should insist that the balancing of bilateral trade accounts must substantially raise the volume of Chinese purchases of American goods and services. At any rate, markets can now confidently expect that the big realignment of U.S.-China trade flows is finally under way. With the prospect of the trade war now virtually over, markets can also count on the Federal Reserve's ample liquidity provisions. The Fed is trimming its huge balance sheet — $3.3 trillion as of June 5, 2019 — while still maintaining an extraordinarily large amount of bank's excess reserves: $1.4 trillion of funds that banks are ready to lend to businesses and households. And that's what the banks are doing. Their lending to households accelerated in the course of April at an annual rate of 6%. The doomsayers should note that easy credit and strong labor markets have kept U.S. household spending (about 70% of GDP) growing at an annual rate of 2.8% during the first four months of this year. That's an acceleration from the pace in the previous four months, when consumer outlays are traditionally high as a result of year-end holidays.

Trump and Macron 'friendship tree' has reportedly died,https://www.cnbc.com,['Elliot Smith'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/trump-and-macron-friendship-tree-has-reportedly-died.html,"The tree gifted by French President Emmanuel Macron to U.S. President Donald Trump has died, according to French media reports Monday.

Democratic presidential candidates are squandering a critical early opportunity to mobilize Latino voters ahead of 2020, potentially easing Donald Trump’s path to reelection, according to leading Latino political operatives in battleground states.

Interviews with more than a dozen strategists and organizers revealed rising alarm at the lack of attention being paid to Latinos in swing states where they could decide the outcome of both the Democratic primary and the general election. Trump is counting on a slice of Latinos to back him, announcing aggressive outreach plans to keep states like Florida in his column.

Story Continued Below

But if Democrats fail to counter those efforts with their own — by energizing younger Latinos and reaching members of the community who feel estranged by the president — those voters may simply sit out the election, the operatives told POLITICO.

Nevada, for example, is wide open for the taking. But despite the state’s envied third spot on the Democratic primary calendar, operatives on the ground say White House hopefuls are all but ignoring the voting bloc that could put them over the top.

“We've seen the typical fly-ins to come and take pictures with popular Dreamers and go to eat tacos or whatever,” said Leo Murrieta, Nevada director for Make the Road Action, which focuses on organizing immigrant and minority communities politically. “But the reality is that very few of the campaigns have had substantive conversations with any Latinx communities around issues like health care, education, criminal justice reform, and worker justice.”

The lack of outreach to Latinos — in contrast to the TLC being shown to key voting blocs in other early states like South Carolina— is striking given the number of Democrats looking for ways to break out in a crowded primary. POLITICO spoke to Latino operatives in Nevada, Florida, Texas, and Arizona, as well as ones at national organizations that work on mobilizing Latinos and other minorities.

It isn’t enough to hold rallies, organizers said: To turn out Latinos, candidates have to take their time with local leaders, put permanent boots on the ground, and make their events accessible to Spanish speakers. So far, none of the candidates have stood out except Julián Castro, who’s mired at around 1 percent in national polls.

Latinos are poised to be the largest non-white eligible voting bloc in 2020. They could be difference makers not only in Nevada but much larger swing states like Florida and even Pennsylvania, which is home to a growing Puerto Rican population.

Latino turnout jumped from 27 percent in the 2014 midterms to 40 percent in 2018 — increasing more than any other ethnic group, according to U.S. Census data. The Latino population is younger compared to other ethnic groups, and strategists often discount younger voters as unreliable. But organizers argue that Democrats who think that way are making a mistake: Voters between 18 and 53 cast more votes in 2018 than Baby Boomers and older generations, Pew Research figures show .

“If you're going to approach communities of color the way the Democratic Party has approached communities of color in so many election cycles, then you're going to lose,” said Natalia Salgado, senior political strategist with the Center for Popular Democracy, a progressive activist group. “Everyone talks about the sort of elusive Rust Belt voter, but what about the elusive Latino voter?”

The battle to mobilize the constituency is complicated. Activists frequently need to remind candidates that Latinos aren’t a monolith: there are undocumenteds and first-generation citizens, but also Latino families who’ve been in the U.S. as long as their white counterparts. Those differences compound based on whether the Latino communities are of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or Venezuelan descent.

Trump officials say their internal data shows the president has “dramatically increased his support among Latino voters compared to 2016,” especially in states like Nevada and New Mexico. Trump received 29 percent of the Latino vote in 2016. He narrowly lost Nevada but eked out a win in Florida, where roughly 1 in 6 voters in the state are Latino.

Most Democratic organizers agree on two things: Candidates need a robust immigration plan that counters Trump’s hard-line policies and nationalist rhetoric. And Democratic hopefuls, they say, need to aggressively communicate how their policies on issues such as education and health care tangibly help the Latino community. Relatedly, the operatives say candidates have to demonstrate an understanding of the different groups of Latinos, including those of African descent.

A number of 2020 candidates recently turned more of their attention to Latino voters during swings through California. A handful last week addressed the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles Action Fund, including Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Castro. And Beto O’Rourke delivered part of his speech at the state's Democratic Party convention in Spanish.

But Latino organizers, who wield significant influence in states like Nevada and California, are waiting for more.

Latinos are set to make up around 28 percent of the voting electorate in Nevada and were pivotal in delivering the state for Democrats in 2016 and 2018. But when Nevada’s governor signed a bill establishing an office for new Americans, a big win for immigration activists, none of the White House hopefuls highlighted the move. Locals took notice.

Multiple strategists warned that Democrats are running out of time to set up an aggressive field operation in Nevada. By comparison, Hillary Clinton had a Nevada campaign office up and running by March 2015.

“I don't understand what's happening, but the Democrats are not getting Nevada right,” Murrieta said.

Fewer than half of the Democratic hopefuls have met with Astrid Silva, a political mainstay in Nevada who co-founded the organization Dream Big Nevada, which sets up meetings between candidates and undocumented communities.

“There's a lot of work that needs to be done,” Silva said. “Not a lot of people understand what a caucus is.”

Advisers to several candidates insist they’re listening and that there’s still plenty of time.

Castro was the first Democratic hopeful to issue an immigration plan and has visited Nevada the most, but his inability to eclipse low-single-digits has troubled activists. Elizabeth Warren has placed nearly 30 staffers in Nevada and is working to hire Latino interns and to set up caucus trainings in Latino communities. Cory Booker is doing Latino outreach through social media as well as digital and TV, notably appearing on the Univision show Despierta America the day he announced.

Harris, whose campaign declined to say how many people she has in Nevada, has prioritized hiring Spanish-speaking organizing staff in the state and rolled out a paid fellowship program. She caught the attention of activists for providing headphones with real-time Spanish translation available at an early Nevada town hall. Pete Buttigieg has no staffers on the ground, but his constituency director is Latino, and the campaign plans to hire a person dedicated to Latino outreach.

Front-runner Joe Biden has just four people in Nevada and has visited the state once. His campaign website, however, does provide a full Spanish translation. Some of the Latino operatives said they're eager to see whether he tailors his speeches more to the experiences of black and Latino populations, in addition to white working-class voters.

“What I have seen from Joe Biden is that he is running a campaign reminiscent of 1992 or 1993, the courting of the suburban white voter,"" Salgado said.

Isabel Aldunate, a Biden campaign spokeswoman, said: “Vice President Biden committed from day one that Latinos will have a voice at the highest level of this campaign.”

Sanders’ campaign wouldn’t disclose how many organizers it has in Nevada, but an adviser said its field staff would grow exponentially in the coming weeks. His pending immigration plan is being co-written by three undocumented immigrants and the campaign is collaborating with activist organizations on it. Ten percent of Sanders’ staff at its national headquarters are Dreamers or immigrants, according to the campaign.

“It's the backbone of this campaign to reach out to Latinos and immigrants and disenfranchised communities of all color,” said Chuck Rocha, a top adviser to Sanders.

But the lack of an immigration plan from all but three Democrats — Castro, O’Rourke and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee — is a troubling indicator, the Latino operatives said. Trump has made clear he intends to run on an anti-immigration platform again, and Democrats have yet to show they'll have an effective response.

“[Republicans are] boldly proposing to send us backwards [on immigration], and the Democrats thus far, with the exception ... of Castro, are turning in what I would consider a C-minus homework assignment,” said Marisa Franco, co-founder of the Latino grass-roots group Mijente.

Andrea Mercado, executive director of New Florida Majority, a liberal grass-roots organizing group, said Democrats could lose the swing state again if they fail to counter the administration’s “socialism” tag.

“Venezuela and Cuban sanctions are as much about winning Florida as they are about anything else,” Mercado said of the administration's actions against the two countries.

“Right now is not the time for caution,” said Salgado. “If [Latinos] do not feel themselves reflected in either the policies or the rhetoric from any of these candidates, they could turn around and vote for Trump.”

VA owes $190 million to disabled veterans improperly charged home loan fees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Robert Gearty'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-owes-190-million-to-disabled-veterans-improperly-charged-home-loan-fees,"The Department of Veterans Affairs owes about $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who were charged home loan fees they were exempt from having to pay, an investigation has found.

These veterans were charged the fees under the VA’s Home Loan Guaranty Program and now may be entitled to refunds ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, a VA Inspector General audit released Thursday found.

VA loan managers knew disabled vets were being charged the fees improperly since 2014 but never did anything about it, VA IG auditors determined.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior (Veterans Benefits Administration) management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the IG report says.

DOZENS OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASK BETSY DEVOS TO FORGIVE DISABLED VETS STUDENTS LOANS

The loan managers told the IG they were focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications, USA Today reported.

The report faulted the Veterans Benefits Administration for placing the burden on a disabled vet to submit a claim for a refund.

The VA announced last month that it was notifying veterans when they buy homes through the Home Loan program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled, the paper reported.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” the announcement quoted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as saying.

The Veterans Benefits Administration told the IG that it would identify exempt veterans who paid the fees and issue them refunds and that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, The Washington Post reported.

Battle over science roils EPA,https://thehill.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447520-battle-over-science-roils-epa,"Environmental Protection Agency is battling its own board of science advisers over its controversial plan to dismiss certain types of scientific research from consideration when issuing rules.

A meeting this week between the agency and some of the nation’s top scientists highlighted the growing rift between the EPA and the scientific community, with members of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) pushing back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public.

Critics say the move would omit important research from EPA consideration and lead to a dramatic rollback of existing regulations.

The SAB, a team of more than 40 of the nation’s top scientists, have been asking to weigh in on the controversial proposal since it was unveiled more than a year ago.

On Wednesday, it said it would do so —despite a request from the agency to review a narrow portion of the rule.

There’s mistrust between the scientific community and EPA’s leaders in the Trump administration.

Then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittBattle over science roils EPA EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage MORE said the proposal, called Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science, would battle “secret science” when it was first introduced. That spurred scientists to call the proposal “censored science.”

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerBattle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T Overnight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T MORE on Wednesday appeared before the board, vowing to improve the relationship between it and the agency.

“I’ll be the first to admit that we have not utilized you in ways that we should. We can and we will do better,” Wheeler said.

But many in the science and environmental community walked away from the meeting disheartened at what they see is the agency’s plan to amplify pet policies and the voices of industry over those from scientists.

“I would say the way that the meeting proceeded kind of contradicted a lot of Administrator Wheeler’s statement at the beginning of the meeting,” said Genna Reed, lead science and policy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Their discussion showed that EPA has not really involved the Science Advisory Board and gotten their advice on several of the deregulatory actions they’ve proposed.”

Scientists have had a number of concerns over how the Trump administration values science, but things really came to a head when the EPA announced the science transparency rule without first consulting the SAB.

The group didn’t find out about the rule until it was publicly announced — a sign, scientists and environmentalists say, the EPA was not interested in meaningful feedback.

The proposal has since proven to be one of the most controversial EPA has written, prompting 600,000 comments. Critics say the rule will exclude some of the most important research from consideration simply because it does not rely on data that can be shared publicly.

The board sent a letter in May of 2018 with a number of questions and asking to weigh in on the rule but it took almost 11 months before the agency responded in April of this year.

Wheeler apologized for the delay Wednesday, saying it was the result of the agency taking time to rethink how it wants to work with the board going forward.

He asked the board to give its thoughts on how the agency can deal with studies that don’t make their data public because it includes confidential business information or personally identifiable information.

The board bucked that request and instead voted to review the proposal in its entirety.

“I’m wondering if any of the comments the EPA received gave you pause about proceeding with that rule?” asked Barbara Morrissey, chair of a separate EPA panel, the Children’s Health Protection Advisory Committee.

“I agree the confidentiality issue in an important and a thorny one so I’m glad that you referred that to us, but I’m concerned about whether the best available science can be ignored because it can’t be replicated for obvious reasons,” she said, nodding to studies of people who were exposed to harmful chemicals.

Watchers of the board were surprised by the vote given how the makeup of the board has changed under the Trump administration.

Fears that the EPA planned to sideline scientists started under Pruitt when he announced that scientists who receive grants from the EPA would not be allowed to serve on the board—a move that knocked out about half of the members sitting on the Science Advisory Board.

Reed with the Union of Concerned Scientists said there are pretty much two types of grants available to scientists—those from the EPA and those from industry. She didn’t understand why getting an EPA grant would present a conflict of interest when an industry grant wouldn’t.

“People who received these no strings attached grants and are experts on some of the most pressing environmental issues are kept from serving on the board,” she said. “It’s clearly a political maneuver to change the composition of these advisory committees.”

Twenty six of the 45 current board members were appointed during the Trump Administration, a huge amount of turnover in a board that otherwise loses under a fifth of its members each year due to term limits.

“I was pleasantly surprised,” Chris Zarba, who served as the former staff coordinators for SAB until last year, said of the vote to review the entire science transparency rule. It’s not that the Trump administration picks aren’t qualified, he said, but a good board needs diversity.

“Think of it this way. If I was picking a world class football team, and I only picked people that were world class, top-ranked players — if all those people I picked were field goal kickers, I’d never win a game,” he said. “It’s hard to question any single member on the board, and by law the administrator can pick anyone they want and any member that is qualified, but the bigger question is: is the entire team well equipped and accurately representing mainstream science? I think we will see how it turns out...There are certainly picks I wouldn't have recommended to the administrator.”

Robert Phalen is one Trump administration pick that has been questioned by scientists for views of air pollution that are out of line with most mainstream scientists. The University of California Irvine professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science that “modern air is a little too clean for optimum health.""

Phalen was one of the few at the meeting to vote against reviewing the science transparency rule in its entirety.

“I can see and respect both sides of the debate on transparency,” he told The Hill in an email. “We need to know if the research used for regulations is free of serious errors, and that requires other scientists having access to the data. On the other hand if the data were widely available it could be improperly used, such as for disclosing private information. So both sides have validity.”

Wheeler said the agency will move forward with something, assuring the board that the administrator will always have the power to give an exemption to an important study, even if it can’t disclose all its data.

“I do fundamentally believe the more information we put out to the public as far as what is the basis for our regulatory decisions, the more sound our decision will be and the more easily understood and accepted by the public our decision will be because they see all the science we are using,” he told the board."
Meadows predicts DOJ inspector general FISA abuse report will be late due to new developments,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/meadows-predicts-doj-inspector-general-fisa-abuse-report-will-be-late-due-to-new-developments,"A top Republican on the House Oversight Committee predicted on Sunday that the highly anticipated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse report from the Justice Department’s inspector general will be released later than expected due to new developments.

On Fox News Rep. Mark Meadows told ""Sunday Morning Futures"" host Maria Bartiromo that he is ""not as optimistic now"" after Attorney General William Barr said he anticipated Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation to be complete by early June.

Horowitz and his team have been investigating alleged FISA abuse by the Justice Department and the FBI since March 2018. The inquiry includes a focus on the FBI’s handling of the unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele and its extensive use in the FBI's FISA applications and renewals to target former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Barr said in April that Horowitz would be wrapped up “in probably May or June” but an end-of-the-month deadline looks increasingly unlikely.

“Only Michael Horowitz knows the exact time frame of when it’s coming out. Obviously the attorney general indicated that he hoped to see it in June. I’m not as optimistic now,” Meadows said on Sunday. “One of the reasons for that is additional information has been given to the inspector general for them to investigate.”

One significant piece of new potential information could be Steele’s interest in being interviewed by Horowitz’s team. Steele has conditions for an interview, including that the inspector general's team needs to come to London, where he lives and runs his private investigative firm Orbis Business Intelligence, they can only focus on his relationship with the FBI, for whom he was a confidential source, and the U.S. has to get permission from the U.K. government first.

As recently as April it was reported that Steele declined to meet with Horowitz’s team due to concerns about being undermined. Although he has apparently come around to speaking with Horowitz, Steele still appears dead set against meeting with officials connected to Barr’s own investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, led by U.S. Attorney John Durham.

Steele was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was itself being paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. The fact that the dossier had Democratic funding was not revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Meadows stressed that his prediction about Horowitz's inquiry was just his own opinion based on the reports he has seen. “I can tell you Inspector Horowitz obviously hasn't communicated that to my knowledge to anybody on Capitol Hill,” the North Carolina congressman said. “But based on what I'm seeing in terms of additional information being shared with him I think it'll be a while.”"

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” McAleenan said that while people can disagree with Trump’s tactics, the fact remains that Mexico approached the White House with “real proposals” on how to handle the immigration crisis. “Mexico came to the table with real proposals,” McAleenan said. “We have an agreement that, if they implement, will be effective.”

The agreement — announced late Friday in a tweet by Trump — ended a showdown that business leaders warned would have disastrous economic consequences for both the U.S. and one of its largest trading partners, driving up consumer prices and driving a wedge between the two allies. And it represented a win for members of Trump's own party who had flooded the White House with pleading calls as well as aides who had been eager to convince the president to back down.

PELOSI NEEDS TO ADDRESS 'INVASION' AT BORDER, CONGRESS' INACTION 'SHAMEFUL,' GOP REP SAYS

“I think, just in general, Republicans understand that tariffs are a tax on American consumers,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said during a separate interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “And we don't want to see them in place long-term, nor do I believe President Trump does either. He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly, quite honestly.”

A ""U.S.-Mexico Joint Declaration"" released by the State Department said the U.S. ""will immediately expand the implementation"" of a program that returns asylum-seekers who cross the southern border to Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. Mexico will ""offer jobs, health care and education"" to those people, the agreement stated.

Mexico has also agreed, it said, to take ""unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration,"" including the deployment of the Mexican National Guard throughout the country, especially on its southern border with Guatemala. And Mexico is taking ""decisive action to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organizations as well as their illicit financial and transportation networks,"" the State Department said.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador tweeted, ""Thanks to the support of all Mexicans, the imposition of tariffs on Mexican products exported to the USA has been avoided."" He called for a gathering to celebrate in Tijuana Saturday.

TRUMP DEFENDS DEAL WITH MEXICO TO STEM MIGRANT FLOWS, PREVENT TARIFFS

The changes, in part, continue steps the Trump administration was already taking. The U.S. announced in December that it would make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their cases were being proceeded — a begrudging agreement with Mexico that has taken months to scale and that has been plagued with glitches, including wrong court dates, travel problems and issues with lawyers reaching their clients.

Homeland Security officials have been ramping up slowly, and were already working to spread the program along the border before the latest blowup. About 10,000 people have been returned to Mexico to wait out the processing of their immigration cases since the program began Jan. 29.

More than 100,000 migrants are currently crossing the U.S. border each month, but not everyone claims asylum and migrants can wait an entire year before making a claim.

“We need to change the asylum standard, so that that front bar, where we assign credible fear, is not so automatic, so that 85-95 percent of people get that, while only 10 percent get asylum at the end of a court proceeding,” McAleenan said. “We need to align that more closely with what might actually be a successful claim.”

Trump had announced the tariff plan last week, declaring in a tweet that, on June 10, the U.S. would ""impose a 5 percent Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP."" U.S. officials had laid out steps Mexico could take to prevent the tariffs, but many had doubts that even those steps would be enough to satisfy Trump on illegal immigration, a signature issue of his presidency and one that he sees as crucial to his 2020 re-election campaign.

After returning from Europe Friday, though, Trump tweeted, ""I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico."" He wrote that the ""Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.""

Trump said Mexico has agreed to work to ""stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border"" and said those steps would ""greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.""

The 5 percent tax on all Mexican goods, which would increase every month up to 25 percent under Trump's plan, would have had enormous economic implications for both countries. Americans bought $378 billion worth of Mexican imports last year, led by cars and auto parts.

Many members of Trump's Republican Party and business allies had urged him to reconsider — or at least postpone actually implementing the tariffs as talks continue — citing the potential harm to American consumers and manufactures.

State Dept. denies embassies’ requests to fly rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-denies-embassies-requests-fly-rainbow-pride/story?id=63566900,"The State Department has denied multiple U.S. diplomatic posts' requests to fly the rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles during LGBT Pride Month, according to two State Department sources.

The decision is the latest in a string of moves by the agency under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's tenure that LGBT rights activists say discriminate against the community.

Among the U.S. missions overseas that were denied are Brazil, Germany, Israel, and Latvia, one source told ABC News.

The denials fly in the face of the spirit of President Donald Trump's stated push to launch ""a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality."" While the president tweeted last Friday that the White House would ""celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation"" -– making him the first Republican president to do so – his administration has not proclaimed June as LGBT Pride Month.

Pride flags can be displayed elsewhere on a U.S. mission's grounds, but not the official flagpole, according to department guidance distributed in May. Flying any special flag on the official flagpole at a US diplomatic post overseas requires special permission, per the department's Foreign Affairs Manual.

The denial to the U.S. embassy in Germany is particularly striking since Trump's envoy to Berlin is Richard Grenell, one of the highest-ranking openly gay officials in the administration.

""The President's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,"" Grenell told NBC News, which was first to report on the denials.

In 2016, the Obama administration granted ""blanket written authorization from the Under Secretary for Management to display the pride flag on the external-facing flagpole"" during June, according to a cable sent at the time. But that permission was rescinded under the Trump administration, and individual posts had to request permission to fly the pride flag.

In previous years, an official cable was sent from Washington with guidance on how to mark LGBT Pride month and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.

But this year, Pompeo did not approve the cable and instead, the department sent guidance to posts via email that noted it would not transmit an [an official cable for and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia] and LGBT Pride Month this year.""

That meant embassies and consulates could still mark both with whatever actions they wanted. But they were not given encouragement as in years past to engage in outreach with local LGBT communities, and they had to again get permission to fly the Pride flag on the official flagpole.

This time, those requests were denied, the sources said. The State Department has not responded to requests for comment.

LGBT rights activists expressed concern last week after news broke that the State Department was planning to convene a new commission on human rights that was based on ""natural law"" -- often taken to mean a religiously-based interpretation that excludes LGBT rights.

The author of the commission's concept paper is Robert George, a prominent anti-LGBT academic who created the National Organization for Marriage, a source told ABC News.

The department has also come under fire from Congress for a policy that does not automatically grant birthright citizenship to U.S. citizens' children who are born abroad through assisted reproductive technology, which lawmakers say indiscriminately affects gay and lesbian couples.

Under State Department policy, children born overseas must be the biological child of a U.S. citizen to receive citizenship at birth. But citizenship will not be granted to the child if it is born through in vitro fertilization and surrogacy and the genetic parent is not a U.S. citizen, even if the couple is legally married.

In several cases, the children of same-sex couples have had their citizenship denied or delayed even though at least one parent is a U.S. citizen. The State Department is currently fighting lawsuits from two couples on this issue.

Nearly 20 Democratic senators and 80 House members signed two letters to Pompeo Thursday demanding he reverse the policy."

Rosenstein predicts Barr's critics may one day realize his obstruction decision was 'reasonable',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/rosenstein-predicts-barrs-critics-may-one-day-realize-his-obstruction-decision-was-reasonable,"Rod Rosenstein predicts Attorney General William Barr's detractors who criticize him for his handling of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation may come around one day.

No stranger to controversy himself, the former deputy attorney general stressed to the New York Times that Barr made the right call when he determined there was insufficient evidence to initiate criminal prosecution against President Trump for obstruction of justice.

“A few years from now, after all of this is resolved, some of Barr’s critics might conclude that his approach was a reasonable way to navigate through a difficult situation,” he said.

A redacted version of the report Mueller's report laid out 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, but Mueller declined to make a determination on the matter, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted. Mueller also did not find sufficient evidence to establish criminal conspiracy took place between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

Before the report's release in April, Barr released a summary of its principal conclusions which said he and Rosenstein decided there was not sufficient evidence to establish an obstruction crime had occurred. Still, although Trump says he has been vindicated, Democrats argue Mueller's refusal to clear Trump on obstruction provides them a road map to continue to investigate and possibly seek impeachment.

In a CBS News interview last month, Barr contradicted the reasoning Mueller gave about why he did not make a determination on the question of whether Trump obstructed justice. “I personally felt he could’ve reached a decision,"" Barr said, adding that the special counsel “had his reasons for not doing it” but declined to explain. “I’m not going to, you know, argue about those reasons,” he said.

Rosenstein was the official who appointed Mueller to be special counsel in May 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Trump heavily criticized Rosenstein and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions because of the Russia investigation, which he called a ""witch hunt.""

But by the time Rosenstein left the Justice Department last month, he appeared to patch things up with the president and has been a vocal defender of Barr, who has become a target of Democrats amid a fight over access to materials and people related to the Mueller investigation.

Barr is now looking into the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign, which began in the summer of 2016 and was wrapped into Mueller's inquiry, due to misconduct concerns by Justice Department and FBI officials, including Comey, and has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham with leading a review.

“He dives right into things,” Rosenstein said. “He doesn’t act like somebody who just arrived recently. He acts like someone who has been here all along for 30 years.”

Barr previously served a stint as attorney general in the early 1990s under former President George H.W. Bush."
Carter Page says FBI informant 'intensified' communications just prior to FISA warrant,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Carter Page', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-informant-intensified-communications-just-prior-to-fisa-warrant-carter-page-says,"Former Trump foreign policy aide Carter Page said Sunday that U.S. intelligence informant Stefan Halper ""intensified"" communications with him as the FBI worked to obtain a secret surveillance warrant to monitor Page, shortly after he and Halper met for the first time at a research institute symposium in Cambridge, England, in July 2016.

Page's remarks on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" come as the Justice Department is set to unearth new documents this week concerning the origins of the Russia probe. A DOJ court filing Thursday, meanwhile, provided more details about a crucial period just before Halper allegedly sprang into action to seek more information on future National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

Within days of a January 2016 Flynn phone call to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak referenced in the court filing, Russian-born U.K. academic Svetlana Lokhova said Halper suddenly contacted her to gain information on Flynn. Asked about the timing, a source familiar with the situation told Fox News that ""nothing is a coincidence"" when it comes to Halper, and that Kislyak was likely under U.S. surveillance.

""I had a longstanding relationship with Professor Halper,"" Page told host Maria Bartiromo. ""I always believe in 'innocent until proven guilty,' but my conversations with him intensified right in the month before my illegitimate FISA warrant in September 2016, when all these defamatory articles are being placed by the [Democratic National Committee].""

COMEY, BRENNAN SURROGATES DISPUTE WHO PUSHED DISCREDITED DOSSIER

Page has sued he DNC and other actors for defamation related to accusations that he was colluding with Russian agents. The FBI, in its Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application, flatly called Page ""an agent of a foreign power."" Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing despite months of surveillance, and the dossier that the FBI relied upon in its FISA application has largely been discredited as a political document rife with inaccuracies.

In its warrant application, the FBI assured the FISA court on numerous occasions that other sources independently corroborated the dossier's claims but did not clearly state that the dossier's author worked for a firm hired by Hillary Clinton's campaign.

Page continued: ""Professor Halper was being very positive, you know, like a Harriet Tubman figure. He understands sort of the the injustices, or he presented himself as understanding that ...... and I sort of trusted him.""

The FBI formally opened its counterintelligence probe into the Trump campaign July 31, 2016, several days after Page says he first met Halper at the symposium. From 2012 to 2018, the Defense Department paid Halper more than $1 million for consulting work.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Halper -- now widely reported to be a confidential FBI source -- also reached out to Trump campaign aides including Page, George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis. (Papadopoulos separately told Fox News in May that in September 2016, a U.S. intelligence informant approached him in London seeking information, and attempted to ""seduce"" him as part of a ""bizarre"" episode."")

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INTERNAL FBI TEXT MESSAGES REVEAL HIGH-LEVEL DOJ DOUBTS ABOUT KEY FISA SOURCE

Ultimately, Page told Bartiromo, his actions, and those of other Trump campaign officials, were ""completely spun in the fake Mueller"" report to help advance what he characterized as Democrats' ""ridiculous"" goal of impeachment.

""Professor Halper was being very positive, like a Harriet Tubman figure. ... I sort of trusted him."" — Carter Page

""I had a longstanding relationship with the CIA, going back decades, essentially,"" Page said. ""I was always very transparent, open.""

North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, also speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" backed up Page's assertion. Specifically, Meadows pointed to a report from The Hill's John Solomon, who found that Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, was actually a U.S. informant. In his report, Mueller linked Kilimnik to Russian intelligence, and did not mention Kilimnik's secretive ties to the U.S. in the report other court filings -- even as Mueller suggested former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Kilimnik were nefarious.

""The deeper the dive we take into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions, and actually some of the facts they put forth in there, are a misrepresentation of what we actually know,"" Meadows said.

Meadows added that he expected DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into potential FBI and DOJ surveillance misconduct to come out later than June, when it was originally expected. Meadows said more information has come to light that might necessitate the delay.

Page, for his part, told Bartiromo that he did not recall ever ""crossing paths"" with Kilimnik.

In a separate lawsuit filed last month, Lokhova accused Halper and various news media outlets of conspiring to defame her, by falsely claiming she had inappropriate contact with Flynn to further the narrative that Flynn was compromised by Russia.

The complaint asserted that ""Stefan Halper is a ratf----- and a spy, who embroiled an innocent woman in a conspiracy to undo the 2016 presidential election and topple the President of the United States of America.""

According to the lawsuit, ""On January 12, 2016, [Cambridge Professor Christopher] Andrew emailed Lokhova, and invited her and her partner, David North ('North'), to Andrew’s house to have dinner with Halper and his wife. Two dates in February were offered. Andrew stated that the purpose of the dinner was to discuss the book that Lokhova and he were authoring. Lokhova was perplexed. At no point before this unexpected invitation had Halper expressed any interest in Lokhova’s work.""

The complaint alleges, ""Halper had no interest in Lokhova’s work. Rather, Halper wanted to have dinner with Lokhova to probe her for information relating to Flynn in the hopes that his FBI handlers might find a basis upon which to file an application to conduct surveillance and spy on General Flynn.""

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' FLYNN

Halper has said virtually nothing in public about his role. During a rare interview with BBC Radio 4 Today in May 2017, Halper was asked if the Trump FBI inquiry was of Watergate proportions. He responded that the probe was ""moving in that direction.""

Multiple independent reviews into potential FBI and DOJ misconduct in 2016 are ongoing. John Durham, the Connecticut U.S. attorney assigned by Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions,” according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.

Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News last week that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham, who was in Washington, D.C., this month.

Homeland Security secretary: Mexico’s guard border deployment is ‘new’,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/09/homeland-security-secretary-mexicos-guard-border-deployment-is-new/,"The acting secretary of Homeland Security on Sunday heralded Mexico’s decision to send thousands of its national guard troops to the Guatemalan border as a new development, disputing a report that said the concession that averted new tariffs had been agreed upon months ago.

“All of it is new,” Kevin McAleenan said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I mean, we’ve heard commitments before from Mexico to do more on their southern border. The last time they deployed down there, it’s about 4 or 500 officers. This is a more than tenfold commitment to increase their security in Chiapas. That’s where people are entering from Guatemala in southern Mexico.”

President Trump announced Friday that he would hold off on imposing 5 percent tariffs on Mexican imports after Mexico said it would send up to 6,000 national guard troops to the Guatemalan border to curb the flow of illegal immigrants.

But the New York Times in an article Saturday said the agreement for the troops had been reached in March during talks between then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Mexico’s Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez.

Fox News host Bret Baier pressed McAleenan after Trump called the newspaper the “enemy of the people” whether the action was new.

“This is the first time we’ve heard anything like this kind of law enforcement being deployed in Mexico to address migrations, not just at the southern border but also in transportation routes to the northern border and coordinated patrols in key areas around our southwest border,” McAleenan said.

Baier noted that Nielsen testified to the House Judiciary Committee in December that there had been existing talks about Mexico deploying the national guard and asked whether this new commitment is different.

“It’s very different,” McAleenan said. “The president put a charge in this whole dialogue with Mexico with the tariff threat, brought them to the table, the foreign minister from Mexico arrived within hours. He arrived the next day with real proposals on the table.”

​Baier also brought up Trump’s suggesting in another tweet that ​there may be more announcements coming of agreements between the US and Mexico.

“Yeah, so the president tweeted out that this tariff has been suspended, that Secretary Mnuchin point it out that there’s a mechanism to make sure that they do what they promise to do, that there’s an actual result, that we see a vast reduction in those numbers,” McAleenan said.

“And as the state department announced, there are going to be further actions, further dialogue with Mexico on immigration, and how to manage this asylum flow in the region, which is a small percentage of the total flow.”"

Enlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP

Lawyers for the House of Representatives are pushing back on the Justice Department's decision to walk away from a statute barring female genital mutilation — and an unusual argument that lawmakers shouldn't intervene to defend the interests of Congress in the case.

The fight is unfolding over the first federal criminal prosecution for female genital mutilation.

Last year, a judge in Michigan threw out charges against several women who had their daughters circumcised. The Justice Department notified Congress it would not appeal that decision because of constitutional considerations.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote to Congress in April to say female genital mutilation should be ""universally condemned"" but that DOJ had ""reluctantly determined"" it lacked a ""reasonable defense"" of the law following Supreme Court rulings in other cases.

In stepped the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center, which is working with Congress to mount a defense of the statute. The lawyers argued Congress has an interest in the enforcement and defense of the laws it has passed.

The ICAP lawyers were surprised, though, to face opposition from the Justice Department, which only once before has opposed moves by the House and Senate to weigh in on legal disputes.

""It's deeply concerning to see the Justice Department abandoning its defense of this important federal law,"" said Joshua Geltzer, the executive director of ICAP.

""It's further concerning to see the department resisting even the effort by the House of Representatives to offer its own defense of the law it helped to enact. The court should reject the department's effort and at a minimum hear the House's arguments in defense of the statute.""

ICAP is arguing that it wants to weigh in to support the law — which made it a crime to ""knowingly"" circumcise young women who have not yet reached the age of 18 — not to try to force the Justice Department to proceed with a criminal prosecution.

Four of the eight people who were originally charged in Michigan face other criminal allegations, including obstruction of justice.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that half a million women and girls inside the U.S. have suffered genital mutilation or are at risk in the future.

Congress outlawed it, but the Justice Department's Office of Legislative Affairs earlier this year asked Congress to amend that existing law to make clear that it applies to travel between states and when payments or offers are made in connection with the circumcision.

The issue is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which covers territory that includes Michigan.

DOJ distance from Congress

DOJ's position in the female genital mutilation case followed closely behind its refusal to defend President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy legislation, the Affordable Care Act.

In practice, the Justice Department routinely defends legislation passed by Congress so long as there are reasonable arguments that are lawful.

Attorney General William Barr and lawyers inside the White House opposed the decision to walk away from the defense of the health care law, but they were overruled by President Trump.

Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail have criticized that move. But Barr appeared unbothered about their concerns in testimony earlier this year — if the law is sound, they shouldn't be bothered, he said.

""You say that administration's position is hokey and then you say the sky is falling?"" the attorney general said. ""If this was such a hokey position to take, what are you worried about?"""

Re “Elizabeth Warren Wants Congress to Ensure Presidents Can Be Indicted” (nytimes.com, May 31 ):

Contrary to Senator Warren’s view, the mere fact that the current occupant of the White House has engaged in deplorable, and perhaps criminal, conduct provides no basis for revoking the Justice Department’s longstanding rule that a sitting president cannot be indicted.

Senator Warren’s desire to use the criminal justice system against a president the Democrats find objectionable is shortsighted: Given our polarized times, if she were to succeed, it would surely not be long before we would see efforts to use the same tool against a Democratic president.

Moreover, the Justice Department policy, which has remained in force through Democratic and Republican administrations alike, is firmly rooted in the constitutional provision establishing impeachment as the course for dealing with presidential misconduct.

Lastly, as a practical matter, it is likely that the Supreme Court rues the day that it naïvely ruled, in Clinton v. Jones, that a sitting president can simultaneously handle his or her constitutional duties and defend against civil litigation. We saw how the Paula Jones litigation consumed President Bill Clinton’s second term, and having to defend against criminal charges would surely hamstring President Trump to a far greater degree."
The White House reportedly blocked climate testimony warning of a 'possibly catastrophic' future because it didn't 'jibe' with Trump's policy,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aria Bendix'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-blocked-climate-testimony-trump2019-6,"The White House is engaged in a war of words about climate change.

Last Wednesday, Rod Schoonover, a senior analyst at the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, was barred from submitting his written assessment of the effects of a warming world to the House Intelligence Committee, the Washington Post reported.

Schoonover was scheduled to testify on behalf of the bureau at a climate change hearing held on June 5. Though he was permitted to speak in person, his office's written statement was blocked by White House officials, who thought his scientific claims contradicted the policies of the Trump administration.

In his written testimony, Schoonover predicted that the ""the compounded effects of climate change"" would produce ""significant,"" ""possibly catastrophic,"" harm to the planet. The ability to prevent this future, he wrote, will depend partly on humanity's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

A White House aide told the Washington Post that the testimony didn't ""jibe"" with the administration's official stance on climate change.

The testimony was reportedly opposed by members of the White House's Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, and National Security Council, including William Happer, a National Security Council senior director. Happer, who was dismissed from his post at the Department of Energy in 1993, has stated that most of Earth's warming ""has probably been due to natural causes.""

Before the White House barred Schoonover's written testimony, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research reportedly refused a request from the Trump administration to eliminate certain scientific claims.

Here are a few claims from the written document, first obtained by the Washington Post:

Extreme high temperatures are increasing worldwide, and will continue to increase, due ""largely"" to greenhouse gas emissions.

Today's levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere haven't been seen in ""at least 800,000 years.""

Oceans are becoming more acidic due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Climate change will amplify ""stresses"" such as droughts, floods, and fires.

The effects of climate change could undermine trade routes, the global economy, and the world's food supply.

Climate change will ""almost certainly"" threaten national security in the coming decades.

The crackdown on Schoonover's testimony reflects a larger effort on behalf of the Trump administration to police government reports related to climate change.

In May, the New York Times reported that the administration planned to prevent the federally-funded National Climate Assessment from outlining the ""worst-case scenarios"" if climate change went unchecked.

The Times also reported that the White House aimed to prevent the US Geological Survey from making climate predictions beyond 2040. Scientists expect the worst effects of global emissions to manifest after that time period.

WASHINGTON – More than 50,000 disabled veterans could be owed as much as $190 million in refunds from the Department of Veterans Affairs for home loan fees they were wrongly charged or no longer owe, an investigation has found.

Senior leaders knew about the problem for years but didn’t ensure veterans received what they are due, the investigation by the VA inspector general found.

Veterans pay the fees when they buy homes with the help of VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program, but they are supposed to be exempt if they are disabled. Fees can total up to 3.3% of a home's value.

In cases where veterans improperly paid the fees or the VA later determined they were disabled, the agency is supposed to issue refunds.

But the VA didn’t do that in thousands of cases dating back more than a decade because the veterans didn't ask for the refunds.

VA loan managers, who knew about outstanding debts to veterans since at least 2014, told investigators that they had been focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications.

Investigators from the inspector general’s office said in their report released Thursday that they found it “troubling” that the managers were “aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued.”

“It is the review team’s opinion that requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” investigators said.

'Internal quality improvement'

The VA issued a press release last month – as the inspector general was preparing to release the investigation results – announcing that the agency is now notifying veterans when they buy homes under the program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in the release.

The release did not say what is being done to ensure veterans due refunds from loans in prior years are paid. The inspector general found the amounts owed in its review ranged from $5,000 to $20,000.

The VA said veterans who believe they are owed a refund should consult the agency’s website for more information about VA home loan funding fees.

Between 2012 and 2017, the VA collected roughly $10 billion in fees from veterans under the loan program.

The inspector general estimated disabled veterans who were wrongly charged accounted for $286 million of those fees. But the VA only refunded about $100 million, leaving an estimated $190 million that may still be due to 53,200 veterans.

The Loan Guaranty program was established in 1944 to help veterans finance home purchases. Loans are provided by private lenders, but the VA guarantees a portion of the loans for eligible buyers. The lenders collect the fees and transmit them to the VA.

If a veteran wrongly paid the fees, the VA can refund the money directly to the veteran. If the fees were included as part of a loan, the VA pays the lender, which applies it to the loan balance.

'Other priorities'

In 2014, regional VA loan officials in St. Paul, Minnesota, notified senior VA managers that an analysis found nearly $150 million may be due in refunds to disabled veterans for fees on 48,000 loans issued between 2006 and 2014.

“As of January 2019, the review team received no indication that a large-scale effort had been initiated to issue refunds to these veterans,” the inspector general said.

The director of the Loan Guaranty program since 2017, Jeffrey London, told investigators he “considered contracting out the task of issuing refunds, but never requested the award of a contract because other priorities…took precedence,” the investigators wrote.

The inspector general recommended the agency identify and pay all the veterans owed refunds. In addition, the VA should implement procedures to minimize the number of veterans who are wrongly charged fees and conduct periodic reviews to ensure those who are receive prompt refunds.

The VA told investigators some of the fees were incorrectly assessed by lenders, not the VA. But agency officials said in their response to the report that they “generally agreed” with the investigation’s findings and are consulting lawyers about complexities related to issuing refunds.

The agency “has drafted a plan with contingencies ready for implementation depending on the (legal) opinion,” the VA response said. The agency did not elaborate on what the plan is or when refunds will be issued.

The U.S. Agriculture Department has good news it seemingly wants nobody to know about.

On April 23, the USDA released its “School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study,” with no news release, no fanfare. The link on the USDA website disappeared for several days after that and was altogether inaccessible before reappearing under a different URL.

The USDA says the study was “the first nationally representative, comprehensive assessment” of school meals after the implementation of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, a key initiative of the Obama administration that mandated healthy changes in food at schools.

The best news was that the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010), a multicomponent measure of diet quality, shot up dramatically for both school-provided breakfasts and lunches.

For the 2009-2010 school year, the score for breakfast was an abysmal 49.6 out of 100 (even lower than the overall American average of 59), rising to 71.3 by the 2014-2015 school year. In that same time frame, the lunch score went from 57.9 to 81.5. The score for whole grains in school meals went from 25 to 95 percent of the maximum score, and the score for greens and beans rose from 21 to 72 percent.

In addition, there was greater participation in school meal programs at schools with the highest healthy food standards. And the study found food waste, a troubling national problem in the lunchroom, remained relatively unchanged.

[Why banning ‘meal shaming’ isn’t enough]

The 52-page summary of study findings is chockablock with other good news, so why isn’t Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue crowing about it?

The USDA did not respond directly when asked about the rollout beyond a statement that said it conducts studies like this to inform choices on policies and program operations, and that “we intend to use it to make these great programs even better.”

“It seems fairly outside of the norm for a federal agency to release a study that directly contradicts what the administration’s position is,” explained Elizabeth Balkan, food waste director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “That’s why it was released very quietly.”

In December, Perdue announced the USDA was weakening school nutrition standards for whole grain, nonfat milk and sodium, all of which had been tightened during the Obama administration. He cited food waste and nonparticipation as key rationales for the shift.

“If kids are not eating what is being served, they are not benefiting, and food is being wasted,” he said at the time.

About two-thirds of the 30 million children who eat school meals every day qualify as low-income and are getting meals free or for a reduced price. Low-income kids are disproportionately affected by obesity and are less likely to be fed healthy meals at home, so the nutritional makeup of those school meals is impactful. Kids can get more than half of their daily calories from school meals.

[Spray cheese, beef jerky and stuffed olives to be counted as staples under Trump administration food stamp proposal]

“As a nutrition and public-health policymaker, what’s extraordinary is for a policy to have that large an effect, to affect tens of millions of school kids. If you consider the crisis that we face — people living shorter, less healthy lives — solutions usually take decades,” said Jerry Mande, a senior USDA official during the Obama administration who was involved in developing the standards. “Within two years there’s a dramatic change. This demonstrates the power the USDA has to change the way kids eat. We should be doubling down on this.”

Advocates say the push to roll back stricter requirements is consistent with President Trump’s overall mission of deregulation.

“Waste was the smokescreen,” said Margo Wootan, vice president for nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “There have been several studies that showed that food waste hadn’t increased.”

[Big Money Joins Fight Against $1 Trillion in Wasted Food]

Wootan enumerates many things that can be done — beyond making food saltier, fattier or more processed — to reduce food waste in schools. Have recess before lunch to work up hunger and don’t schedule lunch times midmorning before kids are peckish. Cut up apples instead of offering them whole. Offer taste tests and share tables and give students opportunities to provide more input. Perhaps most importantly, adopt an “offer versus serve” approach at elementary schools and middle schools (it is required at high schools). This means that students can select three out of five meal components and avoid things they don’t like and are likely to discard.

“The Trump administration wants to tick off the maximum number of regulations it can say it rolled back,” Wootan said. “It’s another tick mark on the deregulatory agenda.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 13.7 million, or 18.5 percent, of children aged 2 to 19 are obese. That percentage is higher for Hispanics (25.8 percent) and non-Hispanic blacks (22 percent).

The American Medical Association changed the term obesity from a condition into a disease in 2013. The CDC says obesity puts people at an increased risk for all causes of death, but it is linked to high blood pressure and cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and some cancers.

The School Nutrition Association, the trade group for school food-service manufacturers and school food professionals, has commended Perdue for seeking regulatory flexibility.

Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the association, says that although the study findings are very positive, the new standards have presented challenges for school districts.

“We’re seeing a lot of schools struggle with cultural preferences with students. Like white rice — some cultures don’t eat brown rice. And in the Southwest, there are students who are not familiar with a whole-grain tortilla.”

She also says that participation in school lunch programs has dropped, from 32 million to 30 million, under the new standards, and that as a result, costs per student have increased.

Schools are forced to rely more heavily on a la carte items (a sandwich, rather than the full meal with fruits, veggies and milk) to stay solvent.

Schools have also looked to restaurant practices, offering more customizable meals such as burritos made to order, to boost participation, and catering programs on the side to bolster revenue. Bottom line, she says: The cost of preparing the new style of meals frequently exceeds the cost of reimbursement.

However, that runs counter to the study’s finding that healthier meals did not impose a greater financial burden.

“There was no significant association between reported cost per NSLP (National School Lunch Program) lunch and the nutritional quality of the meals,” the study said. “That is, mean reported costs per NSLP lunch were not significantly higher in schools that prepared more-nutritious meals . . . than in schools that produced the least-nutritious meals.”"
"Did Trump Administration ‘Purge’ 200,000 VA Health Care Applications?",https://www.snopes.com,['Bethania Palma'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/06/07/trump-admin-va-applications/,"Five years have passed since Scott Davis testified before Congress about mismanagement at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a condition that resulted in almost a million backlogged applications and a sometimes deadly state of limbo for veterans waiting to get health care. On 13 May 2019, Davis penned a widely read opinion piece for the Washington Examiner in which he stated that despite a whirlwind of media attention in years past, the problem had hardly been resolved.

Despite President Donald Trump’s blasting the administration of his predecessor for the problem, Davis wrote, “The Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.”

“I tried in a very non-partisan way to say, two years after you made a big deal about this, this is happening on your watch,” Davis told us by phone. Davis is a former public affairs officer for VA Member Services, which deals with enrollment. Although he currently works in a different department, Davis is still employed by the VA.

The VA has taken issue with Davis’ use of the word “purge” in reference to applications, with spokeswoman Susan Carter telling us by email that it’s a “loaded term” and calling Davis’ opinion piece “misleading.” However, the VA confirmed that 208,272 veterans’ applications for health care had been moved from “pending” status to “closed” status between January and February (she did not specify the year). Once an application has been closed, the veteran must reapply for health care benefits.

Davis maintained taking issue with his terminology was just wordplay, and that no functional difference existed between “closing” and “purging” an application from the veteran’s perspective. “Offering the person the opportunity to reapply is not offering them anything,” Davis told us. “Intake is a very basic function of any government organization. If you can’t do that, that’s a problem. And that’s a problem that people in my opinion, from the president on down, should be concerned with, because this is the nation’s largest health care system.”

If a veteran applies to receive VA benefits but the application is incomplete, the person has a year to submit necessary additional information. During that time, the application is placed in “pending” status. After a year, in accordance with federal law, the application is placed in “closed” status by the VA, and the veteran is notified by letter how to reapply. The VA states it notified all veterans with incomplete applications via letter “that they are in pending status and that they have 365 days to complete their applications.”

Between January and May 2019, a total of 21,881 applications have been moved to “pending” status, according to Carter’s email. Davis sent us a copy of the VA’s Fiscal Year 2019 briefing book showing more than 317,000 applications currently in “pending” status. That same book shows over 270,000 applications in “closed” status.

Davis told us that known issues exist with the VA’s notification process dating back to a 2014 scandal that prompted Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump had been critical of the scandal. The VA Office of Inspector General determined in 2015 that “extensive, persistent problems with veterans’ health care enrollment records maintained by the [Health Eligibility Center or HEC]” existed.

Whistleblower Allegations

The 2015 report confirmed whistleblower allegations that the VA had 867,000 “pending” applications, and that of that backlog more than 307,000 were records associated with deceased veterans. But auditors were unable to determine how many of those were people who died while awaiting health care because of sloppy record-keeping by the VA. (The issue was widely misreported, and Trump asserted that all 307,000 cases were veterans who died awaiting care while their applications were pending.)

In 2017, auditors reported that the VA lacked an adequate, uniform system for enrolling veterans at the point of contact, VA health-care facilities. We asked the VA whether a national enrollment policy was enacted in response to that report, and spokeswoman Susan Carter told us a policy was “still under development.”

Carter also said that the VA makes thousands of attempts to reach veterans in “pending” status. The VA “regularly reaches out to Veterans both by mail and by phone. In this fiscal year alone, VA has made over 200,000 call attempts to Veterans with pending applications, and over 300,000 attempts to newly enrolled Veterans. On average over 27,000 calls are placed each month to Veterans with a pending [Veterans Health Administration] application to assist them with completing anything that is missing in order to reach an enrollment determination. VA makes six attempts with each Veteran over the course of one year.”

We asked how many of those attempts yielded verifiable contacts with veterans but have not yet received an answer to that question.

Letters by Mail

Davis questioned whether veterans ever received the letters or calls. He provided us an internal memo dated 30 November 2016 in which Health Eligibility Center (HEC) officials cautioned that tens of thousands of addresses had been flagged as potentially bad, while acknowledging that “although a letter was never returned by the postal service, we cannot say that the Veteran received it.”

“How many times do we all miss one letter in the mail? In 2019, that’s how they’re communicating? It’s ridiculous,” Davis said. “To say, ‘We sent a letter to people’ in 2019 — I know people in government don’t know how the internet works, but people under 60 aren’t running to the mailbox every day.”

The quality of VA health care for veterans, and the agency’s mismanagement of processes that help them get it, have for years been a focal point of public concern, but the controversy rose to the surface again in April 2019 amid news reports that four veterans had committed suicide at VA facilities in the span of one month. On that issue, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote:

Veteran suicide is an acute crisis wrapped in a national crisis. Between 2005 and 2016, suicide rates in the general population climbed 21%. For veterans, already taking their lives at twice the U.S. rate, it climbed 26%. More than 6,000 veterans are dying by their own hands each year – nearly 20 a day. The latest deaths renew questions about whether the VA, criticized and investigated for failing to provide timely or sufficient help to veterans, is doing enough to solve the problem. That is despite making suicide prevention a high priority in recent years.

We asked the VA how many veterans committed suicide while their applications were in “pending” status between January 2012 and May 2019 but received no response to that question."
"Carter Page says he consulted State Department, FBI, and CIA for years",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/carter-page-says-he-consulted-state-fbi-and-cia-for-years,"Former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page said he was a source for several agencies in the U.S. government for years before he became the subject of the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Working as an American consultant with Russia expertise, he told Fox News that over the years he spoke with the State Department, FBI, and the CIA.

""I was asked various questions, not only by State, FBI, et cetera, but also CIA,"" he said on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" ""I had a long-standing relationship with the CIA going back decades essentially, and I was always very transparent, open.""

Soon after he left the Trump campaign, Page became the subject of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants beginning in October 2016, which relied on British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier packed with unverified claims about President Trump's ties to Russia. Steele was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was itself being paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. The fact that the dossier had Democratic funding was not revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Page was also a subject of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. Although Mueller determined Russia meddled in election affairs, he did not accuse Page of coordinating with Russian agents and did not establish criminal conspiracy between the campaign and the Kremlin.

Page has been heavily critical of the Russia investigation and the media coverage of it, which he claimed was an effort to advance a narrative for impeachment.

""Unfortunately, it was completely spun that as you're correctly alluding to in this fake Mueller report, they just refer to this as oh, he's, you know, colluding, if you will, with these Russian intelligence officers,"" he said. ""I mean, I'm acting as a source, completely helping our government.""

""Oh, by the way, doing it for free,"" Page said, noting that this stands in stark contrast to conservative watchdog Judicial Watch's findings that the FBI made 11 payments to Steele in 2016 and the Democrats' ties to Russian oligarchs.

""So unethical,"" he said."
William Barr compares return to Justice Department to D-Day invasion,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Andrew Blake']",06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/8/william-barr-compares-return-to-justice-department/,"Attorney General William Barr drew parallels Friday between his return to the Department of Justice and Allied soldiers invading Nazi-occupied Friday during World War II.

“This is my second stint as attorney general,” Mr. Barr said during an address to incoming FBI agents. “My arrival this time was a little more eventful than I recall it being the last time.”

“As we’ve been watching the coverage of June 6, 1944 — D-Day — I had the thought that my arrival this time felt a little bit, I think, like jumping into Sainte-Mère-Église on the morning of June 5, trying to figure out where you could land without getting shot,” he said.

Less than 10 miles west of Utah beach, U.S. paratroopers were airdropped into Sainte-Mère-Église on the morning of D-Day during the start of the unprecedented Allied invasion of Normandy, France, where President Trump visited Thursday the week to commemorate the operation’s 75th anniversary. The invasion paved the way for an Allied victory the following year, albeit not without costing the lives of several thousands of U.S. troops and other soldiers.

Mr. Barr, 69, served as attorney general under former President George H.W. Bush between 1991 to 1993. He was nominated for another term in 2018 by Mr. Trump to succeed Jeff Sessions, and he was confirmed by the Senate in February despite opposition from Democrats, who are considering holding a vote in the House of Representatives next week to potentially hold Mr. Barr in contempt for failing to comply with a congressional subpoena.

Someday the U.S. Will Have to Actually Deal With Its Nuclear Waste Problem,https://slate.com,['Jane C. Hu'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/department-of-energy-nuclear-waste-reclassification-yucca.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Jeff J. Mitchell—WPA Pool/Getty Images.

Of all the things in the world to worry about, nuclear waste management is not at the top of most people’s lists. We trust (or hope, at least) that expert scientists and policymakers will make good decisions about how to make sure radioactive byproducts stay far, far away from us, by whatever means possible. But, many of those experts say, we’re going to need to figure out a new way to manage our country’s nuclear waste—and soon.

To that end, the Department of Energy announced Wednesday that they are reclassifying the definition of “high-level,” or highly radioactive, waste stored in underground tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. The DOE hopes that the redefinition will expedite cleanup of the waste. Currently, the high-level waste stored at these sites is waiting for the government to open a secure waste repository (like Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which has been in limbo for decades). But if some of the less radioactive waste qualifies under the new definition, it might instead be shipped off to other sites, like one in Texas, where it could be mixed with “concrete-like grout.” The cleanup at Hanford has already cost the country billions of dollars and is projected to cost billions more as we continue the search for the waste’s final home. (Adding some urgency to developing a new plan is the risk that containers could leak and contaminate the environment, especially if there’s an earthquake in Washington.)

The DOE’s new plan could be cost-effective, sure, but the question is whether it’s safe. When the agency first announced reclassification plans in October 2018 and solicited public comment, the proposal received thousands of responses. And Washington state officials are not happy; Gov. Jay Inslee and Department of Ecology Director Maia Bellon have both sent letters of concern to the DOE. “I am gravely concerned with DOE forging ahead with a new interpretation of HLW that does not comport with federal law, despite objections from Washington state,” wrote Bellon.

Some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts.

In addition to the waste we already have sitting around at Hanford and other old nuclear weapons facilities (charmingly called “legacy waste”), nearly 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 60 facilities around the U.S. are creating new waste every day. The type of waste produced by those two types of facility contains different radioactive materials with varying half-lives, but the same storage issues remain: What will we eventually do with all this radioactive stuff?

The lack of solution is not from lack of discussion. There have been all sorts of wacky ideas floated about where to store nuclear waste. Some have proposed we shoot it all into space, maybe have it orbit Venus. But given how spacecraft are prone to explosions, which would effectively mean showering the world with bits of radioactive waste, that idea stalled. In the ’90s, the idea of burying waste in deep ocean seabeds seemed promising, but it never really got off the ground. And some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts. As the earth thaws out, old waste becomes uncovered.

Here in the U.S., we’re running out of space, and experts are concerned about the lack of long-term solutions. “Instead of a planned, coherent system, we have the confusion of an unplanned, less than optimal system,” nuclear experts wrote in a 2018 report on nuclear waste management strategy and policy, calling the U.S. program “an ever-tightening Gordian Knot” subject to technical, scientific, logistical, regulatory, legal, financial, social, and political challenges. “This is not a situation that builds public confidence.”

Currently, we’re at a standstill. In 1987, the government designated Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada as the storage facility for waste, but more than three decades later, proper approvals are still pending. Buckets of radioactive waste are still sitting around at the various facilities around the U.S., waiting for a place to go. While critics from environmental advocacy organizations like Columbia Riverkeeper and National Resource Defense Council have condemned the DOE’s reclassification, calling it “irresponsible,” “outrageous,” and an “attempt to cut corners,” local government welcomed the new policy. Richland, Washington, Mayor Bob Thompson told the Tri-City Herald that the decision was a “fantastic opportunity” to speed up Hanford’s cleanup.

We could avoid adding to the problem by trying to reduce the amount of waste generated. One way to do that is to recycle. By separating out uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, engineers can reuse those in reactors to generate additional energy and throw out the rest. “Ninety-five percent of original energy is in the unused fuel,” says Kathryn Huff, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois, who likens the process to recycling a soda can: You wash out the sugar and dirt to reuse the aluminum. By reusing fuel, nuclear plants could cut down on the amount of space they need for waste containment by an order or two of magnitude.

On that front, countries like France, the U.K., and Japan are way ahead of us. France, in particular, leads the game; it generates about 80 percent of its energy through nuclear plants, but thanks to its recycling site, called La Hague, the waste currently fits “in a room not significantly bigger than a basketball court,” says Huff. Of course, the U.S. is a far bigger country than France, we’ve run our reactors for longer, and we have a lot more waste already sitting around, so we’ll never shrink our waste pile to that size. But La Hague is a testament to how the amount of true waste can be reduced through reprocessing.

Adopting recycling is subject to many of the same logistical and regulatory pitfalls as building a repository. For one, recycling is more expensive, and without regulatory pressure to change existing systems, commercial nuclear energy plants may not want to pony up the cash. (Opponents of reprocessing, like the Union of Concerned Scientists, also point to high costs of reprocessing, estimating it could cost tens or even hundreds of billions to implement.) Beyond the costs of just reprocessing waste, we’d also have to build critical infrastructure, like recycling facilities and retrofitting of existing reactors to accept recycled fuel. France’s energy system is government-run, and its government has decided to invest the money to have less waste sitting around in the long term.

To make progress on recycling, or building a repository, or even having a coherent plan for the roughly 80,000 metric tons of waste in our country, experts say any decisions about nuclear management need to be removed from the political cycle. “The instability in the dynamics of American politics makes it a challenge to develop a sustainable program,” says Huff. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, a group of experts assembled by the Obama administration in 2012, brought up similar concerns in its recommendations and suggested that the government establish an entirely new government entity to oversee nuclear waste policy. “The overall record of DOE and of the federal government as a whole, however, has not inspired widespread confidence or trust in our nation’s nuclear waste management program,” the commission wrote in the final report. “The Commission concludes that a new, single-purpose organization is needed … to get the waste program back on track.” Members recommended also that this organization would solicit active consent from affected communities and implement policies that would provide continuity from administration to administration.

But until then, it seems inevitable that the rules will keep shifting, and we’ll keep passing the buck on the problem of waste management. What’s now “high-level” waste seems destined to be reclassified, but it’s also possible that the next administration could change the definition right back. Unless the government moves toward a longer-term solution, we’ll likely be stuck in limbo until something catastrophic happens, the waste’s radioactivity decreases over thousands of years, or the world ends—whichever comes first.

The Department of Veterans Affairs issued more than $280 million in excessive fess between 2012 and 2017, and took no action despite knowing that veterans were owed refunds, the VA Inspector General report found.

In many cases, third-party lenders rely on the VA to certify that a veteran is exempt from certain fees when applying for a home loan. But its exemption certificates were “outdated, incorrect, or missing exemption status resulting in veterans being incorrectly charged a funding fee,” according to the report.

The Under Secretary for Benefits responded to the report by saying the problem would be corrected by the end of July.

Although most cases involved veterans becoming exempt from the fees only after they were issued, investigators found the VA did not implement its own policy to identify and refund the charges.

“Requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” the report stated.

The fees averaged $4,000 and some were considerably higher. One was for $19,470.

More than half of the 72,900 veterans who are entitled to refunds have yet to be paid by the VA.

When the issue was first identified in 2014, an analysis estimated that 48,000 veterans were owed as much as $151 million in overpaid fees.

When asked why corrective action wasn’t taken at the time, current and former leaders of the loan office said they were “focused on other competing priorities” and said they faced “historically high loan volumes” in the following years, according to the inspector general."
U.S. and Mexico Issue Joint Declaration on Migration and Tariffs,https://www.nytimes.com,['Liam Stack'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/state-department-mexico-trump.html,"President Trump pulled back from his plan to impose tariffs on all Mexican imports, saying on Friday night on Twitter that the United States and Mexico had reached an agreement to reduce the number of migrants entering the United States over the southwestern border.

The tariffs, which could have been potentially crippling for Mexico, were to go into effect on Monday. Mr. Trump’s announcement came after several days of intense negotiations between the two countries in Washington.

“The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended,” Mr. Trump wrote just before 8:30 p.m. “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border.”

Here is a joint statement by the United States and Mexico released by the State Department on Friday night:

“The United States and Mexico met this week to address the shared challenges of irregular migration, to include the entry of migrants into the United States in violation of U.S. law. Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution."
"DHS watchdog finds spoiled food, nooses at multiple immigration detention centers",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/dhs-oig-watchdog-spoiled-food-nooses-immigration-detention-centers-b5796c0ff257/,"The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report Thursday detailing the horrific conditions at immigration detention centers across the United States. Inspectors found “immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards” including nooses in detainee cells, overuse of solitary confinement, and spoiled food, among other issues.

DHS OIG inspected four Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, including the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado, the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, and the Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey.

According to the report, the “inspections of the four detention facilities revealed violations of ICE’s detention standards and raised concerns about the environment in which detainees are held.”

OIG described the food service issues at Adelanto and Essex as “egregious.” At Adelanto, “lunch meat and cheese were mixed and stored uncovered in

large walk-in refrigerators,” while chicken “smelled foul and appeared to be spoiled.” Food in the freezer was also expired. At Essex, “open packages of raw chicken leaked blood all over refrigeration units” and “lunch meat was slimy, foulsmelling and appeared to be spoiled.”

All of the facilities demonstrated “serious issues with the administrative and disciplinary segregation of detainees” that violate ICE detention standards and infringe on detainee rights, the report read.

The findings confirm what most immigration activist groups and some progressive members of Congress have been clamoring about for months: ICE is routinely violating the human rights of the individuals in its custody.

“The report’s findings reveal that issues in ICE detention are not isolated — they are systemic,” Freedom for Immigrants, a non-profit that has been monitoring the conditions at Adelanto and other ICE facilities for years, said in a statement. “And yet, not one single entity in this detention apparatus is ever held accountable for these human rights violations. This is outrageous. More and more evidence points to the fact that ICE and private prison companies like GEO are incapable of providing for the well-being of immigrants. That’s why we must abolish detention. It’s time to implement humane community-based alternatives that treat people with dignity and respect.”

While ICE standards require facilities to place detainees in disciplinary segregation only after they have committed a prohibited act, Adelanto, Essex, and Aurora punished immigrant detainees with solitary confinement for unproven disciplinary violations. Detainees in solitary were found to have limited access to recreation and even showers despite ICE standards mandating that individuals have access to these basic resources.

At the facility’s bathrooms, OIG observed mold throughout all the

walls in the bathroom area, including ceilings, vents, mirrors, and shower

stalls. Prolonged exposure to mold and mildew can lead to allergic reactions and long-term health issues.

Immigrants in detention are required to receive toiletries including including shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste, lotion, and soap. At Essex, however, detainees reported not having received any toiletries. Staff at the facility told inspectors that toiletries must be purchased through the commissary, which is against ICE standards.

At Aurora, visitation rooms go unused. DHS OIG found that while the facility is capable of hosting in-person visitation, it only allows “non-contact visits” — even to children and family.

ICE standards mandate “that detainees shall be able to maintain morale and ties through visitation with their families, the community, legal representatives and consular officials, within the constraints of the safety, security and good order of the facility.”

Three of the four detention centers that were inspected are operated by GEO Group, a private prison company that contracts with the federal government.

GEO Group, among other similar companies like CoreCivic, has greatly benefited from the Trump administration’s increase in immigration enforcement. ICE is detaining more people than ever before, a record-breaking 52,000, and GEO Group is making money off of it. Just this week the private prison company announced a 314 bed expansion at the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas. The expansion would bring the total bed count to 1,314. The company is expected to rake in $10 million as a result."

Elijah Cummings was denied a request for documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo legal DOJ, Commerce reject Dem subpoenas for census docs

The Justice and Commerce departments on Thursday rejected House Democratic demands for more documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, likely leading to contempt citations for Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

In a letter to Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the documents the panel subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.

Story Continued Below

“[T]he committee’s insistence that the department immediately turn over these documents ... is improper,” Boyd wrote, adding that the Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of documents and made officials available for interviews.

A Commerce Department spokesperson accused the committee of trying to interfere with ongoing litigation that centers on the constitutionality of the citizenship question appearing on the census.

“In its zeal to influence the Supreme Court’s decision, the committee is poised to hold Secretary Ross in contempt,” the spokesperson said. “Holding the secretary in contempt is an empty stunt, and it shows that the committee is simply interested in playing politics.”

The Democrat-led committee gave the Justice Department and the Commerce Department until 5 p.m. on Thursday to comply with its subpoenas, threatening to initiate contempt proceedings absent compliance.

Cummings said his committee gave Barr and Ross every opportunity to provide the documents but they didn’t cooperate and made no counteroffers.

“They seem determined to continue the Trump Administration’s cover-up,” he said in a statement.

The committee has been investigating the decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, with lawmakers accusing the Trump administration — Ross in particular — of lying about its origins.

New evidence emerged last week that the administration allegedly “concealed” the role of now-deceased Republican gerrymandering expert Thomas Hofeller, who believed that adding a citizenship question to the census would boost Republicans in future elections.

The Trump administration has said it is simply trying to enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have argued that such a question would create an undercount of ethnic and racial minorities, resulting in newly drawn congressional districts that would diminish their influence in American elections.

Cummings said this week that the Trump administration was seeking “to gerrymander congressional districts in overtly racist, partisan and unconstitutional ways,” and he accused the Trump administration of a “coverup.” Republicans on the committee have said that holding Barr and Ross in contempt is an effort to improperly interfere with ongoing court proceedings about the census question.

The subpoenas, which were first authorized in April, required the Justice and Commerce departments to turn over all communications with the White House, the Republican National Committee, and President Donald Trump’s campaign, among other entities. The subpoenas also sought memos and witness testimony.

One of those witnesses, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore, refused to answer lawmakers’ specific questions about his role in drafting a DOJ memo, requesting the addition of a citizenship question, and he later skipped a scheduled deposition with the committee.

In a statement, the Justice Department said Gore had “never heard of” Hofeller’s work, and added that it “played no role in the department’s December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question.”

Barr is expected to be formally held in contempt of Congress in a separate matter on Tuesday, when the House is scheduled to vote on a contempt citation for his refusal to turn over former special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report and underlying evidence, allowing the House Judiciary Committee to enforce its subpoena in federal court.

The contempt resolution will also allow other committees to enforce their subpoenas without requiring a full House vote.

"More Than 100,000 Americans Urge EPA To Restrict Unnecessary Use of Monsanto’s Weedkiller on Oats",https://www.ewg.org,[],,,,https://www.ewg.org/release/more-100000-americans-urge-epa-restrict-unnecessary-use-monsanto-s-weedkiller-oats,"WASHINGTON – This week, more than 100,000 Americans officially joined EWG and 20 companies calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to significantly restrict the use of Monsanto’s weedkiller glyphosate on oats as a pre-harvest drying agent.

A coalition of companies and public interest groups, led by EWG and Megafood, gathered 104,952 signatures on online petitions to the EPA, urging the agency to lower the tolerance limit of glyphosate in oats and prohibit its pre-harvest use. The names of those who signed the petitions were submitted to EPA on Wednesday.

The EPA’s legal limit for glyphosate residues on oats is 30 parts per million, or ppm. The petition, first filed last September, asks the agency to set a more protective standard of 0.1 ppm, which was the legal limit in 1993.

“Administrator Andrew Wheeler and the EPA could quickly remove one of the more concerning routes of dietary exposure to glyphosate for children by restricting the unnecessary use of glyphosate on oats,” said EWG Legislative Director Colin O’Neil. “Americans are demanding the agency act to protect the public and the food supply from being contaminated with this toxic weedkiller linked to cancer.”

“It’s hard to find 100,000 people who agree on anything,” O’Neil said. “But when it comes to feeding themselves and their families, they agree that we should not have to worry whether eating healthy, oat-based foods for breakfast could come with a dose of glyphosate.”

The petition was amended this week and submitted to the EPA docket to include additional companies that have signed on since last year.

Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Bayer-Monsanto’s Roundup, is the most widely used pesticide in the world. It is largely used as a weedkiller on genetically modified corn and soybeans. But it is increasingly being used for crop management and applied pre-harvest to a number of non-genetically engineered crops, including oats.

Glyphosate kills the crop, drying it out so it can be harvested sooner than if the plant were allowed to die naturally. This is very likely one of the leading sources of dietary exposure for people who consume foods made with oat-based foods, like cereal and oatmeal.

Two rounds of laboratory tests commissioned by EWG found glyphosate in nearly every sample of oat-based cereal and other breakfast products at levels higher than what EWG scientists consider protective for children’s health with an adequate margin of safety.

On June 12, EWG will release results of its latest tests, which will include additional oat-based cereals and other foods that were not analyzed for glyphosate in the two earlier rounds.

A 2017 study by a team of California scientists estimate that between 2014 and 2016, at least 70 percent of American adults surveyed had detectable levels of the cancer-causing weedkiller in their bodies. That compares to 12 percent in American adults between 1993 and 1996, just before the use of glyphosate started to surge with the advent of GMO crops designed to withstand direct application of the chemical.

In 2015, 17 of the world’s top cancer researchers convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer reviewed hundreds of studies on glyphosate and voted unanimously to classify the weedkiller as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” In 2017, California added glyphosate to its official list of chemicals known to cause cancer.

These companies are cosigners of the petition to the EPA: MegaFood, Ben & Jerry’s, Stonyfield Farm, MOM’s Organic Market, Nature’s Path, One Degree Organic Foods, National Co+op Grocers, Happy Family Organics, Amy’s Kitchen, Clif Bar & Company, Earth’s Best Organic, GrandyOats, INFRA, KIND Healthy Snacks, Lundberg Family Farms, Organic Valley, Patagonia Provisions, PCC Community Markets, Foodstirs and Kamut International, Ltd.

At two facilities in California and New Jersey, the investigators said they found ""immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards,"" including ""nooses in detainee cells"" and ""inadequate medical care.""

Expired food and health issues were found at all four facilities mentioned in the report released this week. CNN first obtained details of the report.

The newly released report comes on the heels of another Homeland Security oversight investigation that found overcrowded and unsanitary conditions at migrant holding facilities along the border.

Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source,https://thehill.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/447394-key-figure-that-mueller-report-linked-to-russia-was-a-state-department,"In a key finding of the Mueller report, Ukrainian businessman Konstantin KilimnikKonstantin KilimnikKey figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Ex-GOP lawmaker says Trump 'illegitimate president,' should be impeached MORE, who worked for Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortKey figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Ocasio-Cortez says Manafort, others should be released from solitary confinement MORE, is tied to Russian intelligence.

But hundreds of pages of government documents — which special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSchiff says Intel panel will hold 'series' of hearings on Mueller report Schiff says Intel panel will hold 'series' of hearings on Mueller report Key House panel faces pivotal week on Trump MORE possessed since 2018 — describe Kilimnik as a “sensitive” intelligence source for the U.S. State Department who informed on Ukrainian and Russian matters.

Why Mueller’s team omitted that part of the Kilimnik narrative from its report and related court filings is not known. But the revelation of it comes as the accuracy of Mueller’s Russia conclusions face increased scrutiny.

ADVERTISEMENT

The incomplete portrayal of Kilimnik is so important to Mueller’s overall narrative that it is raised in the opening of his report. “The FBI assesses” Kilimnik “to have ties to Russian intelligence,” Mueller’s team wrote on Page 6, putting a sinister light on every contact Kilimnik had with Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman.

What it doesn’t state is that Kilimnik was a “sensitive” intelligence source for State going back to at least 2013 while he was still working for Manafort, according to FBI and State Department memos I reviewed.

Kilimnik was not just any run-of-the-mill source, either.

He interacted with the chief political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, sometimes meeting several times a week to provide information on the Ukraine government. He relayed messages back to Ukraine’s leaders and delivered written reports to U.S. officials via emails that stretched on for thousands of words, the memos show.

The FBI knew all of this, well before the Mueller investigation concluded.

Alan Purcell, the chief political officer at the Kiev embassy from 2014 to 2017, told FBI agents that State officials, including senior embassy officials Alexander Kasanof and Eric Schultz, deemed Kilimnik to be such a valuable asset that they kept his name out of cables for fear he would be compromised by leaks to WikiLeaks.

“Purcell described what he considered an unusual level of discretion that was taken with handling Kilimnik,” states one FBI interview report that I reviewed. “Normally the head of the political section would not handle sources, but Kasanof informed Purcell that KILIMNIK was a sensitive source.”

Purcell told the FBI that Kilimnik provided “detailed information about OB (Ukraine’s opposition bloc) inner workings” that sometimes was so valuable it was forwarded immediately to the ambassador. Purcell learned that other Western governments relied on Kilimnik as a source, too.

“One time, in a meeting with the Italian embassy, Purcell heard the Italian ambassador echo a talking point that was strikingly familiar to the point Kilimnik had shared with Purcell,” the FBI report states.

Kasanof, who preceded Purcell as the U.S. Embassy political officer, told the FBI he knew Kilimnik worked for Manafort’s lobbying firm and the administration of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose Party of Regions hired Manafort’s firm.

Kasanof described Kilimnik as one of the few reliable insiders the U.S. Embassy had informing on Yanukovych. Kilimnik began his relationship as an informant with the U.S. deputy chief of mission in 2012–13, before being handed off to the embassy’s political office, the records suggest.

“Kilimnik was one of the only people within the administration who was willing to talk to USEMB,” referring to the U.S. Embassy, and he “provided information about the inner workings of Yanukovych’s administration,” Kasanof told the FBI agents.

“Kasanof met with Kilimnik at least bi-weekly and occasionally multiple times in the same week,” always outside the embassy to avoid detection, the FBI wrote. “Kasanof allowed Kilimnik to take the lead on operational security” for their meetings.

State officials told the FBI that although Kilimnik had Ukrainian and Russian residences, he did not appear to hold any allegiance to Moscow and was critical of Russia’s invasion of the Crimean territory of Ukraine.

“Most sources of information in Ukraine were slanted in one direction or another,” Kasanof told agents. “Kilimnik came across as less slanted than others.”

“Kilimnik was flabbergasted at the Russian invasion of Crimea,” the FBI added, summarizing Kasanof’s interview with agents.

Three sources with direct knowledge of the inner workings of Mueller’s office confirmed to me that the special prosecutor’s team had all of the FBI interviews with State officials, as well as Kilimnik’s intelligence reports to the U.S. Embassy, well before they portrayed him as a Russian sympathizer tied to Moscow intelligence or charged Kilimnik with participating with Manafort in a scheme to obstruct the Russia investigation.

Kasanof’s and Purcell’s interviews are corroborated by scores of State Department emails I reviewed that contain regular intelligence from Kilimnik on happenings inside the Yanukovych administration, the Crimea conflict and Ukrainian and Russian politics. For example, the memos show Kilimnik provided real-time intelligence on everything from whose star in the administration was rising or falling to efforts at stuffing ballot boxes in Ukrainian elections.

Those emails raise further doubt about the Mueller report’s portrayal of Kilimnik as a Russian agent. They show Kilimnik was allowed to visit the United States twice in 2016 to meet with State officials, a clear sign he wasn’t flagged in visa databases as a foreign intelligence threat.

The emails also show how misleading, by omission, the Mueller report’s public portrayal of Kilimnik turns out to be.

For instance, the report makes a big deal about Kilimnik’s meeting with Manafort in August 2016 at the Trump Tower in New York.

By that time, Manafort had served as Trump’s campaign chairman for several months but was about to resign because of a growing controversy about the millions of dollars Manafort accepted as a foreign lobbyist for Yanukovych’s party.

Specifically, the Mueller report flagged Kilimnik’s delivery of a peace plan to the Trump campaign for settling the two-year-old Crimea conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

“Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a ‘backdoor’ way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine,” the Mueller report stated.

But State emails showed Kilimnik first delivered a version of his peace plan in May 2016 to the Obama administration during a visit to Washington. Kasanof, his former handler at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, had been promoted to a top policy position at State, and the two met for dinner on May 5, 2016.

The day after the dinner, Kilimnik sent an email to Kasanof’s official State email address recounting the peace plan they had discussed the night before.

Russia wanted “a quick settlement” to get “Ukraine out of the way and get rid of sanctions and move to economic stuff they are interested in,” Kilimnik wrote Kasanof. The email offered eight bullet points for the peace plan — starting with a ceasefire, a law creating economic recovery zones to rebuild war-torn Ukrainian regions, and a “presidential decree on amnesty” for anyone involved in the conflict on both sides.

Kilimnik also provided a valuable piece of intelligence, stating that the old Yanukovych political party aligned with Russia was dead. “Party of Regions cannot be reincarnated. It is over,” he wrote, deriding as “stupid” a Russian-backed politician who wanted to restart the party.

Kasanof replied the next day that, although he was skeptical of some of the intelligence on Russian intentions, it was “very important for us to know.”

He thanked Kilimnik for the detailed plan and added, “I passed the info to my bosses, who are chewing it over.” Kasanof told the FBI that he believed he sent Kilimnik’s peace plan to two senior State officials, including Victoria Nuland, President Obama’s assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs.

So Kilimnik’s delivery of the peace plan to the Trump campaign in August 2016 was flagged by Mueller as potentially nefarious, but its earlier delivery to the Obama administration wasn’t mentioned. That’s what many in the intelligence world might call “deception by omission.”

Lest you wonder, the documents I reviewed included evidence that Kasanof’s interview with the FBI and Kilimnik’s emails to State about the peace plan were in Mueller’s possession by early 2018, more than a year before the final report.

Officials for the State Department, the FBI, the Justice Department and Mueller’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Kilimnik did not respond to an email seeking comment but, in an email last month to The Washington Post, he slammed the Mueller report’s “made-up narrative” about him. “I have no ties to Russian or, for that matter, any intelligence operation,” he wrote.

Kilimnik holds Ukrainian and Russian citizenship, served in the Soviet military, attended a prestigious Russian language academy and had contacts with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. So it is likely he had contacts over the years with Russian intelligence figures. There also is evidence Kilimnik left the U.S.-funded International Republican Institute (IRI) in 2005 because of concerns about his past connections to Russia, though at least one IRI witness disputed that evidence to the FBI, the memos show.

Yet, omitting his extensive, trusted assistance to the State Department seems inexplicable.

If Mueller’s team can cast such a misleading portrayal of Kilimnik, however, it begs the question of what else might be incorrect or omitted in the report.

Elijah Cummings indicates he will move ahead with contempt vote against Barr and Ross,https://www.cnn.com,['Laura Jarrett'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/doj-2020-census-response-house-oversight/index.html,"(CNN) The chairman of the House Oversight Committee indicated Friday morning that he will proceed with a contempt vote against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over a dispute about documents regarding a potential citizenship question on the 2020 census.

The Department of Justice said on Thursday it was working to get the committee more documents in response to a subpoena for the information, but said some materials the panel has requested will continue to be withheld. Justice is also refusing to allow John Gore, a senior official in the civil rights division, to appear before the committee without department counsel in the room -- which the committee has thus far refused to allow.

House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, however, said that offer was insufficient.

""We gave Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross every opportunity to produce the documents the Committee needs for our investigation, but rather than cooperate, they have decided that they would rather be held in contempt of Congress,"" Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement Friday morning. ""They produced none of the documents we asked for, they made no counter-offers regarding these documents, and they seem determined to continue the Trump Administration's cover-up.""

Cummings had said Monday he would postpone the contempt vote if the Commerce and the Justice departments produced the materials the committee had previously requested.

Glyphosate Resistant Wheat Found in Washington State,https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/glyphosate-resistant-wheat-found-in-washington-state,"Wheat plants resistant to glyphosate herbicide have been discovered in Washington State, for the third time since the development of glyphosate resistant wheat was scrapped in 2013. This is the second occurrence in Washington State.

USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to issue the following statement:

“USDA is collaborating with our state, industry and trading partners, and we are committed to providing all our partners with timely and transparent information about our findings.

“There are no GE wheat varieties for sale or in commercial production in the United States at this time, as APHIS has not deregulated any GE wheat varieties.

“After previous detections of GE wheat, USDA strengthened its oversight of regulated GE wheat field trials. APHIS now requires developers to apply for a permit for field trials involving GE wheat beginning with GE wheat planted on or after January 1, 2016. Bringing GE wheat under permit enables APHIS to create and enforce permit conditions that ensure confinement and minimize the risk that the regulated GE wheat will persist in the environment.

“This detection is a result of events occurring before USDA strengthened its oversight of regulated GE wheat trials.

The U.S. Wheat Associates and National Association of Wheat Growers issued a joint statement Friday in response to the discovery.

“We appreciate that USDA is collaborating with our organizations and our state, industry and trading partners to provide timely and transparent information about their findings as they investigate this discovery. We understand samples of the wheat plants from the field in Washington were sent to the USDA Federal Grain Inspection Service lab in Kansas City, MO, as well as USDA Agricultural Research lab in Pullman, WA, for testing and confirmation.

“We cannot speculate or comment about any potential market reactions until we learn more from APHIS and have a chance to discuss the situation in more detail with overseas customers. Based on what we know today from APHIS, we are confident that nothing has changed the U.S. wheat supply chain’s ability to deliver wheat that matches every customer’s specifications.”"

Reagan in 1984 became the first U.S. president to visit the shores of Normandy to mark the anniversary of allied forces invading occupied France, a day remembered as the turning point for the allies against Nazi Germany in World War II.

David Hume Kennerly/Getty Images, FILE

""These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,"" Reagan said in a speech on the 40th anniversary.

Reagan’s predecessor, President Jimmy Carter, actually was the first U.S. president to visit the site, in 1978, but his visit did not coincide with the anniversary.

Many presidents since Reagan have continued the tradition of visiting on the anniversary, an act of remembrance for the lives lost that day and to celebrate their contribution to the ultimate victory of the allied forces.

Ten years after Reagan’s visit marking the 40th anniversary, President Bill Clinton also made the pilgrimage.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

The Homeland Security watchdog has agreed to an outside review of its performance following missteps that led it to retract 13 audits of disaster responses that hid problems and instead flattered the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The outside review will be done by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that Homeland Security’s monitor has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA, officials said.

The peer review, to be completed next year, comes after an unusual internal investigation uncovered a disturbing pattern at the oversight agency responsible for rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the sprawling Department of Homeland Security.

John V. Kelly, now the acting inspector general, overrode auditors who flew to communities affected by hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters from 2011 to 2016 to assess how well FEMA helped local residents recover, according to the internal investigation. It said auditors often discovered problems with the response, but Kelly, then in charge of the auditing teams, instead directed them to write what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed its oversight of FEMA’s disaster response with ‘feel good’ reports]

Under pressure from Congress, the inspector general’s office purged the faulty reports from its website in 2017 and 2018 and acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards. Then the watchdog spent 14 months examining what went wrong.

It released an internal investigation in May that found fault with Kelly, his managers and their oversight of a staff that was supposed to offer real-time oversight from the ground of FEMA’s disaster response.

Kelly apologized to his staff of 600 auditors and investigators and took responsibility for failing to “set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

Federal inspectors general are traditionally evaluated by their peers every three years. The Homeland Security inspector general asked to have its next review in 2020, a year early.

Following a report Thursday in The Washington Post, two top Democrats in Congress called on the inspector general’s office to do better.

“We rely on [the office] for fact-based products that are invaluable in conducting oversight, and these reports did not meet the standard,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement.

Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the failures underscore the urgency for the Senate to confirm a permanent inspector general.

“Any effort to gloss over real challenges . . . limits the ability of federal, state and local governments to learn from their mistakes and improve performance for future disasters,” Peters said in a statement.

President Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office.

The office said it is making changes that include more rigorous training of auditors to improve their objectivity, more reliance on direct sources to document their findings and rotating assignments.

The internal review also prompted the agency to address poor employee morale. Deputy Inspector General Jennifer Costello, in her written response, said she wanted “equal measures of self-awareness and accountability” and acknowledged a need for stronger leadership.

The office ranked 303 of 415 of departments that operate as part of larger agencies in last year’s Best Places to Work in the Federal Government survey, and has hovered at the bottom for years.

Charles K. Edwards, the acting inspector general under President Barack Obama, was found by a Senate oversight panel in 2014 to have altered and delayed investigations at the request of senior administration officials, compromising his role as an independent watchdog.

Edwards routinely socialized with department leaders and gave them inside information about the timing and findings of investigations, the report found. And he improperly acquiesced to requests from top political advisers to then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to change the wording and timing of three separate reports.

In an email Thursday, inspector general spokeswoman Erica Paulson said the office is addressing poor morale, appointing an ombudsman, creating an employee advisory council and encouraging more communication between managers and their staffs.

The inspector general “workforce remains focused and dedicated to our mission: rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in DHS programs and operations and issuing high-impact, high-value oversight reports,” Paulson said in a statement.

“While disheartening, the mistakes on this small percentage of our work should not diminish confidence in the great work that this office has done and continues to do on behalf of the American taxpayers.”

Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency watchdog gave Homeland Security a rating of “pass with deficiencies” after reviewing a sample of audits. The black mark came primarily from one audit: The assessment of FEMA’s performance after catastrophic flooding in southern Louisiana in 2016.

The EPA review identified a variety of shortcomings with the audit, including poor supervision and issues with how the staff assessed FEMA’s performance.

“As a result, the audit report may not present a complete assessment of the issues affecting the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) response to the 2016 Louisiana,” reviewers found. The internal investigation supported EPA’s conclusions."
"CNN analyst Mudd: Christopher Steele should not talk to DOJ, could turn into 'car wreck'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cnn-phil-mudd-christopher-steele-should-not-talk-to-doj,"A former FBI official and frequent critic of President Trump said Tuesday that Christopher Steele should avoid being questioned by the Justice Department, warning it could turn out disastrously for the former British spy.

Phil Mudd was responding on CNN to reports that Steele agreed to be questioned by investigators about his salacious and unverified dossier on Trump's ties to Russia.

Steele's interview would reportedly happen within weeks in London and it would come on the heels of Attorney General Bill Barr appointing a U.S. attorney to review the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.

The DOJ inspector general is also looking into how Steele's Democrat-funded dossier was used by the FBI to secure surveillance warrants for a former Trump campaign adviser in 2016, despite questions about its credibility.

Mudd said this could turn into a ""car wreck"" for Steele if he goes forward.

""If you go to car races looking for car wrecks, this is significant. This will be a car wreck,"" said Mudd, doubting whether Steele will have sufficient answers on how he compiled the dossier.

“I can’t believe he has perfect answers about the origins of the Steele dossier. I’m not even sure why he’s showing up. If I were him, I’d go to Disney World. I would not go to the Department of Justice, because it will not end up well,"" he said.

Mudd then speculated that Steele wants to be interviewed in an attempt to clear his name so he can resume doing the same kind of work in the private sector.

“Let me give you how this game ends. Christopher Steele shows up in front of the Department of Justice and I’m guessing doesn’t have terrific answers for the quality of the information in that Steele dossier,” said Mudd.

Republicans have long accused former FBI officials of relying too heavily on Steele's dossier in 2016, when a counterintelligence investigation was launched into the Trump campaign."
EPA cleanup of old Vermont copper mine in final phase,https://www.wcax.com,[],,,,https://www.wcax.com/content/news/511050731.html,"An official with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says the final phase of the cleanup of the former Elizabeth Mine in Vermont is underway.

In 2001 the EPA declared the South Strafford property a Superfund site, citing the acid- and metal-contaminated water that had been leaching from waste rock and tailings into streams feeding the west branch of the Ompompanoosuc River.

The 150-year-old copper mine closed in 1958.

The Valley News reports the EPA has spent almost $90 million to contain the contamination that was leaking from the mine.

The EPA estimates that the amount of copper flowing into the Ompompanoosuc has fallen 99%, while the concentration of iron dropped 95%.

The river has been removed from the list of Vermont waterways too ""impaired"" to support aquatic life.

Congressional Democrats Demand State Dept. End ‘Disturbing’ Policy Denying Citizenship to Kids of LGBT Couples,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Scott Bixby', 'National Reporter']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senate-democrats-demand-state-dept-reverse-disturbing-policy-denying-citizenship-to-kids-of-lgbt-couples,"Nearly one hundred members of Congress, including five presidential candidates, have added their names to a pair of letters calling on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately reverse a State Department policy that withholds American citizenship from some children of U.S. citizens who are born abroad.

One letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Kamala Harris of California and signed by 17 other Democratic members of the chamber, calls the policy “a thinly veiled attack on LGBTQ Americans whose children are conceived through the use of egg donors and gestational surrogacy.”

“Your Department’s reinterpretation of immigration law to deny the constitutional right of citizenship to the children of same-sex couples who are born outside the United States is extraordinary and deeply disturbing,” the letter states. The letter’s 19 signatories urge Pompeo to immediately drop the State Department’s appeal of a court ruling striking down the policy, “and make it clear that every U.S. married couple is entitled to the same rights under the U.S. Constitution, no matter whom they love.”

In addition to Merkley and Harris, the letter was signed by Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Udall (D-NM), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Another letter, signed by the co-chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and every gay, lesbian and bisexual member of the House of Representatives, was delivered to Pompeo on Thursday afternoon. In that letter, the 80 signatories called the policy “discriminatory and cruel.”

“Welcoming a new child into a family should be a time of joy and excitement, but instead it is being met by your Department treating these couples differently than their different-sex counterparts,” the second letter, led by Reps. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), stated.

The policy in question changes the State Department’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a 1952 law that codifies eligibility for U.S. birthright citizenship. Under the policy, children born abroad via assisted reproductive technology like gestational surrogacy or sperm donation are considered to have been born “out of wedlock,” even if their parents are legally married U.S. citizens.

“Out of wedlock” births abroad face a bevy of legal and logistical hurdles to gaining birthright American citizenship, and the policy has led to numerous instances of the children of U.S. citizens being effectively turned away at the border.

“They basically take our marriage, and they say ‘It doesn’t mean anything. Your child was born out of wedlock,’” Adiel Kiviti, whose three-month-old daughter was born with the help of an egg donor and a gestational surrogate in Canada, told The Daily Beast last month. “We were there when she was born, she took her first breaths in our arms. Make no mistake: We are her parents—we are her only parents on her only birth certificate.”

“This is a very clear attack on families, on American families,” his husband Roee, who married Adiel in California in 2013, said at the time. “Denying American married couples their rights to pass their citizenship, that is flat-out discrimination, and everyone should be concerned about this.”

Two same-sex couples have sued the State Department over the policy, which they say disproportionately affects LGBT families, who stick out when seeking government documents that recognize the birthright citizenship of children born abroad.

The INA makes no reference to biology in determining birthright citizenship of children born abroad to married U.S. citizens, giving the policy little textual support in law. In February, a federal judge ruled that “the basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, and dismissed attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples as “unilateral.”

But the State Department has appealed that ruling, and has fought to summarily dismiss a suit brought by another same-sex couple against the policy.

The publication of a story by The Daily Beast on the policy brought renewed national attention to the issue, prompting nearly every Democratic presidential candidate, as well as senior congressional leadership, to call for the policy’s reversal.

“Once again, the Trump administration is demonstrating just how far they are willing to go to undermine our core values and advance their hateful agenda,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement last month. “The State Department must uphold our laws, end this cruel and inhumane policy and treat every family with the dignity and respect that they deserve.”

In the letter from Senate Democrats, signatories called the department’s legal defense of the policy part of a larger tapestry of decisions that have hurt LGBT Americans, from its decision to not grant visas to the same-sex partners of some foreign diplomats to what they called the “muted” response to anti-LGBT persecution abroad.

“Every new American parent should focus on celebrating the birth of a child, not be consumed with fear that all members of their family may not be welcomed back home to the United States,” the signatories wrote. “The United States can best advocate for LGBTQ rights around the world by living its values at home, especially during this month of Pride.”

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter."
"Bill Barr ""strayed from the ideals of the DOJ and everything it should stand for,"" Mimi Rocah says",https://www.salon.com,[],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/07/bill-barr-strayed-from-the-ideals-of-the-doj-and-everything-it-should-stand-for-mimi-rocah-says_partner/,"On Thursday, former federal prosecutor and NBC legal analyst Mimi Rocah wrote an editorial scorching Attorney General William Barr for spinning former special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, and then criticizing Mueller himself, in order to protect President Donald Trump.

“Over and over again, Barr seemed to bank on the fact that few people would actually read the full Mueller report and so Trump’s and Barr’s false narrative of ‘no collusion, no obstruction’ would be accepted in the media and by the public,” wrote Rocah. Now that the report is out and Mueller himself has contradicted this, “Barr has done what many good defense attorneys do — attack the investigation and the investigator,” insinuating there was misconduct in the investigation and going after Mueller’s prosecutorial judgment for not explicitly determining whether the president committed a crime.

“If Barr really thought that it was Mueller’s obligation to announce a conclusion about whether he thought Trump had committed a prosecutable crime, he could have directed Mueller (who worked for him) to render one,” said Rocah. “But Barr didn’t do that. And what about the other investigations into Trump? Shouldn’t any other United States attorney’s office with evidence of Trump’s participation in a crime announce their conclusions? The Southern District of New York has already implicated Trump in a campaign finance fraud scheme. This is surely not the outcome Barr intends, but it is the logical outgrowth of his critique of Mueller.”

In contrast to Mueller, who made clear the precedent he was following in his investigation and analysis, Barr is muddying the waters on the basic issues.

“If Mueller had indeed made a mistake in his legal analysis, it would be within Barr’s power to correct that. But nothing about what Barr has said suggests any error by Mueller,” said Rocah. “In his April 18 press conference, Barr claimed that because Trump was ‘frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks,’ these were ‘non-corrupt motives’ that weighed ‘heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.’ That logic is laughable. Most people charged with obstruction of justice (or any crime) are frustrated and angry. That doesn’t negate the seemingly illegitimate and corrupt motives Trump had when attempting to impede the Mueller investigation and other federal investigations. There is just no question that the ‘angry and frustrated’ defense would not be recognized in federal court by a judge or a jury.

Similarly, Rocah added, Barr’s claim that obstruction requires an underlying crime to be proven is not true. “There are dozens of examples of cases brought by the DOJ under different administrations of people prosecuted for obstruction and perjury where no underlying crime was proven,” she wrote. “Plus, if this was true, only the least successful obstructors would ever be prosecuted.”"
Former DHS official on CBP declaring 'full-blown' border emergency: Authorities at point of 'desperation',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/cbp-declaring-full-blown-border-emergency,"The head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) declared Wednesday a ""full-blown emergency"" at the southern border, as the number of apprehensions surged last month to levels not seen in more than a decade.

Responding on ""America's Newsroom"" Thursday, former Department of Homeland Security official Theresa Cardinal Brown said it's clear that authorities at the border are in a state of ""desperation.""

Brown said the situation is different from years past because of the number of families and children who are seeking asylum at the border and having to be detained.

In his comments to reporters, Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders called the immigration system ""broken,"" explaining that facilities housing migrants near the border are ""well beyond capacity.""

""This ongoing crisis has placed a tremendous strain on our limited resources and operational effectiveness,"" he warned.

Brown told Bill Hemmer that Border Patrol agents and other officials feel like they're not getting enough support and resources from lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

""I hear very much the desperation of operators and people whose job it is to deal with the people they encounter at the border effectively and humanely, who feel like they're not able to do their job. ... It is a crisis,"" she said.

Brown said the White House and lawmakers from both parties need to come together and figure out how to deal with the crisis.

She said tensions are high between House Democrats and President Trump in particular, but she pointed back to Bill Clinton negotiating ""significant legislation while he was under impeachment.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible -- more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year.

The number of apprehensions was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

The latest figures could embolden President Trump amid tense negotiations with Mexico over the immigration crisis.

Last week, in an effort to force Mexico to do more to “stop the invasion” of migrants into the U.S., the president vowed to impose a new 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports. The tariffs, set to go into effect on June 10 absent an agreement, would increase over time, reaching 25 percent by Oct. 1.

"Bruce Ohr, DOJ official, received nearly $43K in bonuses, raise in midst of Russia probe: Report",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Jeff Mordock']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/7/bruce-ohr-doj-official-received-nearly-43k-bonuses/,"The Justice Department official who was demoted for serving as the conduit between the FBI and ex-British spy Christopher Steele received nearly $43,000 in taxpayer-funded performance bonuses during the early stages of the Russia investigation, according to documents released Friday.

The official, Bruce Ohr, also received a $2,600 salary increase after his demotion, the records revealed.

Government watchdog group Judicial Watch released the employment documents that it obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.

“These documents will raise questions as to whether the conflicted Bruce Ohr, who the FBI used to launder information from Christopher Steele was rewarded for his role in the illicit targeting of President Trump,” said Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president.

According to the documents, Mr. Ohr was awarded a $14,250 bonus in November 2015, which doubled to $28,000 in November 2016. Less than a year later, he was removed from his position as associate attorney general and later transferred again.

At the time of his demotion, Mr. Ohr was the fourth-ranking official at the Justice Department. His wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS, the opposition-research firm tapped by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele to author the salacious and unverified dossier that helped spark the Russia investigation.

Mr. Ohr remains an active Justice Department employee, a move that has been questioned by Mr. Trump and his allies.

“How the hell is Bruce Ohr still employed at the Justice Department? Disgraceful! Witch Hunt!” Mr. Trump tweeted last year.

Judicial Watch says it has five current lawsuits seeking information about Mr. Ohr.
