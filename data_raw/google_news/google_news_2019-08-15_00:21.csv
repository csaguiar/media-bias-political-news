"Fox News Poll: Most back gun restrictions after shootings, Trump ratings down",https://www.foxnews.com,['Dana Blanton'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-most-back-gun-restrictions-after-shootings-trump-ratings-down,"In the wake of two mass shootings, overwhelming and bipartisan majorities of voters favor background checks on gun buyers and taking guns from people who are a danger to themselves or others, according to the latest Fox News Poll. Two-thirds also support a ban on “assault weapons,” although that majority is largely driven by Democrats.

But asked to choose one or the other, voters would rather live in a country where gun ownership is legal than one where guns are banned.

The poll was conducted August 11-13, about a week after mass shootings involving assault-style weapons in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. The alleged El Paso shooter reportedly penned an anti-immigrant manifesto. The motive of the alleged Dayton shooter is unknown.

An equal number, 56 percent, place a great deal of blame for mass shootings on easy access to guns and a lack of services for mentally ill people with violent tendencies. Four in 10 blame expressions of white nationalism (40 percent) and inadequate parenting (39 percent). About a third point to sentiments expressed by President Trump (34 percent) and anti-immigrant sentiment (33 percent). Less than a quarter say violent video games (23 percent) and sentiments expressed by Democratic political leaders (15 percent).

Democrats are most likely to blame easy access to guns (79 percent), expressions of white nationalism (62 percent), and Trump (59 percent). For Republicans, it’s a lack of services for mental illness (60 percent), bad parenting (54 percent), and access to guns (32 percent).

When voters are asked to say in their own words why mass shootings happen more often in the U.S. than elsewhere, their top three responses are: access to guns (35 percent), mental health issues (22 percent), and Trump rhetoric (10 percent).

On specific measures to reduce gun violence, there’s broad support for requiring criminal background checks on all gun buyers (90 percent) and passing “red flag” laws that allow police to take guns from people shown to be a danger to themselves or others (81 percent).

Fewer, although still a sizable 67 percent majority, favor banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons. That’s up from 60 percent in 2018. Support includes over half of those living in a gun-owner household (53 percent). Over half of independents (58 percent) and an overwhelming majority of Democrats (86 percent) favor a ban. Republicans split 46-46 percent, which is a shift from 2018 when it was 41 favor vs. 56 oppose.

Most Democrats (88 percent) and Republicans (75 percent) favor “red flag” laws, as do voters in gun households (77 percent). Universal background checks are favored by 9 in 10 Democrats (92 percent), Republicans (89 percent), and gun households (93 percent).

Some 71 percent think the government has the ability to reduce gun violence, yet only 18 percent feel it’s extremely or very likely Congress will act this year -- and 42 percent say there’s no chance at all.

Approval of Trump’s response to the shootings stands at 37 percent, and 46 percent think the administration has made the country less safe from mass shootings. For comparison, 32 percent think Trump has made the country less safe from Islamic terrorist attacks.

In addition, more than three times as many believe a mass shooting by an American citizen is a bigger threat than a terrorist attack by Islamic terrorists (60-17 percent). And 32 percent are less likely to attend a large-scale event since the recent shootings -- that’s 12 points higher than the 20 percent who felt that way after 9/11 (October 2001).

Still, by a 57-34 percent margin, voters would rather live in a country where guns are legal, and 38 percent report someone in their household owns a gun.

Meanwhile, the president’s job ratings are increasingly negative in the shooting aftermath, as 59 percent say Trump is “tearing the country apart,” compared to 31 percent who feel he’s “drawing the country together.” Two years ago it was 56-33 percent (August 2017).

Sixty-five percent of Republicans and 54 percent of conservatives think he’s drawing the country together, while 92 percent of Democrats, 74 percent of non-whites, 59 percent of independents, and 53 percent of whites say tearing the country apart.

Overall, 56 percent of voters disapprove of Trump’s performance, up from 51 percent in July. Record numbers of men (53 percent), white men (46 percent), and independents (64 percent) disapprove. His disapproval rating has only been higher once: 57 percent in October 2017.

Currently, 43 percent of voters approve of Trump, down from 46 percent last month.

The National Rifle Association receives similar marks: 42 percent have a favorable view, down from 49 percent in 2018. Forty-seven percent have an unfavorable opinion. This is the first time the organization has had a net negative rating. Positive views of the NRA are also down among gun-owner households: 56 percent versus 67 percent last year.

Pollpourri

The mood of the electorate is blah.

Fifty-nine percent of voters are unhappy with the way things are going in the country. That’s higher than the 53 percent who were dissatisfied at Trump’s 100-day mark (April 2017). Among partisans, Republicans (73 percent) alone are satisfied, as most Democrats (86 percent) and independents (63 percent) are dissatisfied.

When thinking about their personal finances, 50 percent say they are “holding steady,” 26 percent “falling behind,” and 22 percent “getting ahead.” That’s unchanged since 2018.

Most voters either disapprove (51 percent) of Trump’s tweeting or wish he would be more cautious (31 percent). Sixteen percent approve.

Conducted August 11-13, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,013 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters."
'CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE!' — Trump rips 'clueless Jay Powell' and the Fed as the market slides,https://www.cnbc.com,['Jacob Pramuk'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/14/trump-hammers-clueless-jay-powell-rails-against-crazy-inverted-yield-curve.html,"President Donald Trump blamed the Federal Reserve for mounting fears about a slowing U.S. economy on Wednesday as he defended his administration's trade war with China.

In a pair of tweets, the president argued the central bank and its ""clueless"" chairman, Jay Powell, have dragged on the U.S. economy. He also blamed the Fed for the yield on the 2-year U.S. Treasury moving higher than the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury — an indicator of a possible recession that contributed to major U.S. stock indexes dropping about 3% on Wednesday.

""CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE!"" the president wrote. ""We should easily be reaping big Rewards & Gains, but the Fed is holding us back. We will Win!""

Trump also claimed ""we are winning, big time"" in his administration's trade conflict with the world's second-largest economy. ""China is not our problem,"" but rather ""our problem is with the Fed"" and its interest rate policy, he said.

Trump has repeatedly pushed the Fed to cut its benchmark federal funds rate in recent months as the trade conflict with Beijing has, at times, contributed to stock market chaos and concerns about U.S. economic growth slowing. On Tuesday, he argued the Fed ""raised too much"" and ""too fast"" in hiking rates by a quarter of a percentage point seven different times in 2017 and 2018.

He said the central bank is ""now too slow to cut"" rates. Last month, the Fed decreased the target range on the federal funds rate to 2% to 2.25% — the first time it cut rates since the 2008 financial crisis. Trump nominated Powell for the job.

On Tuesday, Trump delayed new tariffs on some Chinese goods that were set to take effect on Sept. 1. They will now be implemented on Dec. 15. Stocks popped Tuesday following the announcement as investors grew more hopeful about the trade conflict easing or ending.

Trump told reporters ""we're doing this for the Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on U.S. consumers. "" The president and members of his administration have insisted China will bear the burden of the duties rather than American businesses and consumers.

The yield curve inversion sent fear back into stock markets Wednesday. The falling yields in longer-term U.S. Treasurys reflect a move into safe-haven assets as concerns grow about the economy's health.

The bond market phenomenon took place Wednesday as parts of the global economy showed signs of flagging. Germany's economy contracted by 0.1% between April and June, according to data released Wednesday.

The Trump administration is not actively working on plans to kick-start the U.S. economy, The Washington Post reported Wednesday."
Judge slaps down Dem gambit in Trump impeachment probe,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-dem-trump-impeachment-probe,"A D.C. federal judge on Wednesday shot down an attempt by House Judiciary Committee Democrats to link their subpoena for former White House counsel Don McGahn to a separate request for secret grand jury information from the Russia investigation after the Justice Department accused them of trying to ""game the system.""

Normally cases are assigned to judges randomly, which the DOJ said is meant to keep parties from “attempting to game the system” by “shopping” for a judge they like. But in a Tuesday court filing, the department alleged the Democrat-controlled committee was trying to do exactly that by exploiting an exception that allows “related” cases to be heard by the same judge. In this case, the DOJ said the panel improperly sought to connect the McGahn case to the grand jury case simply because they're both part of their investigation of President Trump.

NADLER SLAMMED FOR 'HARASSMENT' AFTER FRESH KAVANAUGH DOC REQUESTS

""[A]t first blush, the House Judiciary Committee's view that the related case rule applies is understandable,"" D.C. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell wrote in her order rejecting the bid. ""Nonetheless, closer examination demonstrates that these connections between the two cases are too superficial and attenuated for the instant McGahn Subpoena Case to qualify[.]""

Howell, who is currently assigned to the grand jury case, agreed with the DOJ's argument that the committee’s request to unseal secret grand jury information from former special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe has to do with the application of the law under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, while the McGahn case is a civil matter dealing with enforcing a subpoena where immunity has been asserted.

“This later-filed, subpoena-enforcement suit involves no issues of fact or law common to the earlier Grand Jury application, nor does it focus on a common event or transaction such that the matters would be ‘related,’” the DOJ argued in its court filing.

The House Judiciary Committee claimed that the cases are related because they both tie into what they are now calling an “impeachment investigation” of Trump. Their complaint against McGahn calls him the ""most important witness, other than the President, to the key events that are the focus of the Judiciary Committee’s investigation"" into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

The DOJ, however, argued that the term “related” refers to cases that have “common issues of fact” or stem from a “common event or transaction.” They claimed the committee “gets it backwards” because they are “trying to relate completely unrelated cases simply because it filed them in service of its overarching desire to bring various matters together in its investigation of the President.”

IMPEACHMENT CHAOS: POLS CAN’T AGREE ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY’VE LAUNCHED PROCESS TO OUST TRUMP

McGahn’s refusal to comply with a subpoena is the real “event or transaction” in this case, the DOJ said, “not the Committee’s asserted ‘impeachment investigation.’”

Howell also identified the legal issues in the grand jury case, pointing out that those issues ""are entirely absent"" from the McGahn case.

The Justice Department also countered the committee’s claim that linking the cases would make the judicial process more efficient by noting that while the committee knew about McGahn’s refusal to testify back in May, they waited until August – soon after filing the grand jury information case – to sue over it.

“Thus, any delay is the Committee’s doing at this point,” the DOJ said, questioning how getting around the random judge assignment process would help make things go faster.

Judge Howell countered the committee's argument by saying that ""judicial efficiency is not served where two cases present such different factual and legal issues, as is the circumstance here.""

The McGahn case will now be transferred to the Calendar and Case Management Committee to be randomly reassigned.

The existence of an “impeachment investigation” has also been called into question. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has stated that “formal impeachment proceedings” are underway, but the committee’s ranking Republican Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., said that is impossible because the House never voted to approve such an investigation.

Several House Democrats have claimed that a vote is not necessary, either because the Constitution grants them the power to conduct impeachment investigations or because a recent expansion of committee powers allows it."
Fact check: Kamala Harris makes false claim about Trump and auto jobs,https://www.cnn.com,['Daniel Dale'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/14/politics/fact-check-kamala-harris-makes-false-claim-about-trump-and-auto-jobs/index.html,"Washington (CNN) In an interview with CNN on Monday, Sen. Kamala Harris argued that President Donald Trump has failed to deliver on his promises to workers. And she issued a dire warning about autoworkers' jobs in particular.

""He said he was going to help working people, and it is estimated that as many as 300,000 autoworkers may be out of a job before the end of the year,"" she said aboard her campaign bus in Iowa.

That was a more conservative figure than Harris used July 12 on the radio show ""The Breakfast Club,"" during which she said, ""He's helped the top 1% and the biggest corporations. Meanwhile, some estimate that as many as 700,000 autoworkers were going to lose their job before the end of the year.""

Both figures are incorrect.

Facts First: There is no credible estimate that 300,000 autoworkers might lose their jobs by the end of the year. And there has been an increase in autoworker jobs during the Trump presidency, though there has been a slight decrease over the past year.

We can't fact-check the future of automotive employment; anything is possible, even a sudden depression. But Harris was wrong to claim that experts are suggesting there might be a massive decline in autoworker jobs within five months.

Harris' campaign told CNN that the ""300,000"" figure came from a study published in February by the Center for Automotive Research. That study, however, estimated approximately 367,000 job losses in the entire economy, not among autoworkers in particular.

And the estimate was for job losses a year after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on automobiles and auto parts from every country except for Canada, Mexico and South Korea -- which he has not done.

Kristin Dziczek, a co-author of the study and the Center for Automotive Research's vice president for industry, labor and economics, said the center has not published a specific job-loss estimate for autoworkers. But she said it is ""highly unlikely"" there would be a loss even close to 300,000 autoworkers by the year's end.

The number of people employed in ""production and nonsupervisory roles"" making automobiles and auto parts -- plant workers, in other words -- did fall over the last year, from 648,100 in June 2018 to 640,200 in June 2019, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. But that's a decrease of about 1%, nothing approaching the catastrophic collapse Harris suggested might be coming.

""The sector is starting to shrink,"" Dziczek said, but a rapid loss of 300,000 autoworker jobs ""would be orders of magnitude worse than what we're expecting to see.""

Dziczek said that 90% of the hypothetical 367,000 job losses in the February study were attributable to the possibility of Trump imposing the 25% tariff.

Trump could certainly still impose such a tariff, but he decided in mid-May to delay a decision for six months. So even if there were 300,000 job losses throughout the economy after a hypothetical tariff did come into effect, the delay means they would be highly unlikely to occur by the end of 2019.

Harris' ""700,000"" figure relied on a previous Center for Automotive Research study, published in July 2018, that estimated a loss of more than 700,000 jobs if Trump imposed a 25% tariff on automobile and auto parts imports from every country. This estimate, too, was for all kinds of jobs, not autoworkers alone, and the Center for Automotive Research says it has been supplanted by the updated analysis in the February 2019 study.

Trump has made false claims about his record on auto jobs -- inaccurately boasting , among other things, that new auto plants are being built in places like Florida and Pennsylvania. But he is correct when he says auto jobs have been created during his tenure.

In June, there were 195,600 production and nonsupervisory employees involved in the manufacturing of motor vehicles , up 14% from 171,000 in January 2017.

For production and nonsupervisory employees involved in parts manufacturing , it was 444,600 in June, down 2% from 454,500 in January 2017. Still, for vehicles and parts manufacturing as a whole , including supervisory workers and people involved in manufacturing bodies and trailers, there were 1,005,500 people employed as of July, up 5% from 955,800 in January 2017.

Harris could fairly argue that Trump has had a modest impact on industry employment. But she is wrong in suggesting that experts believe he might cause autoworker employment to plunge within months."
Exclusive: Google Insider Turns Over 950 Pages Of Docs And Laptop To DOJ,https://saraacarter.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://saraacarter.com/exclusive-google-insider-turns-over-950-pages-of-docs-and-laptop-to-doj/,"A former Google insider claiming the company created algorithms to hide its political bias within artificial intelligence platforms – in effect targeting particular words, phrases and contexts to promote, alter, reference or manipulate perceptions of Internet content – delivered roughly 950 pages of documents to the Department of Justice’s Antitrust division Friday.

The former Google insider, who has already spoken in to the nonprofit organization Project Veritas, met with SaraACarter.com on several occasions last week. He was interviewed in silhouette, to conceal his identity, in group’s latest film, which they say exposes bias inside the social media platform.

Several weeks prior, the insider mailed a laptop to the DOJ containing the same information delivered on Friday, they said. The former insider is choosing to remain anonymous until Project Verita’s James O’Keefe reveals his identity tomorrow (Wednesday).

He told this reporter on his recent trip to Washington D.C. that the documents he turned over to the Justice Department will provide proof that Google has been manipulating the algorithms and the evidence of how it was done, the insider said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the House Judiciary Committee in December, 2018, that the search engine was not biased against conservatives. Pichai explained what algorithm’s are said Google’s algorithm was not offensive to conservatives because its artificial intelligence does not operate in that manner. He told lawmakers, “things like relevance, freshness, popularity, how other people are using it” are what drives the search results. Pichai said even if his programmers were anti-Republican, the process is so intricate that the artificial intelligence could not be manipulated and it was to complicated to train the algorithm to fit their bias.

Google did not immediately respond for comment on the insider’s claims, however, this story will be updated if comment is provided.

The insider says Google is aware most people are unaware or not knowledgeable about these advanced IT systems and therefore unable to determine who is telling the truth.

“I honestly think that a free market can fix this issue,” he told this reporter at a meeting in Washington D.C. “The issue is that the free market has been distorted and what’s happened is that the distortion is so grotesque and the engineering is so repulsive, all we need to do is just expose what’s going on. People can hear that it is bad but that can be bias. But when they see what Google has actually written with the documents, this will actually be taught in universities of what totalitarian states can do with this type of capability.”

“It will be so revolting that it doesn’t matter what the solution is, a solution will just form as a reaction to this manipulation they have done,” the Google insider said.

He said he’s asked himself many times if he’s overreacting “and every time I simply look back at the documents and realize that I am not.”

“It’s that bad,” he said. “Disclosing Google’s own words to the American public is something I am, must do, if I am to consider myself a good person. The world that google is building is not a place I, or you or our children want to live in.”

— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) August 13, 2019

Another Google insider, who has come forward already, told O’Keefe and other media outlets recently that it is the programers at Google who use the algorithms to manipulate the information to advance its leftist agenda.

Greg Coppola, a software engineer, told Project Veritas that he doesn’t “have a smoking gun.”

However, “I’ve just been coding since I was ten, I have a Ph.D., I have five years of experience at Google, and I just know how algorithms are. They don’t write themselves. We write them to make them do what we want them to do.”

“I look at Search and I look at Google News, and I see what it’s doing,” he said. “I see Google executives go to Congress and say … that it’s not political, and I’m just so sure that that’s not true.”

Department of Justice officials declined to comment on the document dump. But SaraACarter.com has reviewed the documents and obtained proof from the Google insider that the documents were delivered to the DOJ.

The unnamed Google insider first spoke to O’Keefe’s Project Veritas. O’Keefe has been criticized by the left for outing the political bias of executives and employees of Google and other social media companies.

In the nonprofits most recent video, Project Veritas uses their undercover techniques to get Google employees to talk openly about their disdain for Trump and how their artificial intelligence operates.

Jenn Gennai, who heads Google’s Responsible Innovation Team, did not know she was being filmed by O’Keefe’s group. She told the undercover journalist that “the reason we launched our AI principals is because we’re not putting our line in the sand. They were not saying what’s fair and what’s equitable so we’re like, well we’re a big company, we’re going to say it.”"
Labor Dept. proposes granting businesses with federal contracts 'religious exemption' in hiring,https://thehill.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457409-department-of-labor-grants-businesses-with-federal-contracts,"The Department of Labor proposed a rule Wednesday allowing “religion-exercising organizations” with federal contracts to raise religious exemptions if accused of bias in their hiring practices.

The Labor Department said the proposal, which is set to officially be published in the Federal Register on Thursday, is intended to help companies “make employment decisions consistent with their sincerely held religious tenets and beliefs without fear of sanction by the federal government.”

The Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), which regulates federal anti-discrimination requirements for businesses and other organizations that work with the government, said the rule applies to both religious companies as well as “closely held” groups acting in accordance with their owners’ religious beliefs and is based on past laws and court rulings detailing protections for certain groups.

“Today’s proposed rule helps to ensure the civil rights of religious employers are protected,” acting Labor Secretary Patrick Pizzella said in a statement. “As people of faith with deeply held religious beliefs are making decisions on whether to participate in federal contracting, they deserve clear understanding of their obligations and protections under the law.”

The proposal will be open for public comments until Sept. 16.

Advocacy groups have long warned that such protections intend to provide cover for groups with discriminatory hiring practices.

“The Department of Labor just proposed a rule that aims to let government contractors fire workers who are LGBTQ, or who are pregnant and unmarried, based on the employers’ religious views,” the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) tweeted after the proposal was announced. “This is taxpayer-funded discrimination in the name of religion. Period.”

“This rule seeks to undermine our civil rights protections and encourages discrimination in the workplace — and we will work to stop it,” the group added.

FACT: Nearly one-quarter of employees in the United States work for an employer that has a contract with the federal government.



This rule seeks to undermine our civil rights protections and encourages discrimination in the workplace — and we will work to stop it. — ACLU (@ACLU) August 14, 2019

The ACLU is currently involved in a litany of lawsuits against the Trump administration over several policies it argues are discriminatory.

The Labor Department maintained in its statement that its rule “reaffirms employers’ obligations not to discriminate on the basis of race, sex, or other protected bases and does not exempt or excuse a contractor from complying with any other requirements.”

""In no way does today’s announcement by the Department of Labor undermine the President’s promise and commitment to the LGBTQ community. The proposed rule will continue to responsibly protect religious freedom and members of the LGBTQ community from discrimination,"" the White House added in a statement to The Hill.

Workplace protections for LGBT employees have been thrust into the spotlight in the Trump administration. The Justice Department argued in court in 2017 that sexual discrimination protections in the workplace do not extend to sexual orientation and wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court in 2018 the protections also do not extend to transgender people.

The Supreme Court will hear three cases in October to determine whether aspects of the 1964 Civil Rights Act bar discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

“OFCCP is consistently looking for ways to bring clarity and certainty to federal contractors, and this proposal falls squarely within that effort. The rulemaking process allows the public opportunity to comment on the proposal and impact any potential final rule,” said OFCCP Director Craig Leen.

ANALYSIS: Who and what the Horowitz report is likely to cover,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/analysis-who-and-what-the-horowitz-report-is-likely-to-cover,"The 448-page report detailing special counsel Robert Mueller's two-year Trump-Russia investigation is public. Next up: Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report into how that investigation started.

That report, anticipated to be released after Congress returns from August recess, will come amid an ongoing contentious debate between Republicans who think the government unfairly targeted President Trump and Democrats who believe Trump deserved to be investigated for his alleged ties to Russia.

But what Horowitz's report, which is expected to delve into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the FBI's use of the salacious and unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, contains has been held close.

Still, recent developments have offered a sneak preview of the cast of characters who could make appearances when Horowitz explains what his team uncovered.

Former FBI Director James Comey received good news a couple weeks ago when the DOJ decided not to charge him over leaking his memos, despite a criminal referral from Horowitz, who concluded Comey leaked classified information and showed a lack of candor. But the leak inquiry was just a narrow slice of the broader investigation Horowitz launched in March of last year.

Horowitz is likely scrutinizing every aspect of the FISA approval process, and the head of the FBI plays an integral role. Comey signed three of the four FISA warrant applications and renewals targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, who was never charged with wrongdoing, during the Trump-Russia investigation. Comey defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier but admitted the dossier wasn't verified when he approved its use, and investigators were still working to verify its contents when he was fired in May 2017. The final FISA renewal happened a month later.

The FISA filings required approval from top members of the FBI and the Justice Department, so other possible targets of Horowitz's inquiry likely included the approvers of the four applications and renewals: Comey; Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates; Dana Boente, the only signatory in active government service and currently Trump’s top lawyer at the FBI; then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller to be special counsel the month before.

Mueller told Congress he wasn't involved in approving that final FISA warrant.

The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the Justice Department and the FBI made extensive use of Steele’s dossier, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Clinton campaign hired the firm through Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm and was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race.

Also last week, McCabe and former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, both fired during the Trump administration, separately sued the Justice Department alleging political bias played a role in their removals. Strzok demanded reinstatement and back pay, and McCabe demanded he receive his full retirement pension.

Horowitz has a history with both men. He previously concluded anti-Trump texts sent from Strzok to FBI lawyer Lisa Page, his mistress, not only showed Strzok was biased but also that he was willing to take official action to affect Trump's electoral prospects. Horowitz also concluded McCabe leaked information without authorization and ""lacked candor"" with investigators.

Horowitz's findings were cited in both their firings, and he's likely not done with them since both played prominent roles in the Trump-Russia investigation.

And last Thursday, FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from ""Russian conspiracy theories."" Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI.

Horowitz is also likely looking into the FBI's use of an article by Michael Isikoff to bolster its FISA filings. The FBI told the court it didn't think the piece was connected to the dossier, even though Isikoff only wrote it after meeting with Steele.

The Justice Department inspector general said when he launched the investigation last year at the behest of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements"" related to FISA filings against Page and review the DOJ’s and the FBI’s dealings with Steele. But while Horowitz said he would consider including other issues that arose during the investigation, Attorney General William Barr has since suggested the inquiry is narrow.

Former FBI General Counsel James Baker is also likely to be among those scrutinized, since he admitted he inserted himself into the FISA approval process and reviewed the first FISA application. Baker defended how the FBI handled the Steele dossier, claiming “we took it seriously” but “we didn’t necessarily take it literally.”

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Officials such as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec knew by October 2016 portions of Steele’s dossier were inaccurate. And State Department officials such as Jonathan Winer and Victoria Nuland seem to have been involved in spreading Steele's information within the U.S. government.

Many members of the media also received info from the Steele dossier, which may have contained Russian disinformation, at the behest of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.

The Steele dossier's central thesis was ""a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation"" between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Mueller didn't agree. Although Mueller concluded the Russians interfered in the 2016 presidential election, the investigation did not establish the Kremlin and Trump's campaign criminally conspired. Mueller’s report also shot down at least one of Steele’s biggest claims — that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen met with foreign hackers in Prague.

Acting DHS secretary on ICE facility attack in Texas: Rhetoric must be toned down,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/acting-dhs-secretary-ice-facility-attack-texas,"Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday on ""Fox & Friends"" that the latest attack on an ICE facility in Texas could be the result of politicians and pundits ""demonizing"" federal agents for enforcing existing laws.

After shots were fired into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office and another facility associated with the agency in San Antonio, Texas, early Tuesday, ICE said in a statement that, ""Political rhetoric and misinformation that various politicians, media outlets and activist groups recklessly disseminate to the American people regarding the ICE mission only serve to further encourage these violent acts.""

McAleenan agreed, calling on those who oppose the Trump administration's policies to tone down their rhetoric before someone gets hurt, noting that this is the fourth such incident targeting an ICE facility.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BOOSTS ABILITY TO DENY GREEN CARDS TO IMMIGRANTS USING WELFARE PROGRAMS

""I think the environment where we're demonizing law enforcement for doing their jobs, for enforcing the laws on the books, is concerning, it can be dangerous and it can result in people taking actions that are not supported by the facts,"" he said.

The FBI is investigating the ""targeted attack"" in which shots were fired at around 3 a.m. at an ICE building where two floors house administrative and executive offices, according to the San Antonio Express-News. The outlet reported another shooting occurred at a separate facility where an ICE contractor is located.

The Texas attack follows two separate incidents last month, when a man attacked an ICE building in Washington state and protesters raised a Mexican flag at a Colorado ICE facility.

Many on the left renewed their harsh criticism of ICE after 680 “removable aliens” were arrested last week at several Mississippi food processing plants where they were working. It was deemed the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in U.S. history.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said the raids were part of a ""campaign of terror"" by the Trump administration, while the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote in a letter to McAleenan that the purpose of the raids was ""to instill fear in Latino and immigrant communities at a time when Latinos are already living in terror.""

McAleenan said progress is being made when it comes to working with Mexico and Central American nations to stem the flow of migrants at the border, but the laws ""in the interior"" must also be enforced, including going after businesses who employ undocumented workers."
How Trump Is Reversing Obama’s Nondiscrimination Legacy,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Emma Green'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/trump-lgbtq-rules/596116/,"According to the Department of Labor, 420,000 entities are currently registered as potential federal contractors. While this figure might overestimate the number of groups eligible to work with the Department of Labor, it illustrates how far-reaching the federal-contracting system is. Marketplace recently reported that 4.1 million people work as federal contractors; add in subcontractors, and that number gets far larger.

At least some portion of federal contracts are awarded to religious groups—roughly 2,000 across the federal government each year, according to recent congressional testimony. In its new proposed rule, the Department of Labor claims that some of these groups have been “reluctant to participate as federal contractors” because they’re unsure whether they would be protected from discrimination claims if they hired or fired people on religious grounds.

This rule is intended to clarify that any kind of religious group can make employment decisions according to its tenets, provided it doesn’t violate existing laws that ban discrimination based on religion, sex, national origin, and other qualities. Labor officials went out of their way to make clear that the new rule wouldn’t protect religious groups that discriminate based on race, citing the landmark Supreme Court decision Bob Jones University v. United States, which found that government interests outweigh supposed religious objections to racial integration and more.

What’s unclear is whether the new rule includes forms of discrimination that are currently in legal limbo. In 2014, Obama signed an executive order making it illegal for federal contractors to fire or refuse to hire people on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The new proposed rule does not undo that executive order. Conspicuously, it does not address protections for LGBTQ people at all, even though that was a major area of concern for faith leaders back in 2014. Administration officials may be using that ambiguity to their advantage. This fall, the Supreme Court will consider whether the workplace protections provided under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 cover discrimination based on gender identity. Until the Court weighs in, and perhaps even after that, the status of LGBTQ rights in federal nondiscrimination laws will remain unclear.

Progressive advocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union are alarmed by the Trump administration’s proposed new rule. “This is taxpayer-funded discrimination in the name of religion,” the ACLU tweeted today. “Period.” Mara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement that “religious freedom must be a shield to protect the marginalized, not a sword to attack them.”"

Officials blame 'political rhetoric and misinformation' after shots fired at San Antonio ICE office,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Nicholas Wu', 'Published A.M.

CLOSE After 9/11, the U.S. enforced stricter control on immigration. This enforcement led to the birth of Homeland Security and ICE, but what is ICE exactly? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY

Officials blamed ""political rhetoric and misinformation"" after shots were fired at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in San Antonio, Texas, early Tuesday morning.

Local TV station KENS 5 reported that suspects fired at the building,which includes the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) field office and Jefferson Bank offices, around 3:00 a.m. CDT Tuesday morning on the northeast side of San Antonio.

Christopher Combs, special agent in charge of the San Antonio FBI, said in a press conference later Tuesday that “an unknown number of individuals in an unknown number of vehicles” fired shots at the building and came close to hitting federal employees in the building, according to the San Antonio Express-News.

More: Nearly 700 people arrested in ICE raids at Mississippi food processing plants

“I want to stress to everyone that any attempt at any violence or illegal activity against a federal official will not be tolerated,” said Combs, who said the FBI would open a federal case on the shooting.

Combs said that ICE was targeted in the shooting since “all of the shots that we have found were on the floors where ICE has offices, so there is no question it is a very targeted attack.”

He slammed the shooting as an ""act of violence"" that could have resulted in the ""assassination of a federal employee.""

According to the Express-News, FBI officials said they were investigating a series of attacks against ICE facilities around the country.

ICE issued a statement later Tuesday on the shooting, reported KENS 5. Daniel Bible, the San Antonio ERO field office director, said that ""political rhetoric and misinformation that various politicians, media outlets, and activist groups recklessly disseminate to the American people regarding the ICE mission only serve to further encourage these violent acts.”

""ICE officers put their lives on the line each and every day to keep our communities safe. This disturbing public discourse shrouds our critical law enforcement function and unnecessarily puts our officers’ safety at risk,” he continued.

United States Citizenship and Immigration Service acting Director Ken Cuccinelli tweeted about the shooting on Tuesday, saying ""@USCIS stands with @ICE as they work to enforce our laws and keep Americans safe,"" along with a picture of a bullet hole at the San Antonio office.

A spokesperson for GEO Group, a private prison contractor that also runs some immigration detention centers, said that their offices, which were in the same office building as the ICE offices, were also shot at in the same incident.

No one was injured in the shooting, and federal investigators from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security were searching for suspects.

""We are deeply troubled by yet another targeted act of violence, and we hope that the perpetrator is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" said GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez. ""Unfortunately, the dishonest narrative and lies that are being spread about the services our company provides on behalf of the federal government has led to the endangerment of our employees, of government employees, and the public.”

Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, whose district includes the San Antonio office, said ""we pray for the safety of these law enforcement personnel,"" urging the public to wait for the results of the investigation.

""This will not be tolerated,"" he added.

State Dept. 'deeply concerned' by China threats as unrest in Hong Kong grows,https://www.politico.com,['Caitlin Oprysko'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/14/engel-mccaul-hong-kong-china-1463442,"House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel (left) and Rep. Michael McCaul wrote that the protests are ""the result of Beijing’s successive violations of their commitment to honor the will of the people of Hong Kong.” | Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo congress State Dept. 'deeply concerned' by China threats as unrest in Hong Kong grows

Bipartisan U.S. concern over the discord in Hong Kong is growing, as the State Department on Wednesday issued a travel warning for the region and expressed support for pro-democracy demonstrators there.

The bipartisan leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday condemned Chinese authorities' hostility to protesters and threats of military intervention in a joint statement, warning that should Beijing attempt to use force to shut down peaceful demonstrations, they “would be met with universal condemnation and swift consequences.”

Story Continued Below

“The House Foreign Affairs Committee has called upon Beijing to cease encroaching on Hong Kong’s autonomy — it is Beijing’s actions that are at the root of the frustration among the people of Hong Kong. No foreign powers are fomenting this dissent,” Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and ranking member Michael McCaul (R-Texas) wrote. ""It is the result of Beijing’s successive violations of their commitment to honor the will of the people of Hong Kong.”

Engel and McCaul expressed their “deep respect for the brave efforts of Hong Kong people from every walk of life who have demonstrated their clear desire for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.”

Separately, the State Department on Wednesday issued a travel advisory for Hong Kong due to the unrest, instructing travelers to exercise increased caution.

""Police have used a variety of crowd control measures, including the deployment of tear gas. The protests and confrontations have spilled over into neighborhoods other than those where the police have permitted marches or rallies,"" the notice reads.

The protests began earlier this spring in opposition to a since-suspended plan that would allow extraditions to mainland China. They've since grown broader in scope and have intensified in recent months leading up to this week, when demonstrators occupied the Hong Kong airport and effectively blocked air travel to and from the airport for two days in a row. Police there have grown increasingly confrontational, and clashes broke out periodically Tuesday. Beijing called the skirmishes ""a near-terrorist act.""

Satellite images have emerged purporting to show Chinese troops gathering near the border with Hong Kong, raising worries of a potential violent conflict. Lawmakers have compared the simmering tensions to the 1989 massacre of hundreds of peaceful protesters in Tiananmen Square, warning against a repeat.

A State spokesperson said Wednesday that the department was “deeply concerned” by reports of military movement along the border.

The State Department urged Beijing to abide by its commitments under the treaty that created the “one country, two system” administrative structure that governs Hong Kong. “We encourage China and all parties in Hong Kong to pursue a solution that respects the liberty of Hongkongers and Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, as enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration,” the spokesperson said.

“We condemn violence and urge all sides to exercise restraint, but remain staunch in our support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong. The ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong reflect the sentiment of Hongkongers and their broad and legitimate concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy. We categorically reject the false charge of foreign forces as the black hand behind the protests. The continued erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy puts at risk its long-established special status in international affairs.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday called the recent developments “extremely alarming"" and said that American officials had a responsibility to speak out in defense of the protesters, regardless of the crucial role China plays in American trade. “If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out elsewhere,"" she said.

“To the thousands of young people in Hong Kong who are speaking UP for human rights and speaking OUT against the Communist Party of China: we see you waving the American flag, and we hear you singing our national anthem,” wrote House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. “America stands for freedom. America stands with Hong Kong.”

Some of the strong language has underscored the delicate line U.S. lawmakers must walk — the desire to express support for democracy while not undermining the protesters' legitimacy, something Beijing has repeatedly sought to do.

Chinese propaganda has blamed the U.S. for the protests, suggesting the CIA had been pulling strings behind the scenes. Earlier this week, China's foreign minister accused the U.S. of fomenting dissent among ""anti-China rabble-rousers."" The State Department spokesperson denied U.S. involvement in the pro-democracy protests, where demonstrators have been seen waving American flags.

President Donald Trump has so far maintained some distance from the unrest in Asia, telling reporters on Tuesday: “The Hong Kong thing is a very tough situation. I hope it works out peacefully. I hope nobody gets hurt. I hope nobody gets killed.”

But at the White House, Trump aides have been watching events closely and worry that it could spiral out of control, according to a current and a former White House official.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross defended Trump’s dovish approach in an interview on CNBC Wednesday, questioning what role the U.S. could play in the conflict.

“This is an internal matter,” Ross said of Trump’s relative neutrality, noting that Trump has made clear he’s monitoring the situation. “He talked about the possibility of troop build-ups — so it’s not that we’re not watching it.”

Lawmakers, meanwhile, have taken a more active stance. In their letter on Wednesday, Engel and McCaul also denounced state-run media publishing information about a U.S. diplomat who met with activists, calling them ""the actions of a 'thuggish regime.'""

Did Trump Brag About Crowd Sizes While Past Presidents Consoled Massacre Victims?,https://www.snopes.com,['Dan Macguill'],,,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-beto-crowds-el-paso-victims/,"In the aftermath of a spate of mass shootings in August 2019, attention turned to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tone in discussing the killings, and the wider issue of gun violence in the United States, as well as his comportment in visiting two of the cities affected, El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

Trump was criticized for smiling and offering a thumbs-up gesture while visiting an infant whose parents had been shot to death in a massacre in El Paso, and allegations that the president was using the tragedies as an opportunity to gain political capital extended to unfounded rumors that his administration had hired “fake” medical staff to pose with him at a hospital in Dayton.

On Aug. 9, the left-leaning Facebook page Occupy Democrats posted a meme that purported to highlight a stark difference in tone and decorum between Trump — who supposedly used a visit to El Paso to brag about crowd sizes and snipe at Democratic presidential candidate and former Congressman Beto O’Rourke — and his predecessors in the Oval Office — who purportedly offered words of comfort and solidarity in the aftermath of previous mass shootings.

We received multiple inquires from readers about the accuracy of the meme, which read as follows:

“Littleton, I can only say tonight that the prayers of the American people are with you.” — Bill Clinton, after Columbine. “This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech community — and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation.” — George H.W. [sic] Bush. “Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation. You are not alone.” — Barack Obama. “Crazy Beto only had like 400 people in a parking lot, they said his crowd was wonderful.” — Deplorable Trump, in El Paso.

The caption of the meme read: “SERIOUSLY, what is WRONG with Trump?!?! He REALLY said this to the El Paso victims.”

The Occupy Democrats meme was a largely accurate recounting of four post-shooting statements made by the four most recent occupants of the White House. (Strictly speaking, Trump was addressing medical staff who had treated victims of the El Paso shooting, rather than the victims themselves, and the second quotation was, apparently in error, attributed to George H.W. Bush, rather than George W. Bush.)

Despite the authenticity of the quotations, the meme presented an incomplete and rather misleading picture of Trump’s overall comportment in visiting El Paso after the August 2019 massacre there. While the president did indulge in side-sniping about a political opponent who had been fiercely critical of him (something his predecessors markedly did not do in similar circumstances), Trump did also offer words of solidarity and comfort to the victims of the August 2019 massacres, their families, and the wider communities affected by the shootings.

Clinton

The first quotation in the meme was taken from remarks Bill Clinton delivered in a White House press conference on April 20, 1999, the day of the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colorado. His speech can be read in full here, and viewed in full in the video below.

In the most relevant section, Clinton said:

“To the families who have lost their loved ones, to the parents who have lost their beloved children, to the wounded children and their families, to the people of the community of Littleton, I can only say tonight that the prayers of the American people are with you.”

﻿

Bush

The second quotation in the meme came from a speech that George W. Bush gave on April 17, 2007, during a convocation at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, the day after a student shot to death 32 people on that campus. The full text of his speech is available here, and it can be watched in full below.

In the section quoted by Occupy Democrats, Bush said:

“Laura and I have come to Blacksburg today with hearts full of sorrow. This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech community, and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation. We’ve come to express our sympathy. In this time of anguish, I hope you know that people all over this country are thinking about you and asking God to provide comfort for all who have been affected.”

Obama

The third quotation in the meme was taken from a speech Barack Obama gave during an interfaith vigil at Newtown High School on Dec. 16, 2012 — two days after a shooting massacre at nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

The speech can be read in full here, and watched in full in the video below. During the relevant section, Obama said:

“Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation. I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts. I can only hope it helps for you to know that you’re not alone in your grief. That our world, too, has been torn apart. That all across this land of ours, we have wept with you, and we’ve pulled our children tight. And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we will provide. Whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you, to ease this heavy load, we will gladly bear it. Newtown, you are not alone.”

Trump

The fourth and final quotation in the meme consisted of remarks Trump made while talking to hospital staff during a visit to University Medical Center in El Paso on Aug. 7, 2019, four days after a mass shooting at a Walmart store in that city.

Police in El Paso have linked the suspected shooter, Patrick Crusius, to a white nationalist manifesto posted online shortly before the massacre began. The author of the manifesto decried what he characterized as a “Hispanic invasion of Texas” and espoused the discredited “white genocide” theory.

Although the manifesto’s author, thought by El Paso police to be the suspected Walmart shooter, stipulated that his anti-immigrant sentiment predated the elevation of Trump to the presidency, some observers have pointed out areas of overlap between how the president talks about immigration and immigrants, and how the manifesto addressed them.

Others, including Democratic politicians and long-standing critics of the president, went further in connecting Trump to the manifesto and the El Paso shooting. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said the manifesto was so similar to Trump’s rhetoric that it “could have been written by the people that write Trump’s speeches.” O’Rourke described the massacre as “an act of terror inspired by [Trump’s] racism.”

Conventional news media were not permitted to accompany the president and first lady Melania Trump on their visits with shooting victims, families and medical staff in Dayton and El Paso on Aug. 7, but amateur footage emerged later that showed Trump addressing medical professionals at University Medical Center in El Paso.

In the short clip, the president commended the work done by hospital staff in caring for the victims of the shooting, saying “the job you’ve done is incredible,” and “it’s an honor to be with you.” Without any obvious reason or prompt, Trump then shifted to talking about a rally he had held in El Paso in February 2019 (although he mentioned “three months ago,” Trump’s most recent rally in the city was in February, six months earlier):

“I was here three months ago and we made a speech and we had a — what was the name of the arena? — that place was packed … That was some crowd, and we had twice the number outside. And then you had this crazy Beto — Beto had like 400 people in a parking lot, they said, ‘His crowd was wonderful!’ …”

Trump was referring in those remarks to a counter-protest held in response to his Feb. 11 rally at the El Paso County Coliseum. The counter-protest was led by O’Rourke and was estimated to have had between 7,000 and 15,000 attendees — considerably more than the “400 people in a parking lot” claimed by Trump.

During his rally, Trump thanked the El Paso fire department for allowing 10,000 of his supporters to enter the arena, despite the venue’s having a capacity of 6,500. In response, a spokesperson for the fire department corrected the president, insisting that no special permission had been given, and the number of attendees inside the arena was no greater than its capacity. At other times, Trump claimed that as many as 35,000 supporters had come to the rally, taking into account those outside the arena.

For an unknown reason, Trump decided to re-open that six-month-old dispute and grievance over crowd sizes and news coverage, while meeting and praising hospital staff who had treated and cared for the victims of a mass shooting. That struck some observers as grossly inappropriate, and we found no record of former Presidents Obama, Clinton or Bush having engaged in similar behavior while meeting the victims of past shootings or the medical professionals who had treated them.

However, Trump’s “crazy Beto” aside was not the extent of his remarks on the massacres in Dayton and El Paso, and the Occupy Democrats meme misled readers by cherry-picking that unscripted moment and comparing it with remarks made by previous presidents from behind a podium, during prepared speeches.

In a White House address on Aug. 5, Trump offered sentiments of solidarity and comfort to the victims of the Dayton and El Paso shootings and their families:

“The First Lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their families, and the survivors. We will stand by their side forever. We will never forget. These barbaric slaughters are an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation, and a crime against all of humanity. We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil — the cruelty, the hatred, the malice, the bloodshed, the terror. Our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents, children, husbands and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives. America weeps for the fallen.

“We are a loving nation, and our children are entitled to grow up in a just, peaceful and loving society. Together, we lock arms to shoulder the grief. We ask God in heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer, and we vow to act with urgent resolve.”

﻿

The salient difference between Trump and his three most recent predecessors was not that they gave “presidential” speeches after mass shootings, because Trump, too, gave a relatively dignified speech from the White House. The key difference, in the context of the Occupy Democrats meme, was in Trump’s comportment and behavior when he stepped away from the podium. We therefore rate the truth of this meme as “Mixture.”"
Tyson aims to reduce USDA involvement in beef inspection at Kansas plant,https://theweek.com,['Catherine Garcia'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://theweek.com/speedreads/859008/tyson-aims-reduce-usda-involvement-beef-inspection-kansas-plant,"Tyson Foods is requesting that company employees at a Kansas beef plant take over some inspection responsibilities previously held by United States Department of Agriculture officials.

If enacted, the proposal would reduce the number of USDA inspectors present on the line in the factory for ""post-mortem, pre-sortation activities"" regarding food safety and disease conditions, per the proposal. The company's request to the USDA was written in March, and obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request by Food and Water Watch, a company that is suing Tyson, reports NBC News.

The USDA is considering the proposition, reports NBC News, which is in reference to the company's factory in Holcomb, Kansas.

According to the proposal, the requested changes aim to improve efficiency, work toward pathogen reduction, and ""allow better use of Agency's resources"" while providing equal outcomes to current inspection practices.

But consumer advocates are hesitant. Former USDA chief veterinarian Pat Basu told NBC News ""bypassing safeguards"" may result in missed signs of disease, drug injections, or bacteria due to lack of adequate training.

""It could be devastating for the whole country — you cannot turn it over,"" he told NBC News.

This isn't the first time the government has considering bowing out of certain inspection responsibilities. The Obama administration allowed an increase in privatized poultry inspection, reports NBC News, and the Trump administration announced a proposition to establish a ""new voluntary inspection system"" for pork plants.

"Only bottled water for Newark residents, EPA says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Georeen Tanner'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/epa-tells-newark-provide-bottled-water,"Just over a year ago, Newark officials declared the city's water was ""absolutely safe to drink,"" but last week environmental officials called on the city to advise residents with known or suspected lead service lines that the filters they had been provided were not reliable after elevated lead levels were discovered in two Newark homes.

For three years the New Jersey city has been mired in a crisis caused by high levels of lead in the drinking water. The water filter program meant to answer the call for safer water has failed to solve the problem.

UK BABY LOSES ALL 4 LIMBS FOLLOWING HORRIFIC SEPSIS INFECTION

Now, in a move that echoes Flint, Mich., the city is distributing bottled water.

Last fall, the city distributed water filters to residents to reduce lead levels in drinking water while it implemented new corrosion control methods.

According to the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, lead exposure is devastating. Lead serves no purpose in the human body and there is no safe level of lead in drinking water. Children are especially at risk of its deadly effects. Early exposure can have lifelong consequences, such as intellectual disabilities, the agency says.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) letter, the agency is “unable at this time to assure Newark residents that their health is fully protected when drinking tap water filtered through these devices.”

The EPA places the onus to provide bottled water to Newark residents on the city.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a joint statement with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka that he is prepared to make bottled water available to residents. He further stated that Newark is expanding the testing of filtered drinking water to more Newark homes and that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is “working with the filter manufacturer to determine the scope of the situation.”

The city handed out nearly 40,000 PUR water filters, half of which were donated by the company. In a statement, PUR said it has been “working diligently with the City of Newark to understand the situation, assist with the establishment of testing protocols for additional sampling, and help them determine next steps.” PUR says its faucet filters are “independently tested and certified by NSF International (NSF) to remove 99 percent of lead at levels up to 10 times the applicable federal and state drinking water standard of 15 parts per billion (ppb).”

Erik Olson, senior director of health programs at Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), is “troubled” by these developments. NRDC, an environmental group, sued Newark last year for failing to comply with regulations for the control of lead in drinking water.

“Everyone in Newark deserves safe drinking water,” Olson said, in a statement. “We welcome EPA’s recent letter stating that Newark residents with lead service lines should be provided bottled water, though we do not understand why EPA does not insist on protecting other at-risk people such as those with lead plumbing and whose water tests high for lead. We also continue to be concerned about risks to residents in the eastern part of the City, the Wanaque service area.”

The bottled water distribution targets families served by the Pequannock water system with lead service lines who have received filters. Other Newark residents are served by the Wanaque water system, which was not prioritized for filters.

Newark does not know why the filters are failing, but one resident is not surprised by the turn of events.

“We’ve been telling them this for the last two years, but we were looked at as crazy,” said Debra Salters, a member of advocacy group Newark Water Coalition.

“We told [city officials] to give out bottled water and now they’re talking about they’re only giving out two cases. That’ll be gone by the end of the night,"" she said.

According to Salters, residents must show two forms of identification to collect water. She believes that complicates an already alarming situation.

“You couldn’t listen to the residents who pay your salary. You had to wait until the federal government put their foot on your neck and made you do something,” Salters said. “This is a life crisis.”

A reduction of lead levels is expected by the end of this year as stated in Murphy’s and Baraka’s statement. They are “optimistic” that the new corrosion control treatment will “prevent leaching from lead pipes.”"
"Sasse demands Barr ‘rip up’ 2008 Epstein deal, bring co-conspirators to justice",https://nypost.com,['August'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/14/sasse-demands-barr-rip-up-2008-epstein-deal-bring-co-conspirators-to-justice/,"Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) has urged Attorney General William Barr to “rip up the non-prosecution, non-investigation agreement” for Jeffrey Epstein so that co-conspirators are brought to justice.

“Too many of Epstein’s secrets have gone to the grave with him, and the Department must not allow his death to be one last sweetheart deal for his co-conspirators,” Sasse wrote in a letter sent to Barr on Tuesday.

“The victims of Epstein’s international sex trafficking ring deserve justice. In order to bring Epstein’s co-conspirators to justice, the Department of Justice should rip up the non-prosecution, non-investigation agreement entered into by Epstein and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida in 2008.”

That 2008 deal, put together by then-US Attorney and recently ousted Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, granted Epstein and “any potential co-conspirators” immunity from federal charges in exchange for him pleading guilty to a single state charge.

Epstein served 13 months in a state prison in Florida, but was allowed out six days a week so he could work from his private office.

Sasse slammed the deal, writing, “This agreement should shock the conscience of anyone familiar with its details.

“These problems run far beyond those identified by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, which ruled that federal prosecutors violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act by hiding the terms of the deal from the women and girls that Epstein raped and exploited until after it was entered.”

This is the second letter Sasse has sent Barr regarding Epstein.

On Saturday, Sasse wrote to the attorney general demanding answers on circumstances that allowed for Epstein to commit suicide in federal custody.

“Heads must roll,” Sasse wrote.

“Every single person in the Justice Department — from your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer — knew that this man was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn’t be allowed to die with him.”

Barr has promised to bring anyone involved in Epstein’s crimes to justice.

“We will get to the bottom of what happened and there will be accountability,” Barr said, adding, “Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims deserve justice and they will get it.”"
The USDA Dropped a Corn Bombshell. What It Means for Deere and Other Stocks.,https://www.barrons.com,['Al Root'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-usda-dropped-a-corn-bombshell-what-it-means-for-deere-and-other-stocks-51565705634,"Text size

The U.S. Agriculture Department, or USDA, zigged on Monday when the market expected it to zag.

The farming agency released its monthly world grain report, called WASDE, and, surprisingly, the agency sees a bigger U.S. corn crop—despite poor weather in the Midwest. Corn prices cratered as a result.

Corn futures contact prices dropped “limit down” on Monday—dropping about 6%—meaning futures reached their maximum allowable daily losses on Chicago exchanges. And corn prices were down again Tuesday. What roiled commodity traders was the USDA increasing the expected corn yield per acre for farmers in the 2018/2019 crop year. (For farmers the “crop year” goes from harvest to harvest.) The USDA now expect farmers to produce about 169 bushels of corn per acre, up from expecting 166 in July. (Bad weather has had an impact though—U.S. corn yield was more than 176 bushels per acre last year.)

That’s good news if you are a user of corn, such as a food company, such as corn buyer Post (ticker: POST).

“We view the USDA’s August WASDE report as positive for packaged food manufacturers, as fears over a run-up in grain-driven input cost inflation are being alleviated by a robust corn supply outlook,” writes Citigroup analyst Cornell Burnette in a Tuesday research report. “Thus, our positive thesis for the sector remains intact.”

But higher corn production isn’t such good news if you sell inputs or equipment to farmers, such as Deere (DE).

“Deere’s near-term fundamentals were challenging exiting the second quarter 2019 but there was hope that investors could look through near-term weakness as higher corn prices would deliver demand reacceleration in 2020,” writes Baird analyst Mig Dobre in a Monday evening research report. “The 2019 crop still has challenges that could drive prices higher, but the near term is decidedly more difficult after today’s USDA forecast updates.” Dobre rates shares of Deere Buy, but he cut his price target to $150 from $170 based on the USDA news.

Things could still change for the U.S. corn outlook. Weather, exports, ethanol demand all feed into the USDA models, and all inputs are fluid. Agricultural consultant Mark Feight of International Agribusiness Group, or IAG, believes the corn acreage figures could still come down when the USDA reports figures in October.

Stocks usually don’t overreact to a single crop report because equity prices reflect long-term business value—at least, that’s what the theory says. The long-term trend in agricultural prices and acreage matters more for stocks. Still, there were some big moves along the agricultural value chain on Monday.

Post , for instance, dropped 1.4% on Monday along with the 400-point drop of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That wasn’t a surprise, but ethanol producer Green Plains (GPRE) actually dropped 4.3%, even though corn is an input for the company. Ethanol demand also influences Green Plains stock. Input provider Corteva (CTVA) dropped 6%, and tractor maker Deere dropped 5% in Monday trading.

35 vintage photos taken by the EPA reveal what American cities looked like before pollution was regulated,https://www.businessinsider.com,['James Pasley'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.businessinsider.com/what-us-cities-looked-like-before-epa-regulated-pollution-2019-8,"Don't let the soft, sepia tones fool you. The United States used to be dangerously polluted.

Before President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, the environment and its well-being was not a federal priority.

In the early 1970s, the EPA launched the "" The Documerica Project,"" which leveraged 100 freelance photographers to document what the US looked like. By 1974, there were of 81,000 photos. The National Archives digitized nearly 16,000 and made them available online.

Many of the photos were taken before water and air pollution were fully regulated. The Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, and the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972.

Baltimore, Birmingham, Cleveland, Delaware, Denver, Kansas, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New Jersey, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and San Francisco all feature here, in shots filled with smoke, smog, acid, oil, rubbish, and sewage.

None of the 35 photos are pretty (other than the film-photo haze), but it's worth remembering what US cities used to be like before we cared what we put into the air, soil, and water."
DHS in a ‘Mad Scramble’ to Catch Up With Domestic Terror,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-homeland-security-is-in-a-mad-scramble-to-catch-up-with-domestic-terror,"It wasn’t that long ago that senior Department of Homeland Security officials shied away from focusing on domestic terrorism, often fearing political backlash.

The White House pushed the sprawling department to focus overwhelmingly on immigration enforcement, at the expense of just about everything else. DHS veterans told reporters that white supremacist terror was the FBI’s issue, not theirs. When a DHS analyst warned of far-right violence in 2009, congressional Republicans bellowed in protest, with a lasting chilling effect. Under the Trump administration, the department disbanded a group of intelligence analysts focused on domestic terrorism. Cybersecurity staffers got shipped to the border. In the days after the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, leading DHS minds focused on the migrant caravan. And, as NBC reported, the administration cut funding for DHS grants designed to prevent radicalization.

But as white supremacists have terrorized communities around the country, senior officials at DHS have tried to step up their work against the threat. They fought to get that counter-radicalization money back, for instance. A consensus within the department slowly began to form: DHS exists to fight terrorism—even when those terrorists are American.

Then came the El Paso shooting, which left 22 people dead in the Texas border city. That’s when, in the words of one senior DHS official, “ the dam broke.”

“There were robust conversations before El Paso,” added that official, who spoke anonymously to discuss internal talks. “Acting DHS Sec. Kevin McAleenan has been very clear that this is a top priority for the Department, as Nielsen had also previously stressed. But the conditions are different now. We will ensure the Department is doing everything possible with existing capabilities and resources, and seek more capabilities and resources as needed. And more will be needed.”

Since the shootings in El Paso and Dayton that left 31 people dead, DHS officials are working overtime to find ways to ramp up domestic terrorism prevention efforts, according to four DHS officials familiar with the situation. But it’s not easy, sources said; over the last two years, the department has maximized resources focused on border security, and it’s already strained.

“These two shootings have caused a mad scramble where they are pulling every publication and book off the shelf in an attempt to figure out what they can do to address this problem,” said one former DHS official.

Senior DHS leadership had a call on Saturday night after the El Paso shooting and then again on Sunday afternoon, after a second shooter killed 10 people in Dayton. The violence was spiraling. So McAleenan directed senior officials to start a working group to assess what DHS was doing about domestic terrorism and what more it could do immediately, according two sources familiar with the situation. The department’s advisory council is supposed to speak with McAleenan about domestic terrorism prevention this week, one of those sources said.

It’s too soon to tell if El Paso will be a turning point for DHS. But just taking a serious look at what the department is doing to fight domestic terrorism and what more it can do—that marks a significant moment, especially when many in the White House remained laser-focused on stopping the flow of immigrants.

“People are scrambling,” said a current DHS official.

And they aren’t alone. The Daily Beast reported last week that the National Counterterrorism Center, another 9/11-era counterterror institution, has also quietly amped up its work fighting domestic terror.

DHS, meanwhile, heightened its efforts last week after President Trump condemned white supremacy and domestic terrorism. For more than two years, according to current and former DHS officials, the White House has directed the department to rev up its efforts to deal with the mass flow of migrants into the country.

Now, department officials are looking to elevate the mission to prevent domestic terrorism by leveraging existing resources and surging capabilities from throughout the department, according to another senior DHS official. It’s not dissimilar to the concept the department uses in responding to a natural disaster, the official added. The number of people involved is smaller, but it draws from people all across the department. They’re also putting together an action plan looking at the growing threat from domestic terrorism, according to multiple DHS sources.

“To ensure our communities are safe, we are focusing efforts on enhancing our prevention and preparedness, and creating response assets in communities so they will be better able to mitigate risk and respond to these kinds of events when they do occur,” McAleenan said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “So far we’ve reached thousands of people in communities around the country, educating them about indicators of radicalization or mobilization to violence. Community awareness can play a major role in preventing an attack.”

But significant turnover among senior DHS leadership has complicated its efforts to help state and local law enforcement partners.

“Trying to find someone in charge at DHS overall—it’s been hard lately!” said one senior state law enforcement official who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “Since DHS has been in existence, it’s always been fairly chaotic. But this is probably the longest it’s been with so many people in acting positions.”

The department’s effort to increase its focus on domestic terrorism has left officials in DHS playing catch up. One official said some of the individuals working overtime do not have domestic terrorism experience, as most have spent their careers on international terrorism.

“That’s a bit of a challenge,” said the official.

The challenge hasn’t gone unnoticed.

“This scramble is a direct result of the fact that notwithstanding concerns raised by some in DHS over the past several years, there have been no serious planning efforts by the department to focus on [domestic terrorism],” said John Cohen, former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “That’s due in large part because of the insistence by the White House that the department first and foremost focus on immigration and border security.”

The Daily Beast reported on DHS’ decision to disband a group of domestic terror analysts just days before McAleenan took office. Soon after, the secretary directed a review of all DHS efforts to combat targeted violence and domestic terrorism, including programs funded by federal grants doled out to the department in 2017, a department spokesperson said.

“Given the proof-of-concept nature of these programs, DHS was not prepared until earlier this year to make an assessment of their efficacy,” a spokesperson for the department said, adding that McAleenan directed the department to request more funds for domestic terrorism prevention for fiscal year 2020."
New policy at Interior's in-house watchdog clamps down on interactions with press,https://thehill.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/457452-new-policy-at-interiors-in-house-watchdog-clamps-down-on,"A new policy rolled out by the Interior Department’s inspector general puts strict limits on the office’s interactions with reporters.

The press office for the agency’s internal watchdog, which is investigating a number of Interior officials, including Secretary David Bernhardt, is now prohibited from providing journalists with information on its work beyond, “Our report speaks for itself,” or “We have no comment.”

The policy, which took effect Aug. 5, is a change from the previous practice of sometimes providing reporters with background or additional information.

When asked this week about a new report released by the IG office, the press office told The Hill it could use one of two statements: “Our report speaks for itself” or “We have no comment.”

The policy change comes under the leadership of acting Inspector General Gail Ennis.

Mark Lee Greenblatt, Trump's nominee to replace Ennis as head of Interior’s IG office, has been confirmed by the Senate but has not yet assumed the role. Greenblatt, a former assistant inspector general for investigations at the Commerce Department, is anticipated to begin his new job in the coming weeks.

Stephen Hardgrove, chief of staff for the inspector general’s office, said in an email to The Hill that the policy change “was put in place for the period of time that we had an Acting Inspector General and while awaiting the arrival of our appointed Inspector General, Mark Greenblatt.”

“Of course each Office of Inspector General determines what, if any, information they choose to elaborate on for closed investigation,” he added.

In late May, President Trump Donald John TrumpWhy Republicans should think twice about increasing presidential power The opioid crisis is the challenge of this generation Flynn, Papadopoulos to speak at event preparing 'social media warriors' for 'digital civil war' MORE appointed Ennis, the Social Security Administration (SSA) inspector general, to also oversee the Interior Department watchdog office.

Ennis was sworn in for the SSA role at the beginning of the year, her first time serving as an inspector general (IG). The Senate confirmed her by unanimous consent.

Interior’s IG office is handling a number of investigations, including an ethics probe into six Interior officials, including Bernhardt.

The IG office told House lawmakers that it is also looking into former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: EPA proposes scrapping limits on coal plant waste | Appointee overseeing federal lands once advocated selling them | EPA lifts Obama-era block on controversial mine Latest appointee overseeing federal public lands once advocated to sell them Overnight Energy: Warren edges past Sanders in poll of climate-focused voters | Carbon tax shows new signs of life | Greens fuming at Trump plans for development at Bears Ears monument MORE's alleged use of private email to conduct public business. That investigation is being included in a criminal probe overseen by a joint Justice Department and Interior IG team, Ennis told House lawmakers in a letter released publicly at the end of July.

The letter was the first public acknowledgement that Zinke is being criminally investigated for matters involving his stake in a Montana land deal with the chairman of oil services company Haliburton, as well as Interior’s initial decision to obstruct construction of a tribal casino project in Connecticut following heavy lobbying from rival casino MGM.

Ennis previously worked as a partner at the Washington-based law firm WilmerHale, which lobbies for a number of clients with business before Interior. One of the companies represented by the firm is Twin Metals, a Minnesota-based mineral mining company that is lobbying to build a hotly debated copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In May, the Trump administration moved to renew one of the mine's mineral leases, reversing a decision from the Obama administration.

Unlike most IG officials, who are usually career government employees, Ennis is a political appointee who previously contributed to Trump’s campaign.

She donated $4,275 in total to Trump’s Make America Great Again Committee and his presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission data."
New Jersey Paralegal Allegedly Used DOJ Access to Help Son’s Gang Identify “Snitches”,https://slate.com,['Molly Olmstead'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/new-jersey-gang-paralegal-doj-access-snitches.html,"The state seal of New Jersey. Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Wikipedia.

A paralegal in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office has been accused of using her government access to identify people in her son’s gang who cooperated with investigators, putting them in danger of retaliation from their fellow gang members, according to filings in a federal court in Brooklyn. The woman pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday.

According to prosecutors, Tawanna Hilliard, 44, used her access to Department of Justice computers to search databases to identify cooperating witnesses from the 5-9 Brims, a set of the Bloods street gang, at the direction of members of that gang. According to NJ.com, Hilliard had worked in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney Office’s Civil Division for nine years.

Hilliard also specifically targeted the co-defendant in a robbery case that resulted in her son, Tyquan, being sentenced to 10 years in prison. In May 2018, the man and Tyquan Hilliard robbed an AT&T store in Monticello, New York. The men threatened the store clerk and two shoppers with a gun and bound them with duct tape in a storage room. They fled the scene and led the police on a high-speed chase before crashing their car and being captured.

Texts between the mother and son allegedly show Tawanna Hilliard complaining that the co-defendant’s cooperation with the investigators after the robbery ruined her son’s defense. The man was “giving up murders, victims, shooters and all…SMH,” she wrote in a text, according to court documents. Tawanna Hilliard allegedly responded by posting a video on YouTube of the co-defendant talking to investigators about that robbery, with the title “NYC Brim Gang Member Snitching Pt. 1.” The man and his family then received death threats from other inmates linked to the Bloods, according to prosecutors.

According to NJ.com, the indictment contends that before his arrest, Hilliard told her son in an April 2016 call that she had “looked up” cases for another gang member who wanted to locate people who “snitched.”

Hilliard has been charged with witness tampering, obstruction of justice, and obtaining information from a government computer. She was released on bond with the order not to contact her son or other gang members. Her son is also charged in the indictment."

MADISON, Wis. - Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul has joined a multistate lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision to ease restrictions on coal-fired power plants.

State Department's overly broad travel warnings undermine US mission,https://thehill.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/457170-state-departments-overly-broad-travel-warnings-undermine-us-mission,"BERBERA, SOMALILAND — To depart Mogadishu’s heavily-armed international airport — Somalia’s “green zone” — is an expensive prospect. Decades of lawlessness and instability in Mogadishu make insurance almost impossible. Few foreigners will pass outside the airport’s heavily fortified walls without armored cars and multiple personal security contractors. Most diplomats in Somalia (including America’s and Europe’s) are either sequestered inside the airport or remain in Kenya.

But Berbera is a different story. The main port in the northern region of Somaliland is thriving. New hotels are opening. Locals and foreigners intermingle on the beach, and both men and women gather on doorsteps and in tea houses in the evening to watch football, gossip, or shop. In Somaliland’s capital Hargeisa, money changers leave bundles of cash unattended as crime is so low. While al-Shabaab repeatedly strikes deep into Mogadishu and Kismayo, there has not been a terrorist attack in Hargeisa in more than a decade. While President Bihi’s government in Somaliland controls approximately 50,000 square miles of territory, President Farmajo in Mogadishu has secured only around 50,000 square feet, equivalent to the grounds of Villa Somalia, Somalia’s heavily-fortified White House.

According to the State Department’s travel warning, there is no difference between the two regions. “Do not travel to Somalia due to crime, terrorism, kidnapping and piracy,” it warns. It declares violent crime pernicious across regions, and continues to warn about piracy, even though Puntland’s pirates have not captured a single ship in more than two years, and Somaliland’s coast guard has never permitted piracy off its 450-mile coast.

Inaccurate and imprecise State Department warnings are not limited to Somalia. The State Department’s Iraq warning neither acknowledges Iraqi Kurdistan’s decades-long security nor the dramatic drop in Baghdad violence. The United States recently got a taste of its own medicine when Uruguay issued a travel warning citing “growing indiscriminate violence, mostly for hate crimes, including racism and discrimination” as a reason to avoid travel to the United States, even as most towns and cities — let alone rural America — remain safer than ever.

Overly broad travel warnings matter. They undercut diplomacy and diminish soft power when America needs it most. They inflate insurance costs and dissuade investment. In effect, the State Department’s embrace of travel warning inaccuracy risks ceding entire countries to Russian, Chinese, Turkish, or Iranian influence as their businessmen sink roots while their American counterparts are absent.

There are other second order effects. Many universities now forbid students to study or research in areas subject to travel warnings. The irony here is that the countries where there are warnings are arguably the areas in which the United States most needs specialists.

They also breed corruption. I watched food shipments arrive in Berbera supervised by the World Food Programme. Because the UN, like the United States, does not differentiate between Somalia and Somaliland, the UN employees receive thousands of dollars of bonuses monthly due to supposed hazardous conditions which, in reality, do not exist. In short, it’s an expensive scam which costs American taxpayers. U.S. diplomats likewise receive similar danger pay and hardship bonuses, undermining the State Department’s already limited budget.

The reasons for such inaccurate warnings are complicated. Part of the problem is no security officer wants to loosen restrictions fearing that they could become a scapegoat in case of any future terrorism. This is why, more than a quarter century after the end of the Lebanese civil war, U.S. diplomatic security parameters remain largely unchanged. The Benghazi tragedy has also led the State Department to double down. Regional Security Officers feel the best way to protect staff is to hold them in gilded prisons, never mind undercutting any effectiveness.

Sometimes policy interferes. Since 2015, the State Department has refused to treat Somaliland differently than Somalia so as not to reinforce its separatism. That fiction not only undermines the veracity of all State Department warnings, but also cedes Somaliland to Russia or China.

Indeed, it can be a vicious circle as overly broad warnings become reason to dissuade diplomatic visits necessary to reassess the real situation, and they can even stand in the way of Congressional delegations and oversight.

Make no mistake: It’s essential to keep America’s diplomats and Americans safe, but inaccuracy and the State Department’s penchant for playing games with warnings risks undermining the reception of legitimate warnings and undermines the broader U.S. mission.

VA Partners With DoD to Upgrade Supply Chain at High Risk for Abuse,https://www.military.com,['Richard Sisk'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/08/14/va-partners-dod-upgrade-supply-chain-high-risk-abuse.html,"The Department of Veterans Affairs announced a partnership with the Defense Department this week to upgrade its supply chain system, which is perennially on a government watchdog agency's ""high risk"" list for waste, fraud and abuse.

The partnership with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will give the VA access to the DLA's worldwide procurement system in an effort to streamline the VA's purchase of everything from medical and surgical supplies to cleaning equipment and construction materials, the VA said in a news release Monday.

""This is a huge step forward in our efforts to transform VA into a modern, high-performing organization by simplifying operations and leveraging DoD's supply chain system to support our veterans,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in a statement.

Army Lt. Gen. Darrell Williams, director of the DLA, said the agreement would help the VA reduce costs for supplies.

Related content:

""On behalf of DoD, we are proud to be a value-add to VA on behalf of America's veterans,"" he said in a statement.

The VA release said the DLA will help ""create a centralized ordering system for VA"" aimed at ""reducing risk, waste, fraud and abuse in purchasing medical equipment and supplies,"" problems that have plagued the system for years and repeatedly been cited by the VA's Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office.

In March, the GAO again put the VA on its biennial ""high risk"" list of agencies and departments whose practices are open to abuse; it also added a new area of concern at the VA -- acquisition management.

""VA's procurement policies have historically been outdated, disjointed and difficult for contracting officers to use,"" the GAO report states.

In 2017, the department launched a new program aimed at overhauling its supply chain system to achieve $150 million in cost reductions, the GAO noted.

However, the GAO reported in November 2017 that the new program ""was rushed, lacked key stakeholder involvement and buy-in, and relied on establishing non-competitive blanket purchase agreements for the overwhelming majority of products, resulting in low utilization by medical centers.""

The VA's Office of Inspector General was particularly scathing in a series of 2017 reports on supply chain scandals at the Washington, D.C., VA Medical Center.

IG Michael Missal found the problems at the Washington VA so troubling that he took the unusual step of issuing preliminary findings prior to the final report to alert the Veterans Health Administration to a situation ""sufficient to potentially compromise patient safety.""

The final report concluded that no patients were harmed but found that $150 million in supplies had never been inventoried, storage areas were filthy, and there was no system for ensuring that defective medical instruments and supplies were not used on patients.

Poor oversight of the medical supply system led to shortages in operating rooms at the hospital, according to the report. At one point, the operating room ran out of vascular patches to seal blood vessels and ultrasound probes used to map blood flow.

In addition, the hospital had to borrow bone material for knee replacement surgeries and also ran out of tubes needed for kidney dialysis, forcing staff to go to a private-sector hospital to procure them, the report added.

Where do New York’s Democratic House members stand on impeachment?,https://www.cityandstateny.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-state/where-do-new-yorks-democratic-us-reps-stand-on-impeachment.html-0,"At least 121 members of the U.S. House of Representatives support starting formal impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, including 13 Democrats from New York. Among the notable New York representatives to come out in favor of taking such a step are House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey.

Should the House move forward, Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat, would direct the initial investigation into potential charges of high crimes and misdemeanors. The House Judiciary Committee began investigating obstruction of justice charges against the president and those close to him in March 2019.

Here is a list of all the members of the Democratic New York representatives positions on impeachment, as of Aug. 11.

In favor of impeachment proceedings:

Yvette Clarke

Rep. Yvette Clarke tweeted in May 2017, “We have to remove @realDonaldTrump from the White House as soon as possible. #Impeach45.” She had been open to impeachment for a long time and is quoted at a town hall in February 2017, “I will say to you, it won't be long.”

Eliot Engel

At the end of July, Engel released a statement outlining his support for an official impeachment inquiry. He said, “The American people want, and deserve, the truth. Mr. Mueller’s testimony provided ample evidence that the President committed obstruction of justice, and I believe the House must pursue a formal impeachment inquiry.” He also indicated that the House Foreign Affairs Committee would be looking into the Trump Campaign’s relationship with Russia and possible violations of the Emoluments Clause.

Adriano Espaillat

Rep. Adriano Espaillat first called for Trump’s impeachment in May 2017. Following the release of the Mueller Report and Mueller’s subsequent testimony before Congress, Espaillat released statement restating his support for an impeachment inquiry into Trump. Espaillat had previously held a forum with Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen in 2018 to show his support for impeachment.

Brian Higgins

Rep. Brian Higgins has indicated his support for an impeachment inquiry based off of the Trump administration’s unwillingness to cooperate with Congress’ investigations thus far. In a statement, he said, “This action cannot and should not be taken lightly. Over our history, the House has commenced impeachment proceedings 60 times, and has voted to impeach 19 federal officials: 15 federal judges, two presidents, one senator, and one cabinet member. While this process is difficult, it is necessary to preserve both our democracy as well as the role of Congress as a co-equal branch of government.”

Nita Lowey

Following the public testimony of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Lowey released a statement in favor of impeachment proceedings. She made clear that she supports Congress’ role in conducting oversight of the executive brand saying, “The House Judiciary Committee should move forward with an impeachment inquiry. I will continue to strongly support the important efforts of Democrats on the House Judiciary, Intelligence, Oversight, and other committees who are working to hold President Trump accountable to the American people and believe an impeachment inquiry will strengthen our hand in uncovering the truth. As Chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, I will also continue to work to ensure effective oversight of this administration.”

Carolyn Maloney

At a rally in Foley Square in June, Rep. Carolyn Maloney said that after much thought and deliberation she was in favor of beginning impeachment proceedings. She said, “I do not say this lightly. Impeachment is going to be a painful ordeal for our already divided nation. But, given the evidence we’ve seen of numerous violations of public trust and democratic norms, our commitment to the Constitution demands our action.” She also said that the president’s public statements about accepting opposition research from a foriegn power factored into her thinking.

Grace Meng

At the end of June, Rep. Grace Meng tweeted, “When I was sworn into Congress, I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. In this regard, I believe it is my duty to seek out truth for the sake of my constituents and our nation, and thereby call for an impeachment inquiry.” In a longer statement also shared on Twitter, she expressed her concern over 10 potential instances of the president obstructing justice laid out in the Mueller Report.

Jerrold Nadler

Nadler has been hard to pin down on the issue of impeachment, but in August he told CNN’s Erin Burnett that the investigation into the president’s alleged effort to obstruct justice were formal impeachment proceedings. He had previously said the Judiciary Committee’s investigation was basically an impeachment investigation.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted her support for Michigan Rep. Rashida Talib’s impeachment resolution in April. The freshman congresswoman told ABC more recently that support for impeachment was growing, even among members of the Democratic caucus in swing districts. She reiterated that it is her belief that an inquiry be opened to hold the president accountable. Following the ABC interview, she responded directly to Trump on Twitter, saying, “Opening an impeachment inquiry is exactly what we must do when the President obstructs justice, advises witnesses to ignore legal subpoenas, & more.”

Kathleen Rice

In a series of tweets in May, Rep. Kathleen Rice said, “Congress has a moral obligation to put our politics aside and take action. We need to start impeachment proceedings.” A week later, she added, “Robert Mueller made it clear that it was DOJ policy, not a lack of evidence, that prevented him from charging the President with a crime.”

José Serrano

Rep. José Serrano reached a conclusion on his position on impeachment in July. His office released a lengthy statement, where he said, “I make this statement with a heavy heart. As one of the few current Members of the House who served during the last impeachment proceedings in 1998, I am particularly aware of the wrenching nature of this constitutional process. It puts deep strain on our institution and on our democracy. To take steps towards impeachment is to understand that the threat to our nation is so great, and the ability to find recourse elsewhere is so slim, that we have no other choice. In my opinion, we have now reached that point.”

Paul Tonko

In a tweet-storm at the beginning of June, Rep. Paul Tonko said that based on the findings in the Mueller Report, Congress was obligated to open an impeachment inquiry into the president, saying, “After careful review of the evidence and testimony currently available, and in service to my oath, it is my judgment that Congress needs to accept the baton being handed to us by now former Special Counsel Mueller and open an impeachment inquiry to more fully assess the Constitutional implications of seemingly criminal actions by the President and his campaign, and to determine whether formal impeachment charges need to be filed.”

Nydia Velázquez

Rep. Nydia Velázquez shared a video on Twitter explaining in depth her reasons for calling for an official impeachment inquiry. In conclusion to her statement she said, “I’ve long viewed impeachment as a last resort -- not just because it is politically divisive, but also because such a course of action must be grounded in the facts. Today, given the facts available, I believe an impeachment inquiry is the only path forward. Congress has a solemn duty to hold this President accountable and I intend to live up to that duty.”

Velázquez pointed to her call for a special counsel investigation, and efforts to protect the integrity of the special counsel office prior to calling for impeachment. She also indicated that her constituents were highly concerned about the information in the Mueller Report.

Do not support or do not support right now:

Anthony Brindisi

Rep. Anthony Brindisi is clear that he does not support an impeachment inquiry and that has not changed. In a May video from NY NOW he said, “I am not in favor of impeachment. I think we need to move forward here and try to look at issues that we can find compromise on.”

Antonio Delgado

Rep. Antonio Delgado has not taken an official stance on impeachment, but when asked by NY Now he said did not run for Congress to impeach the president and would wait to make a decision about impeachment after congressional investigations had more information.

Hakeem Jeffries

A spokesman for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries told the New York Times that the representative does not support impeachment at this time. In an interview with MSNBC in May, Jeffries explained that he wanted more information from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation before taking any further steps towards impeachment. In a statement to the BKReader, Jeffries camp said, “The Judiciary Committee should continue to follow the facts, apply the law and be guided by the Constitution, as it relates to holding the president accountable for any high crimes and misdemeanors that may have been committed”

Sean Patrick Maloney

In April, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney told MSNBC that the president likely “deserved to be impeached,” but that an impeachment inquiry could be “counterproductive” for Congress and impede Democratic efforts to get the president out of office in 2020.

Gregory Meeks

Rep. Gregory Meeks holds the position that starting impeachment proceedings is not a good idea because it would be a partisan effort that would be blocked in the Senate. On MSNBC a few months ago, he said that oversight investigations should continue looking into the administration because a case had to be made for a bipartisan effort to remove the president.

Joseph Morelle

Rep. Joseph Morelle’s spokeswoman told City & State, “Rep. Morelle supports Congress exercising its constitutional authority and responsibility to provide oversight of the President through continued investigations into his administration and campaign. Before advancing articles of impeachment, he believes these investigations must be allowed to conclude and their findings presented to the American people.”

Max Rose

Rep. Max Rose told Politico in May that he thinks that pursuing an impeachment inquiry heightens the possibility of Democrats losing control of the house in 2020. He urged his fellow representatives to not get distracted by impeachment and keep working towards legislative solutions for their constituents.

Thomas Suozzi

A spokesman for Rep. Thomas Suozzi told The New York Times that the representative does not support impeachment right now. In an interview with the Long Island publication The Island Now in July, Suozzi indicated support for oversight of the executive branch, but stopped short of endorsing a formal impeachment inquiry, instead saying “we must not be distracted from doing our jobs as legislators and work to solve the problems we face in our country.”

Interior centralizes ethics reviews after recent high-profile probes,https://thehill.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/regulation/energy-environment/457415-interior-centralizes-ethics-reviews-after-recent-high-profile,"The Department of the Interior will be centralizing ethics reviews across its many agencies at its headquarters, following years of ethics investigations centered on many of the department’s top staff.

In an order signed by Secretary David Bernhardt Wednesday and shared with The Hill, ethics officials at the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service and others will report to ethics officials based at Interior’s headquarters rather than agency directors.

But ethics officials who reviewed the plan criticized its broad focus on all agency employees rather than the high-level officials currently being investigated for ethical lapses.

Scott de le Vega, director of Interior’s Departmental Ethics Office, said the change was designed to ensure Interior’s roughly 70,000 employees are getting consistent ethics advice regardless of which branch of the department they serve.

They also want to ensure ethics officers are held accountable for the advice they give.

“The Department of the Interior has received criticism from the Government Accountability Office, from the Office of Government Ethics, not to mention from the Hill itself and Republican and Democratic administrations about lapses in ethical behavior from the highest levels to the lowest levels at the department,” de la Vega told The Hill.

“The way we are reorganizing and restructuring things will build a stronger program so that we ensure that our employees have the best tools and resources for them to mitigate and reduce the chances of those ethical lapses occurring again.”

Ethics experts apprised of the plan by The Hill criticized its focus on thousands of employees rather than the top staff whose actions have resulted in at least half a dozen investigations by the agency’s Office of Inspector General, as well as countless other requests for investigations.

Much of the attention to ethics issues within the department during the Trump administration has focused squarely on those at the top, particularly at Bernhardt, a former energy lobbyist who has been followed by protesters donning “swamp creature” masks during many of his congressional appearances.

“Ethical leadership should come from the top of the top. An ethical workplace depends on leadership that sends the tone,” said Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center (CLC). “So the idea that the fix is to centralize who other ethic officials report to ... they might be missing the boat a little bit. They should definitely be focused on ensuring their senior level officials are complying with ethics laws first.”

The CLC was one of several groups to file an ethics complaint against Bernhardt following reporting from The New York Times that he was influential in easing rules that would benefit a former client.

“The ethical problems at Interior have nothing to do with 70,000 rank-and-file employees and has everything to do with David Bernhardt and his inner circle,” said Aaron Weiss, at the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group that has repeatedly criticized ethics issues at Interior. “There’s 70,000 employees getting good ethics advice, and we know David Bernhardt has been getting poor ethics advice and in some cases doing everything he can to skirt his ethics obligations.”

The centralized ethics office will be housed within Interior’s solicitor’s office. That’s not unusual, ethics experts say, but the man nominated to fill that post and who already fills the role in a de facto capacity, Daniel Jorjani, has been mired in ethical issues of his own.

Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenBusiness groups to Trump: Tariff delay isn't enough Democrats give cold shoulder to Warren wealth tax Senate Dems urge Mnuchin not to cut capital gains taxes MORE (D-Ore.) has vowed to try and block his confirmation given concerns about whether he was truthful to Congress during his confirmation hearing about his potential involvement in a controversial ethics policy at the Interior Department that has been criticized for giving political appointees more power over public records.

De la Vega said the order from Bernhardt comes as he is trying to increase ethics staff throughout Interior, raising the number from the 21 employees he oversaw when arriving in April of last year to 90.

Bernhardt’s order directs the agency to complete its ethics reorganization by the end of the year.

De la Vega, a career official, served in a number of capacities at the White House under the Obama administration, including as the ethics official for former Vice President Biden.

He said the secretary’s office won’t be let off the hook under the reorganization.

“Making sure that the secretary’s office — and all of the politicals at [Interior] within the secretary’s office — making sure they get proper ethics advice and proper ethics attention to the questions and concerns that they raised in the course of their policymaking, that is also a top priority for my office,” de la Vega said.

Ethics experts said centralizing ethics functions isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it could sideline ethics officials within departments that are the most familiar with how they function and what conflicts of interest must be avoided.

“The mandate of Interior is so broad and there are so many bureaus,” Marsco said. “I don’t understand how centralizing who the reporting person is gets at the ultimate goal of making sure everyone is receiving consistent advice. If that’s the goal, there are other ways to do that like more training.”

The ethics reorganization comes on the heels of another one announced just last week. Interior will now be organized into 12 regions based on various watersheds to consolidate communication between 49 offices spread across eight different bureaus within Interior. Each region will be headed by a field assistant who will coordinate activities across the bureaus.

Both moves have been described as a way of centralizing power within the secretary’s office.

“It’s certainly centralizing the power of the designated agency ethics official,” Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said of the role filled by de la Vega. “In normal times I could see why they’d do this, but these are not normal times.”

Treasury Department Is Wrong. China Didn't Just Devalue Its Currency.,https://www.dailysignal.com,['Riley Walters'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/08/13/the-treasury-department-is-wrong-china-didnt-just-devalue-its-currency/,"The U.S. Treasury Department has incorrectly labeled China a manipulator of its currency.

An important distinction exists between devaluing a currency and currency depreciation.

Devaluing implies the People’s Bank of China actively manipulated the value of the Chinese renminbi to gain unfair advantage for its exports. Depreciation simply means the renminbi has lost purchasing power relative to the U.S. dollar, based on market forces.

There’s no indication that China is actively devaluing its currency.

However, according to the Treasury Department, China met a broad definition of manipulation laid out in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, which says of the Treasury secretary:

The Secretary considers that such manipulation is occurring with respect to countries that (1) have material global current account surpluses; and (2) have significant bilateral trade surpluses with the United States.

The law itself doesn’t make clear what a “significant” level of trade surplus with the U.S. equals.

Like many things Congress does, it leaves the most critical details of the law to the executive branch to determine. It must do so, because the criteria laid down in the law could implicate any number of countries, such as Japan, India, Taiwan, Thailand, and South Korea.

And the U.S. trade deficit with the European Union is more than $100 billion.

Yet, the criteria Treasury used in this case are different from another criterion it uses to monitor and label currency manipulators based on the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015.

Under that law, and by standards set by the Treasury, a country is considered a currency manipulator only if it: 1) has an annual trade surplus with the U.S. of more than $20 billion; 2) has a material current account surplus that’s more than 2% of its gross domestic product; and 3) has shown persistent, one-sided intervention in foreign exchange markets, with net foreign exchange purchases of more than 2% of its gross domestic product.

China meets only one of these three criteria. It has had a trade surplus with the U.S. valued at more than $300 billion a year since 2012. It hasn’t met more than one criteria since 2016.

Even then, a dozen other countries, such as Mexico, Vietnam, and Switzerland, also meet at least one criteria established under the 2015 law.

The Context

The recent announcement comes just days after President Donald Trump announced new taxes on $300 billion worth of imports from China, to begin Sept. 1.

It also comes just after news that the Chinese renminbi depreciated against the U.S. dollar to a symbolic 7 renminbi to $1, down from roughly 6.88 renminbi last month.

Trump claimed this recent depreciation was because of manipulation even before the Treasury Department had a chance to clarify.

Nonetheless, the depreciation of the renminbi beyond 7 renminbi has always been seen as significant.

It signals a further weakening of the Chinese economy. Currencies tend to trend along with the health of their local economies. That means when the U.S. economy is strong, the dollar appreciates. When the Chinese economy is weakening, the renminbi depreciates. Both are happening.

That’s why over the past four years, the renminbi has depreciated against the dollar roughly 13%, while China’s annual growth in gross domestic product has decreased from 7% to 6.2%.

The depreciation beyond 7 renminbi was also seen by the Trump administration as a potential offset to the cost of tariffs it has imposed on imports of goods from China.

The administration already has levied a 25% additional tax on roughly $250 billion worth of goods from China. New tariffs, a 10% additional tax on $300 billion worth of goods from China, could go into force as soon as Sept. 1.

A weaker Chinese currency implies American dollars can buy more Chinese exports, while the Chinese can buy fewer American exports. Despite the change in the dollar/renminbi exchange rate, Americans have been paying billions of dollars a month in import taxes.

Value of China’s Currency

According to international measures, both the Chinese renminbi and U.S. dollar are overvalued by as much as 15% to 20%.

According to the Bank for International Settlements, the real effective exchange rate for China and the U.S. is roughly 123.7 and 115.6, respectively.

That’s well above an index that’s equal to 100, which weighs their relative strength to other global currencies and takes into consideration consumer prices.

The Treasury Department’s semiannual report on the foreign exchange policies of our major trading partners stopped publishing the real effective exchange rate of the Chinese renminbi—potentially because it goes against any argument that China’s currency is undervalued.

China does have a history of currency manipulation. Questions about China’s currency interventions arose in 1992, 1994, 2003, and 2014. Since then, to the extent China has manipulated its currency it has done so only to prop up the value—in order to stem capital flight, not to devalue the currency in an attempt to boost exports, which is mostly what the 1988 law is about.

However, legitimate concerns over China’s currency management haven’t arisen for the past five years, and not since Beijing stopped artificially pegging the renminbi’s value to the dollar.

Now, the People’s Bank of China sets an exchange rate that’s more or less determined by the value of several global currencies and allows the renminbi to depreciate up to 2% a day.

It’s easier for the bank to allow the renminbi to depreciate up to 7 renminbi than to continue to cut into foreign exchange reserves to keep it propped up.

Negotiations on the Horizon

A silver lining beyond the heated rhetoric is that labeling China will have little real effect.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will now have to negotiate with Beijing either bilaterally or through the International Monetary Fund to achieve an effective balance of payments.

Reports from earlier this year said a currency agreement is a part of the looming U.S.-China deal. Very little suggests the U.S. could take even further punitive action against China beyond the use of more tariffs.

But the recent escalation, leading to a potential currency war and prolonging of U.S.-China trade tensions, spooked markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3% on Monday.

And if the Trump administration is somehow successful in persuading Beijing to manipulate its currency in the other direction—appreciate the renminbi against the dollar—it would just mean Americans would have to pay even more for Chinese imports.

Editor’s note: The second chart has been modified to correct inadvertently reversed trend lines for the U.S. dollar and Chinese renminbi."
Protesters in Milwaukee take aim at Veterans Affairs contract negotiations,https://www.jsonline.com,"['Meg Jones', 'Published P.M. Ct Aug.']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2019/08/13/va-labor-contract-would-harm-workers-protesters-say/1993022001/,"CLOSE

Holding signs and banners that read ""Don't Privatize the VA,"" ""Union Busting is Disgusting"" and ""VA Employees Deserve Dignity, Fairness, Respect,"" a small group stood on a sidewalk near Milwaukee's VA Medical Center Tuesday afternoon to protest employee contract negotiations.

Some were members of the union representing Milwaukee VA Healthcare System employees, some were members of other unions and some were military veterans.

Gayle Griffin, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 3, said the contract proposed by the Department of Veterans Affairs is unfair.

""I think it's a disservice to us and to the veterans we serve,"" said Griffin, a certified nursing assistant who has worked at the Milwaukee VA for 11 years.

In early May, the Department of Veterans Affairs proposed a new collective bargaining agreement with more than 250,000 federal employees that would sharply limit the number of hours VA employees can perform union work while on the clock.

The VA contends its proposal would also empower supervisors, streamline hiring and job classifications and make sure the contract doesn't interfere with the MISSION Act, which funnels tax dollars to private health care facilities for veteran care.

""It's time for a reset in VA's approach to labor-management relations,"" Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie said in May. ""A reluctance to challenge the status quo produced the current agreement, which includes many benefits that favor the union rather than the veterans we are charged with serving.""

But the AFGE contends the new contract would strip protections employees currently have by removing language providing reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities, whistleblower protections, child care programs and requests to work remotely.

AFGE National Vice President Dorothy James said at Tuesday's protest in Milwaukee that the contract is an effort ""to destroy unions"" by curtailing time that could be spent on union activities and eliminating a third party to intervene in appeals of disciplinary actions.

""People would not have a democratic process with airing their grievances,"" said James. ""We would be turning back the clock.""

Department of Veterans Affairs Press Secretary Christina Mandreucci said in an email Tuesday that the union is trying to undermine the agency's attempts to improve medical care, customer service and accountability of staff.

""Whether through its condemnation of the MISSION Act or its efforts to repeal the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, AFGE has consistently fought for the status quo and opposed attempts to make (the) VA work better for veterans and their families,"" Mandreucci said.

""Now AFGE is taking the same approach with its refusal to accept common sense improvements to its collective bargaining agreement.""

The current contract has been in effect since 2011. Negotiations are ongoing.

The new bargaining agreement would curtail time used by union representatives to perform work for the union, such as collective bargaining negotiations or representing employees in grievance procedures, while they are on the job.

In its proposal, the VA contends that reducing taxpayer-funded union time from more than 1 million hours each year to 10,000 hours annually will redirect $48 million to services and medical care for veterans.

Cars driving by the group on West National Avenue honked and one man leaned out an open car window to say ""God bless you all, I'm a a vet.""

Tamekio Davis has been an assistant in the Milwaukee VA's mental health unit, known as the Domiciliary, for 17 years. Several of her family members are veterans. She's worried efforts to use private health care facilities for veterans and other changes could affect employees' pay and benefits.

""It's like they're trying to bust us up. I think they want to get rid of unions so they could fire you without protections,"" said Davis, who enjoys working with veterans going through in-patient treatment programs. ""I love what I do. Instead of going somewhere else to maybe get more money, I want to be here helping vets.""

(Jeenah Moon/Reuters)

The Justice Department on Tuesday reassigned the warden at the New York detention center where Jeffrey Epstein apparently hanged himself, and placed on leave two staffers monitoring his unit at the time — a shake-up ordered amid growing complaints about the facility made to hold some of the country’s most notorious suspects.

The Metropolitan Correctional Center, a high-rise holding roughly 760 prisoners, has been the subject of intense scrutiny since Epstein’s death while in federal custody last weekend. Critics called the incident emblematic of a neglected, understaffed and dysfunctional federal prison system.

The move to transfer Lamine N’Diaye, who had only recently begun working as the MCC’s warden, came a day after Attorney General William P. Barr decried “serious irregularities” there and a “failure” to keep Epstein secure.

[Attorney general rips ‘failure’ of detention center to secure Epstein]

On Tuesday, Barr “directed the Bureau of Prisons to temporarily assign” N’Diaye to a regional office, pending the outcome of internal investigations into Epstein’s death, the Justice Department said in a statement. The Bureau of Prisons declined to make N’Diaye available for an interview, and efforts to reach him separately were not successful. The two staffers placed on administrative leave were not identified.

“Additional actions may be taken as the circumstances warrant,” the department’s statement said.

Barr appointed James Petrucci, who has been running a federal prison in nearby Otisville, N.Y., as the facility’s new acting warden.

The MCC is run by the Bureau of Prisons, which is part of the Justice Department and falls under Barr’s authority.

Epstein, a 66-year-old registered sex offender and multimillionaire, was found hanging in his cell around 6:30 a.m. Saturday, according to officials familiar with the matter. He was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges when he died. Results of his autopsy are pending.

Epstein was being held in a special housing unit of the MCC called Nine South and should have been checked on by the staff every 30 minutes. But correctional officers had not done so for “several” hours before he was found by staff as they delivered breakfast to inmates, a person familiar with the matter said on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.

Serene Gregg, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3148, which represents the staffers, said in a text message, “I can’t confirm if in fact anyone has been placed on leave but this is not atypical when an investigation is initiated. It’s likely being done to preserve the integrity of the investigation.”

The FBI and the Justice Department’s inspector general have been investigating Epstein’s death, focusing on apparent breakdowns of policy at the jail in the hours before staffers discovered him unresponsive.

On Monday, Barr said he “was appalled … and, frankly, angry” to learn of the detention center’s “failure to adequately secure” Epstein. He did not specify what irregularities had been found in the aftermath of Epstein’s death but vowed accountability.

A Justice Department official said the Bureau of Prisons’s suicide reconstruction team, which includes psychologists, on Tuesday began attempting to model the event, analyzing how and why Epstein was able to kill himself. The department planned to send an “after action” team on Wednesday, which would perform a broader assessment.

To those who have worked in or around the MCC, Epstein’s death is viewed as a symptom of long-term problems there and, more broadly, within the Bureau of Prisons.

Robert Hood, a former chief of internal affairs for the bureau, said the MCC has had longtime problems with overcrowding and understaffing. But in recent years, he said, the bureau has been afflicted by a lack of leadership, with a significant number of senior positions filled by temporary appointments.

“A third of the leadership isn’t really home, and that means people are looking for leadership and accountability, and there’s a morale issue,” Hood said. “The system is in crisis mode.”

Bruce Barket, a lawyer who represents a former cellmate of Epstein’s, said an overhaul of the MCC is years overdue.

“There are individual guards who work hard and do a good job, but the culture there is a bad combination of lazy and cruel,” said Barket, who described the concrete jail as infested with insects and rodents, chronically understaffed and comically inefficient.

“There are clocks in the attorney visiting rooms that require an AA battery,” Barket said. “The reason the clocks don’t work is because nobody bothers to put the batteries in.”

Sometimes, incompetence in the building reaches alarming proportions, observers said. In May 2017, for instance, a bank robber named David Evangelista was accidentally released from the MCC, even after he told staff he still had years left on his sentence, according to people familiar with the matter.

During roughly six hours of freedom, Evangelista called his lawyer seeking advice, and the lawyer, David Wikstrom, told him to get back to the jail, these people said. Evangelista returned, and was ultimately transferred to a different federal detention center. Wikstrom declined to comment on the incident, which was first reported by Gangland News.

The MCC has had other recurring security gaps. In June, prosecutors accused former CIA employee Joshua Adam Shulte of smuggling cellphones into the jail so that he could wage an “information war” against the government as he continues to fight charges that he illegally transmitted national defense secrets.

Still, the MCC is considered one of the safest and most secure lockup in the federal system. When Joaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera, the drug kingpin better known as “El Chapo,” was brought to New York, he was jailed there because it was considered more secure than the federal lockup close to the Brooklyn courthouse where he was ultimately convicted.

The MCC’s problems with understaffing and a lack of resources are not unique to the facility, nor is Epstein’s the first death in federal custody to be blamed on such deficiencies.

Last year, Boston’s most infamous gangster, James “Whitey” Bulger, was beaten to death by inmates in a federal prison in West Virginia. While at least two people were immediately identified as suspects, no one has been charged in the killing.

Bulger’s lawyer, Hank Brennan, said the Epstein and Bulger cases “appear unique because we usually only hear about the high-profile cases. This isn’t unique; it’s an epidemic. It’s using indifference as a tool against people, and it’s beyond negligent by the Bureau of Prisons and whoever is controlling them.”

E.O. Young, national president of the Council of Prison Locals C-33, said Tuesday that the MCC faced significant staffing shortages due in part to a hiring freeze that had been implemented by the Trump administration. Under Trump, the Bureau of Prisons has experienced the second-most dramatic drop in the number of permanent employees of any department in the federal government, behind the IRS. The prison system saw a net loss of nearly 4,300 employees, or 11 percent of its payroll, in the first 20 months of the Trump administration, the most recent time period in which numbers are publicly available.

Because the facility is in downtown Manhattan, where the cost of living is high, it is seen as an unattractive post for prospective officers, and vacancies are hard to fill, Young said.

Young said he and other union officials recently convinced management to implement two incentive programs offering bonuses for those who transferred to the MCC or put off retirement. But the facility remains short-staffed, leading officers to work massive amounts of overtime and management having to assign people normally in other roles to officer duty, Young said.

Those factors were both at play the night of Epstein’s death, a local union official told The Washington Post over the weekend. The two officers assigned to watch Epstein’s unit were both on overtime — one forced, the other for the fourth or fifth time that week, union officials said. One did not normally work as a corrections officer, though a person familiar with the matter said the person had worked in that role for about seven years before taking a higher-paying job about five years ago.

Young praised the attorney general for acknowledging staffing shortages at the Bureau of Prisons and for lifting the hiring freeze in recent months, but he said it was “irresponsible” for Barr to blame prison officials before the investigation was complete.

Federal records show N’Diaye, the warden who was reassigned Tuesday, was at least the fifth person to lead the MCC in five years, and his work history — which includes time as the MCC’s head of correctional services and, later, as regional spokesman for the federal prison system — appeared to contrast with that of others who have held the high-pressure job.

Until five years ago, the path to the job of warden there at the MCC was more structured, with candidates having to first prove themselves as associate wardens at two or more other federal prisons, said Catherine Linaweaver, who retired as warden of the MCC in 2014. Linaweaver said the demands there were known to be unique and difficult for wardens, as one of the few pretrial facilities in the federal prison system.

“You have hundreds of inmates, each in some phase of presenting their defense, coming and going from the facility,” she said. “If one claimed he was being mistreated, it was not uncommon to have a judge call me up and ask what’s going on.”

In his first months in New York, N’Diaye had already been called to account by a group of attorneys representing federal suspects. The nonprofit Federal Defenders of New York demanded a meeting in May with the new warden to raise concerns about inmate treatment, particularly what they felt was a lack of adequate mental health care.

Linaweaver, who began her career in corrections as a teacher, said that as the MCC’s warden she never approved non-officers rotating into the special housing unit where Epstein was held, in part because it was protocol to cuff detainees when transferring them.

“It’s like anything. If you’re not doing it every day, you get rusty. You want guards practiced in the tactile side of corrections,” she said. “There are certain posts you do not pull your guards, and your special housing unit is one. You can’t take shortcuts with those people, or bad things happen.”

EPA's latest power grab is aimed at states' rights,https://thehill.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/457426-epas-latest-power-grab-is-aimed-at-states-rights,"The Environmental Protection Agency has just proposed a rule that would severely limit state authority to ensure that federally licensed pipelines, coal terminals, LNG facilities and other major energy infrastructure projects will not violate state water quality laws.

Innocently titled “Updating Regulations on Water Quality Certification” the proposed rule was issued on Aug. 8 in response to President Trump Donald John TrumpWhy Republicans should think twice about increasing presidential power The opioid crisis is the challenge of this generation Flynn, Papadopoulos to speak at event preparing 'social media warriors' for 'digital civil war' MORE’s Executive Order 13868 seeking to fast track energy projects. The order directed EPA to adopt new rules to implement the Water Act's Section 401 water quality certification provision which gives states the power to veto or condition federal licenses or permits to construct a variety of projects that impact water resources.

Impetus for the proposed rule has come mainly from the gas industry complaining that states like New York, Washington and Oregon have been using their 401 authority to block or delay these projects. Litigation challenging the states’ denial of 401 certification is underway in various state and federal courts.

ADVERTISEMENT

Rather than allow the judicial process to sort out industry claims that these “blue” states are abusing their 401 authority EPA is proposing a radical reinterpretation of the statute that would severely curtail the power of the states to protect their water resources.

First, EPA proposes to give the states less time to act on 401 certifications or lose their right to do so. The statute says the states must act within a “reasonable period of time” not to exceed 12 months from the date it receives the request for certification. Failure to meet the deadline means the state forfeits its rights of review. Courts have strictly enforced this statutory time limit even where the state claims the applicant has provided insufficient information to make an informed decision.

EPA wants to give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Army Corps of Engineers the power to determine what constitutes a “reasonable” period, suggesting that 6 months should be the norm. This would hamstring states with limited resources to evaluate complex projects and encourage companies to game the system by submitting minimal data and ignoring a state’s request for additional information knowing that the clock is ticking.

Second, EPA wants to shrink the scope of the states 401 authority and takes issue with the Supreme Court’s seminal decision in the 1994 PUD#1 case upholding the state of Washington’s imposition of a minimum flow condition on a FERC license for a proposed hydroelectric dam. In that case the utility argued that the condition exceeded the state’s authority because it was not limited to the ""discharge of fill material"" to build the dam and was not tied to any specific numeric water quality criteria.

Justice Sandra Day O’Connor emphatically rejected that argument and wrote an opinion giving states broad authority to consider the full impacts of the “activity” associated with the discharge. She said that a state may impose limitations necessary to protect designated uses of the water that go beyond numerical water quality criteria including flows needed to maintain salmon habitat. O'Connor noted that Congress gave the states broad discretion to base their certifications on ""any other appropriate"" state law requirement.

ADVERTISEMENT

In a remarkable show of bureaucratic chutzpah, the Trump EPA now says O’Conner got it all wrong. The proposed rule brazenly states “EPA is proposing to interpret section 401 differently than the Supreme Court did in PUD No. 1.” EPA criticizes the court's ""outmoded"" reasoning and says its more ""holistic' approach better reflects what it calls the “modern"" Clean Water Act.

It turns out what EPA means by a modern interpretation is one that strips the states of the authority Congress gave them to oppose projects that do not meet their standards for protecting not just the chemical composition of a water body but the overall health and biological integrity of the aquatic ecosystem.

Finally, EPA purports to give FERC and the Corps the final word on whether a state's rationale for denying or conditioning a federal permit is ""consistent with the scope"" of the Clean Water Act. If not, the licensing agencies can “set aside” the state’s decision, forcing the state to go to court to overturn the agency ruling while allowing construction to proceed. This stands the certification process on its head and flatly contradicts Congress’ express policy to “recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution.”

Ironically, the Trump EPA cited interference with states’ rights as a major reason for repealing the Waters of the United States rule adopted by the previous administration to clarify the jurisdictional scope of the Clean Water Act. It will be interesting to see how the states’ rights advocates respond to this far more serious impingement on state sovereignty.

DHS chief regrets 'unfortunate' timing of ICE raid of food processing plants in Mississippi,https://www.usatoday.com,"['David Jackson', 'Published P.M. Et Aug.']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/11/trump-aide-kevin-mcaleenan-unfortunate-timing-ice-raids-mississippi/1981130001/,"CLOSE

CLOSE Dozens of immigrant workers have been released a day after being detained in the largest immigration raid in a decade in the United States. AP

BEDMINSTER, N.J. – President Donald Trump's acting secretary of Homeland Security expressed regret Sunday for the timing of immigration raids that netted 680 workers at food processing plants in Mississippi, an operation that took place after a mass shooting that targeted Hispanics in El Paso, Texas.

""The timing was unfortunate,"" acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan said on NBC's ""Meet The Press.""

McAleenan said the long-planned raid received court approval before the operation that led to the arrests of 680 people, the majority of them Hispanic.

""That means those employers are just ignoring the law entirely in what they do,"" McAleenan said. ""That's why a judge gave us a warrant to go after them.""

McAleenan said the administration is aware that Hispanics feel targeted in the wake of the mass shooting Aug. 3 in El Paso that claimed at least 22 lives, days before the raids in Mississippi.

The Department of Homeland Security regards the El Paso shooting as an attack ""on our community"" at the U.S.-Mexican border and is working to address the threat of ""domestic terrorism,"" McAleenan told NBC News.

Asked whether authorities considered delaying the raids conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, McAleenan said, ""Something like this has been planned for over a year. This is a criminal investigation with 14 federal warrants issued by a judge, and ICE had to follow through on that. It was already planned and in motion.”

Only employees were arrested at the plants – not employers.

Officials said Thursday that 300 people arrested during the raids were released.

""We're in the middle of an ongoing investigation,"" McAleenan said. ""You get a warrant from a federal judge with probable cause. You then go gather evidence at the sites. And then you look at the appropriate charges in concert with the Department of Justice and U.S. attorney to see how you proceed.""

Congressional Democrats said they are looking into events that led up to the raids in Mississippi.

In a letter to Matthew Albence, acting director of ICE, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., lamented that the raids stranded children of the workers who were arrested.

""At a time when this country is grieving due to two domestic terrorist shootings, your agency has instead seemingly deliberately disregarded its own long-standing guidelines and carried out another form of family separation,"" Thompson said.

After the attack in El Paso, another mass shooting that weekend in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine people.

""The blatant lack of planning and resulting chaos calls into question the true motivation behind these worksite enforcement operations,"" Thompson said.

Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, defended the operation on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""We still have to apply consequences, meaning enforce the rule of law, for those individuals that are here illegally against immigration law,"" he said.

"State Department hiring freeze undermined safety and gutted morale, report finds",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/12/politics/state-oig-report-hiring-freeze/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department's 16-month-long hiring freeze had broad and negative impacts on the agency, including its ability to ensure the safety and wellbeing of personnel domestically and abroad, according to a report from the department's watchdog.

According to the Office of Inspector General's report released Friday, 96% of embassies and consulates and 95% of domestic bureaus and offices who responded to OIG's surveys said the hiring freeze ""had a somewhat negative or very negative effect on overall operations."" Some 97% of embassies and consulates and 100% of bureaus and offices told OIG that the freeze negatively impacted employee morale and welfare.

President Donald Trump instituted the hiring freeze upon taking office in January 2017. The Office of Management and Budget lifted the freeze in mid-April of that year, but the State Department continued the freeze for another 13 months under the tenure of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mike Pompeo resumed hiring in May 2018, after becoming secretary of state.

The OIG report, which was ordered by Congress and based on responses from 38 bureaus and offices and 151 overseas posts, found that ""several bureaus charged with protecting security, health, and life safety reported to OIG that the hiring freeze had significant detrimental effects on their operations.""

The Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), for example, reported a number of adverse repercussions as a result of the freeze. Among those were the inability to staff its command center -- which ""operates 24 hours a day to monitor and report information regarding threats against US diplomatic missions, the Secretary, and American citizens abroad"" -- at the recommended levels.

Under the Trump administration, the Justice Department reportedly wants the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to back them up in their stance that it would not be a violation of law for businesses to discriminate against transgender employees, sources told Bloomberg Law.

The Obama administration previously held that the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which states that employers can't discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, also applies to LGBTQ persons. The EEOC currently follows that Obama-era rule. The Trump administration DOJ holds that Congress did not have the LGBTQ community in mind when passing the 1964 law.

The case, involving Aimee Stephens, a transgender funeral worker from Michigan who was fired from her job after announcing her transition, will appear before the Supreme Court on October 8.

The Justice Department has until Friday to outline their reasons for the reversal before the case appears before the Supreme Court.

Though the EEOC initially sued on behalf of Stephens, the Justice Department is now handling the case and urging the EEOC to change its stance on the case, Bloomberg Law reported.

Representatives for the Justice Department and the EEOC did not immediately respond to emails from INSIDER for comment.

Members of the five-person commission — which has two current vacancies and a 2-1 Republican majority — have previously expressed their thoughts on the matter, according to Bloomberg Law. Commissioners Victoria Lipnic, a Republican, and Charlotte Burrows, a Democrat, have said ""they believe that LGBT discrimination is a form of sex bias already banned by federal law,"" Bloomberg Law wrote."
EPA-funded research finds pollution made worse by climate change can accelerate lung disease,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-ozone-smog-cigarettes-lung-disease-climate-change-435540cd595d/,"Air pollution, especially one type that is worsening with global warming, can accelerate lung disease as quickly as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, new research released Tuesday shows.

The study published on August 13 in the journal JAMA by researchers at the University of Washington, Columbia University, and the University at Buffalo, doubles down on the link between air pollutants and lung disease. It also emphasizes the connection between the lung ailment emphysema and pollution from ground-level ozone, the main ingredient in smog (not to be confused with the ozone layer).

Air pollutants have long been associated with both cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Chronic lower respiratory disease is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, and the third leading cause worldwide.

But Tuesday’s study, funded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), showed an increase in emphysema after exposure to pollutants like PM2.5 — fine particulate matter already linked to a staggering number of deaths — as well as black carbon.

Most notable was the impact of ozone. While other air pollutants are largely decreasing nationwide, ozone is increasing — with severe public health ramifications.

For years, scientists have linked worsening ozone pollution to climate change. Smog is created when pollutants react with each other in sunlight; warmer temperatures can cause air to stagnate, forcing people to breathe in the pollution. So, as ozone becomes more prevalent with climate change, its impact on lungs will become more widespread.

The 18-year study tracked more than 7,000 people of various ethnicities and races between 2000 and 2018 across six major metropolitan areas. Researchers found that if an individual’s exposure to ozone pollution increased slightly (by 3 parts per billion) that was “significantly associated” with an increased risk of emphysema over a decade — the equivalent of smoking one pack of cigarettes every day for 29 years.

The World Health Organization recommends people not exceed exposure to ozone levels of 60 ppb over eight hours, and no more than 20 days in one year. The EPA’s 1971 recommendations put that level at 80 ppb.

The urban areas included in the study are Chicago, Illinois; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Baltimore, Maryland; Los Angeles, California; St. Paul, Minnesota; and New York, New York. The new study also found that ozone is increasing in these cities, a trend scientists attribute to climate change. Annual ozone averages in the places studied were between 10 and 25 ppb.

“These findings matter since ground-level ozone levels are rising, and the amount of emphysema on CT scans predicts hospitalization from and deaths due to chronic lung disease,” said Dr. R. Graham Barr, a Columbia University professor and a senior author of the paper.

While the EPA funded the study, the researchers’ findings are at odds with the government’s policies. President Donald Trump’s administration is weakening clean air regulations and seeking to relax air quality rules imposed on coal-fired power plants, for example, in addition to targeting vehicle emissions standards in states like California. Data shows that those standards have helped improve air quality.

Trump and other top-level officials have also taken a skeptical stance on climate science, downplaying and questioning the threat of global warming. The study in JAMA highlights that both weakening air quality rules and ignoring climate change could have real long-term health consequences.

In a statement, co-author Dr. R. Graham Barr cautioned that worsening ozone pollution could have dire health implications as the world warms.

“As temperatures rise with climate change, ground-level ozone will continue to increase unless steps are taken to reduce this pollutant,” Barr said. “But it’s not clear what level of the air pollutants, if any, is safe for human health.”"
