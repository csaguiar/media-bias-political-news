"Why November 4, 2020 could be a very bad day",https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/politics/trump-2020-election-fraud/index.html,"(CNN) Since almost the moment Donald Trump won the White House in 2016, people have had November 3, 2020 -- aka Election Day -- circled on their calendars.

For Trump haters, that first Tuesday in November next year is the moment when they can put an end to what they believe is a colossal mistake. For Trump backers, Election Day 2020 is their chance to prove that 2016 was no fluke -- and that they want another four years of the billionaire businessman in the White House.

But what if the vote on November 3, 2020 doesn't actually settle anything?

There's been polling evidence for some time that Americans are losing faith in the ability of Americans elections to be conducted fair and squarely.

In an NPR/Marist University poll conducted just before the 2018 midterm elections, almost half -- 47% -- of respondents said that they lacked faith that all votes cast would be counted fairly. That number was even higher among non-white voters -- of whom almost 6 in 10 said it was likely not all votes would be counted. Two in 5 voters said they did not believe American elections were fair in that same poll."

It's been eight months since President Donald Trump's first secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, handed in his resignation.

Now the retired four-star general has written his first book, co-authored by former Marine Bing West. Spoiler alert: Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead is not, as the title might suggest, a tell-all exposé of Mattis' tense tenure at the helm of the Pentagon with Trump as commander in chief.

""I'm old fashioned,"" Mattis writes. ""I don't write about sitting presidents.""

Mattis mentions Trump by name only four times, all in the prologue's first two pages — each instance taking place prior to the president's taking office. That said, he does imply criticism, without directly taking shots.

""All Americans need to recognize that our democracy is an experiment and one that can be reversed,"" Mattis writes. ""We all know that we are better than our current politics.""

Mattis' maddening refusal to offer direct thoughts about Trump does not apply to past commanders in chief. His war stories — from liberating Kuwait to invading Afghanistan to battling insurgents in Iraq — are also a refighting of old battles with officers and others whose wartime guidance he portrays as deferring more to presidential whims than to theater-of-war realities.

Enjoying his perch as a visiting scholar at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Mattis never expected Trump to offer him the Pentagon's top job. ""I figured that my strong support of NATO and my dismissal of the use of torture on prisoners would have the President-elect looking for another candidate,"" he writes. But when Trump, who had never met Mattis before interviewing him for the job, called him ""the real deal"" and asked that he join his Cabinet, the self-described political independent agreed on the spot. ""In my view, when the President asks you to do something, you don't play Hamlet on the wall, wringing your hands.""

Trump may have believed he was hiring a latter-day Gen. George C. Patton, a made-for-TV war hero the president-elect would repeatedly refer to as ""Mad Dog."" (That moniker, which Mattis abhors, goes unmentioned in his book.) Instead, what Trump got was the seasoned, well-read and thoughtful warrior-scholar who penned this memoir, the only Cabinet member who failed to laud his boss in front of TV cameras at the president's first full staff meeting.

""I did as well as I could for as long as I could,"" Mattis writes. He left about halfway into what he expected to be a four-year tenure. ""When my concrete solutions and strategic advice, especially keeping faith with allies, no longer resonated, it was time to resign, despite the limitless joy I felt serving alongside our troops in defense of our Constitution.""

Mattis informs us this book has been in the works since he previously parted ways with his former commander in chief, Barack Obama. In that episode, he was fired in late 2012 as head of the U.S. Central Command.

Call Sign Chaos is ostensibly part of the well-trodden genre of leaders keen to share their insights on what it takes to lead. ""My purpose in writing this book, is to convey the lessons I learned for those who might benefit, whether in the military or in civilian life,"" Mattis writes.

And the book, indeed, is chockablock with insights and aphorisms about what it takes to be a good leader. It begins with a death-scraping tumble down a steep, icy ridge in Mattis' home state of Washington when he was 20. Alone and badly battered, he refused a stranger's offer for a lift home, opting instead to camp by himself for a couple of days and nurse his wounds. That fall, and his proud insistence on recovering alone, would be, as he writes, ""a metaphor for my subsequent career in the Marines: You make mistakes, or life knocks you down; either way, you get up and get on with it. You deal with life. You don't whine about it.""

Or perhaps you write about it. Chapter by chapter, Mattis takes us through a steady rise through the ranks of the U.S. Marine Corps, an ascent he self-deprecatingly finds inexplicable. ""Every time I made a mistake — and I made many,"" he writes, ""the Marines promoted me."" Mattis tells us very little about his personal life. There is nary a word, for example, about this lifelong bachelor's broken engagement to a woman who could not countenance a life of constant relocations with a man dedicated to an often lethal job. He does disclose that as a ""mediocre student with a partying attitude"" at Central Washington State College in 1968, he served time in a local jail on weekends as punishment for underage drinking. There he met another inmate:

""One Saturday night he saw me hoisting myself up to look out the barred window, eager to see what I was missing outside. "" 'What do you see, Jimmy?' he said, lying back on his bunk. "" 'A muddy parking lot.' "" 'From down here, I see stars in the night sky,' he said. 'It's your choice. You can look at stars or mud.' ""He was in jail, but his spirit wasn't.""

""You don't always control your circumstances,"" Mattis concludes about his jailhouse epiphany, ""but you can always control your response."" His book is a compendium of circumstances often beyond his control. What makes it a compelling read is how this warrior-monk dealt with and learned from the jams he found himself in. His call sign, CHAOS, irreverently bestowed by a more junior Marine officer, is an acronym: Does the ""Colonel Have Another Outstanding Solution?""

The 1991 Gulf War was Mattis' first battlefield experience. It would become his touchstone for how a winning war should be waged. As ""the least astute battalion commander in the Marine Corps,"" Mattis trained his charges — ""my young wolves"" — for battle in the desert of Southern California and the peaks of the Sierra Nevada farther north. ""Each week,"" he writes, ""the blade got sharper. ... My intent was to rehearse until we could improvise on the battlefield like a jazzman in New Orleans."" Relocated to the Saudi desert, Mattis would walk the lines after dark, chatting with his charges and learning their state of mind. ""Troops will tell you things when they're on guard duty at night.""

Despite leading his troops into an ambush at one point after three days with almost no rest, Mattis took part in a clear victory: The U.S. chased the Iraqi army out of Kuwait during 100 hours of ground combat. ""In my military judgment,"" he writes, ""President George H.W. Bush knew how to end a war on our own terms. ... He approved of deploying overwhelming forces to compel the enemy's withdrawal or swiftly end the war."" And, in a clear dig at Bush's successors, Mattis added that Bush ""avoided sophomoric decisions like imposing a ceiling on the number of troops or setting a date when we would have to stop fighting or leave.""

A decade later, Mattis was itching to avenge the Sept. 11 attacks, but landlocked Afghanistan was not a place where the Marines — a maritime expeditionary force — could be expected to make a forced entry by sea. Still, he convinced his superiors that he could fly 4,000 Marines through 400 miles of Pakistani airspace separating Afghanistan and the Arabian Sea to a remote airstrip near Kandahar. ""It never entered my mind that we might fail,"" Mattis writes. ""Marines don't know how to spell the word. ... Our lads were ready for the brawl.""

But Mattis' forced entry into Afghanistan soon had him clashing with Gen. Tommy Franks, the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan. He writes bitterly of being told by Franks to hold his troops back from going after Osama bin Laden in the al-Qaida leader's mountain hideout of Tora Bora. Rather than blaming President George W. Bush for not sending in the Marines, Mattis faulted himself for failing to ""build understanding up the chain of command"" of how his forces might have prevented bin Laden's escape.

Mattis' thoughts on Bush's decision to go to war with Iraq a year later were another matter. ""Invading Iraq stunned me,"" Mattis writes. ""Why were we fighting them again?"" Toppling the Iraqi army, which Mattis compares to ""a tall, dead tree,"" was the easy part. Left unclear, he writes, was what would happen after that. ""I had no specific policy guidance.""

The chafing by Mattis against his superiors is sharpest in his account of trying to seize Fallujah after four Americans were hanged and burned there by Sunni insurgents. With his forces poised outside the city for street-to-street combat, Mattis received the order to desist. Bush had decided to have American commanders work with local leaders to create an all-Iraqi security force for Fallujah. ""I believe the President's goal was idealistic and tragically mistaken,"" Mattis writes, ""based on misguided assessments that appeared impervious to my reporting.""

Much of the general's pushback is over restrictive rules of engagement that made little sense to him. ""There are some jerks in the world that need to be shot,"" he says he told his ""lads"" patrolling Anbar province. ""Be polite, be professional — but have a plan to kill everyone you meet.""

The book reprises other unbridled comments by Mattis. ""You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil,"" he recalls telling an audience of sailors, Marines and civilian contractors in San Diego in 2003. ""You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them. Actually, it's quite fun to fight them. It's a hell of a hoot. It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up there with you. I like brawling.""

The remark was widely reported and criticized. ""Frankly, I was surprised and found their comments bizarre,"" Mattis writes of his critics. ""I never moderated my words or apologized. Knowing our enemies also read my words, I wanted them to know that America had troops who were not tormented about fighting people who murder in the name of religion or deny human rights to others.""

Mattis was investigated in 2004 by a U.S. military team for possible murder charges after he ordered an airstrike on what he says was an al-Qaida team that had crossed from Syria into Iraq. His team's account of killing 26 insurgents had been contradicted by the Guardian, which published a report alleging ""that women and children had been the ones killed, because the gathering was actually a wedding party."" The official investigation concluded the airstrike Mattis ordered had in fact hit a war camp, and he was not charged. ""But by then it was too late,"" he laments. ""The initial false reports had become ground truth; correcting it was not considered news. We had once again lost the battle of the narrative.""

No administration catches more flak in this book than that headed by Obama. In a chapter titled ""Snatching Defeat from the Jaws of Victory,"" Mattis describes a losing battle as head of the U.S. Central Command (appointed by Obama in 2010) to keep a contingent of 18,000 troops in Iraq. ""Beginning with President Bush and continuing through the Obama administration, the White House was set on a total troop withdrawal, for political reasons,"" he writes. ""The National Security staff put no stock in our forecast that if we pulled out, the enemy would resurrect.""

A visit to Iraq by Vice President Joe Biden in the summer of 2010 gets mixed reviews from Mattis. He quotes a teasing question Biden put to him there. ""Know why you're at CENTCOM?"" Biden asks him. ""Because no one else was dumb enough to take the job.""

Mattis writes he found Biden ""an admirable and amiable man"" and liked him. But the vice president was not to be swayed. ""He didn't want to hear more; he wanted our forces out of Iraq. Whatever path led there fastest, he favored,"" Mattis writes. ""He exuded the confidence of a man whose mind was made up, perhaps even indifferent to considering the consequences were he judging the situation incorrectly.""

When Obama announced in 2011 that U.S. troops were being withdrawn from Iraq, his assertion that ""we're leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq"" rankled his military commander for the region. ""The words 'sovereign, stable and self-reliant' had never been used by the Pentagon or the State Department,"" Mattis writes, ""and I had never seen them in any intelligence report."" Rhetoric, he concludes acidly, ""doesn't end conflicts.""

Obama's efforts to end the U.S. fighting in Afghanistan fare no better in Mattis' account. He notes that while Obama had ""however reluctantly"" sent an additional 30,000 U.S. forces there in 2010, the president had also promised those troops would begin to come home after 18 months. ""My thought was that 'exiting' a war was a by-product of winning that war,"" Mattis writes. ""Unless you want to lose, you don't tell an enemy when you are done fighting, and you don't set an exit unrelated to the situation on the ground.""

Things went downhill from there. At a 2011 meeting with then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's Defense Policy Board, former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger asks Mattis what the larger strategy is behind the Pentagon's force deployments. ""I don't know what our integrated strategy is,"" Mattis recalls responding, ""or specifically what it is for my region."" That earned him a chewing out from a ""high-ranking DOD official."" Mattis says he ignored the scolding. ""It had become too clear that I was supposed to sit quietly in the back of the bus as it careened off a strategic cliff.""

Mattis also clashed with the Obama administration over its insistence on wanting ""human rights to be the singular criterion for our foreign policy,"" a stance that put Washington at odds with nations Mattis considered key allies, among them Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. ""The Arab monarchies and strongman leaders were not reforming at the pace our human rights idealists insisted upon,"" Mattis writes. ""But those nations that had stood by us after 9/11 had records far better than those of hostile, oppressive regimes like Iran and Syria.""

It was Mattis' enduring enmity toward Iran that abruptly ended his tenure as CENTCOM commander. He criticizes the Obama administration's failure to respond more forcefully to a 2011 failed plot to bomb a Georgetown restaurant where Saudi Arabia's ambassador would be dining. While Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, publicly pointed at Iran's Quds force as being behind the plot, ""we treated an act of war as a law enforcement violation,"" Mattis fumes, ""jailing the low-level courier.""

Late in 2012, Mattis writes, ""I received an unauthorized phone call telling me in an hour, the Pentagon would be announcing my relief."" He did not go gladly. ""I was leaving a region aflame and in disarray,"" he writes. ""The lack of an integrated regional strategy has left us adrift, and our friends confused.""

We will possibly have to wait for another administration before learning Mattis' thoughts about his 23 months as Trump's defense secretary. But he lets some of those views slip toward the end of his book. ""Nations with allies thrive, and those without wither,"" he writes. ""A polemicist's role is not sufficient for a leader; strategic acumen must incorporate a fundamental respect for other nations that have stood with us as trouble loomed.""

A parting shot? Perhaps. Mattis clearly has another book to write that many will be eager to read."

Follow Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-demands-apology-from-nbc-news-over-false-and-defamatory-and-extremely-damaging-unverified-report,"President Trump's legal team sent a harshly worded letter to NBC Wednesday demanding an apology and retraction for “false and defamatory, and extremely damaging” comments made by liberal MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell, who ran with a singled-sourced, unverified report that Trump had loans co-signed by Russian oligarchs.

The letter obtained by Fox News was sent by Trump’s legal counsel to NBC Universal executives.

“We write concerning the false and defamatory statements published by Lawrence O’Donnell and NBC Universal,” the letter said.

“Demand is hereby made that Mr. O’Donnell and NBCU immediately and prominently retract, correct and apologize for the aforementioned false and defamatory statements.”

CNN'S BRIAN STELTER WIDELY RIDICULED AFTER BLAMING TECH ISSUES FOR BIZARRE ANTI-TRUMP SEGMENT

The letter, written by Charles J. Harder, asked for NBC to confirm in 24 hours: “O’Donnell and NBCU will immediately and prominently retract, correct and apologize for the aforementioned false and defamatory statements.”

“Failure to do so will leave my clients with no alternative but to consider their legal options which could include immediate legal proceedings against Mr. O’Donnell and NBCU,” Hader added.

NBC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The incident occurred on Tuesday night when O’Donnell and fellow far-left MSNBC host Rachel Maddow were discussing how Trump was “able to obtain loans when no one else would loan him any money” when he tossed out the unverified speculation.

“I may have some information, in this next hour, which would add a great deal to their understanding of that, if true, and I’ll be discussing it here,” O’Donnell said. ""I stress ‘if true,’ because this is a single source who has told me that Deutsche Bank obtained tax returns… this single source close to Deutsche Bank has told me that Donald Trump’s loan documents there show that he has co-signers. That’s how he was able to obtain those loans and that the co-signers are Russian oligarchs.""

A stunned Maddow leaned back in her chair and responded, “What? Really?”

O’Donnell added “that would explain every kind word Donald Trump has ever said about Russia and Vladimir Putin” if his information is accurate.

“These statements are false and defamatory, and extremely damaging. The only borrowers under these loans are Trump entities, and Mr. Trump is the only guarantor. Numerous documents for each of these loans are also recorded, publicly available and searchable online. Thus, actual malice can easily be proven based on your reckless disregard of the truth and unreasonable reliance on an alleged ‘source’ who you will not even identify in your story and likely is seeking to mislead you and the public for political reasons or other ulterior motives,” the letter said in response to O’Donnell’s report.

“You are officially on notice of this dispute and are required to undertake steps to affirmatively preserve, and not delete, any and all physical and electronic documents, materials, information, and data,” the letter said.

The letter concludes by stating that if NBC fails to retract the story and apologize, Trump will “pursue all available causes of action and seek all available damages and other legal remedies to the maximum extent permitted by law.”

The fiery letter came after White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham blasted O’Donnell on Wednesday over the story.

“This is one of the reasons that a majority of Americans have lost trust in the media. Instead of applying ethics and standards to their reporting, journalists and left-wing outlets have weaponized the media, using it to attack and harass people with little to no regard for the truth,” Grisham told Fox News.

Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson also slammed MSNBC for the reckless report.

“Even if tempered with an 'if true' caution, there still needs to be a solid basis for believing it is true. Otherwise, pure speculation and wishful thinking takes the place of news reporting,"" Jacobson told Fox News.

MSNBC’s primetime hosts have a long history of running with unverified claims regarding Trump and Russia. “The Rachel Maddow Show” has plummeted to fifth overall among cable news programs after she dedicated substantial airtime since Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016 to speculating about whether or not Trump colluded with Russia.

Viewers began turning away when Maddow’s collusion theory was discredited by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report and testimony. Ex-MSNBC host Krystal Ball even blasted her former colleague earlier this year for floating wild “Russian conspiracy theories” that blew up when Mueller didn’t substantiate them.

“Rachel Maddow, you’ve got some explaining to do,” Ball said on The Hill’s “Rising.”

Ball noted that MSNBC and Maddow “built segment after segment, show after show, on building anticipation for a big reveal” that never arrived.

NBC News did not immediately respond when asked if O’Donnell’s report met its standards.

Trump’s Unprecedented Fight to Withhold Information,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Kerry W. Kircher', 'Former House General Counsel']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/house-needs-its-subpoena-power-against-trump/596857/,"Under these circumstances, the House has to keep fighting, including by suing civilly to enforce its committees’ subpoenas. During the period that I served in the Office of General Counsel, only two House-subpoena cases ended up in court: Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers (during George W. Bush’s presidency) and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder (during Barack Obama’s presidency). I worked on both. These cases provide some guidance on how the current suits will likely unfold, at least at the lower-court level.

In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi was speaker, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to testify about, and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten to produce records relating to, the White House’s firing of an unusual number of U.S. attorneys. The Bush White House directed Miers not to appear and Bolten not to provide records, claiming that senior White House aides were absolutely immune from congressional subpoenas (the same claim the Trump White House now makes with respect to McGahn). Ultimately, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued to compel compliance.

U.S. District Judge John Bates, a Bush appointee, ruled in 2008 in the Miers case that senior White House aides are not immune from congressional subpoenas, that Miers had to appear before the committee but could raise privilege objections in response to specific questions, and that Bolten had to either produce the documents subpoenaed or provide to the committee a log of the documents as to which he claimed privilege. Bates also indicated that if further disputes ensued regarding specific privilege objections, he would help resolve them. Miers and Bolten appealed. But shortly thereafter, President Obama was sworn in, and the parties settled: The Judiciary Committee took Miers’s testimony and Bolten produced some, although not all, of the subpoenaed documents.

In 2011, when John Boehner was speaker, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform subpoenaed Attorney General Eric Holder for documents that concerned “Fast and Furious,” an undercover Justice Department law-enforcement operation that went awry and resulted in the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. After months of back-and-forth and the production of a small number of documents to the committee, Holder claimed that the remaining documents were protected by a common-law privilege little understood outside legal circles, known as the deliberative-process privilege. As before, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued, this time to compel compliance with certain specific aspects of its document subpoena.

In 2013, U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson, an Obama appointee, ruled that the House had standing to sue. On the merits, however, the case dragged on for several more years—because of the volume of documents at issue, because Jackson allowed the Justice Department to assert new privileges as the case proceeded, and because she concluded that the deliberative-process privilege had some constitutional roots. Ultimately, the committee obtained many, although not all, of the documents it had sought."

The Federal Reserve’s Job Isn’t to Help Trump — or to Hurt Him,https://www.barrons.com,['Randall W. Forsyth'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/donald-trump-federal-reserve-trade-war-51566950641,"Text size

The policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to promote maximum employment and stable prices. That is what Congress has mandated, period.

This bears repeating, because the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York thinks it’s actually the job of the central bank to oppose Executive Branch policies with which it takes issue.

In a Bloomberg opinion piece, Bill Dudley argues the Fed should not “enable” the policies of President Donald Trump, which will he says will produce an “economic disaster.”

Leave aside the arguments over policy for a moment. Consider instead the Constitutional question of an unelected agency of government officials working to thwart the policies of elected officials.

Like him or not, Trump was duly chosen by Electoral College as the 45th President of the United States. As such, he is empowered to carry out the functions and duties as the head of the Executive Branch, as articulated by the U.S. Constitution, subject to the checks and balances provided by the Legislative and Judicial branches.

The Fed, meanwhile, is run by unelected officials, some of whom are nominated by the executive and confirmed by the legislative branch. Others are selected solely by private citizens answerable to no one else.

The Fed is a creation of Congress, which can change its structure, aims, or operating procedures. And similar to Supreme Court justices, members of the Fed’s Board of Governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Fed governors serve 14-year terms, while the chair has a four-year term (coincident with his or her term as governor.) The 12 Fed district bank presidents are chosen by the banks’ own board of directors, with no legislative oversight.

Monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, comprising the seven Fed governors, with the Fed Board Chair also chairing the FOMC, plus five of the 12 Fed district chairs. The Fed presidents rotate every year, except for the New York Fed president, which is a permanent member, in recognition of New York’s status as the nation’s—and arguably the world’s—financial capital. The New York Fed president also is the FOMC vice chair, further cementing the post as first among equals.

Leave aside the anachronistic structure of the Fed, cobbled together over a century ago. Defenders say it is designed to provide independence for the central bank. Critics argue it makes it unaccountable, resulting in campaigns to “audit the Fed” and its decision making, which the central bank has adamantly opposed.

That’s not to say the Fed has avoided being drawn into the political realm, sometimes legitimately, more often not.

During World War II, the entire aim of the U.S. government was to support the war effort. That included the Fed, by facilitating the financing of the wartime deficit by pegging bond yields. By the early 1950s, that mandate to cap interest rates caused inflation. That led to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which freed the central bank to raise rates as needed to control inflation.

The need to raise interest rates produced other conflicts between the Fed and other branches of government, most notably during the 1960s, when spending on the Vietnam War and the Great Society stirred inflation. President Lyndon B. Johnson literally manhandled then-Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin for hiking rates then.

Richard Nixon, who blamed his loss in 1960 in part on a sluggish economy resulting from tight Fed policy, installed the malleable Arthur Burns as his Fed Chairman after his 1968 presidential victory. Burns dutifully pursued stimulative policies to help ensure Nixon’s reelection, which provided the inflationary tinder for the explosion in oil prices, and the subsequent steep recession of 1973-74.

In more recent years, Alan Greenspan famously made certain to get along with both Republican and Democratic administrations (although George H.W. Bush blamed him for his reelection loss in 1992.) His successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, fared less well: The former didn’t get a third term under Barack Obama, while the latter wasn’t reappointed to a second term.

Jerome Powell got the nod from Trump, who nonetheless has stepped up his criticism of the central bank to unprecedented levels. Trump blasted the Fed for raising rates last year and its reluctance to lower them this year. While the central bank trimmed its federal funds target range one-quarter percentage point, the president has called for a cut of a full percentage point. That’s despite the Fed having achieved its aforementioned policy mandates, with unemployment at 3.7%, a half-century low, and inflation running a few tenths shy of its 2% target.

Fears of recession mainly stem from a global slowdown in manufacturing, which arguably stems mainly from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. In his speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy confab last week, Powell acknowledged the impact of trade. “While monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,” he said. But, he added, “we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” opening the way for another rate cut in September.

Dudley, by contrast, suggests the Fed opt not to do that. “Officials could state explicitly that the central bank won’t bail out an administration that keeps making bad choices on trade policy, making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions,” he wrote.

Even more radically, Dudley contends that Trump’s attacks on the Fed puts the presidential election within the central bank’s purview.

“After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,” he writes. “If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”

This is shocking, coming from a person who used to be one of the top three monetary-policy officials in the U.S. Dudley, moreover, came to the New York Fed from Goldman Sachs, where he was their chief Fed watcher, so he was no neophyte when it comes to the intersection of policy and markets. That also made him just one of the many former Goldman types to ascent to high government posts, such as Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary during the financial crisis.

An independent central bank means one able to meet its clearly defined policy goals—not to pursue its own agenda to thwart policies of other branches of government.

That would be tantamount to a coup d’etat.

"Facing farmer anger, Trump scrambles Cabinet to brainstorm on biofuel policy: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/facing-farmer-anger-trump-scrambles-cabinet-to-brainstorm-on-biofuel-policy-sources-idUSKCN1VC1RN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.

Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry. However, his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting on for re-election in 2020.

Trump met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They presented options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

One proposal that was discussed and was advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was rescinding seven or eight of the 31 waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals, but Trump was yet to make a final decision.

The sticking point is a technical proposal to redistribute projected volumes that could be exempted in the future through the annual biofuel mandate from 2020 onwards. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.

David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels.

“As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers won’t be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story,” Fialkov said.

The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible; and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The final one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump’s EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and billionaire Carl Icahn.

U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to a slump in crop prices and exports shrinking following Trump’s trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about the refinery waivers.

‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.

Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.

On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in the fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed.

“Enough is enough,” Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. “We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions.”

Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.

On Thursday, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.

Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market."

By Felix Onuah

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari swore members of his cabinet into office on Wednesday, assigning a new minister of state for petroleum in Africa's top producer of crude oil.

Buhari kept the petroleum portfolio for himself, as in his first term, and appointed Timipre Silva as the junior minister, who is widely expected to manage the portfolio on a day-to-day basis.

Silva, a former governor of Bayelsa state in the southern Niger Delta oil production heartlands, replaces former ExxonMobil executive Emmanuel Kachikwu who was the country's main representative at OPEC meetings.

Nigeria, which has Africa's biggest economy, remains heavily reliant on crude oil sales despite efforts by Buhari to boost non-oil revenues since he first took office in 2015. Oil receipts account for about 90% of foreign exchange and low oil prices helped to push the country into recession in 2016.

The move to assign portfolios comes six months after Buhari won a presidential election and nearly three months after his second term began. The time taken to appoint ministers caused jitters amongst investors and threatened growth prospects.

Zainab Ahmed, who became finance minister in September last year after her predecessor resigned, retained the position with additional responsibilities for the budget and national planning.

The cabinet of 43 ministers faces a long list of challenges including tepid growth following Nigeria's emergence from recession in 2017, high unemployment and galloping inflation that has hit the poorest people in a nation of 190 million people, most of whom live on less than $2 a day.

And security forces have been stretched as they try to tackle Islamists waging a decade-long insurgency in the northeast, banditry in the northwest and clashes between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities over dwindling arable land in central states.

""The core objectives of this administration are to improve security, achieve diversified, inclusive economic growth and fight corruption,"" Buhari told his cabinet at the swearing in ceremony.

The ministry of power, housing and works - created to address challenges related to the country's ailing electricity and transport infrastructure when Buhari first took office in 2015 - was broken up.

Babatunde Fashola, a former governor of commercial hub Lagos state who headed that super ministry in the first term, was named minister for housing and works.

Sale Mamman, a businessman and former ministry of works official, was given the power portfolio. His task will be to tackle a poor electricity supply that holds back everything from manufacturing to education, while addressing spiraling debts that have crippled the power sector and held back investment.

""We have seen an exodus of the more capable and technocratic ministers and in their place there are politically connected replacements,"" said Malte Liewerscheidt, vice president at Teneo Intelligence.

He said some of the new entrants were stalwarts in Buhari's ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party, who appear to have been rewarded for helping him to win February's election, while others were part of a bid to solidify the party's base in some parts of the country ahead of elections in 2023.

""There are no real surprises here. The potential for positive change is rather limited,"" said Liewerscheidt.

"After blacklisting, U.S. receives 130-plus license requests to sell to Huawei: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Alexandra Alper', 'Min Read']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-usa/after-blacklisting-u-s-receives-130-plus-license-requests-to-sell-to-huawei-sources-idUSKCN1VH2K0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell U.S. goods to China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, three sources said, nearly two months after President Donald Trump said some sales would be allowed.

FILE PHOTO: A Huawei company logo is pictured at the Shenzhen International Airport in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China July 22, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song

But the Trump administration has not yet granted any licenses for sales to the blacklisted company, said the people familiar with the process who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity.

The standstill coincides with mixed messages from Trump in the U.S.-China trade war, which have dimmed hopes for prompt decisions on license applications to sell to Huawei, the world’s top producer of telecoms equipment.

That has raised the specter of billions of dollars of lost sales for chipmakers, software companies and others in Huawei’s U.S. supply chain.

“Nobody in the executive branch knows what (Trump) wants and they’re all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,” said William Reinsch, a former Commerce department official.

Last week, Trump vowed to raise tariffs on $550 billion in Chinese imports, hours after China imposed new levies on $75 billion in U.S. goods. Then he softened his tone toward China at the G7 leaders’ meeting over the weekend, saying he thought the world’s two largest economies would reach a deal to end the tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hammered growth.

The current number of license applications, not previously reported, far exceeds the 50 or so that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross disclosed receiving in July.

A spokesman for the Commerce Department said: “The interagency process, weighing license requests concerning Huawei and its non-U.S. affiliates, is currently ongoing.”

Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has called for the United States to remove the company from the so-called entity list and put an end to what it called “unjust treatment.”

Huawei, the world’s no. 2 smartphone maker, was placed on the list because of U.S. national security concerns in May, when trade talks with China broke down. Sales of U.S. goods are mostly banned to companies on the list, unless suppliers obtain special licenses, which must overcome tough scrutiny.

The United States says the company can spy on customers and has sought to convince allies to exclude it from 5G networks. Huawei denies the allegations.

PROMISE

Seeking to lure China back to the negotiating table in late June, Trump promised President Xi Jinping that U.S. companies would be allowed to make some sales to Huawei, a gesture welcomed by U.S. chipmakers and software companies. Huawei spent $11 billion on U.S. components from U.S. firms such as Intel Corp, Qualcomm and Micron Technology last year.

Government officials urged U.S. companies to apply for licenses following Trump’s pledge of relief, saying exports to Huawei of non-sensitive items that are readily replaced by foreign competitors would be permitted. Ross and Trump in July promised timely responses.

One of the sources noted that the review process was not delayed, pointing to the complexities of interagency consultation.

But the only relief seen by Huawei thus far was the extension in August of the temporary general license, which gives U.S. companies a small exception to repair and maintain Huawei’s existing handsets and networks.

China expert Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute said a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks could spur license approvals for Huawei as soon as next month.

The two trade teams are due to meet in September in Washington, but no specific dates have been disclosed.

According to three Commerce department officials, many of the licenses requests have been reviewed by other agencies such as the Departments of State and Defense.

However, no standards have yet been set and no responses have been issued as officials await a green light from Ross and the White House, according to three people familiar with the process.

The United States has a case pending against Huawei over allegations Huawei violated U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou has been detained in Vancouver since December on U.S. bank fraud charges for misleading banks about the company’s Iran business. Trump has at times asserted that Huawei and Meng could be included in a grand U.S.-China trade deal."
Can Trump force U.S. companies out of China?,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Rachel Layne'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-force-u-s-companies-out-of-china-not-technically-but-he-can-make-it-very-hard-to-stay/,"The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 would give President Trump discretion to impose restrictions on U.S. companies doing business in China if he declared an emergency.

The law was first used in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on the Iranian government during the Iran hostage crisis.



Although Congress could intervene to block Mr. Trump from declaring an emergency, it would be unlikely to do so given the ongoing partisan conflict in Washington, D.C.

President Donald Trump startled investors last week when he took to Twitter and ""hereby ordered"" U.S. companies to stop doing business in China as the countries continue to clash over trade. So is he within his rights?

The answer, experts say, is probably so. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a more than 40-year-old law Mr. Trump later cited in another tweet, gives the executive branch broad powers that, if invoked, could make it difficult for U.S. companies to operate in China.

Passed by Congress in 1977, IEEPA authorizes the president — after a national emergency is declared — to ""investigate, regulate or prohibit"" a range of activities by U.S. companies engaged in global commerce. Those include foreign exchange transactions, banking payments or transfers, and the import or export of foreign currency and securities. The law was first used in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on the Iranian government during the Iran hostage crisis.

IEEPA is ""an extraordinarily broad and open-ended delegation from Congress to the president,"" Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and Hoover Institute fellow, said in a tweet. As of earlier this year, U.S. presidents had invoked the act more than 50 times since its initial passage, according to the Congressional Research Service.

CBS News poll: U.S. consumers concerned about China tariffs

More recently, Mr. Trump in May invoked IEEPA in placing restrictions on U.S. companies doing business with Chinese technology company Huawei. He also threatened to use it to impose tariffs on Mexico tied to immigration. The difference now is that Mr. Trump is threatening to use IEEPA, which is typically used for sanctions, as a cudgel in his administration's trade war with China.

Mr. Trump's threat to block U.S. companies from doing business in China ""would face no effective legal barrier,"" Height Securities analyst Clayton Allen said in a research note. The White House could also expect backing from the courts, which have tended to uphold even broad exercises of power under IEEPA, Goldsmith said in another tweet.

The White House has since walked back Mr. Trump's order that U.S. companies cut ties with China amid protest from the business community. But he could still brandish IEEPA down the road if the conflict continues to deteriorate.

""So in theory that law exists, but that's not what the president said. He is asking American companies to take a look, take a fresh look at frankly moving out of China, go in someplace else,"" Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, told Margaret Brennan Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

Trump gets ready to ""double down"" on trade war with China

So what's to stop Mr. Trump from using IEEPA to push U.S. companies around in an unending series of national emergencies? In a word, Congress, which is constitutionally mandated to regulate commerce with foreign countries and which could vote to end a national emergency.

The problem there is that Congress would likely need a two-thirds majority to end a national emergency, according to the Congressional Research Service. Partisan conflict in Washington would make that a tall task, giving Mr. Trump more room to exercise his power under IEEPA."

Italy inches toward new govt as Trump backs Conte's return as PM,https://www.reuters.com,"['Gavin Jones', 'Min Read']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-5star/italys-5-star-opposition-clash-over-potential-cabinet-roles-idUSKCN1VH0QT,"ROME (Reuters) - The two parties trying to form a new Italian government made progress toward a coalition deal on Tuesday, cheering financial markets as well as U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he hoped Giuseppe Conte would be reinstated as prime minister.

The role of Conte has been a sticking point in the negotiations between the 5-Star Movement, a member of the outgoing coalition, and the opposition Democratic Party (PD), which has been resisting his reappointment.

“Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Conte,” Trump said on Twitter. “A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister.”

After setbacks early on Tuesday the roller-coaster talks between the anti-establishment 5-Star and the center-left PD appeared to be back on track later in the day, with upbeat comments from both sides prompting a strong market rally.

Italian 10-year bond yields fell to three-year lows, and the spread between German Bunds narrowed to below 182 basis points, the tightest since May 2018.

Tensions persist and surprises are possible, however.

Late on Tuesday, a PD source said talks were still at risk of failure over the post of deputy prime minister, saying 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio was insisting on retaining that role in a new coalition despite strong opposition to this from the PD.

Even if a deal were struck, it would need to survive an online vote of 5-Star party members, the party said in a blog post. Many of its rank and file are hostile to the PD and have used social media to urge Di Maio against doing a deal.

Investors, though, are betting that Italy will avoid snap elections, fearing they would be won by Matteo Salvini’s hard-right League party, which would put Rome on a collision course with the European Union over expansionary government spending.

“Our work is continuing in a fruitful way,” the PD’s Senate leader Andrea Marcucci told reporters in brief comments after an evening meeting with 5-Star officials.

Deputy PD leader Paola De Micheli said the two sides had “analyzed points for the basis of a common program”, while 5-Star’s Senate chief Stefano Patuanelli reported a “good climate” and said contacts would continue on Wednesday.

The parties are due to report back to President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday from 1400 GMT. If no deal has been sealed he will name a caretaker government and call elections.

Conte, who belongs to no party but is close to 5-Star, resigned last week after League chief Salvini declared his 14-month coalition with 5-Star was dead, seeking to trigger elections and capitalize on his surging popularity.

The move has not gone to plan, as 5-Star and the PD seek to form a coalition of their own, pushing the League into opposition.

FIGHT OVER JOBS

Earlier on Tuesday the PD/5-Star talks seemed to have run into trouble, with the two sides fighting over key jobs as well as being at loggerheads over Conte’s role.

The PD accused 5-Star of undermining the formation of a new cabinet by demanding the interior ministry for Di Maio. 5-Star denied this, and the parties canceled a scheduled meeting.

The PD says Di Maio is insisting on keeping the role of deputy prime minister that he held in the outgoing government, something it considers unacceptable if Conte is to stay on as premier.

It remains to be seen if the exchanges are merely tactics to secure the upper hand in negotiations over cabinet jobs, or whether they have the potential to scupper an accord between the two parties which have always been bitter adversaries.

The picture is complicated by deep internal divisions in both parties, each one split between leadership factions that want a deal and others that would prefer to risk an election.

Slideshow (6 Images)

Di Maio was absent at the start of an evening meeting of all the 5-Star lawmakers. The great majority favors an accord with the PD rather than a snap election which would probably see many lose their seats less than 18 months into this parliament.

Meanwhile Salvini continues to demand elections, and is likely to be disappointed by Trump’s endorsement of Conte, especially as the populist League chief has always expressed his admiration for the U.S. president.

Opinion polls suggest the League has lost 3-7 percentage points since collapsing the government, though it remains easily the most popular party, followed by the PD and 5-Star."
David Koch’s spirit is alive and well in the White House cabinet,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1694132/david-kochs-spirit-lives-on-in-the-white-house-cabinet/,"David Koch was no friend of US president Donald Trump. The businessman and conservative icon, who died today at age 79, made little secret of his dislike of the president or his policies—his tariffs, the travel ban, and almost everything else about him.

So they surrounded him with their allies instead.

The sons of Koch Industries founder Fred Koch, David Koch and his brother Charles were born into extraordinary wealth. For decades, they used their billions to wield political influence, supporting a sprawling network of conservative nonprofits closely aligned with their mission—right-wing libertarianism. The crux of this, as Charles Koch once put it, was a desire for “economic freedom”—with as little power in the hands of centralized government as possible. In short, he wrote, “big governments are inherently inefficient and harmful.”

The brothers favor minimal government “intrusions,” encompassing conservative economic policies such as minimal taxation and free trade, as well as more liberal, anti-interventionist social policies. Many of their main areas of concern have closely aligned with Koch Industries’ business interests, ushering in candidates who deny climate change, were likely to promote fossil fuel use, and support environmental deregulation.

They did this through organizations like Americans for Prosperity, which supported the establishment of the Tea Party movement, while concealing the identities of other, more media-shy, conservative donors.

When it came to Trump, who rose to political power on the heels of the Tea Party movement, their enthusiasm was much more muted. But while they may not like Trump’s style, and have publicly refused to donate directly to Trump’s campaign, the brothers’ influence is apparent in the president’s choice of advisors, including official counselor Kellyanne Conway. The president’s cabinet remains a who’s-who of Koch affiliates. Their nearly $900 million budget for the 2016 election seems to have had the desired effect.

Koch may be dead, but many of his preferred political figures—and, by extension, his preferred policies—continue to thrive in the highest positions of power. Here’s how.

Vice President Mike Pence

During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-trusted Trump advisor and the high-powered arch-conservative Steve Bannon expressed concerns that a potential Pence president would be “a president that the Kochs would own.” This pretty much sums up the long-held loyal relationship between Pence and the Kochs, which dates back to his time as an Indiana congressman in the early 2000s. Though a channel for the their influence in the White House, Pence differs from David Koch in his anti-choice evangelical position.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry

The Koch brothers are above all petrochemical magnates, so there is arguably no cabinet position more important than energy secretary. Perry, who once studied animal husbandry and has in the past actually recommended abolishing the energy department, might not be the most qualified for the job. But he is an important representative of the Koch’s interests at the country’s most important table. A climate change denier, Perry has been pushing for more fossil fuel and has called attempts to replace them with renewables “immoral.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

Formerly nicknamed the “congressman from Koch,” Pompeo is a member of the Wichita, Kansas, business community—the Kochs’ home base. He made the jump into politics thanks almost entirely to the Kochs’ support. He has, in fact, received more money from the brothers than any other single individual. Pompeo has shown his gratitude toward his donors by favoring environmental deregulation on energy production, and by defending his benefactors in the public arena, including an op-ed unsubtly titled “Stop Harassing the Koch Brothers.”

Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross

The billionaire investor was a close personal friend of David Koch’s. He was photographed with the late financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein at a dinner party at his home in 2010. (Koch was among Epstein’s personal friends.) Ross and his wife later attended Koch’s 2016 holiday party.

Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao

Chao is the wife of Senate leader Mitch McConnell, and a regular guest at Koch donor events. As secretary of labor under US president George W. Bush, Chao spoke at the 2002 annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Koch Industries is a longtime member of ALEC’s corporate board. She was also a fellow of the Heritage Foundation, a think-tank closely tied to the Koch brothers’ political ambitions.

Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos

Trump appointed the billionaire and charter school advocate as education secretary in 2017. Her family has close ties to the Koch brothers’ political fundraising, donating millions in 2016 to super-PACs, including the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Action Fund. Devos is a regular attendee at the Kochs’ biannual donor meeting, and is a financial backer of Koch-affiliated groups such as Americans for Prosperity, and the George Mason University-based Mercatus Institute. In October 2018, the education secretary met privately with members of the Koch-funded group Youth Entrepreneurs at a Koch Industries office in Wichita, Kansas."

President Donald Trump on Monday ordered cabinet members to alleviate anger from corn farmers over his administration's decision to exempt some refiners from US biofuel laws, Reuters reported.

The administration granted exemptions to 31 small refineries on August 9, allowing them to use less ethanol when mixing gasoline.

President Donald Trump ordered cabinet members Monday to alleviate discontent in Farm Belt states over his administration's decision to give 31 small refineries exemptions from US biofuel laws, according to Reuters.

The exemptions, granted on August 9, allow the refiners to use a smaller amount of ethanol when mixing their gasoline. Trump's administration has handed out a record number of such exemptions. Refiners are required to blend biofuels such as ethanol into their gasoline or help fund peers that do so.

Ethanol producers and corn harvesters lobbied to cut the number of exemptions, according to Reuters.

Iowa is the US' largest producer of corn and ethanol, and the state swung to Trump in 2016 after voting for President Barack Obama twice.

""At a time when ethanol plants in the Heartland are being mothballed and jobs are being lost, it is unfathomable and utterly reprehensible that the Trump administration would dole out more unwarranted waivers to prosperous petroleum refiners,"" Renewable Fuels Association CEO Geoff Cooper said in a statement following the decision.

Trump held a two-hour cabinet meeting during which the matter was discussed on Monday, two sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.

Corn prices were down about 1.3% as of 2:40 p.m. ET Tuesday, at $3.60 per bushel. Corn closed as much as 12% lower after the administration's August 9 announcement.

Mauricio Macri calls Urgent Cabinet Meeting amid Monetary Instability

Buenos Aires, Aug 28 (Prensa Latina) In the midst of another hard day for the Argentine economy, in which the US dollar again rose to reach 58 pesos for each greenback, President Mauricio Macri called an urgent cabinet meeting.

According to local media, Macri met with his cabinet at the Casa Rosada to evaluate the situation and take other measures to cushion the financial blow of the falling Argentine peso since last year.



The Argentine cabinet meeting was attended by the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, Marcos Peña, Buenos Aires Governor María Eugenia Vidal, the new Minister of the Treasury, Hernán Lacunza, and the President of the Central Bank, Guido Sandleris.



On Tuesday, the US dollar rose again generating greater market volatility. The so-called 'country risk' also increased to over 2,000 points, while Argentine shares on the New York Stock Exchange collapsed once again.



According to several media, in the meeting Macri envisaged drawing up an 'institutional response' to the impact on financial markets.

Because of the Facebook like, Pitt's motion states, Shepherd's court ""has demonstrated an inability to set aside politics to preserve the integrity of the judiciary. For that reason, it must disqualify itself from further presiding over this action.""

Shepherd declined to comment on the motion Tuesday.

Beshear called it ""yet another absurd attack by an out-of-control governor.""

""Matt Bevin and his labor secretary have recently announced their 'findings' that over 1,000 Kentucky teachers broke the law. Now Bevin is trying to prevent the courts from giving those same teachers due process. Matt Bevin needs to stop attacking teachers, judges and his own lieutenant governor,” Beshear said in a statement.

Bevin has publicly criticized Shepherd on numerous occasions during his first term, referring to him as a ""partisan hack.""

This motion is also not the first time the Bevin administration has sought to discredit Shepherd over a Facebook post.

In September 2018, Bevin posted a video criticizing Shepherd for clicking that he was ""interested"" in a Facebook event in Frankfort that involved a protest against legislators who voted for a pension bill that was supported by the governor.

A motion by the Bevin administration to the Kentucky Supreme Court in the lawsuit challenging that pension bill also made a reference to that Facebook event in its footnotes.

Shepherd told the Courier Journal at the time that his response was not an endorsement of the event or an indication that he would attend, as he lived two blocks away from the event and only wanted information about how to avoid the crowd.

The Federal Reserve’s Job Isn’t to Help Trump — or to Hurt Him,https://www.barrons.com,['Randall W. Forsyth'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/donald-trump-federal-reserve-trade-war-51566950641?refsec=up-and-down-wall-street,"Text size

The policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to promote maximum employment and stable prices. That is what Congress has mandated, period.

This bears repeating, because the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York thinks it’s actually the job of the central bank to oppose Executive Branch policies with which it takes issue.

In a Bloomberg opinion piece, Bill Dudley argues the Fed should not “enable” the policies of President Donald Trump, which will he says will produce an “economic disaster.”

Leave aside the arguments over policy for a moment. Consider instead the Constitutional question of an unelected agency of government officials working to thwart the policies of elected officials.

Like him or not, Trump was duly chosen by Electoral College as the 45th President of the United States. As such, he is empowered to carry out the functions and duties as the head of the Executive Branch, as articulated by the U.S. Constitution, subject to the checks and balances provided by the Legislative and Judicial branches.

The Fed, meanwhile, is run by unelected officials, some of whom are nominated by the executive and confirmed by the legislative branch. Others are selected solely by private citizens answerable to no one else.

The Fed is a creation of Congress, which can change its structure, aims, or operating procedures. And similar to Supreme Court justices, members of the Fed’s Board of Governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Fed governors serve 14-year terms, while the chair has a four-year term (coincident with his or her term as governor.) The 12 Fed district bank presidents are chosen by the banks’ own board of directors, with no legislative oversight.

Monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, comprising the seven Fed governors, with the Fed Board Chair also chairing the FOMC, plus five of the 12 Fed district chairs. The Fed presidents rotate every year, except for the New York Fed president, which is a permanent member, in recognition of New York’s status as the nation’s—and arguably the world’s—financial capital. The New York Fed president also is the FOMC vice chair, further cementing the post as first among equals.

Leave aside the anachronistic structure of the Fed, cobbled together over a century ago. Defenders say it is designed to provide independence for the central bank. Critics argue it makes it unaccountable, resulting in campaigns to “audit the Fed” and its decision making, which the central bank has adamantly opposed.

That’s not to say the Fed has avoided being drawn into the political realm, sometimes legitimately, more often not.

During World War II, the entire aim of the U.S. government was to support the war effort. That included the Fed, by facilitating the financing of the wartime deficit by pegging bond yields. By the early 1950s, that mandate to cap interest rates caused inflation. That led to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which freed the central bank to raise rates as needed to control inflation.

The need to raise interest rates produced other conflicts between the Fed and other branches of government, most notably during the 1960s, when spending on the Vietnam War and the Great Society stirred inflation. President Lyndon B. Johnson literally manhandled then-Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin for hiking rates then.

Richard Nixon, who blamed his loss in 1960 in part on a sluggish economy resulting from tight Fed policy, installed the malleable Arthur Burns as his Fed Chairman after his 1968 presidential victory. Burns dutifully pursued stimulative policies to help ensure Nixon’s reelection, which provided the inflationary tinder for the explosion in oil prices, and the subsequent steep recession of 1973-74.

In more recent years, Alan Greenspan famously made certain to get along with both Republican and Democratic administrations (although George H.W. Bush blamed him for his reelection loss in 1992.) His successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, fared less well: The former didn’t get a third term under Barack Obama, while the latter wasn’t reappointed to a second term.

Jerome Powell got the nod from Trump, who nonetheless has stepped up his criticism of the central bank to unprecedented levels. Trump blasted the Fed for raising rates last year and its reluctance to lower them this year. While the central bank trimmed its federal funds target range one-quarter percentage point, the president has called for a cut of a full percentage point. That’s despite the Fed having achieved its aforementioned policy mandates, with unemployment at 3.7%, a half-century low, and inflation running a few tenths shy of its 2% target.

Fears of recession mainly stem from a global slowdown in manufacturing, which arguably stems mainly from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. In his speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy confab last week, Powell acknowledged the impact of trade. “While monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,” he said. But, he added, “we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” opening the way for another rate cut in September.

Dudley, by contrast, suggests the Fed opt not to do that. “Officials could state explicitly that the central bank won’t bail out an administration that keeps making bad choices on trade policy, making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions,” he wrote.

Even more radically, Dudley contends that Trump’s attacks on the Fed puts the presidential election within the central bank’s purview.

“After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,” he writes. “If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”

This is shocking, coming from a person who used to be one of the top three monetary-policy officials in the U.S. Dudley, moreover, came to the New York Fed from Goldman Sachs, where he was their chief Fed watcher, so he was no neophyte when it comes to the intersection of policy and markets. That also made him just one of the many former Goldman types to ascent to high government posts, such as Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary during the financial crisis.

An independent central bank means one able to meet its clearly defined policy goals—not to pursue its own agenda to thwart policies of other branches of government.

That would be tantamount to a coup d’etat.

Report: U.K. Seeks Suspension of Parliament Before Brexit,https://time.com,['Stuart Biggs'],,,,https://time.com/5663167/uk-brexit-queen-prorogue-parliament/,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is preparing to ask Queen Elizabeth II to prorogue or suspend the U.K. Parliament from September until mid-October, the BBC reported, a move that could hamper lawmakers’ efforts to block a no-deal Brexit and even trigger a constitutional crisis.

The pound fell as much as 0.7%.

Under the plan, all business would be suspended from about Sept. 11 until a Queen’s speech on Oct. 14 kicks off a new session of Parliament, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg said on Twitter. Downing Street called it business as usual for a new government, she said, with the “useful political side effect” of denying time to MPs trying to stop Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31.

The prime minister’s office had no immediate comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Parliament is due to return from summer recess on Sept. 3.

Members of Parliament who oppose a no-deal Brexit have feared Johnson would attempt to stop them meeting, and won’t take it lying down. Some have talked of simply continuing to meet in another building, and defying the government. Parliament has also passed measures aimed at forcing the government to let it meet.

“This is an unconstitutional and undemocratic outrage not seen in recent British history,’’ Labour MP Stephen Doughty said on Twitter. “Pulls HM the Queen into major political crisis. Did Cabinet know or approve? How can a tiny meeting of just three be allowed to shut down our democracy? This will not stand.’’

The BBC also reported the Cabinet would hold a conference call on Wednesday morning.

Venezuela’s Guaidó names shadow cabinet to help oust Maduro,https://wtop.com,"['News Traffic Weather', 'The Associated Press']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://wtop.com/latin-america/2019/08/venezuelas-guaido-names-a-shadow-cabinet-to-oust-maduro/,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó named a new shadow cabinet on Wednesday, launching the latest phase…

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó named a new shadow cabinet on Wednesday, launching the latest phase of his campaign aimed at forcing President Nicolás Maduro from power.

The new team — including heavyweight opposition figures Leopoldo López and Julio Borges — will be dedicated to preparing for a transitional government and new elections, said Guaidó, who claimed presidential powers in late January as head of the National Assembly, saying Maduro’s election last year was a fraud.

Guaidó has since gained support from more than 50 nations, named several foreign ambassadors to represent him abroad and appointed a board to oversee U.S.-based Citgo refineries, Venezuela’s most valuable foreign asset.

But the opposition leader has yet to wrest power from Maduro after seven months of trying.

Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, a geopolitical risk analyst who teaches at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said Guaidó’s so-called interim government functions more tangibly outside of Venezuela than at home.

“The shadow cabinet is relevant, however, in terms of shoring up domestic belief that the transition continues — despite its painfully drawn-out timeline,” Lansberg-Rodriguez said. “Any movement signals advancement to a certain extent.”

Guaidó said he’s calling on his political mentor López to serve as general coordinator, though López has lived in the Spanish ambassador’s home in Caracas for protection since launching a failed military uprising with Guaidó on April 30.

Opposition lawmaker Borges, who lives in exile in Colombia, will oversee Guaidó’s foreign relations, and other members of his team will deal with economic development, asset recovery and human rights.

For his part, Maduro rejects Guaidó as a puppet of the U.S. government, which he says is bent on exploiting Venezuela’s vast oil wealth. Despite the South American country’s deepening crisis, the socialist leader remains in office with support from the Venezuelan military and nations including Cuba, Russia, China and Turkey.

The National Wildlife Federation and Sustainable Furnishings Council ranked the country's 90 leading retailers on their wood sourcing practices, compiling the data into an online scorecard. With the annual scorecard, the Federation aims to encourage furniture retailers, big or small, to implement robust policies that drive responsible wood sourcing practices through their complex supply chains.

Top retailers included Cisco Home, ABC Carpet and Home, Ikea, and Williams-Sonoma.

""One thing to remember is that 65% of furniture in North America comes through independent retailers, not the chains,” the National Wildlife Federation's Barbara Bramble. “So that's why we've made the list of companies we score a wide variety.""

Responsible wood sourcing is good for business, says the Federation. According to a poll by the Sustainable Furnishings Council, more than 80 percent of consumers surveyed said they are interested in buying furniture made from wood harvested from well-managed forests. Bramble said since the scorecard was developed last year, many companies already have made improvements.

""The scores, even the top category for several companies, went up this year. And, a number of companies who were in the very low-scoring basket have raised their scores as well,” she said. “So, I think this scorecard is catching their attention.""

"Italian opposition PD, 5-Star say they want to form coalition led by Conte",https://www.reuters.com,"['Giselda Vagnoni', 'Min Read']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics/italy-inches-closer-to-new-cabinet-as-deadline-approaches-idUSKCN1VI0MC?il=0,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s 5-Star Movement and the opposition Democratic Party (PD) said on Wednesday they would try to form a coalition, setting aside years of hostility to avert a snap election and ease economic uncertainty.

Following days of often tense and difficult talks, the leaders of 5-Star and the PD told Italy’s president that the new government should once again be led by the outgoing prime minister Giuseppe Conte.

The two sides still need to agree on a shared policy platform and team of ministers, but 5-Star chief Luigi Di Maio and his PD counterpart Nicola Zingaretti said they had pledged to find common ground for the good of the country.

“We love Italy and we consider it worthwhile to try this experience,” Zingaretti told reporters. Speaking shortly afterwards, Di Maio said: “We made commitments to the Italians...and come what may we want to fulfill them.”

President Sergio Mattarella summoned Conte for talks on Thursday at 9.30 a.m. (0730 GMT), and was widely expected to hand him a fresh mandate.

(graphic: here)

The previous coalition made up of 5-Star and the far-right League collapsed this month when League leader Matteo Salvini withdrew from the alliance hoping to trigger an early election and cash in on his surging popularity.

But his move backfired when Conte refused to resign immediately, giving 5-Star and the PD time to try to overcome their fierce mutual animosity and agree to a government that had previously appeared impossible.

“The only thing that unites them is their hatred of the League,” Salvini said bitterly after meeting President Sergio Mattarella in an effort to convince him to call elections.

“Millions of Italians are being held hostage by a hundred parliamentarians who are looking to cling onto their posts.”

The prospect of a new administration led by Conte, an academic who is considered close to the 5-Star, has buoyed markets, which are betting that Italy will get a fiscally prudent government that will avoid confrontation with Europe.

The League is highly euroskeptic and had promised swingeing tax cuts for 2020 that economists warned could put unsustainable pressure on Italy’s towering debt mountain.

Italy’s 10-year bond yield fell to a record low below 1%, two-year bond yields fell to their lowest since May 2018 at -0.22% IT2YT=RR and Italy’s 50-year bond yield fell to a record low around 2.266% IT50YT=RR.

HURDLES AHEAD

However, a coalition pact is not yet a done deal. The tentative accord could still unravel with 5-Star and the PD yet to agree on other top government posts, besides the prime minister’s position, or reveal a common policy platform.

Unexpectedly, the founder of the 5-Star Beppe Grillo issued a statement late on Wednesday saying the ministers should be technocrats and not elected politicians — a suggestion that is unlikely to gain traction with the PD.

In an added complication, 5-Star has said it will put any deal with the PD to an online vote of its members. Many 5-Star supporters have taken to social media to denounce a pact with the center-left and a ‘yes’ vote cannot be taken for granted.

As negotiations went down to the wire, one of the posts still in play was that of deputy prime minister. The PD wants this job for one of its own, now that it has agreed to Conte staying on as prime minister.

“The problem is that if there is a premier from the 5-Star it is fair that his deputy is from the PD,” PD deputy leader Andrea Orlando said on Twitter.

Conte, a virtually unknown lawyer when he was chosen by the League and 5-Star to lead their new government last year, was seen as a voice of reason within the outgoing coalition and has good relations with Mattarella.

An opinion poll in daily Corriere della Sera on Wednesday showed Salvini’s approval rating had plunged by 15 points since he pulled the plug on the government, and is now 16 points behind Conte’s."

AP National Security Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is warning of bitter political divisions that threaten American society, echoing themes he often cited before he resigned from the Trump administration in protest.

The retired Marine general, who quit in December 2018 amid policy disagreements with President Donald Trump, says he is concerned about the state of American politics and the administration's treatment of allies.

""We all know that we're better than our current politics,"" Mattis wrote in an essay adapted from his new book and published Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal. ""Unlike in the past, where we were unified and drew in allies, currently our own commons seems to be breaking apart.""

Mattis said the problem is made worse by this administration's disregard for the enduring value of allies, which he alluded to in the resignation letter he gave Trump on Dec. 20.

""Nations with allies thrive,"" he wrote in the Journal essay, ""and those without them wither. Alone, America cannot protect our people and our economy. At this time, we can see storm clouds gathering.""

In an apparent reference to Trump, Mattis added: ""A polemicist's role is not sufficient for a leader. A leader must display strategic acumen that incorporates respect for those nations that have stood with us when trouble loomed.""

Mattis is breaking months of public silence as he promotes his new book, ""Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead,"" which is scheduled to be published Sept. 3. Next week, he is to discuss the book in an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

Without citing Trump by name, Mattis suggested the administration and its strongest critics are engaged in destructive politics. He said he worries more about internal divisions in American society than about external threats.

""We are dividing into hostile tribes cheering against each other, fueled by emotion and a mutual disdain that jeopardizes our future, instead of rediscovering our common ground and finding solutions,"" he said.

He said Americans must realize that their democracy is an experiment.

""Tribalism must not be allowed to destroy our experiment,"" he wrote.

A longtime colleague, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked at a Pentagon news conference whether he agrees with Mattis that political tribalism in the U.S. is threatening democracy.

Dunford said he is careful to remain apolitical and would not make judgments about Trump. He said the military has managed to avoid politicization, despite a few lapses, during what he called ""a very politically turbulent period of time"" since Trump took office.

Regarding his reasons for leaving the Trump administration, Mattis offered a slightly more pointed explanation than he outlined in his resignation letter.

""When my concrete solutions and strategic advice, especially keeping faith with our allies, no longer resonated, it was time to resign, despite the limitless joy I felt serving alongside our troops in defense of our Constitution,"" he wrote.

Mattis, who had never met or spoken to Trump before the Republican president-elect interviewed him for the Pentagon job in November 2016, quickly became known as a leading voice of reason and stability in an administration led by an impulsive president unfamiliar with the tools of statecraft and dismissive of allies' interests.

Mattis resigned shortly after Trump announced he was pulling all U.S. troops from Syria. In Mattis' view this amounted to betraying the Syrian Kurdish fighters who'd partnered with American troops to combat the Islamic State group. Trump later backed away from his decision, allowing a portion of the U.S. force to remain in Syria in what the Pentagon sees as an effort to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group.

In his resignation letter, Mattis emphasized the value of allies and suggested that Trump had been irresolute and ambiguous in his approach to Russia and China.

Trump said after Mattis left Dec. 31 that the former Marine general had done a poor job managing the war in Afghanistan. He turned down Mattis' offer to stay at the Pentagon until February to ensure a smooth transition, instead telling Mattis to leave right away.

Thai PM Breached Constitution by Failing to Vow to Uphold It: Ombudsman,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-08-27/thai-pm-breached-constitution-by-failing-to-vow-to-uphold-it-ombudsman,"FILE PHOTO: Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha reacts while taking questions from journalists after the group photo session with new government cabinet in Bangkok, Thailand July 16, 2019. REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun/File Photo Reuters

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's prime minister and his cabinet breached the constitution by failing to recite the full oath of allegiance when they were sworn in before the king last month, the Office of the Ombudsman said on Tuesday.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and 35 cabinet ministers pledged their loyalty to King Maha Vajiralongkorn at a ceremony at a Bangkok palace on July 16 but omitted the last sentence, on upholding and complying with the constitution.

""The prime minister did not recite all the wordings as required by the constitution,"" Raksagecha Chaechai, secretary-general of the Office of the Ombudsman told reporters.

""Therefore, the swearing-in was incomplete,"" he said.

Raksagecha said the Constitutional Court would have to rule on what needed to be done because an incomplete oath could mean that all of the government's actions could be seen as unconstitutional.

Prayuth declined to comment when reporters asked him about the office's ruling.

Prayuth scrapped the previous constitution when he seized power from an elected government in a 2014 coup. He was army chief at the time.

The current constitution was drawn up at his behest. It gives the military a significant role in politics, to the disappointment of pro-democracy activists.

Despite their reservations about the constitution, activists say the failure of Prayuth and his cabinet to recite the line about upholding it could raise concern about prospects for constitutional rule.

On Aug. 8, Prayuth said he was taking full responsibility for the omission and apologized, while assuring the country that the government would function as normal. He did not specify how he would rectify the situation.

Television footage of the July 16 ceremony shows Prayuth reading from a sheet of paper as he and his cabinet swore their loyalty to the king and vowed to perform their duties for the benefit of the county and the people, but leaving out the last bit about the constitution.

Prayuth became prime minister with the backing of pro-military members of a new parliament, elected in a contested March general election.

Earlier on Tuesday, Prayuth and his cabinet received a written message from the king encouraging the government to perform its duty well and do what was right, a government spokeswoman said.

In his resignation letter, Mattis emphasized the value of allies and suggested that Trump had been irresolute and ambiguous in his approach to Russia and China.

Trump said after Mattis left Dec. 31 that the former Marine general had done a poor job managing the war in Afghanistan. He turned down Mattis' offer to stay at the Pentagon until February to ensure a smooth transition, instead telling Mattis to leave right away.

"US Fed should help defeat Donald Trump in 2020, says former New York Federal Reserve Bank president Bill Dudley",https://www.firstpost.com,[],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.firstpost.com/world/us-fed-should-help-defeat-donald-trump-in-2020-says-former-new-york-federal-reserve-bank-president-bill-dudley-7238101.html,"Washington: A former top US central banker leapt into the political fray on Tuesday, calling on the Federal Reserve to oppose President Donald Trump's re-election effort next year.

Bill Dudley, the influential former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, also said the Fed should not ""enable"" Trump's escalating trade war with China by lowering interest rates.

The stunning arguments in a Bloomberg opinion column flew in the face of efforts by current Fed officials to remain strictly neutral and above partisan politics, despite Trump's intense year-long campaign to demand easier monetary policy.

But Dudley said the outcome of the 2020 presidential elections was arguably ""within the Fed's purview"" because a second Trump term represented a threat to the global economy as well as to the Fed's political independence and policy mandates.

""If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020,"" he wrote.

Trump already blames the Fed, rather than trade policy, for the slowing economy and has demanded drastic cuts in interest rates in his relentless, nearly daily attacks.

Last week he called Fed Chairman Jerome Powell an ""enemy"" and on Tuesday tweeted that central bankers loved ""watching our manufacturers struggle"" to export to markets with easier monetary policy.

Powell, when asked, has consistently brushed off Trump's near-daily invective, saying Fed officials do not take politics into account when deciding on a policy.

A spokesman for the central bank maintained this position on Tuesday, saying the Fed's policy decisions were guided ""solely by its congressional mandate"" for stable prices and maximum employment.

""Political considerations play absolutely no role,"" the spokesman said in a statement.

Earlier this month, the Fed cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade even though unemployment remains at historic lows, amid growing concerns about the global economy.

And investors overwhelmingly expect the Fed to deliver at least a 25-basis-point rate cut next month as the economy slows and the US-China trade war drags into its second year.

But Dudley, who also served as the vice-chairman of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said in his op-ed that providing more stimulus could encourage Trump to escalate a ""disastrous"" trade war with China, which deteriorated sharply last week.

""The central bank's efforts to cushion the blow might not be merely ineffectual. They might actually make things worse,"" he wrote.

Instead, the Fed should clearly state that it will not cut rates in response to Trump's trade actions, sending a signal that he will own the risks created by his trade wars — ""including the risk of losing the next election,"" Dudley said.

Dudley retired from his post as New York Fed president last year and is currently a senior research scholar at Princeton University."

President Trump may think he’s keeping Chinese negotiators guessing with his whiplash-inducing remarks about the U.S.-China trade war.

But he’s not fooling anyone here.

More than a year into the deepening commercial conflict, Chinese officials and analysts say they’ve got a handle on the tweeter-in-chief and are no longer fazed by his unpredictable initiatives.

“There is a lot of fatigue with President Trump’s ‘art of the deal,’ ” said Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization and an adviser to China’s cabinet.

“It’s like a roller coaster. Buenos Aires, Osaka, Shanghai. He says one thing one day, then hits the world with a surprise the next day,” Wang said, referring to the sites of high-level, if ill-fated, negotiating sessions. “The more they deal with him, the more they figure him out.”

At the Group of Seven leaders’ summit in Biarritz, France, this weekend, Trump brushed aside complaints that his habit of swerving between tough talk and a salesman’s hype was damaging the global economy.

“Sorry! It’s the way I negotiate,” he told reporters Monday. “It’s done very well for me over the years. It’s doing very well for the country.”

It hasn’t, however, produced a deal that would commit China to make the structural changes in its state-led economy that the administration has been seeking for more than a year.

Trump has announced tariffs that by Dec. 15 will cover almost 97 percent of the Chinese merchandise that American companies import, according to economist Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

By depressing demand for Chinese goods, U.S. tariffs have cost 3 million Chinese factory workers their jobs, according to Trump, and put pressure on Chinese President Xi Jinping to make a deal.

Trump’s claim to have the upper hand at the negotiating table does not appear to have convinced the Chinese.

“They’ve decided Trump is a vacillating guy who can’t figure out what he wants and gets spooked every time the stock market goes down or someone accuses him of not being tough,” said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy in Beijing. “Although there are problems in China, they believe they have their economy under control, more so than Trump. They think he is more vulnerable to a slowdown and that they can afford to wait him out.”

[Trump retaliates in trade war by demanding companies cut ties with China ]

By early May, the two sides had completed 90 percent of a deal involving major Chinese purchases of American farm, industrial and energy products as well as enhanced protections for foreign companies’ technology and trade secrets, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this summer.

But the trade war between the world’s economic superpowers appears to have entered a dangerous new phase this month, with new rounds of retaliatory tariffs and a demand from Trump that U.S. companies stop doing business with China.

That has caused alarm across the globe, with fears that the war could help tip leading economies such as Japan and Germany into recession and create new head winds for the American economy. China’s growth rate has, meanwhile, slowed to its lowest rate in three decades.

Chinese officials were initially mystified by Trump’s unconventional style, and Xi is said to have faced criticism for underestimating Trump’s resolve to tackle China’s trading practices.

But emerging last week from this year’s Communist Party confab at the beach resort of Beidaihe, China’s leadership appears to have decided to hunker down.

“What’s the point of calling Xi Jinping ‘a good friend’ and ‘a great leader’ but still increasing tariffs?” asked Yao Xinchao, a trade professor at the University of International Business and Economics. “He’s a 70-ish-year-old man but speaks like a 7-year-old kid. We just can’t listen to what he says now. I think Chinese leaders have realized this, too.”

Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at the Renmin University, shares a similarly disdainful view. “He is a real estate developer; he is a profiteer in the eyes of the Chinese people,” he said.

[‘Protectionist bullying’: China denounces Trump administration’s latest tariff hikes ]

But the bottom line remains that China, which is experiencing a marked economic slowdown, wants a deal.

“The trade dispute between China and the U.S. should be resolved through dialogue and consultations,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday, adding that the United States’s “maximum-pressure approach hurts both sides and is not in the least constructive.”

“We hope that the U.S. can exercise restraint, return to reason, and demonstrate sincerity in order to facilitate further consultations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefits,” Geng said.

The question now is how the two sides find a way out of the standoff.

Wei Jianguo, a former vice minister of commerce, said Trump’s efforts to browbeat countries such as Canada, Mexico and Japan into making a deal will not work with China.

“We have seen and understand Trump’s style,” Wei said. “If he thinks he can secure an advantage for the U.S. and wear China down by exerting various kinds of extreme pressure, he’s dreaming. It’s impossible.”

[With the U.S.-China trade war escalating, Trump arrives at G-7 with a list of grievances ]

The longer this pattern continues, the more China becomes concerned that any deal won’t stick.

“Now China understands him thoroughly and knows that inconsistency is his nature,” said Wang, of Renmin University. “Even if an agreement is signed, he may not implement it well. But, without an agreement, he does this over and over again, which is also very annoying.”

Many analysts expect the dispute to continue to at least November, when the two leaders are likely to meet at a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Chile.

Xi, meanwhile, confronts domestic political challenges that likely reduce his willingness to make concessions under foreign pressure. The authorities in Beijing face a growing crisis in Hong Kong, where protests aimed at preserving the city’s special status continue, and are preoccupied by preparations to celebrate in early October the politically charged 70th anniversary of the Communist Party’s takeover of China.

Dana Milbank: Is Trump a president or a timeshare salesman?,https://www.sltrib.com,"['Dana Milbank', 'The Washington Post']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/08/27/dana-milbank-is-trump/,"Washington • The Amazon is burning, a trade war is escalating, and the world economy is deteriorating.

Enter President Trump, taking the stage on Monday at the Group of Seven gathering of world leaders in Biarritz, France, to assure an anxious world that … his golf resort in Miami is just tremendous!

“With Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings — we call them bungalows — they each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views,” Trump said at the closing news conference of the international gathering.

Trump, who had been asked to clarify his earlier (inappropriate) remarks promoting his Miami-area property at the international gathering, instead expanded on them: ""We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants. And we have many hundreds of acres so that in terms of parking, in terms of all of the things that you need, the ballrooms are among the biggest in Florida, and the best.""

""We."" With that pronoun, Trump spoke not as president of the United States but as de facto head of the Trump Organization. And he now endeavors to abuse his status as host of next year's G-7 summit to force foreign countries and U.S. taxpayers to pump millions more dollars into one of his properties.

Trump essentially requiring foreign governments to pay him is the very definition of unconstitutional emoluments. Is this a president or a timeshare salesman?

Trump is often criticized for representing only those who voted for him, but even that description seemed generous Monday. On French soil, Trump seemed to be representing only himself.

This isn't the first time Trump has been unable (or unwilling) to distinguish the national interest from his own. And his l'etat-c'est-moiroutine isn't just for the French. After meeting recently with mass-shooting victims, he rhapsodized about their ""love for me — and me, maybe, as a representative of the country — but for me.""

He has badgered the Federal Reserve chairman to reduce interest rates, which would benefit him as a huge borrower. The president has made untold millions from his tax cuts and from foreign governments booking rooms and meals at his properties.

Trump makes geopolitical decisions based on how he's treated personally. It's no mere coincidence that Japan, which nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize and gave him a fancy state visit, has escaped the worst of his trade wrath. By contrast, he canceled a visit to Denmark and claimed the prime minister had insulted the United States by labeling ""absurd"" his (absurd) plan to buy Greenland: ""You don't talk to the United States that way!""

Accordingly, Trump's peers at the G-7 were careful to stroke his ego with talk of his powerful traits, his lovely wife, his new grandchild. Even so, no one praised Trump as much as Trump.

Article continues below

On the environment: ""I think I know more about the environment than most people.""

On oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: ""I was able to get ANWR approved. Ronald Reagan wasn't able to do it.""

On trade: ""We never had a president that understood this."" Until now!

Asked about Russia rejoining the G-7, Trump found himself boasting: ""I ran one election and I won. Happened to be for president.""

Above all, he celebrated the greatness of Trump Organization holdings.

""I own great property in the U.K."" he said when asked about new Prime Minister Boris Johnson, adding, ""I own Turnberry and I own in Aberdeen and I own in Ireland, as you know, Doonbeg and great stuff.""

Great stuff! His travels to his properties in Ireland, Scotland, Virginia, New Jersey, Florida and elsewhere (on 255 days of his presidency, The Washington Post calculated in June) have funneled them a fortune in taxpayer dollars.

Now, it's Doral's turn. Seated earlier Monday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump gave a hard sell for the resort: ""Great place."" ""Tremendous acreage."" ""Next to the airport."" Nothing ""close to competing with it."" Later, he explained that ""my people"" looked at potential G-7 locations and — surprise! — ""they came back and said, 'This is where we'd like to be.'""

It would be a nice boost for the underperforming resort, yet Trump believes he is the one making a sacrifice. The presidency has cost him more than $3 billion, he lamented on Monday, from lost income from giving motivational speeches, for example.

""I don't care about making money,"" Trump claimed Monday. What's more, ""I'm not going to make any money"" from hosting the G-7 at Doral.

Of course not. And if you don't believe him, you can check his tax returns.

Re: “Former governor considers Senate run,” Aug. 14 news story

Former Gov. John Hickenlooper clearly is not going to be the Democratic presidential nominee to run against Donald Trump. Some are prompting him, as the most recognizable name, to run for the U.S. Senate against Cory Gardner despite seeming little in his experience or temperament that fits into a legislative position.

His best prospect for a job post-election, should Democrats succeed in ousting the sitting president, is a Cabinet position in the next administration — perhaps interior secretary (though environmentalists will disagree here). His best move politically would be to work hard for the eventual nominee and hope for the best.

What about us, Chase Bank?

Last week, Chase Bank announced it is forgiving all credit card debt for Canadian customers. Chase closed all Canadian credit card accounts in March 2018, so rather than collect the payments that are legitimately owed, Chase just decided to forgive all those loans.

Who will pay for this magnanimous act? We will, in the form of higher interest rates and higher fees. I think we should cut up our Chase credit cards and send them to Chase with a note stating that we want to be treated the same as our northern neighbors.

A price too high to pay?

Re: “Protections for endangered species weakened by order,” Aug. 13 news story

The Trump administration has again displayed its core values by announcing a revision of the successful Endangered Species Act, with a healthy nod to industry. “Economic costs” are now a key factor in determining whether or not a species receives protection, thus placing the almighty dollar in a judgmental position on the sanctity and diversity of life in an interdependent ecosystem.

This precarious situation of deciding “who stays and who goes” based on financial interests is bound to be a blind and disastrous bargain. But the Trump administration continues to scorn even the most basic of environmental science.

Dangerous decision on scooters

Re: “Death raises safety concerns,” Aug. 13 news story

I honestly can’t imagine what Denver’s “study” process was that resulted in continuing to allow hundreds of electric scooters to be operated in our city. I realize the recent death occurred after the review, but there were hundreds of injuries and, based on my observations, the fatality was inevitable.

I live downtown, and what I have never seen is a rider wearing a helmet — not one. I have seen some responsible, lawful riders. But what I have seen many times is scooting the wrong way on streets and bike lanes, zooming along sidewalks, slaloming around pedestrians, zipping across streets midblock, etc.

So Denver recommends a helmet, and the companies take a break from counting cash to say safety is good, and provide tutorials or offer a helmet? Thank you both for your caring and commitment to public safety.

"The executive branch's job is to enforce laws, not make them",https://thehill.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/457996-the-executive-branchs-job-is-to-enforce-laws-not-make-them,"The Trump administration unveiled two controversial sets of regulations last week. One narrows the eligibility criteria for legal immigrant status. The other eases protections for threatened and endangered species. Both policies face legal challenges.

People can legitimately debate whether these rules make sense as a matter of policy and politics. The environmental regulations arguably do more to protect big business than animal species, while the new immigration regulations make it even harder for migrants to remain in the United States legally.

As a personal matter, judges might like or dislike these outcomes. But as a professional matter, some judges believe that, under the Constitution, only Congress has the express power to make laws — not agencies that answer to the president. These judges tend to be ideologically conservative. Will that crowd join progressives to criticize the new regulations, albeit for different reasons?

ADVERTISEMENT

Not likely.

The argument against agency lawmaking was articulated most recently by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. He wrote the dissenting opinion in Gundy v. United States, a case involving lawmaking by the attorney general regarding the national sex offender registry. Gorsuch eloquently argued that lawmaking power belongs to Congress, and for good reason. Unlike career bureaucrats within the executive branch, Congress is democratically accountable to the people if they wind up making bad laws. Executive branch officials are supposed enforce the law, not create it. This is because — with the exception of the president — the people get no say in hiring and firing those in the executive branch.

To be sure, President Trump Donald John TrumpOur justice system must reward success Former Biden economic adviser: 'I really like a lot of' Warren's tax proposals Roy Moore calls for Omar to go back from 'whence she came' MORE campaigned on aggressive elimination of federal regulations — which is a longstanding GOP objective — and has held to this promise. Proponents of deregulation argue that the federal administrative bureaucracy is bloated and inefficient, and that regulation of free markets is bad for businesses and bad for the economy. Everyone does better if the markets are allowed to function unimpeded by bureaucrats who wind up blocking progress and innovation.

That’s a fine position to take, of course — so long as what is good for the goose is also good for the gander. The problem with the conservative argument against lawmaking by agencies is that it’s often — and conveniently — abandoned once an agency does something that conservatives like politically.

Department of Commerce v. New York involved lawmaking by the Department of Commerce regarding the contents of the U.S. Census form. The Constitution gives the power to implement the Census to Congress — not the president. Congress handed that power off to the secretary of Commerce in a statute called the Census Act. Although this is what Congress did in the statute challenged in Gundy — to Gorsuch’s chagrin — he said nary a peep about the hand-off of legislative power in the Census Act.

ADVERTISEMENT

Conservatives cannot have it both ways. Either delegation of lawmaking power by Congress to the executive branch is constitutionally acceptable or it is not.

One might argue that deregulation is taking regulations off the books, so it doesn’t involve lawmaking, and is less constitutionally objectionable. But that’s not what the Trump administration’s environmental and immigration regulations do. They make new laws.

Let’s start with the Endangered Species Act. It provides that “the Secretary shall by regulation . . . determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species.” That language is the “hand-off” of legislative power from Congress to the secretary of the Department of Commerce, whom today happens to be Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossHillicon Valley: Court delays ruling against Qualcomm | Google asks employees not to talk politics at work | Facebook releases early emails discussing Cambridge Analytica | Bannon to release anti-Huawei film Bannon to release anti-Huawei film 'Claws of the Red Dragon' Trump administration announces deal to avert tariffs on Mexican tomatoes MORE.

The statute then gives Ross a bunch of factors to use in deciding whether a species is endangered or threatened, including habitat destruction, overutilization of the species for commercial or other purposes, disease or predation, inadequate regulations or “other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.”

The agency’s regulations add new factors to this list, including the requirement that a threatened species must become endangered “within the foreseeable future.” For that determination, the agency must now consider factors like “threat-projection timeframes, and environmental variability.”

The immigration regulations are no less constitutionally objectionable. The Immigration and Nationality Act gives the secretary of Homeland Security the power to “establish . . . regulations” to implement the statute. (Again, that’s the “hand-off.”) The statute also states that “any alien who . . . is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible,” and provides a list of factors for use in deciding if someone is a “public charge,” including age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education and skills.

Once again, the agency’s new regulations add new factors to this list, defining “public charge” to also capture “any alien who receives one or more public benefits,” including federally-funded benefits such as housing assistance and Medicaid.

Handing off legislative power to agencies is not considered unconstitutional under current Supreme Court case law, and there are good reasons for tolerating the practice.

But if conservative judges are going to complain about them, they should do so across-the-board. The leaders of the agencies involved in these rulemakings were never on the ballot for the offices they hold. Voters who don’t like these laws cannot go to the polls and fire them. This is precisely why Gorsuch and other conservative judges have balked at lawmaking by agencies. It messes with the separation of powers.

The question for conservatives is this: If either of these laws were to reach the Supreme Court, would Gorsuch kvetch that this particular lawmaking by executive branch agencies is constitutionally objectionable? Or would he stay silent — as in the Census case — leaving us to wonder whether his constitutional purity is contingent on conservative ideology and politics?

Because if it’s the latter, then we might have politicians on the Supreme Court after all.

Let President Trump cancel spending that was never used,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Andy Biggs']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/27/rescinding-wasteful-unspent-appropriations/,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

It is said that there are two parties in Washington, D.C., that want to increase spending, Democrats and Republicans. It is imperative that, as we approach the end of the fiscal year, we consider tools to curb some of the ravenous appetite to spend money in D.C. — using the presidential prerogative to rescind some of our wasteful and subsequently unspent appropriations.

Rescission is a tool that was created by Congress in the 1970s and has been used by presidents of both parties over the decades. President Trump has indicated a desire to cancel spending that was never used, particularly in foreign aid accounts. Whenever he has done so, however, there have been howls from the big spenders in Congress and federal agencies.

While they will predict destruction of the country and our diplomatic relations, the reality is that most of what the president has considered in the past are ones that have previously been identified as being wasteful. How’s that for a novel concept? Actually eliminating programs that have been found to be a waste of taxpayers’ dollars.

I saw firsthand that the United Nations is one of the most-inept institutions on the world stage, yet the United States pays a hefty price as a member and host. While Congress and the federal bureaucracy are experts at wasting funds, we are pikers compared to the skill with which the U.N. blows money — without any accountability. The president has the right idea to eliminate funding of U.N. programs that don’t address critical U.S. needs.

The Executive Branch has some money that was authorized but has been sitting unused for more than two years. Some bureaucrats view these accounts as a potential place to satiate their desire to spend money (after all, there is little incentive to save the money). Rescission by the president will allow these funds to be returned to the U.S. Treasury.

When I first ran for Congress, our national debt was around $20 trillion. Today, it exceeds $22 trillion and is speeding toward $23 trillion. Both parties are to blame.

Revenue to the U.S. Treasury is growing at 3 percent per year but spending growth is around 7 percent. Our spending is in the trillions of dollars. We do not have a revenue problem; we have a gigantic spending problem.

The big spenders in Congress were not at all supportive of the president’s proposal, but he has the authority to claw back unused funds.

National security experts have repeatedly warned us that our biggest national security threat is not the Chinese, Russians or terrorists. They tell us it is our own national debt. As long as our spending rate surpasses our revenue, we will have a structural deficit. That results in a monumental national debt increase.

Even an aggressive proposal by the president will be a mere nudge in the right direction on spending. Regardless, I will support the president should he provide Congress with another rescission package to cut spending. It is the first step in the right direction of addressing our out-of-control spending problem. I hope it will lead to a strong push to bring our national debt under control.

Can Trump Actually Buy Greenland? The Short Answer Is No,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Nick Rigillo', 'Morten Buttler']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/can-trump-actually-buy-greenland-the-short-answer-is-no/2019/08/21/ec08c1d2-c3f4-11e9-8bf7-cde2d9e09055_story.html,"ILULISSAT, GREENLAND - AUGUST 04: In this view from an airplane icebergs float at the mouth of the Ilulissat Icefjord on August 04, 2019 near Ilulissat, Greenland.

U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed an interest in buying Greenland, the world’s biggest island and a self-ruling territory of Denmark. While the seriousness of his intentions is unclear -- and the response from the other side of the imagined transaction was a sturdy “no” -- the proposal raises questions as to whether such a transaction is even feasible.

1. Why would Trump want to buy Greenland?

A real estate baron before his turn to politics, Trump has a history of analyzing geopolitical issues through the lens of a property developer. During his 2018 meeting with Kim Jong Un, for example, Trump spoke of the potential he sees for beach hotels and condos in North Korea. Plus, as Trump surely knows, other U.S. presidents have made their mark in history for such grand ideas.

2. Why is Greenland interesting for the U.S.?

Besides being bigger than Mexico and Saudi Arabia, Greenland has abundant resources and a strategic location near the warming Arctic. Located in the northern Atlantic Ocean between Europe and America, the island has long been a nexus of tensions among the U.S., Russia, Canada, Denmark and Norway. It’s already home to a strategic U.S. air base and radar station. In 1968, a B-52 bomber carrying nuclear weapons crashed near the Thule base in northwestern Greenland, causing radioactive contamination. More recently, Denmark stopped China from gaining a foothold on its territory by agreeing to co-fund the construction of two new airports.

3. Is the idea totally outlandish?

Until a century ago, these kinds of transactions were not unusual: The U.S. bought the territory of Louisiana from France for $15 million in 1803, and Andrew Johnson is remembered as the president who oversaw the acquisition of Alaska from Russia in 1867. There’s even a precedent involving Denmark. The government in Copenhagen sold what are now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1917. There are in fact plenty of other islands for sale, but they tend to be smaller and located in warmer climates. But as the BBC points out, Joseph Blocher of the Duke University School of Law wrote in 2012 that the “market for sovereign territory seems to have dried up” as it does “not seem to be for sale.”

4. How much would Greenland cost to buy?

Since the 830,000 square-mile (2.1 million square-kilometer) island isn’t currently on the market, there are no valuations available. However, for a sense of how much it might fetch, it’s worth noting that its gross domestic product totaled just over $2.7 billion in 2017. The island receives an annual subsidy of about $500 million from Denmark. For perspective, the purchase price of Alaska in 1867, $7.2 million, would translate to just $125 million today -- which most would agree would be quite a bargain.

5. How would Trump go about buying Greenland?

It’s unclear. Adjunct Professor Rasmus Leander Nielsen of Greenland University has told local media that Denmark can’t sell Greenland because its home-rule law of 2009 “clearly states that Greenlanders are their own people.” Trump’s best hope would be for the territory to gain independence and then choose to arrange a sale to the U.S. As it turns out, breaking away from Denmark has been discussed in Greenland, where advocates of independence have touted 2021, the 300th anniversary of colonization, as a possible leave date. One argument in favor of independence is that Greenland should have a closer association with North America, which is much nearer than Denmark.

6. Could Trump do this on his own?

Under the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Congress would have to approve money for any such purchase. But Trump has shown a willingness to try to go around Congress’s power of the purse. When it refused to appropriate money for more fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump raided the Pentagon’s budget to find funds for it -- and the Supreme Court backed him up.

7. What might the next step be?

According to the New York Times, skeptical Trump advisers have told him they would investigate the matter further, but only because they’d rather not tell him that the purchase is impossible. Trump would have had an opportunity to discuss the matter personally with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, but the president canceled his planned Sept. 2-3 state visit to Denmark after his Greenland scheme was rebuked.

What is the G7? Here's the History of the Conference,https://time.com,['Julia Webster'],,,,https://time.com/5657375/what-is-g7/,"Heads of state are meeting on Saturday for a two-day summit in the southern French city of Biarritz. President Emmanuel Macron is this year’s host and wants the meeting to focus on fighting inequality and protecting biodiversity and climate.

Here’s everything you need to know about the conference of world leaders.

What does G7 stand for?

G7 stands for “Group of Seven” industrialized nations. It used to be known as the G8 (Group of Eight) until 2014 when Russia was excluded because of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

Why was G7 created?

The G7 was created more than four decades ago as an annual gathering of political leaders to discuss and exchange ideas on a broad range of issues, including global economy, security and energy.

France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany formed the Group of Six in 1975 so that the noncommunist powers could come together to discuss economic concerns, which at the time included inflation and recession following an OPEC oil embargo. Canada joined the following year. Russia eventually joined in 1998 — and its inclusion was meant as a signal of cooperation between East and West after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991.

The G7 is an informal bloc and takes no mandatory decisions, so the leaders’ declarations at the end of the summit are not binding.

Which countries are members of the G7?

The group includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, France and Italy. Together, the G7 countries represent 40% of global GDP and 10% of the world’s population.

The European Union has been involved in G7 work since 1977, and is represented at the summit by the President of the European Commission (the E.U.’s executive branch) Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. The E.U. has gradually been included in all political discussions on the agenda despite not having official member status.

This would have been Juncker’s last G7, as he is soon to be replaced by his successor, Ursula von der Leyen, following the European elections that took place in May. However, on Monday it was announced that Juncker will not travel to Biarritz for the summit since he needs to continue his recovery after having had emergency surgery at the weekend.

Why was Russia kicked out of the G8?

Russia was kicked out of the then G8 in 2014 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine, which was seen by leaders as a “violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.

President Barack Obama and other world leaders announced in a joint statement, titled The Hague Declaration, in March 2014 that they would cancel that year’s planned meeting in Sochi, Russia.

“Under these circumstances, we will not participate in the planned Sochi summit,” the statement said. “We will suspend our participation in the G8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G8 is able to have a meaningful discussion.”

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, a few days before his departure for the summit, Donald Trump said Russia should be allowed to re-join the G7 group. “I think it’s much more appropriate to have Russia in. It should be the G8 because a lot of the things we talk about have to do with Russia,” he said.

Next year it will be the turn of the United States to host the G7.

What’s the difference between G7 and G20?

They have similar names and similar functions. While the G7 mainly has to do with politics, the G20 is a broader group that focuses on the global economy. It’s also known as the “Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy” and represents 80% of global GDP.

It gathers leaders from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the European Union.

Founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998, the G20 started off as a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors. However, as a response to the financial crisis of 2008, the G20 was upgraded to head of state level in an inaugural summit in Washington, D.C.

This year’s G20 was chaired by Japan. The 2019 Osaka summit was the 14th meeting of the G20, held on 28-29 June 2019.

The House v. Trump: Stymied Lawmakers Increasingly Battle in the Courts,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Charlie Savage', 'Nicholas Fandos']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/us/politics/trump-house-lawsuits.html,"Now, as Senate Republicans refuse to take up the bills they pass, Trump administration witnesses refuse to show up for their hearings and the president levels his own highly unusual lawsuits against the House’s oversight requests, two of the three branches of government are regularly facing off before the third, creating a new stress with uncertain consequences for the political system.

“It is unprecedented,” said Charles Tiefer, a former longtime House lawyer who is now a University of Baltimore law professor. “The challenges for the House counsel ebb and flow over time, but this is like nothing else in history.”

The consequences of the specific disputes could be significant. In the short term, they could determine whether House Democrats are able to drag information to light about Mr. Trump that could lead to his impeachment or damage his re-election prospects. And potential decisions by the higher courts could clarify the long-ambiguous line between a president’s secrecy power and Congress’s oversight authority — determining whether future presidents can systematically stonewall congressional subpoenas.

But the broader phenomenon is also significant.

As an immediate matter, the surge in litigation is a consequence of Mr. Trump’s norm-busting presidency. House Democrats are looking for additional venues through which to take him on — or, in some cases, fighting lawsuits that the president filed against Congress himself to try to block lawmakers from obtaining information about him from entities outside the federal government. But it is also bringing into clearer view how, over the past generation, Congress was already starting to go to court more often than had been the historical norm, as political compromise gave way to deadlock amid growing partisan polarization.

That trend line suggests that even if the number of congressional lawsuits declines when the next president takes office, the constitutional order could change in a way that Mr. Tiefer a nd other legal scholars view as dangerous. He said it is better if the two parties were able to resolve high-level policy disputes through compromise rather than through the “rigid and formalized system” of litigation, and suggested that routinely pushing those disputes into court could heighten politicization of the judiciary."
"WH officials look at executive privilege for Lewandowski, who never worked at the White House",https://www.cnn.com,['Kaitlan Collins'],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/politics/executive-privilege-corey-lewandowski-subpoena-white-house/index.html,"(CNN) White House officials have been engaged in preliminary discussions about invoking executive privilege to limit former campaign aide Corey Lewandowski from complying with a congressional subpoena, despite Lewandowski never serving in any role in the administration, according to three sources. House Democrats authorized a subpoena for Lewandowski last month, and served it Thursday.

The White House has invoked executive privilege in the past to block former aides such as Don McGahn from complying with similar congressional subpoenas. While testifying in June, Hope Hicks declined to answer nearly every question about her time in the West Wing, citing instructions from President Donald Trump that she was ""absolutely immune"" from answering. Annie Donaldson, McGahn's deputy, also did not answer more than 200 questions in her written responses to the House Judiciary Committee, citing similar immunity.

But this would be the first time Trump has tried to invoke privilege for someone who has never worked in the administration when it comes to the Russia investigation. McGahn, Hicks and Donaldson all held titles in the West Wing; Lewandowski has only informally advised Trump since his work on the 2016 campaign ended. The White House once asserted that former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach's conversations with the President about adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census were ""confidential."" Kobach nonetheless testified in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Trump officials and allies aren't confident the move on Lewandowski will work, skeptical that the President will be able to assert the same executive privilege principles over an informal adviser as he would a staff member. The White House has been in contact with members of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department about whether it would be successful, and say it remains an option. A White House official cautioned that the discussions are preliminary and no formal Office of Legal Counsel opinion has been sought or rendered by the White House counsel's office yet, though there is one related to Kobach's testimony.

""Executive privilege exists to protect internal government information that, if made public, would cause some damage to the country,"" said Mark Rozell, the author of ""Executive Privilege: Presidential Power, Secrecy and Accountability."" ""It applies to the President and high-level executive branch officers, not private citizens who never served in the administration.""
