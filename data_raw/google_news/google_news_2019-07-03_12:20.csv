"CNN’s Fareed Zakaria says Trump was right about asylum system, ‘pains me to say’",https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnns-fareed-zakaria-says-trump-was-right-about-asylum-system-pains-me-to-say,"Fareed Zakaria, the CNN anchor, on Sunday said it “pains” him to admit it, but President Trump was correct that the U.S. finds itself in a crisis with asylum system and the number of new arrivals.

The host of “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” was also critical of asylum rules that he called “vague, laxed and being gamed.” Zakaria said asylum was initially intended for a small number of people in the most extreme circumstances, not as a process of immigration in itself. He said the rules need to be “substantially tightened.""

He pointed out that “many” current asylum-seekers often have “suspiciously similar stories” and employ “identical phrases.”

“Democrats have spent most of their efforts on this topic, assailing the Trump administration for its heartlessness,” he said. “Fine. But that does not address the roots of this genuine crisis. If things continue to spiral downward and America's southern border seems out of control, Trump's tough rhetoric and hard-line stance will become increasingly attractive to the public.”

A federal judge in Seattle on Tuesday blocked a Trump administration policy that would keep thousands of asylum-seekers locked up while they pursue their cases, saying the Constitution demands that such migrants have a chance to be released from custody.

The Justice Department did not immediately return an email seeking comment from the AP, but the government was expected to quickly appeal the decision.

3 Reasons Not to Worry About Trump’s Fourth of July—and 1 Big Reason to Worry,https://www.politico.com,"['Jack Shafer', 'Jeff Greenfield']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/07/03/fourth-of-july-donald-trump-military-display-national-mall-227263,"AP Photo/Andrew Harnik Analysis 3 Reasons Not to Worry About Trump’s Fourth of July—and 1 Big Reason to Worry Other presidents have celebrated the Fourth. It's hard to think of one who has less sense of what it's about.

Jeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.

Since President Donald Trump announced his proposal for a military display and presidential speech on the National Mall, Trump’s critics across the political spectrum, have reached a consensus: The president’s intrusion into Independence Day is a hijacking. New York Times columnist Michelle Cottle complains that Trump is ""trampling a longstanding tradition of keeping these events nonpartisan — apolitical even — and focused on bringing the nation together.” The same sentiment came from the Washington Post’s editorial page, and from conservative Trump skeptics like radio host Charlie Sykes and former GOP Congressman David Jolly.

It's true that the president has upended many of the traditions of the celebration; the location of the fireworks have been moved; the president has demanded a heavy military presence, including tanks in the streets of Washington, and he plans to deliver a speech in front of a crowd where the choicest locations will be reserved for ticket holders, a feature somewhat at odds with Trump’s rhetorical scorn for the elites and D.C. insiders.

Story Continued Below

By one measure, the criticism is overwrought. There have been presidents who've appeared during celebrations at the Capitol, most recently Harry Truman in 1951. President Richard Nixon offered up a videotaped speech aired on the Mall in 1970; other presidents, including Calvin Coolidge and John Kennedy, traveled to Philadelphia’s Independence Hall to mark the occasion. (If you want one measure of how far we have traveled since JFK’s time, note that he devoted much of his speech to celebrating the emerging European Union: “The United States looks on this vast new enterprise with hope and admiration,” JFK said “We do not regard a strong and united Europe as a rival but as a partner.”)

As for the parade—well, if Trump wants military armored vehicles to accompany the flyover by the Navy’s Blue Angels, stealth fighters and Air Force One, maybe he’s just trying to emulate Thomas Jefferson, who watched a military parade from the White House back in 1801, rather than the celebrations of military might more common to Moscow and Pyongyang.

And if Trump takes the opportunity to play politics with the speech, something he can rarely resist, it's worth keeping in mind that political parties have been using the Fourth of July celebrations as platforms ever since our first parties, the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans, began holding separate Independence Day events in several locations back in the 1790s.

Celebrations of the Fourth do not tend to benefit both parties equally, and here, Trump may well be demonstrating his instinctive grasp of which way a big event tends to nudge the populace. In 2011, two academics who studied the political effect of Fourth of July festivities concluded that: ""Fourth of July celebrations in the United States shape the nation's political landscape by forming beliefs and increasing participation, primarily in favor of the Republican Party. … The political right has been more successful in appropriating American patriotism and its symbols during the 20th century, [so] there is a political congruence between the patriotism promoted on Fourth of July and the values associated with the Republican Party.”

So, yes, there's been plenty of ground laid for the kind of thing Trump plans to do.

For all that, history also suggests there's good reason that his plan is rubbing people the wrong way. For one, it really is rare; it's far more common for presidents to vacate Washington on the Fourth of July, or to remain at the White House, than to insert themselves into the proceedings.

And on a more troubling level, what Trump is doing is wreathing himself in the most potent symbols of American history—delivering a speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, site of the 1963 March on Washington, looking across at a landscape of monuments—without any appreciation for the history that made that whole landscape possible. Perhaps uniquely among American presidents, he sees himself without any connection to the American story, any link to presidents past, other than his manifest superiority to any of them.

Someone who can say of himself that he has been treated worse than any president in history—four of whom were assassinated—has an impressively unique understanding of his own role in the American story, to say the least. He has rarely if ever reached back to his predecessors to find any kind of meaningful historical connection, especially the kind that would reach across lines of party and ideology to find common national ground on a day like the Fourth. Kennedy often reached back to the first generation of American political leaders; Ronald Reagan quoted FDR and JFK in many of his addresses.

Trump prefers to think of himself as the lone, overarching figure who can bend history to his will. “I alone can fix it,” he said in his 2016 acceptance speech. Neither that speech, nor his inaugural, invoked the name of any past leader. He appears to believe that the American economy turned 180 degrees on the day of his inauguration, rather than moving on the same upward trajectory it had been on for the better part of a decade. Nor is he bound by the restraints that have guided his predecessors in understanding when partisan politics ought to give way to more unifying themes.

This is, after all, a president who went to a CIA commemoration of its fallen agents and bragged (falsely) about the size of his inaugural audience and the number of times he appeared on the cover of Time magazine. This is the president who has repeatedly made blatantly political arguments in speeches to different branches of the military, when his long line of predecessors as commander in chief all somehow managed to observe the bright line between national leadership and partisan brawling.

There’s also a more personal dimension to the Trumpification of the Fourth. Throughout his presidency, he has taken outsize delight in over-the-top celebrations and honors given him by foreign governments, a delight that seems to translate into bizarre foreign policies. Receive the Gold Medallion from Saudi Arabia, and you brush aside the kingdom's murder and dismemberment of an American resident. Enjoy lavish banquets in China, and the brutal crackdown on a million Uighurs goes unmentioned. Get a “beautiful letter” from Kim Jong Un and maybe North Korea can keep its nukes. (And would you really be totally shocked if Kim showed up at the White House to help Trump celebrate the Fourth?)

Trump has been obsessed by the idea of a massive military parade ever since attending the Bastille Day celebration in Paris two years ago, first ordering up a Veterans Day parade for 2018 that was canceled only after the price tag proved embarrassingly high. For someone who literally cannot grasp the possibility that more people voted for his opponent than him, or that fewer people came to his inaugural than his predecessor’s, it is not much of a reach to imagine that in the president’s mind he will see the flyovers and the fireworks as a nation paying tribute to the greatness of a man, rather than the other way around.

It is true that, on some public occasions, Trump has been able to subordinate this vanity to a sense of occasion, at least in his literal words. His speech in Normandy at the 75th anniversary of D-Day was an unexceptionable tribute to the men who stormed the beaches, although a different White House might have thought better of staging an interview with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in front of a graveyard filled with the bodies of those men. He has delivered State of the Union speeches without describing Democrats in the House chamber as treasonous, or the media in the press sections as enemies of the people.

What remains unsettling, however, is the thoroughly reasonable conviction that when the president delivers such homilies, he has no real connection to those words. At any moment, it’s plausible to expect that the id will drive the superego from the podium, and the explosion of grievance, self-pity and rage will erupt—dominating a day that has in recent times been free of political division.

To be fair, however, that would not be the worst result of a presidential Fourth. Back in 1845, President James Polk presided over a fireworks display at the White House. During the festivities, 12 rockets were accidentally fired into the crowd, and two people were killed. If the worst thing that happens tomorrow is just a speech, we can be thankful for small favors."
Trump plans rally in North Carolina on same day as Mueller testimony,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Lukas Mikelionis', 'Lukas Mikelionis Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-keep-america-great-2020-rally-north-carolina-same-day-mueller-testimony,"President Trump will hold a 2020 campaign rally in North Carolina on July 17 – the same day former special counsel Robert Mueller is scheduled to appear before Congress.

The president’s re-election campaign said it will host a “Keep America Great” rally at Williams Arena in Greenville that day.

The timing of the rally is likely planned to coincide with the Mueller’s appearance before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, with Democrats hoping for explosive testimony that will damage Trump.

TREY GOWDY ON MUELLER TESTIMONY: 'SET LOW EXPECTATIONS'

Trump’s critics also hope the testimony will generate attention to the Mueller report that he provided to the Justice Department in March, at the conclusion of his Russia investigation.

The report looked at Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election but found no evidence that Trump colluded with the foreign government in an effort to get elected.

The special counsel did detail instances of possible obstruction of justice by Trump, a section of the report that some Democrats jumped on to suggest launching the impeachment proceedings against the president.

MATT GAETZ: MUELLER HEARING WILL REVEAL 'OCEANS OF BIAS,' BUT NO COLLUSION

The North Carolina rally is also particularly important with 2020 coming. Not only did Trump win the state by less than four points back in 2016, but Democrats are eyeing the U.S. Senate seat of Republican incumbent Thom Tillis.

Trump recently endorsed Tillis against his GOP challenger, despite Tillis' being criticized from the right for opposing Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border.

TRUMP ENDORSES MCSALLY IN ARIZONA SENATE RACE, TILLIS IN NORTH CAROLINA

“Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has really stepped up to the plate,” Trump wrote in a tweet. “Thom is tough on Crime, Strong on the Border and fights hard against Illegal Immigration. He loves our Military, our Vets and our great Second Amendment. I give Thom my Full and Total Endorsement!”

Tillis penned an op-ed last week, arguing that Congress should compel cities and local authorities to cooperate with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“Congress also has a duty to stop the growing trend of sanctuary jurisdictions, which is why I plan next month to take action at the federal level by introducing the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act,” he wrote.

“It has long been assumed that local law enforcement would at least make a good-faith effort to help fulfill lawful requests made by federal law enforcement. However, given the recent embrace of irresponsible sanctuary policies over public safety, the time for action – and accountability – is now,” he added.

Trump's Fed pick Judy Shelton is a fan of the gold standard and other unusual economic policies,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/03/trumps-federal-reserve-pick-judy-sheltons-economic-policies.html,"Judy Shelton, U.S. executive director for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, stands for a photograph.

In tapping Judy Shelton to become one of two Federal Reserve Board governors, President Donald Trump selected one of the minority of mainstream economists supportive of a return to the gold standard and critical of central bank activity.

Shelton, who serves as the U.S. executive director at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, wrote as recently as last year in support of pegging the dollar to gold prices.

Trump announced his intention to nominate both Shelton and St. Louis Fed economist Christopher Waller via tweet on Tuesday.

Shelton's unorthodox monetary beliefs will likely draw questions from Senate lawmakers, who will ultimately need to approve Shelton and Waller to the Fed board.

In a post published by the libertarian think tank Cato Institute in 2018, Shelton drew a comparison between cryptocurrencies and gold.

""If the appeal of cryptocurrencies is their capacity to provide a common currency, and to maintain a uniform value for every issued unit, we need only consult historical experience to ascertain that these same qualities were achieved through the classical international gold standard,"" she wrote.

""In proposing a new international monetary system linked in some way to gold, America has an opportunity to secure continued prominence in global monetary affairs.""

The choice of Shelton may hint at Trump's growing frustration with Fed leaders and the direction of the central bank's monetary policy. Trump has argued that higher interest rates and so-called quantitative tightening have capped GDP growth and dampened the U.S. position in trade deliberations with Beijing.

Two previous Trump nominees, Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, bowed out of consideration after it became clear their confirmation process was in jeopardy.

Shelton, no fan of the Fed's, recently argued against an overly active central bank.

Questioned in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal opinion page whether the U.S. central bank should lower rates she said, ""The answer is yes.""

""When you have an economy primed to grow because of reduced taxes, less regulation, dynamic energy and trade reforms, you want to ensure maximum access to capital,"" she told the Journal. ""The Fed's practice of paying banks to keep money parked at the Fed in deposit accounts instead of going into the economy is unhealthy and distorting; the rate should come down quickly as the practice is phased out."""

DHS Inspector General Finds 'Dangerous Overcrowding' In Border Patrol Facilities,https://www.npr.org,"['Joel Rose', 'John Burnett']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/02/738179391/dhs-inspector-general-finds-dangerous-overcrowding-in-border-patrol-facilities,"DHS Inspector General Finds 'Dangerous Overcrowding' In Border Patrol Facilities

Enlarge this image toggle caption Office of Inspector General Office of Inspector General

The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General is warning about ""dangerous overcrowding"" in Border Patrol facilities in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas.

In a strongly worded report, the inspector general said the prolonged detention of migrants without proper food, hygiene or laundry facilities — some for more than a month — requires ""immediate attention and action.""

The report comes amid growing outrage over detention conditions for migrants and follows reports that migrant children were kept in squalid conditions without enough food and basic necessities in a Border Patrol station in West Texas.

Inspectors from DHS's Office of Inspector General in June visited Border Patrol facilities and ports of entry across the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, the busiest sector in the country for illegal border crossings.

""We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of DHS agents and officers, and to those detained,"" they wrote.

In its response to the report, the Department of Homeland Security says the surge of migrants crossing the Southern border has led to an ""acute and worsening crisis.""

""The current migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis are rapidly overwhelming the ability of the Federal Government to respond,"" DHS says.

In May, according to DHS, an average of more than 4,600 people a day crossed illegally or arrived at ports of entry without the proper documents, compared to less than 700 a day in the same period two years ago.

DHS says Customs and Border Protection facilities are at ""peak capacity"" and that the agency is adding detention capacity at three tent facilities in order to improve the conditions for migrants. CBP also says it ""continues to take steps to address the health and safety of those in custody,"" including by expanding medical services.

The inspector general's office released a report in May describing similarly dangerous overcrowding conditions in Border Patrol cells in the El Paso region.

The latest report from the Rio Grande Valley includes photos of migrants penned into overcrowded Border Patrol facilities — including one man pressing a cardboard sign to a cell window with the word ""Help.""

The inspectors quote one unnamed senior manager calling the situation a ""ticking time bomb.""

Inspectors found that hundreds of children were held for longer than the 72 hours, the maximum time federal rules allow. In some cases, kids were held for more than two weeks. And some adults were kept in standing-room-only cells, without access to showers, for more than a week.

Inspectors said Border Patrol management informed them there had been ""security incidents,"" such as detainees clogging toilets with Mylar blankets and socks in order to be released from their cells during maintenance.

""We ended our site visit at one Border Patrol facility early because our presence was agitating an already difficult situation,"" the inspectors wrote. ""Specifically, when detainees observed us, they banged on the cell windows, shouted, pressed notes to the window with their time in custody, and gestured to evidence of their time in custody (e.g., beards)."""
DOJ says citizenship question being dropped from 2020 Census: NY attorney general's office,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-says-citizenship-question-being-dropped-from-2020-census-ny-attorney-generals-office,"The New York attorney general’s office said Tuesday the Justice Department has decided to print the 2020 Census without the citizenship question sought by the Trump administration, ending a contentious legal dispute over an issue that could soon affect the makeup of Congress and the Electoral College.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that the question couldn't be added for now, but left open the possibility that additional arguments could change its mind. Civil rights groups argued that the Trump administration's reasons for including the question were merely pretextual efforts to discourage illegal immigrants from responding to the Census.

Population counts from the Census are used to apportion House seats among the 50 states, and a new electoral map based on the Census will be in effect for the 2024 presidential election. States receive votes in the Electoral College equal to the number of members in their congressional delegation, counting both House and Senate seats.

In a tweet on Monday, Daniel Jacobson, who worked in the White House Counsel’s Office under President Obama, said a trial attorney at the Justice Department told him that ""the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process"" without the citizenship question.

""We won,"" Jacobson wrote.

In a statement to Fox News, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tied the decision to the Supreme Court's ruling.

“I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census,"" Ross said. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

For his part, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., issued a less-than-celebratory statement calling for answers, even as he praised the decision to scrap the citizenship question.

""I am encouraged that Administration officials dropped President Trump’s unconstitutional plan to postpone the Census just because he lost the Supreme Court case,"" Cummings said. ""The Trump Administration put our country through more than a year of wasted time and squandered resources—all in the service of an illegal attempt to add a discriminatory question based on a pretext.""

Cummings continued: ""The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce must now turn over all of the documents our Committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, added, ""The exclusion of the citizenship question from the census is a victory for our democracy and for fair representation of all communities in this country.""

President Trump had tweeted that he had asked lawyers if the count can be delayed until the Supreme Court can reevaluate the matter, based on additional evidence supporting the administration's justifications for adding the citizenship question.

The Supreme Court, in its ruling last week, did not prohibit a citizenship question out of hand but dismissed the administration's provided rationale as insufficient.

However, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Fox News on Tuesday that the Supreme Court was unlikely to change its mind. Clarke's team successfully challenged the Trump administration on the use of the citizenship question in federal court in California, and was one of several groups to bring such lawsuits.

“The Supreme Court’s ruling left little opportunity for the administration to cure the defects with its decision to add a citizenship question and, most importantly, they were simply out of time given the impending deadline for printing forms,"" Clarke said.

Experts agreed that any delay could gum up the U.S. Census Bureau's finely calibrated timetable for the 10-year count. Monday was the deadline to start printing the 600 million documents that will be mailed to 130 million households for next April's census count.

CAL THOMAS: CENSORING THE CENSUS IS ABOUT POLITICS, NOT THE LAW

For months, the Trump administration had argued that the courts needed to decide quickly whether the citizenship question could be added to the 2020 census because of the looming deadline.

""I think it's very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal,"" Trump told reporters Monday. ""There's a big difference to me between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.""

Former President Barack Obama's administration didn't ask the citizenship question in the 2010 census. The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.

""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,"" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told Fox News.

From a logistical standpoint, any delay ""would be a nightmare,"" said John Thompson, who served as Census Bureau director during Obama's second term.

The bureau already has been in the process of signing almost 250 office leases across the U.S. and has hired 1,500 specialists partnering with community organizations to encourage people to participate in the census. More than 170,000 recruits already have filled out applications for the almost half-million positions being created for the count. The bureau has helped set up more than 1,500 committees nationwide working to get everyone to respond.

Furthermore, Congress would have to change the law for the count to be delayed because Title 13 of the U.S. Code mandates that it take place on April 1, 2020, Thompson said.

""I don't think there's any ambiguity, but I'm not a lawyer,"" Thompson said.

Fewer people are expected to fill out the questionnaires using paper than in years past because the bureau for the first time is relying on most respondents to use the Internet to answer questions. Still, printed postcards and letters are to be sent out next March reminding residents it's time to answer the questionnaire, and those who don't respond digitally are expected to be mailed paper questionnaires.

As recently as last week, the Trump administration's solicitor general wrote in court papers that the Census Bureau needed to finalize the questions by June. Any changes to the paper questionnaire after June would impair the bureau's ability to conduct the count in a timely manner, wrote the solicitor general, Noel Francisco.

More than two dozen Democrats in the U.S. Senate last week sent a letter urging Ross to drop any further pursuit of the citizenship question because it would delay the bureau's ability to conduct the count.

""The 2020 Census is less than half a year away, and any unnecessary delay in operations would impact the ability of the Census Bureau to count every person in our country,"" the letter read.

This past May, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines introduced legislation that would require the census to include a citizenship question.

""This is America,"" Daines told Fox News at the time. ""We are a sovereign nation. It's absurd that we don't know how many citizens and non-citizens are living in this country. That's why I'm introducing this bill to require a citizenship question on the census - and ensure that states harboring millions of illegal immigrants are not rewarded with additional taxpayer dollars.""

"The brightest star this Fourth of July? Donald Trump. Oh, and the tanks.",https://www.nj.com,"['The Washington', 'The Washington Post']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.nj.com/opinion/2019/07/the-brightest-star-this-fourth-of-july-donald-trump-oh-and-the-tanks.html,"By Karen Tumulty

When Donald Trump develops a fixation, he does not give it up easily.

Exactly one week before he was inaugurated in 2017, I interviewed the incoming president about the slogan that had defined his presidential campaign.

How, I asked him, did he plan to demonstrate that he had succeeded in his vow to ""Make America Great Again""? How were this country's citizens to measure something as value-laden as greatness?

""Because I'm going to tell them,"" he replied.

Trump briefly mentioned bringing back jobs, strengthening the borders and improving health care. Then he grew more animated as he described an idea that had clearly ignited his showman's imagination.

""We're going to display our military,"" he said. ""We're going to display it. The military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we're going to be showing our military.""

Where to see Fourth of July 2019 fireworks in N.J.: A statewide guide Where to see fireworks this Fourth of July in New Jersey.

Trump had to scotch the parade idea, after Pentagon and Washington, D.C. officials warned that it could cost as much as $92 million.

But his dream of a military spectacle will finally come to fruition on our nation's 243rd birthday.

Some of it sounds, well, pretty great. There will be a flyover of military aircraft, including that instantly recognizable jetliner used as Air Force One, and a performance by the Navy's elite Blue Angels team. I grew up an Air Force kid and love a good air show.

More unsettling is the president's plan to have tanks in the streets - a dark and ominous image we normally associate with times of national emergency, or martial displays in authoritarian states such as Russia, North Korea and China.

Trump seems oddly taken with tanks. He has insisted on bringing them into downtown Washington, D.C., despite warnings that armored behemoths weighing more than 60 tons could make wreckage of the pavement and potentially damage the underground rooms of the Lincoln Memorial. Then again, it's not entirely clear he has thought this concept through, given his announcement that the Independence Day festivities will showcase ""brand-new Sherman tanks,"" a model that went out of service in 1957.

But the truth is, all of this hardware is merely the setting for a stage. The star of Trump's ""Salute to America"" will be . . . Trump.

Here is how the president described his plan in a February tweet: ""HOLD THE DATE! We will be having one of the biggest gatherings in the history of Washington, D.C., on July 4th. It will be called 'A Salute To America' and will be held at the Lincoln Memorial. Major fireworks display, entertainment and an address by your favorite President, me!""

If there was even a glimmer of doubt that Trump intended to inject politics into this most egalitarian and nonpartisan of holidays, it was erased when he decided to set up a special section of reserved VIP seating to stretch from the steps of the memorial to the halfway point of the reflecting pool. Some of the tickets are being handed out by the Republican National Committee.

Trump believes his predecessors lacked a certain pizazz when it came to proclaiming their own greatness.

Take, for instance, the commander in chief who led the nation during World War II. ""You know, [Franklin Roosevelt] was a great promoter, but nobody would know that because he was very solemn, and you know, very regal,"" Trump told me.

Then there was the one who was known as the Great Communicator.

""Ronald Reagan was a great cheerleader, but nobody thinks of him as a cheerleader,"" Trump said. ""Being a great president has to do with a lot of things, but one of them is being a cheerleader for the country.""

July 4th to ‘lose its meaning’ after N.J. town moves fireworks show, critics say Some residents are upset after the Independence Day show is moved from July 4 to July 2.

So how do presidents normally spend the Fourth of July? Or perhaps that question should be: How do normal presidents spend the Fourth of July?

Mostly, the modern ones have kicked back like the rest of us do. The South Lawn of the White House is a particularly nice vantage point for the fireworks display over the Mall.

Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama also marked the occasion by attending naturalization ceremonies.

""Throughout our history, the words of the declaration have inspired immigrants from around the world to set sail to our shores,"" Bush said at the one he attended in 2008 at Monticello. ""These immigrants have helped transform 13 small colonies into a great and growing nation.""

Great. There it was. That word again. And nary a tank in sight.

Trump administration to print 2020 Census without citizenship question,https://www.10tv.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.10tv.com/article/trump-administration-print-2020-census-without-citizenship-question-2019-jul,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Days after the U.S. Supreme Court halted the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, the U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday started printing the questionnaire without the controversial query.

Trump administration attorneys notified parties in lawsuits challenging the question that the printing of the hundreds of millions of documents for the 2020 counts had started, said Kristen Clarke, executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco confirmed there would be ""no citizenship question on 2020 census.""

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that while he respected the Supreme Court's decision, he strongly disagreed with it.

""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question,"" Ross said in a statement. ""My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.""

President Donald Trump had said after the high court's decision last week that he would ask his attorneys about possibly delaying next spring's decennial census, raising questions about whether printing of the census materials would start as planned this month.

""The Supreme Court's ruling left little opportunity for the administration to cure the defects with its decision to add a citizenship question and, most importantly, they were simply out of time given the deadline for printing forms,"" Clarke said in an email.

Opponents of the citizenship question said it would discourage participation by immigrants and residents who are in the country illegally, potentially providing inaccurate figures for a count that determines the distribution of some $675 billion in federal spending and how many congressional districts each state gets.

""Everyone in America counts in the census, and today's decision means we all will,"" said Dale Ho, who argued the Supreme Court case as director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project."
Bipartisan bill aims to stop child pornography trafficking on Defense Department's network,https://www.cnn.com,['Anna Laffrey'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/house-bill-defense-department-network-child-pornography/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill that would crack down on the use of the Department of Defense internet network for trafficking child pornography.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified over 5,000 individuals, several of whom are affiliated with the Defense Department, who subscribe to child pornography websites in an investigation called ""Project Flicker."" A subsequent inquiry by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service tagged hundreds of Defense Department affiliates as suspects in child pornography cases, according to a news release.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, and Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, would help the Defense Department stamp out use of its computers and network to access and share child pornography. The legislation would bolster training, improve technical capacities and require collaboration with both law enforcement and social service providers.

Spanberger, a former federal agent who worked on child exploitation and child pornography cases, called the abuse and exploitation of children through pornography ""horrific crimes.""

""The notion that the Department of Defense's network and Pentagon-issued computers may be used to view, create, or circulate such horrifying images is a shameful disgrace, and one we must fight head on,"" Spanberger said in a statement.

"Rep.

John Ratcliffe said on ""Hannity"" that the Justice Department inspector general concluded his probe into alleged abuse of the FISA court process during the investigation of the Trump campaign in 2016.

Ratcliffe, R-Texas, said he met last week Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, to discuss when the report will be released.

""He related that his team’s investigative work is complete. They are now in the process of drafting the report. I would expect that it will be a draft that will be completed in short order,"" Ratcliffe told guest host Jason Chaffetz.

The House Judiciary Committee member said he does not expect the report to become public ""any time real soon,"" adding it's uncertain whether members of Congress will get to see the report before their August recess.

Ratcliffe said the draft report will have to be reviewed by the FBI and DOJ because about 20 percent includes classified material, according to Horowitz.

Ratcliffe was joined on the show by former Rep. Trey Gowdy, who outlined the line of questioning Republicans should pursue when former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testifies before House lawmakers July 17.

Dems step up oversight amid detention center firestorm,https://www.politico.com,['Sarah Ferris'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/02/democrats-summon-dhs-leaders-1395859,"The House Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Elijah Cummings, is demanding acting DHS head Kevin McAleenan to appear before the panel. | Alex Wong/Getty Images congress Dems step up oversight amid detention center firestorm Elijah Cummings is summoning top DHS leaders to testify, including the acting head of DHS.

Top House Democrats are escalating their response to Donald Trump’s handling of the migrant crisis at the border, making a direct plea to the president to improve conditions and ramping up their oversight of agencies at the center of a growing political firestorm.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to Trump this week urging his administration to guarantee certain standards — like water, hygiene and sanitation — for detained migrants, just days after losing a legislative battle with Senate Republicans over those same protections. The letter comes after a 14-minute call with the president on Friday, according to an aide.

Pelosi also sent a ""Dear Colleague"" letter on Tuesday to mobilize her caucus on the issue of border detention facilities, writing, ""Every day that goes by, we have even greater cause for concern and urgency to enact the protections for children and families.""

And on Tuesday, a key House committee summoned a pair of top officials from the Department of Homeland Security to testify on Capitol Hill amid a slew of political crises, including new photos of ""dangerous overcrowding"" in U.S. facilities and a secret Facebook group in which some agents mocked dead migrants.

The House Oversight Committee is demanding to hear from the acting head of DHS, Kevin McAleenan, who has been at the forefront of the White House’s response to the recent surge of migrants at the border.

McAleenan's handling of the border crisis drew further criticism on Tuesday, after a damning inspector general’s report found “dangerous overcrowding” and “prolonged detention of children” in a facility in Texas.

Democrats also summoned Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, which has been consumed this week with another scandal — a Facebook group with thousands of current and former agents posting racist and sexist images of Democratic lawmakers and making fun of a recent photo of a father and daughter who were found drowned in the Rio Grande.

Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings said on Tuesday that he plans to investigate the matter, and sent a letter to Facebook officials requesting all posts and comments — as well as deleted content — from the 3-year-old Facebook group.

Democrats first issued invitations to McAleenan and Morgan last week, according to the committee. But it’s not clear that either will respond willingly, as neither has confirmed attendance.

The committee has given both officials until Wednesday to respond to its request for testimony. Though Cummings has not threatened to subpoena them if they refuse to confirm their attendance, he has shown that he's willing to attempt to compel testimony if witnesses snub his panel. Last week, Cummings subpoenaed Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway for refusing to appear at a hearing about her alleged violations of the Hatch Act.

Democrats announced the hearing, which is scheduled for July 12, at the same time they released a damning inspector general’s report that found “dangerous overcrowding” and “prolonged detention of children.”

Among the findings is a disturbing photo that shows mothers and young children packed into tight rooms in a Rio Grande Valley detention center, where they appeared to sleep on concrete floors.

Cummings described the Trump administration's response at the border as “open contempt for the rule of law and for basic human decency.”

“The Trump Administration’s actions at the southern border are grotesque and dehumanizing,” the Maryland Democrat wrote in a release announcing the hearing. “The Committee needs to hear directly from the heads of these agencies as soon as possible in light of the almost daily reports of abuse and defiance.”

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus reacted with fury to the inspector generals’ findings on Tuesday, describing the 16-page report as full of “egregious violations” of human rights, such as denying migrants’ access to showers and hot meals.

The report also found that 165 children had been in custody of the border patrol agency longer than a week — far above the 72-hour court mandated limit.

House Democratic leaders have sought an aggressive response to the border crisis, seeking new conditions to strengthen oversight of the Trump administration.

But an emergency aid package signed into law this week largely ignored those requests, which were demanded by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and progressive leaders. Instead, the White House agreed to certain administrative changes that would, for example, require officials to notify Congress when a child has died in custody.

On Monday, President Donald Trump said he was still ""looking at"" the possibility of trying to delay the census from being printed after the Supreme Court ruled last Thursday to block the administration from adding the question to the 2020 questionnaire.

Michelle R. Smith/AP, FILE

In an email to plaintiffs of the case today, DOJ trial attorney Kate Bailey said ""the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process.""

The Supreme Court's ruling last week seemed to leave open the possibility that the administration could make another attempt to add the question, if it provided a different explanation, after Chief Justice John Roberts said the Commerce Department's initial rationale ""seems to have been contrived.""

""I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.""

The Census Bureau had previously set a target date of early July to begin printing the questionnaire in order to have it prepared for delivery to the American public by the April 1 deadline.

Opponents of the effort had accused the administration of trying to add the question in order to intimidate minorities and shift power to Republicans in future elections.

""I am encouraged that Administration officials dropped President Trump's unconstitutional plan to postpone the Census just because he lost the Supreme Court case,"" House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings said in a statement reacting to the news. ""The Trump Administration put our country through more than a year of wasted time and squandered resources -- all in the service of an illegal attempt to add a discriminatory question based on a pretext.""

House committee sues Trump admin for president's tax returns,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-committee-sues-trump-admin-for-presidents-tax-returns,"Failing to obtain President Trump’s tax returns via request or subpoena, the Democrat-led House Ways and Means Committee is now suing for them.

In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, the committee claimed the Trump administration was violating federal law by refusing to comply with its demands. A statute allows the committee to request an individual’s tax return information, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin shot down the request.

“In refusing to comply with the statute, Defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the Nation’s voluntary tax system,” the lawsuit said.

DEM WANTS TRUMP OFFICIALS JAILED FOR NOT TURNING OVER TAX RETURNS

The White House fought back, with an administration source telling Fox News that “the Justice Department will litigate this, but yes it will be challenged.”

Deputy Press Secretary Steven Groves said: “While the crisis at our southern border worsens, Democrats continue to focus their efforts on Presidential harassment. Chairman [Richard] Neal’s willingness to use his powerful Committee to go after his political opponents is a danger to democracy. The Committee has no legitimate legislative purpose for which it can demand the President’s tax returns, and it is evident that they are only interested in partisan games. The only thing more political than the Committee’s crusade for the President’s tax returns is its sham lawsuit.”

The committee claimed the law gave it “unfettered access to tax return information,” but Mnuchin had claimed the panel lacked a legitimate legislative purpose, which the Supreme Court said was necessary to make such inquiries. The committee claimed the law did not permit the Treasury Department to refuse and did not require any such legislative purpose.

Mnuchin was named as a defendant in the case, as was IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, as well as the IRS and Treasury Department. The IRS and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.

University of Iowa Law Professor Andy Grewal, who has written on the subject, said Tuesday he predicted the House committee may find early success in the lawsuit, but that the Supreme Court ultimately would rule that it did not have the power to bring the lawsuit.

“I would not be surprised if a district court orders the Treasury to turn over the returns,” Grewal tweeted. “But my prediction is that in this lawsuit or another, the Supreme Court says that the legislature lacks standing to sue the executive branch (ie, the case gets tossed out).”

In a separate comment to Fox News, Grewal warned of the precedent the lawsuit could set if it's successful.

""The committee has asserted an extraordinarily broad understanding of its own powers, saying that no one -- not the executive branch, not even the Supreme Court -- can question its motives,"" he said. ""Acceptance of that position would mean that Congress could issue subpoenas even when motivated by racism and bigotry. Courts may be hesitant to accept such a broad construction of the House's investigatory power.""

Despite claiming that it did not require any legislative purpose, the committee did claim it had one. The complaint alleged that the panel needed Trump’s tax return information because it was “investigating the IRS’s administration of various tax laws and policies relating to Presidential tax returns and tax law compliance by President Trump, including whether the IRS’s self-imposed policy of annually auditing the returns of sitting Presidents is working properly[.]”

Trump has said in the past that the reason he did not release his tax returns during the 2016 campaign, per tradition, was because he was under audit. The lawsuit cited a similar comment by Trump in April 2019, where he said he would not give Congress his tax returns while under audit.

The lawsuit also claimed the committee urgently needed the president's tax return information because of the consideration of tax legislation that ""would govern the next Presidential election,"" including bills that would require candidates in 2020 to disclose their tax returns.

TRUMP TAX RETURN STRATEGY COULD BACKFIRE, RECENT COURT DECISIONS INDICATE

Committee member Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-N.J., claimed that the lawsuit was a necessary measure due to the administration’s refusal to comply.

“Litigation is always a last resort. We are here today because Donald Trump and his enablers have sneered at our laws and avoided the thinnest accountability for their corruption. The Ways and Means Committee must file this action to stand for rule of law,” he said in a statement. “Despite Republicans’ efforts to cover-up, Americans cry out for oversight and voted in a new House to enforce that demand in November.”

Republicans on the committee, meanwhile, have been looking to take their own action. Top GOP member Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said after the lawsuit was filed that he was introducing a resolution against it.

“The Democrats’ partisan, flawed lawsuit continues their unprecedented and illegitimate pursuit to expose President Trump’s private tax information,” Brady said in a statement. “This is a dangerous course of action. For this reason, I am introducing a resolution to preserve the integrity of the People’s House from the attacks of the elite few and restore the voice of every American.”

Columnist

The Agriculture Department is offering employees a rare choice: accept a forced transfer to a post 1,000 miles away or be fired.

The Trump administration’s plan to move two agencies from the District to the Kansas City area includes a document with two blank boxes on it, sent to employees on June 13. Check one, it instructs: Accept the transfer by July 15 or “be separated by adverse action procedures.”

That means getting fired, with an opportunity to appeal the dismissal through what could be an expensive process. Getting fired could also make it more difficult to find another federal job in an area where the government dominates.

Although a limited number of buyouts and early retirement opportunities will be available for what union officials expect to be fewer than 15 percent of those affected, and while some USDA employees might find work in government positions elsewhere in the D.C. area, the disruption to employees generally will be substantial.

“Adverse action” can have another meaning that goes beyond the affected employees and more broadly hits taxpayers, organizations and businesses. In addition to the big hassle for workers, relocations could have an adverse impact — a major brain drain — on the work of the two agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Union officials estimate a strong majority of employees will decline reassignment. If that happens, the work of the small but important agencies could be seriously upset. Even before Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Kansas City region as the new location, but after officials said the agencies would be moving out of the District, department employees quit in droves, my colleague Ben Guarino reported last month.

“The current and projected attrition will curtail research data products that encompass commodity estimates, agricultural sector forecasts, food and farm economic and statistical indicators for U.S. agriculture, conservation, and food policy and markets,” said Kevin Hunt, a 10-year USDA employee, speaking as acting vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 3403 representing research service staff.

What the government calls “directed reassignments” to a different city are “very rare in the federal government. That's not something that is a common practice,” said Joanna Friedman, a federal employment lawyer with the Federal Practice Group. “This is unprecedented.”

When the Pentagon closed bases around the country starting in 2005, it forced many defense civilians to make a similar choice. “We lost a lot of talent in geographic moves,” said Jeffrey Neal, formerly the top personnel officer at the Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. “A 20 percent take-up rate is typical.”

Not only are government transfers like the USDA’s uncommon, but the size makes this one especially unusual. Typically, they are much smaller, said Neal, now a senior vice president with the ICF consulting firm. “Years ago, people were more likely to move with their jobs,” he added. “With most people living in two-wage-earner households, it is far more difficult to just pack up and go.”

Many, perhaps most, affected USDA employees are considering a third option — quit and find new work.

“I will be unemployed beyond Sept. 30,” which is the deadline for the District-based workers to report to the new location, Hunt said, “unless I can find another job.”

Of the 547 employees the department wants to move for the two agencies combined, 253 are with the Economic Research Service, 77 percent of its 329-person workforce. An additional 294 are with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 93 percent of its 315-person staff. News of the move prompted a surge of support for the union. Employees at the National Institute voted 137-2 to join AFGE two weeks ago. Last month’s vote at the economic service was 138-4.

When Perdue announced the moves to the Kansas City area, he said, “We did not undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to enhance long-term sustainability and success of these agencies. The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

But the USDA estimate of nearly $300 million in savings over 15 years is way off, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economics Association. Instead, it would cost taxpayers between $83 and $182 million, the analysis found. The USDA underestimated the true cost in part because it did not account for “the lost value of research from staffers who resign or retire rather than move,” the association reported.

A group of Democratic senators, including all four from Maryland and Virginia, has introduced legislation to keep the headquarters of the two agencies within the D.C. area.

Andrew Crane-Droesch, an economist with the research service, said he is not moving and is now looking for another job in the D.C. area. “Definitely the choice we face is move to Kansas City or lose our jobs,” he said. “I’m certainly not happy. I love my job, but I can’t move to Kansas City, and moreover, I don’t want to even if I could.”

Like Crane-Droesch, these staffers “have families, they are part of a community and they’ve been dedicated public servants,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations. “They deserve better than having such a radical and consequential do-or-die decision, which is hardly a fair choice, thrown at them at the last minute.”

Whistleblower: Mike Pompeo Treats Security Detail Like “UberEats With Guns”,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Condé Nast', 'Bess Levin', 'Tina Nguyen', 'Vanity Fair', 'Eric Lutz', 'Bess Levi', 'Alison Durkee']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/mike-pompeo-whistleblower,"If there’s one thing that unites Trump administration officials, it’s their well-documented belief that abusing government resources is a right, and that the purpose of their time in office is to enrich themselves as much as possible. That means a treasury secretary who sees no issue with using a government plane to get a better shot of the solar eclipse; a HUD secretary who dropped $31,000 on a new dining set for his office; a transportation secretary who promotes the family business that has paid her millions; a former VA chief who thought it was totally fine to take his wife on a taxpayer-funded European vacation; a former Health and Human Services secretary who spent $400,000 on private jets; and a former EPA administrator whose deluge of grift included directing his staff to “find reasons for [him] to travel to Oklahoma, so [he] could be in his home state for long weekends at taxpayers’ expense.” Oh, and a current secretary of state who allegedly views his security detail as his own personal concierge.

CNN reports that Democrats “on a key House congressional committee” are investigating claims from a State Department whistleblower who’s raised “multiple issues” over several months about Mike Pompeo and his family’s use of taxpayer-funded Diplomatic Security. Those issues allegedly include:

Tasking an agent with picking up Chinese food (without Pompeo in the car), leading to internal complaints by staff whose job it is to protect the secretary that they are effectively “UberEats with guns.”

Assigning a special agent to pick up the Pompeo family dog from the groomer.

Telling an agent to pick up Pomepo’s adult son from Union Station in D.C. and drop him off at home.

Lon Fairchild, the special agent in charge of the Diplomatic Security Service, did not deny that any of the personal errands—which former government ethics official Walter Shaub called “the very definition of misuse of position”—were carried about by his staff, but said in a statement, “I was head of Secretary Pompeo’s security detail since his first day on the job. At no point during my service did he or any member of his family ask me or any member of my team to act in any way that would be inconsistent with our professional obligation to protect the Secretary 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.” (A former senior official in the DSS told CNN the tasks would be inappropriate unless “some specific threat was identified that necessitated those trips.” Former secretary of state Warren Christopher had apparently wanted his agents to pick up groceries for him but was told that wasn’t their job, which one would think was obvious.)

In addition to the issue of Pompeo allegedly viewing protective agents as personal assistants, and a culture within Diplomatic Security “to try and please the secretary and avoid upsetting him,” there are reportedly also questions among agents as to why Pompeo’s wife, Susan, was assigned her own personal detail beginning in 2018, including when she is home in the United States:"

The decision was made after officials determined that there would not be enough time to continue the legal battle and meet the printing deadlines for the census questionnaire, according to people familiar with the matter.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Tuesday that “I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.”

President Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday night that it was a “very sad time for America when the Supreme Court of the United States won’t allow a question of ‘Is this person a Citizen of the United States?’ to be asked on the #2020 Census.” He said he had asked the Commerce and Justice departments to “do whatever is necessary to bring this most vital of questions, and this very important case, to a successful conclusion.”

The decision to eliminate the question was a victory for civil rights advocates concerned that the query would lead to an inaccurate count of immigrant communities that could skew political representation and federal funding.

“In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, the government had no choice but to proceed with printing the 2020 census forms without a citizenship question. Everyone in America counts in the census, and today’s decision means we all will,” said Dale Ho of the American Civil Liberties Union, the lawyer who argued the Supreme Court case.

The fate of the question has been the subject of legal and political wrangling since March 2018, when Ross announced that he planned to add it to the decennial survey, leading to half a dozen lawsuits from states, cities, civil rights groups and others.

Last week, Trump responded to the justices’ ruling by saying in a tweet he would seek to delay the census to give administration officials time to come up with a better explanation for why it should include a citizenship question.

Trump expressed disbelief again on Monday that the question could not be included and told reporters at the White House: “I think it’s very important — to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal? I think there’s a big difference, to me, between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.”

[Trump says census would be ‘meaningless’ without citizenship question]

Instead of a delay, government lawyers notified those challenging the question of the administration’s decision to proceed without it.

The Census Bureau has started printing the questionnaires without the question, Ross said. He added that his “focus, and that of the bureau and the entire department, is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

Soon after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration, Justice Department officials said privately that they determined that they would have no choice but to eliminate the question from the upcoming survey.

That is because the printer’s deadline was days away, and officials knew there was no way that a court could rule in the administration’s favor before then, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss pending litigation.

When Trump tweeted that he would explore delaying the count, some Justice Department officials were left scratching their heads, they said, because such a move would be legally impossible.

The White House asked the Justice Department how it might be able to add the question, including by possibly delaying the census, and the department explained that it wasn’t realistic or tenable, given time constraints and the Supreme Court’s ruling, said a person familiar with the discussions.

“I have to think that sanity prevailed with respect to the incredible disruption to our representational democracy that delaying the census would have caused,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee. “I doubt anyone at the Justice or Commerce departments could figure out how to overcome the constitutional and statutory hurdles.”

Critics of the question, including some at the Census Bureau, said it could cause an undercount of millions of people in immigrant communities who would be afraid to return the form, leading to an inaccurate number that could skew representation and apportionment in favor of Republican areas.

The government had said it needed the question to enforce the Voting Rights Act, and Ross initially told Congress that he decided to add it in response to a December 2017 request from the Justice Department. But documents uncovered in the lawsuits suggested that Ross was pushing for it months earlier, and that he pressed the department to make the request.

[Despite Trump administration denials, new evidence suggests census citizenship question was crafted to benefit white Republicans]

In the Supreme Court’s splintered ruling Thursday, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that federal agencies must offer “genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” He was joined by the court’s four liberal justices.

Data from the census, which every U.S. household is required to fill out, is used by businesses and by the government to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars in federal spending per year. It is also used to determine congressional apportionment and redistricting. The form has not included a question related to citizenship since 1950.

Thomas Wolf of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice said Tuesday that the push to include such a question will have a lasting effect.

“Even if the citizenship question is dead, it has left damage in its wake. The question has not only distracted necessary attention for over a year from other key aspects of census preparation, but also raised widespread fears about the safety of participating in the census,” Wolf said in an email.

“The administration must refocus its attention immediately on making sure that every person in this country is counted. It can start by launching a nation-wide advertising campaign to ensure everyone that no citizenship question will appear on the 2020 Census.”

The notice from the government came just hours before lawyers were scheduled for a conference call in a separate case in Maryland also challenging the census question.

Judge George J. Hazel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, in Greenbelt, was one of three federal judges who ruled earlier this year against the question, saying Ross violated administrative law and the enumeration clause of the Constitution by proposing to ask the citizenship status of household members.

The issues before Hazel were different from those the Supreme Court heard. The government’s path to adding the question had become more difficult in May after new evidence showed that before his death a Republican redistricting strategist had been in touch with administration officials regarding adding the question.

The strategist, Thomas Hofeller, wrote a 2015 study that found that adding the question probably would help Republicans and white voters in subsequent redistricting decisions; he also had been in touch with a census official about including a citizenship question to the form, according to files found on hard drives belonging to him.

Hazel had ruled that plaintiffs had not provided sufficient evidence for charges that the government had conspired or intended to discriminate when it added the question, and plaintiffs had appealed.

After the Hofeller information emerged, however, Hazel said the new evidence merited further consideration, and a federal appeals court returned the case to his court. The Maryland case could have tied up the question in a separate legal battle that might have eventually reached the Supreme Court.

During the call with Hazel on Tuesday, government lawyers did not explain why the citizenship question was pulled off the table, said Denise Hulett, senior counsel with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who also was on the call.

She said Hazel asked for a written stipulation by Monday in the case before him that the Commerce Department “has given up its fight entirely” to include the question in the 2020 count.

Shankar Duraiswamy, an attorney in the Maryland case, called the Trump administration’s reversal Tuesday a victory for American democracy.

“A citizenship question would have risked a massive undercount in areas with large numbers of Latinos and immigrants, depriving them of their right to equal political representation and fair share of federal funding,” he said in an email.

“It’s unclear what role the state has in the deal between Nike and Goodyear.

TRADE WARS … “Li Keqiang, Chinese Premier, Reaches Out to Trump and Business,” by NYT’s Keith Bradsher in Dalian, China: “A top Chinese leader made an unusually public effort on Tuesday to ease trade tensions somewhat with the United States, woo foreign investors and reassure his own country’s citizens that their economy remained on track.

“In meetings during the World Economic Forum in the Chinese port city of Dalian, Premier Li Keqiang, China’s No. 2 official, promised to cut tariffs, loosen limits on foreign investment, protect intellectual property and allow foreign companies to apply for China’s generous subsidies for research and development. … He also said that China would allow foreign financial services companies into its market a year earlier than previously promised, and that it would rewrite many rules on foreign investment.” NYT

A PERSIAN GULF MYSTERY -- “To Evade Sanctions on Iran, Ships Vanish in Plain Sight,” by NYT’s Michael Forsythe and Ronen Bergman: “A week ago, a small tanker ship approached the Persian Gulf after a 19-day voyage from China. The captain, as required by international rules, reported the ship’s position, course, speed and another key detail: It was riding high in the water, meaning it was probably empty. Then the Chinese-owned ship, the Sino Energy 1, went silent and essentially vanished from the grid.

“It reported in again on Sunday, near the spot where it had vanished six days earlier, only now it was heading east, away from the Strait of Hormuz near Iran. If past patterns hold, the captain will soon report that it is riding low in the water, meaning its tanks are likely full. As the Trump administration’s sanctions on Iranian oil and petrochemical products have taken hold, some of the world’s shipping fleets have defied the restrictions by ‘going dark’ when they pick up cargo in Iranian ports, according to commercial analysts who track shipping data and intelligence from authorities in Israel, a country that backs the Trump crackdown.” NYT

But those totals mask some significant variation by income, according to newly released IRS statistics from tax returns filed through May 23.

“These preliminary tallies provide the first hard data from the government about the actual refunds, deductions and taxes reported at different income levels in the new system. … The fresh data shows that while refund statistics barely budged for lower- and middle-income workers, real movement occurred toward the upper end of the income distribution. Average refunds for taxpayers making between $100,000 and $250,000 dropped 10%, while average refunds for those between $250,000 and $500,000 rose by 11%.” WSJ

As a trans person, it’s easy for me to forget that these candidates aren’t competing for my vote as much as they’re trying to appeal to the woke progressives who have recently taken up the cause on behalf of the trans community.

“Incoherent promises might play well with the progressive base, but I’ve yet to hear a candidate effectively speak out about trans issues beyond calling out Trump’s trans military ban. Selling campaign Pride merchandise is one thing, but offering material plans to roll back Trump’s attacks on our community would be so much more compelling.

Ted Cruz & Migrant Donations -- Senator Asks DHS to Create Process for Collecting Donations,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Mairead Mcardle', 'Kevin D. Williamson', 'Douglas Murray', 'David French', 'Jim Geraghty', 'George Will', 'John Hirschauer', 'Jay Cost', 'John Mccormack', 'Victor Davis Hanson']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/cruz-asks-dhs-to-create-process-for-collecting-donations-to-migrants-in-u-s-custody/,"Texas Senator Ted Cruz speaks in Houston, Texas, November 3, 2018. (Mike Segar/Reuters)

Senator Ted Cruz on Monday sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking for the creation of a process that would allow DHS to accept donations meant for migrants in U.S. custody.

Currently, no such process for collecting a distributing privately donated aid exists, which has caused generous citizens who have offered supplies to overcrowded migrant-detention facilities to be turned away.

Curz called on Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan to “establish and publicize a process for accepting donations from charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, and NGOs to aid individuals in CBP custody.”

DHS facilities are at “peak or beyond peak capacity,” Cruz said, because of the “crisis on our southern border.” Even with the $4.6 billion in emergency humanitarian aid approved by Congress to address the influx of migrants at the border, the Department can surely accept the “generosity of the American people” as well, he said.

A Texas state lawmaker first drew attention to the donation issue when he revealed that he’d tried to donate items to a Texas detention facility and was told by a Border Patrol representative, “We don’t accept donations.”

“It just befuddles me and I think it’s just heartbreaking to know that there’s so many people that want to help, and that help is being denied for no definable reasons that anybody’s been able to communicate,” Democratic state representative Terry Canales said."
Ground Truthing USDA’s June Acreage Report,https://www.fb.org,"['Credit', 'U.S. Department Of Agriculture']",,,,https://www.fb.org/market-intel/ground-truthing-usdas-june-acreage-report,"The 2019 growing season will go down as one of the most challenging planting seasons on record due to spring flooding and persistent rainfall across the Midwest. Planting progress for corn and soybeans was historically delayed, i.e., Crop Planting Delays Reach Historic Levels Resulting in High Levels of Uncertainty for 2019, and current expectations are for prevent plant crop insurance claims to exceed $1 billion and reach a record-high of 10 million acres.

USDA’s June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates recognized the challenges faced in the 2019 crop year and adjusted corn planted acreage down to 89.8 million acres, a reduction of 3 million acres from the department’s March estimate, and also reduced the crop yield from 176 bushels per acre to 166 bushels per acre.

USDA reversed course in its annual survey-based June Acreage Report. For the 2019/20 crop year, USDA indicated corn planted area at 91.7 million acres, up 3% or 2.6 million acres from prior-year levels, and down only slightly from March intentions of 92 million acres planted. Importantly, USDA’s June corn acreage estimate was up from the June WASDE projection and well above the average pre-report estimate of 86.6 million acres. Figures 1 and 2 highlight USDA’s corn acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

Following continued declines in new-crop soybean prices – due to substantially lower Chinese demand – USDA revealed soybean acres planted at 80 million acres, down 9.2 million acres, or 10%, from 2018 and down 4.6 million acres from March intentions. Soybean plantings in 2019 are expected to be the lowest since 2013, and plantings are expected to be lower in all 29 soybean-producing states. Figures 3 and 4 highlight USDA’s soybean acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

USDA Will Reinterview

It is an understatement to say USDA’s report surprised the corn market. New-crop corn futures fell by more than 19 cents and represented a $2.6 billion-reduction in the value of new-crop corn (based on WASDE production estimates). USDA acknowledged as much, indicating that 83% of the intended corn acreage had been planted at the time of the survey – well below the 10-year average.

In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the crop size and planted area, USDA announced that it will resurvey farmers in advance of the August 12 Crop Production report. Farmers in 14 states will be reinterviewed to determine their planted area of corn, soybeans and sorghum. Figure 5 identifies the states subject to acreage resurveys.

State Farm Bureau Perspective

To provide some additional perspective on corn and soybean acres planted, remaining to be planted or prevented from being planted, state Farm Bureaus in the reinterview region were contacted to get their ground-level perspective. Their responses follow.

Illinois – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 5%

A central Illinois farmer reported to me over this past weekend, that he had one field he originally planned to plant to corn, then was prevented-planting of corn on that field, and now he has just finished planting soybeans on that field. [Market Intel note: The planting of soybeans may have been motivated by the planting requirement associated with the Market Facilitation Program.]

Indiana – Corn Acres Up 3% and Soybean Acres Down 11%

Farmers in Indiana have given up on the hope of getting any more corn planted and did so several weeks ago. Prevent planted acres are all around the state, particularly in central and southern Indiana, where farmers have experienced rainfall far above normal. Corn can be seen in the state just popping out of the ground to knee high. Anticipated yields at this time will be far less than the 10-year average for farmers.

Kansas – Corn Acres Up 8% and Soybean Acres Down 1%

While a majority of intended Kansas corn acres have been planted, many of those acres went in during and after the USDA Risk Management Agency’s late planting period. In a few counties, up to 25% of the crop was either prevented from being planted or the planted corn is now under water.

The bulk of intended soybeans in Kansas are in or going in but a significant portion is later than intended; an early frost could be devastating.

Kansas grain sorghum planting is wrapping up, and it is suspected that at least in some areas of the state, forage crops may be substituted for intended grain sorghum acreage.

The Kansas cotton crop went in extremely late and estimates are that only about 50% to 60% of intended acres got planted this spring.

All crops are behind and will require near optimal temperatures and measured amounts of precipitation throughout the growing season. Again, an earlier than normal frost could be devastating.

Michigan – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 9%

There were a lot of acres planted over the weekend in central Michigan, but anything planted to corn recently will go to silage, not grain. The large dairy presence and need for forage in this area has caused a lot of farmers to keep planting corn with no intention of harvesting it for grain. Based on some informal surveys done a few weeks ago, I would estimate that around 65% of originally intended acres were planted to corn for grain.

Soybean progress is harder to estimate because there were still soybeans being planted over the weekend. It varies quite a bit across the state but the southeast and central [parts of the state] are probably the hardest-hit areas. Our media staff is creating a member survey that will go out tomorrow to help give us a better idea of actual acreage.

I think one thing that would help make USDA’s resurvey more accurate is if they give clear direction on how farmers should report prevent plant acreage, especially prevent plant land that gets planted to corn as a cover crop for silage.

Missouri – Corn Acres Down 3% and Soybean Acres Down 9%

Extreme flooding along the Mississippi, Missouri and internal state tributaries has wreaked havoc with corn planting in Missouri. Some land is still either covered or partially covered with water and will not be planted. April and the first half of May corn plantings were detrimentally impacted by frequent heavy rains causing thousands of acres to be replanted and/or forcing many farmers to leave undesirable stands due to the lateness of the season. Corn planted the last 10 days of May and into the first three weeks of June had better stands. 25-30% of the corn is normal, 50% is intermediate with very uneven stands and 20-25% is replant.

Ohio – Corn Acres Down 6% and Soybean Acres Down 6%

It is tough to nail down how accurate the latest USDA planting report is. Some of our economists don't believe it is super far off, but if we ask our farmers they claim much less has been planted. They are not thrilled to see the price slide with this latest report.

I was in Ottawa County in northwest Ohio yesterday and their Soil and Water in the county estimates that only 4% of the corn was planted and 30% of their beans. I would say that is definitely worse than most, but many of the surrounding counties experienced very serious planting issues as well. During my drive through northwest Ohio yesterday I saw a lot of weeds and barren fields.

If Ohio does not have a record for prevented plant acreage I will be surprised. And for crops that are planted, they are weeks behind, struggling to come up or already in need of replant. And how much can be replanted at this point? Probably not much.

South Dakota – Corn Acres Down 9% and Soybean Acres Down 22%

It looks like South Dakota will set the record for prevented planting acres by far. As always, there are differences around the state, but it sounds to me that on average the state will only be around 60% planted. On our farm, we were right at 50%. Some areas of the northeast part of the state are 80% to 90% percent planted. Down by Mitchell and Chamberlain areas, and between Pierre and Huron, some producers couldn't plant anything at all. There are some areas where you can drive several miles and not see a planted field.

Summary

USDA currently projects corn acres at 91.7 million acres, up 3% from prior-year levels, and soybean acres at 80 million acres, down 10% from 2018. However, given the historical delays in planting at the time of USDA’s acreage survey, USDA announced intentions to resurvey farmers in advance of the August Crop Production report. Feedback from state Farm Bureaus confirms the need to resurvey crop acreage, points to potential yield issues due to unfavorable growing conditions and supports a more substantial reduction in corn acres planted."
U.S. states sue EPA for stricter asbestos rules,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Stempel', 'Min Read']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-asbestos-lawsuit/us-states-sue-epa-for-stricter-asbestos-rules-idUSKCN1TW3N6,"(Reuters) - Ten U.S. states and Washington, D.C. sued the Environmental Protection Agency to begin working on rules to tighten oversight of asbestos, and reduce the health risks that the substance poses to the public.

The attorneys general from California and Massachusetts, Xavier Becerra and Maura Healey, said on Monday they are leading the case, after the EPA denied the states’ petition that it collect more data on asbestos.

A spokesman for the EPA and its administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said the agency does not discuss pending litigation.

Asbestos is a carcinogen once used widely in fireproofing and insulation. Many companies stopped using it by the mid-1970s after it was linked to mesothelioma and other types of cancer.

Federal law still allows limited uses of asbestos, and Congress in 2016 amended the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to create a process for regulating the substance. Symptoms from asbestos exposure can take decades to surface.

“Asbestos is a known carcinogen that kills tens of thousands of people every year, yet the Trump administration is choosing to ignore the very serious health risks it poses,” Healey, a Democrat, said in a statement.

“There’s too much at stake to let the EPA ignore the danger that deadly asbestos poses to our communities, including to workers and children,” added Becerra, also a Democrat.

Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington state joined the lawsuit.

The EPA has said protecting people from asbestos exposure is a priority, including through an April rule giving it power to review asbestos products that were no longer on the market before they could be sold again in the United States.

In denying the states’ petition, the EPA determined that it was already aware of all current uses of asbestos, and had the essential information needed to assess the risks, according to the Federal Register.

But the states believe this denial was arbitrary and capricious, and violated the EPA’s obligations under the TSCA.

The lawsuit was filed late on Friday in the federal court in Oakland, California.

It is one of many lawsuits by Democratic-controlled or Democratic-leaning states challenging policies by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, including the rolling back of some environmental protections.

The case is California et al v Environmental Protection Agency et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-03807."
Trump Says Conditions Are 'Disgraceful' in Major U.S. Cities,https://www.usnews.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-07-02/president-trump-says-conditions-are-disgraceful-in-major-us-cities,"President Donald Trump said Monday that U.S. cities struggling with challenges on the streets are ""usually sanctuary cities run by very liberal people."". The Associated Press

President Donald Trump said federal intervention might be needed to clean up the streets in major U.C. cities and appeared to boast about reducing homelessness in Washington during an interview with Fox News on Monday.

In an interview taped in Japan with host Tucker Carlson, the U.S. president addressed foreign policy and the power of big tech companies before the conversation turned toward the conditions in major U.S. cities.

After Carlson said that Osaka and Tokyo – two cities Trump visited during his trip to Japan for the G-20 meeting – were clean and didn't have graffiti or ""junkies,"" Trump agreed that U.S. cities such as New York and Los Angeles had major issues with what Carlson called ""filth.""

""It's a phenomena that started two years ago. It's disgraceful,"" Trump said.

""You can't have what's happening – where police officers are getting sick just by walking the beat,"" Trump continued. ""I mean, they're getting actually very sick.""

Although Trump didn't explicitly use the phrase ""homelessness"" during the interview, he appeared to blame the homeless population for playing a role in ruining cities and implied that many of them choose to be homeless out of personal preference.

""Some of them have mental problems where they don't even know they're living that way,"" Trump said. ""In fact, perhaps they like living that way. They can't do that. We cannot ruin our cities.""

He also suggested the federal government might get involved in decreasing the homeless population in major cities – though he didn't specify how. ""We're looking at it very seriously,"" he said. ""We may intercede. We may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up. It's inappropriate.""

Trump also boasted about cleaning up the streets of Washington after he became president.

""You know, I had a situation when I first became president,"" Trump said. ""We had certain areas of Washington, D.C., where that was starting to happen, and I ended it very quickly. I said, 'You can't do that.'""

Homelessness in the capital region has indeed decreased since Trump took office – dropping from 8,350 in 2016 to 6,904 in 2018, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness . But advocates for the homeless in Washington seem baffled by the president's comments, crediting the drop in homelessness to initiatives such as permanent housing and substance abuse treatment.

""I don't have a clue to what he's referencing,"" Michael L. Ferrell, the executive director of the service nonprofit D.C. Coalition for the Homeless, told The Washington Post . ""Those resources definitely predate the Trump administration.""

Trump said most U.S. cities are doing ""great,"" while adding that those struggling with challenges on the streets are ""usually sanctuary cities run by very liberal people."" He also appeared to suggest the U.S is going through an alarming increase in homelessness.

""We've never had this in our lives before in our country,"" he said.

Data from the National Alliance to End Homelessness, however, suggests otherwise.

Although homelessness did increase slightly by 0.3% between 2017 and 2018, it's been on a general downward trend for the past decade, according to the National Alliance ."
DOJ pushes Congress to permanently close loophole for knock-off fentanyl,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Clare Hymes'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doj-pushes-congress-to-permanently-close-loophole-for-knock-off-fentanyl/,"The Department of Justice is calling on Congress to enact into law a temporary order from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classifying fentanyl-like drugs as controlled substances. The 2018 order, which closed a legal loophole in U.S. drug laws that make Americans vulnerable to what are essentially knock-off versions of the opioid, was imposed on an emergency basis for two years and is set to expire in February 2020.

The drugs were previously able to dodge federal law due to their chemical makeup, which has slight modifications from the fentanyl compound. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is about 100 times stronger than morphine, and its analogues can be even more potent.

""From a policy and regulatory perspective, fentanyl-like substances need to be permanently scheduled as a class,"" said Katie Crytzer, the acting deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice. At a briefing with reporters Monday, she called the classification an ""urgent and necessary first step.""

John Martin, assistant administrator at the DEA, cited statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing more than 70,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2017. Nearly 48,000 of those deaths were caused by opioids, with approximately 29,000 stemming from use of fentanyl or fentanyl-like substances, Martin said.

If the government's current order expires without a plan in place to set permanent controls, Crytzer said, ""the department, its prosecutors and law enforcement would enter relatively unknown territory."" Crytzer said a lapse could have a serious impact on any ongoing or impending prosecutions.

According to the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, there were 863 federal defendants in fiscal year 2018 whose principal charge was related to fentanyl. However, the office only began including fentanyl analogues in their tracking as of October 2018.

The illicit substances are engineered to skirt and exploit gaps in U.S. drug laws, and largely enter the U.S. from foreign sources like Chinese criminal organizations, Mexican cartels and other traffickers. Officials say the analogues coming in from China are more potent, but traffickers from Mexico bring larger quantities of the drugs into the country.

""I can personally tell you how savvy these drug traffickers are,"" said Amanda Liskamm, director of opioid enforcement and prevention efforts in the deputy attorney general's office. ""When there is a gap in U.S. law they take full advantage of it, which results in more drugs and more deaths.""

Officials say the 2018 order has led to a ""significant decrease"" of fentanyl-like substances on the streets, and law enforcement is hoping that a more permanent continuation of the blanket classification will keep it that way. They noted that since the temporary emergency order has been in effect, law enforcement has only encountered three new fentanyl-related substances. Before the order, there were new analogues being discovered on a monthly basis.

Although Congress has been vocal on working to curb the opioid epidemic, they have yet to mark up the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act, or SOFA Act, which would permanently close this particular gap. Some hesitancy stems from concerns about how blanket scheduling could affect researchers, but Martin said that DOJ and DEA are working on an intergovernmental solution that benefits the researchers.

""They have some concerns but from where I'm standing, or sitting, I think we're trying to eliminate I guess the perception out there in the research community that it's going to be a hindrance for them to conduct research,"" Martin said. ""We absolutely don't want that perception to be there."""
House Democrats sue Treasury for Trump’s tax returns,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/02/house-democrats-sue-treasury-for-trumps-tax-returns/,"WASHINGTON — House Democrats have upped the ante in their quest to see President Trump’s tax returns.

On Tuesday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) sued the Treasury Department in order to force the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the president’s returns.

Trump has never publicly released any of his tax returns, a break from presidential candidate tradition. He initially said during the 2016 campaign cycle that he would not be releasing them because he was under audit.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — one of the president’s longest-serving cabinet members — has denied multiple requests from Democrats to turn over the returns since the party took back the House in January.

He ignored a subpoena from Neal’s committee for six years of returns in May. He argued that the request lacked a “legitimate legislative purpose.”

In June, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel issued a 33-page opinion backing Mnuchin, arguing that because Neal wanted to make the president’s tax returns public, the request lacked a legitimate legislative function.

The Democrats filed the lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. It names the Treasury Department, the IRS, Mnuchin and Charles Rettig, commissioner of the IRS, as defendants.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Steven Groves labeled the filing a “sham lawsuit.”

“While the crisis at our southern border worsens, Democrats continue to focus their efforts on presidential harassment,” Groves told The Post via email.

“They are only interested in partisan games. The only thing more political than the committee’s crusade for the president’s tax returns is its sham lawsuit.”"

His letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan comes amid increased scrutiny of the treatment of migrants in U.S. custody. News reports this month have detailed poor conditions at detention facilities, and prompted a lawmaker visit to some centers this week.

Cruz asked the agency to establish and publicize a process of accepting donations from charities, faith-based organizations, and nongovernmental organizations ""to aid individuals in CBP [Customs and Border Protection] custody.""

Cruz noted in his letter that DHS facilities are “at peak or beyond peak capacity,” and praised Congress for approving $4.6 billion in emergency humanitarian aid for the border.

""Many Americans, however, also want to provide more direct and tangible help—they want to donate basic items such as diapers and toothbrushes to children in CBP custody,"" he wrote. ""Organizations are currently having difficulties making donations because DHS and CBP currently lack procedures to accept their donations.""

Attorneys who visited migrant children being held at a facility in Clint, Texas, told The Associated Press last month that children were going weeks without bathing and that they were fed only meals that included uncooked frozen food or rice."

The disaster prompted a public outcry that in part led to the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. The EPA was charged with regulating the country's polluted air and waterways, among other environmental objectives.

Soon after its founding, the agency dispatched 100 photographers to capture the US' environmental issues as part of a photo project called Documerica. The photographers took about 81,000 images, more than 20,000 of which were archived. At least 15,000 have been digitized by the National Archives, and the images now function as a kind of time capsule, revealing what states from California to New York looked like between 1971 and 1977.

Trump’s tweet gained more than 6,000 likes and 2,000 retweets in less than 20 minutes.

The link to the press release was broken for about 30 minutes. It has since been fixed.

Trump has been hyping up his first-ever “Salute to America” event on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. — an event that will feature U.S. Army Abrams Tanks and shutdown the airspace around Washington during and after Trump’s speech.

A Fountain Inn family is calling for help from the Department of Veterans Affairs before they end up without a home. Jacob Skelly served five years in the military, including a tour in Iraq. His time in the service ended when he was honorably discharged and diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He, his wife Autumn and their three kids now live in Fountain Inn. In large part, they rely on the money he collects the first of each month from the VA. ""He's 100 percent disabled, he's on a lot of medications and that's his money for our family,"" said Autumn, inside the family's home Tuesday. They checked their bank account Monday, but didn't find a check. Each month, it comes on the first. ""Find out didn't get paid,"" Skelly said. Nervous, they called the VA for answers. Autumn said she believes they were hacked and said the VA told them the account number for where that check had been deposited changed. ""They did an open investigation, but they told us that it could be six-eight weeks until we hear anything back,"" she said. Skelly said that isn't soon enough. ""By the time we could get that check, we could be evicted. We could lose our vehicles.

Fresh Trouble: DOJ Subpoenas Boeing about Dreamliner Safety,https://marketrealist.com,['Anirudha Bhagat'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://marketrealist.com/2019/07/fresh-trouble-doj-subpoenas-boeing-about-dreamliner-safety/,"Subpoenaed over Dreamliner safety

The Boeing Company (BA) has encountered yet another problem—this time with its twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner planes. The US Department of Justice has reportedly subpoenaed the airplane maker regarding an ongoing investigation about 787 Dreamliner safety issues.

According to the Seattle Times, the Department of Justice is seeking records relating to 787 Dreamliner productions at Boeing’s South Carolina plant. The Federal Aviation Administration has been investigating two battery overheating incidents from 2013, following which Dreamliner planes remained grounded for several months.

The Department of Justice is investigating the allegations of the New York Times, which raised questions about the production process at Boeing’s South Carolina plant. In April, the Times made allegations about “shoddy work” and “flawed quality control” at the plant based on over one hundred pages of company documents, internal emails, and federal records.

The news agency stated that managers had pressured employees to finish work quickly to avoid production delays. In doing so, managers even ignored safety issues raised by employees. According to the Times‘ June 28 article, the Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed three complaints registered by employees at the South Carolina plant since September last year.

Fresh trouble for Boeing

The Department of Justice’s subpoena over Dreamliner planes has brought new trouble for Boeing, which is already facing worldwide criticism and criminal investigation over its fast-selling 737 MAX jets’ safety issues. The 737 MAX planes have been grounded worldwide since mid-March following two deadly accidents that occurred within the span of five months.

Due to their worldwide grounding, air carriers have denied taking deliveries of the MAX planes until safety concerns are cleared, thereby hurting Boeing’s overall shipments. In May 2019, the company’s overall commercial aircraft deliveries fell 56% year-over-year to 30 planes from 68 in May 2018.

Orders for Boeing 737 MAX planes have remained frozen since mid-March. The company has received some respite via several major orders for its Dreamliner jets in the last three months. During the first half of 2019, the company won ~55 orders for 787 Dreamliner planes. Therefore, any fresh findings regarding safety loopholes in the new model will likely severely impact Boeing’s commercial airplane orders and deliveries, hurting its financial results.

Stock performance

Shares of Boeing fell 2% on July 1. The stock has underperformed the iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), which allocates funds to companies engaged in the manufacturing, assembling, and distribution of aerospace and defense equipment. Boeing has returned 10.5% YTD (year-to-date), while ITA has returned 22.8%.

The stock’s YTD gains are much lower than those of its peers. Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Dynamics (GD), and United Technologies (UTX) have returned 38%, 16.1%, and 23.3%, respectively, YTD."
"House panel sues Treasury, IRS over Trump's tax returns",https://www.reuters.com,"['Susan Heavey', 'Min Read']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-taxes/u-s-house-panel-sues-u-s-treasury-irs-over-trumps-tax-returns-idUSKCN1TX24Q,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives panel on Tuesday filed a long-awaited lawsuit in federal court to demand President Donald Trump’s individual and business tax returns.

The House Ways and Means Committee filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused a legal request for the records and defied two congressional subpoenas seeking the returns.

The filing sounded the starting gun in what is widely expected to be a lengthy legal battle that is likely to end in the Supreme Court.

There was no official comment from the Trump administration, but Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said: “We will respond to this latest effort at presidential harassment in court.”

Democrats want Trump’s tax records from 2013 to 2018, which legal experts have said could shed light on the president’s business dealings. Such a legal process, experts said, could unfold slowly and become an issue in the 2020 election.

Mnuchin refused to hand over the returns after House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal asked for the documents on April 3, under a federal law that says Treasury “shall furnish” such records upon request. The committee believes it is the first time an administration has denied such a request, the lawsuit said.

“In refusing to comply with the statute, defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people,” the lawsuit said.

Neal said in a statement that the panel was now pursuing the matter in court because of the administration’s “noncompliance.”

“The judiciary has been a bulwark against Trump’s steaming corruption and roughshod lawlessness. I have no doubt our lower courts will side with Congress,” Representative Bill Pascrell, a Ways and Means Democrat who has helped lead the campaign to obtain Trump’s returns, wrote on Twitter.

Democrats who wanted Neal to move to court more quickly expressed relief at the filing. “This long-overdue legal action is needed to keep this bad president from setting a bad precedent,” Representative Lloyd Doggett said in a statement.

Congressional Republicans condemned the effort as a dangerous political fishing expedition by Democrats that could “weaponize” confidential taxpayer information.

“The Democrats’ partisan, flawed lawsuit continues their unprecedented and illegitimate pursuit to expose President Trump’s private tax information,” Representative Kevin Brady, the top Republican on Neal’s committee, said in a statement.

Ways and Means is one of half a dozen panels in the lower house that are conducting investigations involving Trump and his administration, from his campaign’s contacts with Russians during the 2016 presidential race to the sprawling business interests he has not divested since taking office.

The White House is refusing to cooperate with most of them, setting up other expected legal battles.

Trump broke with a decades-old political precedent by refusing to release his returns as a presidential candidate in 2016 and he continues to do so as president, saying his tax returns are under IRS audit.

House Democrats are using Trump’s audit claim as grounds for seeking the returns. The lawsuit said the documents are needed to determine whether IRS audits are working properly, to examine how the agency administers tax policy where Trump is concerned and to ensure that Trump is complying with tax laws.

The lawsuit said the administration’s continued refusal to produce the materials “is depriving the committee of information necessary to complete its time-limited investigation, thereby impeding its most basic constitutional functions.”

It asked the court to force the administration to comply.

Neal could also have the option of requesting Trump’s state tax returns from the New York Department of Taxation and Finance. The state legislature voted in May to share tax return information with a congressional committee that asks for it.

It was not clear whether Neal has contemplated such a move."
Vandal lists 'Putin' as 45th president on Eden Park monument,https://www.cincinnati.com,"['Cameron Knight', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/crime/crime-and-courts/2019/07/02/vandal-lists-putin-45th-president-park-monument/1625192001/,"CLOSE

The plaque in Presidential Grove in Eden Park was recently vandalized. (Photo: Used with permission)

A vandal has listed ""Putin"" as the 45th President of the United States on an Eden Park monument, park officials confirmed Monday.

A political statement writ in Sharpie got attention on Reddit Monday when someone posted a photo of the plaque in the park's Presidential Grove.

The simple lists of presidents ended with ""45 Putin,"" presumably referring to Russia President Vladimir Putin.

Trees have been planted in honor of each president at Presidential Grove since 1882. Many presidents handpicked the species of tree planted in the grove to represent them.

It's unclear when the vandalism took place, but the actual 45th President Donald Trump and Putin made headlines together last week at G-20 summit in Japan.

Trump was criticized for appearing to joke about Russia's meddling in the 2016 election with Putin.

Trump turned to Putin and wagged his finger with a smile.

""Don't meddle in the election, president,"" Trump said as cameras clicked and reporters shouted questions. Putin laughed.

Rocky Merz, business services division manager for the Cincinnati Park Board, said Monday he was aware of the vandalism and that it would be cleaned up Tuesday.

He explained Trump's nameplate was not damaged or removed from the plaque because the nameplates are only added at the end of a president's term. That president's tree is also planted at that time.

Merz said the plaque there has been vandalized many times over the years, and the targets have been presidents on both sides of the aisle.

Cruz: Overwhelmed DHS must start accepting private donations,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/cruz-overwhelmed-dhs-must-start-accepting-private-donations,"A Republican senator from a southern border state has urged the Department of Homeland Security to start accepting private donations, hoping the money will improve holding conditions and give Customs and Border Protection facilities on the U.S.-Mexico border additional needed help.



Senator Ted Cruz sent acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan a letter Tuesday urging him to create a process for the federal entity to accept money and supplies from faith-based groups, non-governmental organizations, and charities.

""Even with the additional supplemental emergency funding, I am confident that DHS and CBP can still use the generosity of the American people to help manage the humanitarian crisis on our border,"" Cruz wrote in the letter.

Cruz said he made the request because he had heard of individuals who wanted to help improve conditions inside the overcrowded facilities at ports of entry, but Border Patrol stations lacked a way to do so.

""This desire is laudable,"" Cruz wrote. ""But I understand that many of these organizations are currently having difficulties making donations because DHS and CBP currently lack procedures to accept their donations.""

The second-term senator did not make a recommendation for how DHS should go about making the operational change.

McAleenan is meeting with government officials in Honduras and El Salvador the first half of this week to discuss root causes and solutions to ""irregular migration"" from the northern region of Central America. DHS has not indicated if it will consider Cruz's request.

More than 600,000 people have been taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection personnel at and between ports of entry in the first eight months of fiscal 2019, which is more than the previous 12 months. More than half of that group are families.

CBP has said its facilities were designed for single adults to be held for up to 72 hours before being transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation.

Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement is responsible for taking unaccompanied children from CBP but has not had the space to do so, leading to overcrowded facilities with inefficient care for those temporarily living there."

Verizon is teaming up with the VA on a telehealth program,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Zachary Hendrickson'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-department-of-veterans-affairs-telehealth-partnership-2019-7,"Verizon partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a move that will give veterans who are also Verizon customers access to the VA's telehealth app VA Video Connect — which enables remote consultations with healthcare professionals — free of data charges via Verizon's 4G LTE network, per Health Data Management.

American Well

Here's what it means: The VA is doubling down on telehealth efforts to expand its reach among rural vets.

The VA conducted over 1 million telehealth consultations last year, and a strategic partnership with Verizon should help it reach its lofty telehealth goals. Six million unique patients received VA treatment last year — a difficult task given there are only 172 VA medical centers nationwide — and telehealth could effectively expand VA providers' reach: The VA aims for all of its care providers to be telehealth enabled by the end of fiscal year 2021, according to a 2018 Veterans Health Administration notice.

The VA is concerned that there are fewer care options for rural vets — but hopes 4G-powered telehealth could provide reinforcements. The VA's major telehealth investments are almost primarily geared toward addressing the needs of the 4.7 million US veterans living in rural areas: Rural veterans may need to travel great distances between their homes and points of care — a problem exacerbated by uncertainty around the 21% of rural hospitals currently facing closure. Also, 27% of rural vets don't use the internet at home, likely due in part to a lack of broadband coverage: Nearly 40% of individuals in rural communities don't have broadband access compared with 4% in urban areas, per The Conversation. Nevertheless, the VA has had success with telehealth in rural areas: Of the 1 million telehealth visits last year, over half were made by rural veterans.

The bigger picture: Verizon likely sees the massive VA patient base as a proof-of-concept for a larger telehealth play on the horizon.

Verizon isn't the only major telecom player interested in telehealth, but its superior 4G network could still give it the long-term edge. In addition to its partnership with Verizon, the VA has previously tied up with two other major players in the telecom space — T-Mobile and Sprint— on telehealth initiatives. However, Verizon performed better than the competition in terms of 4G mobile video streaming, and it also had the widest coverage area, according to insights from OpenSignal.

And free 4G access for veterans could be just the first step in a larger 5G telehealth play from Verizon.Of the three telecom providers linked up with the VA, only Verizon has a web presence fully dedicated to 5G in healthcare. As we've previously covered, 5G is the next step in mobile connectivity, and it's prepped to have a major impact on the efficacy and speed of digital health tools. I (Zach) think we could see Verizon leveraging 4G performance data from VA Video Connect in attempts to work out a more ambitious, paid contract to provide 5G digital health services to VA medical centers in the near future. However, Verizon will need to improve its 5G network before that point and could find itself competing with the reach of a potentially merged T-Mobile/Sprint.

EPA challenges Flint over staffing at water treatment plant,https://www.mlive.com,['Ron Fonger'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2019/07/epa-challenges-flint-over-staffing-at-water-treatment-plant.html,"FLINT, MI -- More than three years after the city’s water crisis was recognized as a national emergency, Flint still doesn’t appear to have hired enough employees to insure its water treatment plant is properly operated, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says.

But a city spokeswoman says it’s the federal agency that “simply has its facts wrong.”

In a June 26 letter to Mayor Karen Weaver and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, the EPA asks “what the city will do to demonstrate that the Flint (plant) has the necessary, capable and qualified personnel on board so that the (Dort Highway plant) is properly operated at all times.”

Reports from treatment plant operators to the state have shown an operator trainee quit, causing inadequate staffing; that employees have been scheduled to work up to 80 hours per week; and that workers are fatigued “due to low staffing and long work weeks.”

Defiant mayor will fight 'unwarranted' oversight of Flint water system ""This man-made crisis occurred because the state, over the stringent objections of the city and its people, imposed its misguided policies on the people of the city of Flint,"" Weaver's letter says. ""The city is committed to remediating and recovering from this crisis ... However, this proposed (order) does nothing to substantively further the city's recovery and instead appears to be retaliatory and punitive.""

City spokeswoman Candice Mushatt said administrative changes at EPA during the past several months have led to erroneous information in the letter.

“These concerns were addressed and discussed originally with EGLE ...,” Mushatt said in an email to MLive-The Flint Journal. “As a result and through our regular voluntary agreement tracking meetings with EGLE and reporting this information to the EPA during monthly calls, we were able to address those concerns.”

“The resolution through the city’s (Department of Public Works) director, was to implement a four-foreman schedule, which will limit overtime to one shift,” she said. “A new operator foreman was trained and a day shift operator was also assigned as foreman.”

In a Monday, July 1, posting on its web site, EGLE said a resolution to accept funding and pay for the continued training of plant operators was also headed to the Flint City Council at its next meeting, that operator trainees who passed written exams last month must next take physical exams, and that all foremen who took a certification exam on May 30 passed.

Flint to keep contractor at water plant after city staff fail operator exams ""The city intends to begin a new recruitment process to hire an internal, permanent (operator in charge),"" Weaver wrote in a June 11 letter to Eric Oswald, director of DEQ's Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance Division.

Flint’s staffing at the treatment plant has been a federal concern since the EPA issued an order in January 2016, spelling out required actions for the city water system.

In her June 26 letter to Weaver, Cheryl Newton, EPA’s deputy regional administrator, said Flint has worked to try to resolve its staffing issues but appeared reluctant to hire additional staff “for fear of having to lay them off when the (water system) becomes more automated.”

“However, the city has yet to demonstrate that this requirement has been met on a continuous basis,” Newton’s letter says of staffing issues. “While the city continues its efforts to hire and train staff, the ability to provide adequate coverage on an ongoing basis is an EPA concern.”

In 2017, EPA also raised what it called “continued and significant concerns” that too few people were working in the water system and asked the city for a plan “to ensure ... the necessary, capable and qualified personnel” are hired.

Mushatt said the city expects to respond to the Newton letter this week."
DOE Makes It Easier for Predatory For-Profit Coding Schools to Dupe Students,https://insights.dice.com,"['Nate Swanner', 'Nate Has Written For Publications Like Slashgear', 'The Next Web. When Not Opining About Tech', 'He S Likely Knee-Deep In Swift Methods']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://insights.dice.com/2019/07/02/doe-easier-predatory-coding-schools/,"Department of Education (DOE) Secretary Betsy DeVos is making a critical rule change that will allow for-profit schools and career certification providers to prey on unwitting students. It could also mean the proliferation of even more suspect coding schools.

In the summary of a document titled “Program Integrity: Gainful Employment,” the Office of Postsecondary Education, Department of Education writes:

The Secretary of the Department of Education (Department) amends the regulations on institutional eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), and the Student Assistance General Provisions to rescind the Department’s gainful employment (GE) regulations (2014 Rule).

The rule change is set to take affect July 1, 2020.

The “Gainful Employment” (GE) rule is a critical one. It requires for-profit colleges to make debt-to-earnings ratios available to students or potential students. This per-program ratio displays students’ earning potential so they could better understand their earnings and debt carried after graduation. (It was also a mandatory disclosure for schools that wanted federal funding.)

For example, if someone were to sign up for a 10-month web developer program at a cost of $18,000, the Gainful Employment rule meant the school would have to tell them what they’d make upon graduation (if they even found a job). The student (or potential student) would then know they were assuming $18,000 in debt, in addition to their potential earnings, which allowed them to make a more informed decision about whether they could afford the program.

Schools had to publicly post their debt-to-earnings figures, too, which the DOE now says is unfair. From its report:

The Department has determined that the GE regulations rely on a debt-to-earnings (D/E) rates formula that is fundamentally flawed and inconsistent with the requirements of currently available student loan repayment programs, fails to properly account for factors other than institutional or program quality that directly influence student earnings and other outcomes, fails to provide transparency regarding program-level debt and earnings outcomes for all academic programs, and wrongfully targets some academic programs and institutions while ignoring other programs that may result in lesser outcomes and higher student debt. Although the GE regulation applies to less-than-degree programs at non-profit institutions, this represents a very small percentage of academic programs offered by non-profit institutions

The DOE is arguing that for-profit schools are playing by different rules than non-profit schools, and that’s unfair. It’s also asserting a four-year degree in Computer Science and a 10-month certification in web development are not the same thing… but that both institutions should follow the same governance for reporting data, because for-profit schools are wrongfully targeted by the GE rule.

But there’s good reason for the GE rule: For-profit schools are notoriously suspect; for-profit certification provider ITT folded because it couldn’t display an appropriate debt-to-earnings ratio, which affected its federal funding and financial aid status. More recently, Woz U has raised eyebrows.

The DOE also tried to argue students’ inability to repay debt from for-profit schools was a socioeconomic concern, leaning on numbers that show those who enroll at for-profit schools (“proprietary,” in the snippet below) are less likely to come from stable, financially solvent backgrounds:

Students who enroll at proprietary institutions are far more likely to be financially independent (80 percent vs. 59 percent); part of an underrepresented minority group (52 percent vs. 44 percent); or a single parent (33 percent vs. 18 percent) than students enrolled at community colleges. Students enrolled at proprietary institutions are also slightly less likely to have a parent who completed high school (84 percent vs. 87 percent); and are much less likely to have a parent who completed a bachelor’s degree or higher (22 percent vs. 30 percent). These differences in characteristics may explain disparities in student outcomes, including higher borrowing levels and student loan defaults among students who enroll at proprietary institutions.

If your takeaway is that GE should apply to all post-secondary education programs, the DOE says that’s impossible because:

“The Department could not simply expand the GE regulations to include all title IV programs since the term ‘gainful employment’ is found only in section 102 of the [Higher Education Act of 1965]. This section extends title IV eligibility to non-degree programs at non-profit and institutions and all programs at proprietary institutions, and at the same time restricts the application of the GE regulations to those same programs and institutions. Therefore, without a statutory change, there was no way to expand the GE regulations to apply to all institutions.”

TL;DR: The DOE wants to take GE away rather than expand on it. Instead of making all schools more responsible, it wants to allow for-profit schools more opportunity to obfuscate their true value (or lack thereof) to students.

Third-party services such as CIRR serve as a destination to view the same data reported by schools under the GE rule, but it’s all based on voluntary reporting. If schools aren’t required to disclose such data, they may just not go through the trouble… or worse, use voluntary reporting as a means to outright lie.

Ditching the GE rule may be the most alarming step for DeVos’s DOE in its continued march to allow for-profit schools (including coding schools) to proliferate, but it’s not the first. In April, the DOE ended a program that forced for-profit schools to set aside funds in the event the school abruptly closed. This program was designed so those schools couldn’t take federal funding and run, but DeVos made it possible for schools to operate as fly-by-night swindlers.

As for the ‘why’ in all of this, we should remember Betsy DeVos was heavily invested in a company contracted by the DOE to hound students about loan repayments before being appointed to her post as Secretary – though it’s not clear if she’s completely divested from her holdings, or if they’re just in a trust to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. She also has (or had) holdings in an investment firm with direct ties to Laureate Education, which boasts of 875,000 students worldwide, including Minneapolis-based Walden University and its 40,000-plus students."
President Trump becomes 1st president to step inside North Korea ahead of brief meeting with Kim Jong Un,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trump-travel-dmz-meet-kim-jong/story?id=64042883,"Donald Trump became the first U.S. president to step into North Korea Sunday, reaching across the demarcation line to shake hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and then, at Kim's invitation, stepping across the border and into North Korea -- in a historic moment Trump called ""a great honor.""

Kim, through a translator, called Trump's decision to meet with him a ""courageous and determined act.""

""I just want to thank you, it was very quick notice and I just want to thank you,"" Trump said.

""Good to see you again, I never expected to see you in this place,"" Kim said as they initially shook hands.

Both leaders spoke, standing side by side, before heading into a bilateral meeting in a nearby building.

""Tremendous positivity, really great things are happening"" Trump said. ""We met and we liked each other from day one and that was very important.""

After Trump and Kim met for more than 40 minutes, they emerged together from the Freedom House -- along with Moon -- and walked side-by-side back to the demarcation line, where Trump and Moon bid Kim farewell.

Back inside Freedom House, Trump declared it a ""great"" and ""legendary"" day and said they agreed to formulate teams to restart active negotiations for a comprehensive agreement. Trump said Steve Biegun, U.S. special representative for North Korea, would lead the U.S. side.

""We just had a very, very good meeting with Chairman Kim and we’ve agreed that we’re going to designate a team, and the team will try and work out some deals, and again speed is not the object, we want to see if we can do a really comprehensive good deal.""

""Nobody knows how things go, but certainly this was a great day. This was a very legendary, very historic day,"" Trump said.

""It will be more historic if something comes of it, something very important, but a lot has already come of it,"" Trump continued, pointing to the relationships that have been built through engaging directly with the North Koreans and claimed it was a ""fiery mess"" during the previous administration.

Prior to sitting down for their extended talk, the president said he would be inviting Kim to visit him at the White House.

""If it was not for the excellent relationship between us, it would not have been possible,"" Kim said during the bilateral.

Trump then spoke and first complimented the strength of Kim's voice.

""You hear the power of that voice, nobody's heard the voice before, he doesn't do news conferences, in case you haven't noticed, and this was a special moment,"" Trump said.

""This is an historic moment, the fact that we're meeting,"" Trump continued.

The president then thanked Kim for not turning down his invitation to meet at the border, because ""if he didn't show up, the press was going to make us both look bad.""

AP Photo/Susan Walsh

""You made us both look good and I appreciate it,"" Trump said.

""It was an honor that you asked me to step over that line, and I was proud to step over that line. I thought you might do that, I wasn't sure, but I was ready to do it, and I want to thank you, it was great, very historic,"" Trump said.

Trump arrived at the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ) just before 2 a.m. Eastern time in a prelude to a historic meeting with Kim. Trump visited an observation tower, looking into the secluded North, where many U.S. presidents have stopped before.

But unlike previous presidents, Trump later met with Kim at Panmunjeom, the so-called Peace Village, on the border between the two countries and possibly cross over the line and become the first-ever president to visit North Korea.

Trump made brief comments from the overlook: ""After our first summit, all the danger went away,"" Trump claimed. ""I say that for the press, when they say there's been no difference. There's been a tremendous difference.""

He visited U.S. troops at the border afterward, was given the gift of a jacket and signed the wall as has become tradition for presidents.

Just hours before, Trump announced he was set to travel to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea at a joint press conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Moon joined Trump in his visit to the border.

""I’ll be meeting with Chairman Kim I look forward to it very much. I look forward to seeing him, we’ve developed a very good relationship,"" Trump said at the press conference. ""We understand each other. I do believe he understands me and I think I maybe understand him. And sometimes that can lead to very good things.""

""I put out the word and he got back, and he wanted to do it from the beginning and so did I,"" Trump continued.

Expanding on his decision Saturday to extend a last-minute invite to Kim to meet him at the DMZ, Trump said the trip was ""something I planned long ago, but had the idea yesterday, to maybe, say 'hello,' just shake and quickly say 'hello.'""

Asked about the possibility of a third summit, Trump said he'd like to see what happens Sunday before talking about another meeting.

""Let’s see what happens today before we start thinking about that,"" Trump said.

The president also claimed -- falsely -- that former President Barack Obama sought to meet with Kim and that he was rebuffed.

""The Obama administration was begging for a meeting, there were begging for meetings constantly, and Chairman Kim would not meet him,"" Trump claimed.

The president continued to express optimism about the state of relations with North Korea and insisted that important progress has been made through both of his previous summits with Kim.

""I'm not in a rush,"" Trump said. ""If you're in a rush you get yourself in trouble.""

On Sunday morning in South Korea, Trump said that Kim ""very much wants to"" meet, and that the two countries are ""trying to work it out. Both want to do it.""

""Very short, it would be very short, virtually a handshake,"" Trump said. ""But that’s OK. A handshake means a lot.""

AP Photo/Susan Walsh

Trump has even raised the possibility of stepping across the border into North Korea -- something no previous U.S. president has done.

""Sure, I would. I would. I'd feel very comfortable doing that. I would have no problem,"" Trump said earlier in his Asia trip.

The two leaders have met on two occasions. Their most recent meeting in February in Hanoi, Vietnam, failed to produce an agreement toward the goal of North Koreas' denuclearization.

Trump announced yesterday that he would be traveling to the DMZ during his visit to South Korea and issued an impromptu Twitter invitation to the North Korean leader to have a brief visit and share a handshake.

After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2019

Since that time, a senior administration official said that the governments of the United States, North Korea and South Korea have been in communication to prepare for the prospective meeting.

In remarks Sunday morning at a breakfast with Korean business leaders, President Trump suggested that a meeting was likely to happen.

""I understand they want to meet and I’d love to say hello,"" Trump said.

Trump is also expected to meet with U.S. service members following his brief meeting with Kim.

Asked by ABC News’ Jonathan Karl in a press conference Saturday if it will be a bad sign if the North Korean leader doesn’t take him up on his offer to meet, the president said it would not.

""No,"" Trump told Karl. ""Of course, I thought of that because I know if he didn’t, everybody is going to say, ‘Oh, he was stood up by Chairman Kim.’ No, I understood that.""

The president went on to say that the North Korean leader must follow him on Twitter, because U.S. officials ""got a call very quickly"" after he sent out his tweet.

The president said if the meeting does happen, it would only be a brief one.

""We'll see each other for two minutes,"" Trump said. ""That will be fine."""
Trump administration drops bid to put citizenship question on 2020 Census,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'Tara Bahrampour', 'Ann E. Marimow', 'The Washington Post', 'This Story Was Originally Published At Washingtonpost.Com.']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/2020-census-will-not-include-citizenship-question-doj-confirms/,"WASHINGTON – The Trump administration has dropped plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, the Justice Department said Tuesday, just days after the Supreme Court described the rationale for the question as “contrived.”

The decision was made after officials determined that there would not be enough time to continue the legal battle and meet the printing deadlines for the census questionnaire, according to people familiar with the matter.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Tuesday that “I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.”

The decision to eliminate the question was a victory for civil rights advocates concerned that the query would lead to an inaccurate count of immigrant communities that could skew political representation and federal funding.

“In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, the government had no choice but to proceed with printing the 2020 census forms without a citizenship question. Everyone in America counts in the census, and today’s decision means we all will,” said Dale Ho of the American Civil Liberties Union, the lawyer who argued the Supreme Court case.

The fate of the question has been the subject of legal and political wrangling since March 2018, when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced he planned to add it to the decennial survey, sparking a half-dozen lawsuits from states, cities, civil rights groups and others.

Just last week, President Donald Trump responded to the Supreme Court’s ruling temporarily blocking the question by saying he would seek to delay the census to give administration officials time to come up with a better explanation for why it should include a citizenship question.

Trump expressed disbelief again on Monday that the question could not be included and told reporters at the White House, “I think it’s very important – to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal? I think there’s a big difference, to me, between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.”

Instead of a delay, government lawyers by email notified those challenging the planned Census question of the administration’s decision to proceed without it.

The Census Bureau has started printing the questionnaires without the question, Ross said. He added that his “focus, and that of the bureau and the entire department, is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

Soon after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration, Justice Department officials said privately they determined they would have no choice but to drop the question from the 2020 census.

That is because the printer had a deadline that was merely days away, and officials knew there was no way that the court process could resolve favorably for them before that deadline, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss still pending litigation.

When Trump tweeted that he would explore delaying the census, some Justice Department officials were left scratching their heads, they said, because such a move would be legally impossible.

The White House asked the Justice Department how it might be able to add the question, including by possibly delaying the census, and the department explained that it wasn’t realistic or tenable, given time constraints and the Supreme Court’s ruling, said a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke under condition of anonymity because the person wasn’t authorized to speak about it publicly.

“I have to think that sanity prevailed with respect to the incredible disruption to our representational democracy that delaying the census would have caused,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee. “I doubt anyone at the Justice or Commerce departments could figure out how to overcome the constitutional and statutory hurdles.”

Critics of the question, including some inside the Census Bureau, said it could cause an undercount of millions of people in immigrant communities who would be afraid to return the form, leading to an inaccurate that could skew representation and apportionment in favor of Republican areas.

The government had said it needed the question in order to enforce the Voting Rights Act, and Ross initially told Congress he decided to add it in response to a December 2017 request from the Justice Department. But documents uncovered in the lawsuits suggested Ross was pushing for it months earlier, and that he pressed the Justice Department to issue the request.

In the Supreme Court’s splintered ruling Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that federal agencies must offer “genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” He was joined in by the court’s four liberal justices.

Data from the census, which every U.S. household is required to fill out, is used by businesses and by the government to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars in federal spending per year; it is also used to determine Congressional apportionment and redistricting. The form that goes to all households has not included a question related to citizenship since 1950.

Thomas Wolf, of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said Tuesday that the push to include such a question would have a lasting impact.

“Even if the citizenship question is dead, it has left damage in its wake. The question has not only distracted necessary attention for over a year from other key aspects of census preparation, but also raised widespread fears about the safety of participating in the census,” Wolf said in an e-mail.

“The administration must refocus its attention immediately on making sure that every person in this country is counted. It can start by launching a nation-wide advertising campaign to ensure everyone that no citizenship question will appear on the 2020 Census.”

The notice from the government came just hours before lawyers were scheduled for a conference call in a separate case in Maryland also challenging the Census question.

Judge George Hazel, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland in Greenbelt, was one of three federal judges who ruled earlier this year against the question, saying Ross violated administrative law and the enumeration clause of the Constitution by proposing to ask the citizenship status of household members on the form.

The issues before Hazel were different from those heard by the Supreme Court. The government’s path to adding the question had become more difficult in May after new evidence emerged showing a deceased Republican redistricting strategist had been in touch with some administration officials over adding the question.

The strategist, Thomas Hofeller, was author of a 2015 study that found adding the question would likely help Republicans and white voters in subsequent redistricting decisions; he had also been in touch with a census official about adding a citizenship question to the form, according to files found on hard drives belonging to him.

Hazel had ruled that plaintiffs had not provided sufficient evidence for charges that the government had conspired or intended to discriminate when it added the question, and plaintiffs had appealed.

After the Hofeller evidence emerged, however, Hazel said the new evidence merited further consideration, and a federal appeals court returned the case to his court. The Maryland case could have tied up the question in a separate legal battle that might have eventually reached the Supreme Court in its own right.

During the call with Hazel on Tuesday, government lawyers did not explain why the citizenship question was pulled off the table, said Denise Hulett, senior counsel with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who also was on the call.

She said Hazel asked for a written stipulation by Monday in the case before him that the Commerce Department “has given up its fight entirely” to include the question in the 2020 count.

Shankar Duraiswamy, the lead attorney in the Maryland case, called the Trump administration’s reversal Tuesday a victory for American democracy.

“A citizenship question would have risked a massive undercount in areas with large numbers of Latinos and immigrants, depriving them of their right to equal political representation and fair share of federal funding,” he said in an email.
