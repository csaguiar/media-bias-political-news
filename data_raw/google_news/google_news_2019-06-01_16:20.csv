"William Barr vs. Robert Mueller, explained",https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/1/18647362/mueller-barr-trump-obstruction-law,"Major disagreements between Robert Mueller and Attorney General William Barr have spilled out into public this week, with the dispute focusing on the handling of the investigation of President Trump for potential obstruction of justice.

On Wednesday, Mueller announced his resignation and made his first-ever public statement on the investigation, giving a summary of his conclusions that was conspicuously different from Barr’s. After that, Barr responded, defending his own decisions in an hour-long interview with CBS This Morning.

Discrepancies between Barr and Mueller have simmered for some time. Barr’s initial letter describing Mueller’s findings gave a starkly incomplete picture that seemed much rosier for Trump than the full report. And he has since adopted Trump’s line that the investigation found “there was in fact no collusion.” (Mueller says there was “insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.”)

But the heart of the current dispute relates to the highly unusual way the obstruction investigation wrapped up — with Mueller deciding not to reach a conclusion on whether Trump broke the law, and with Barr then deciding to reach the conclusion that he didn’t.

Barr is now taking aim at several of Mueller’s choices. He says Mueller “could’ve reached a decision” on whether Trump committed crimes. He says he disagrees with Mueller’s application of obstruction statutes to certain of Trump’s acts. And he says that even if you accept Mueller’s interpretation of obstruction law, the evidence against Trump was “deficient” in every single episode.

What Mueller did

Tasked with investigating President Trump for potentially attempting to obstruct the Russia investigation, Mueller conducted a thorough investigation into 11 particular “episodes” involving the president (including the firing of James Comey as FBI director, Trump’s conduct toward witnesses like Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen, and Trump’s attempts to dismiss Mueller himself).

But Mueller also determined that he could not indict a sitting president because of existing Justice Department policy. “Charging the President with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider,” he said this week.

Still: even if Mueller couldn’t charge Trump, it seemed at least possible that he would wrap up his investigation with a judgment on whether the president broke the law.

So it came as a surprise to many when he chose not to do that. “We concluded that we would not reach a determination, one way or the other, about whether the president committed a crime,” Mueller said Wednesday. In part, his report explains, this is because it would be unfair to accuse the president of a crime when he can’t be charged and have the opportunity to clear his name at trial.

What Mueller did instead was lay out evidence and analysis about each of the potentially obstructive episodes involving Trump. Specifically, he examined whether Trump’s actions in each case met three elements common to obstruction statutes: 1) whether they were obstructive acts, 2) whether they had a nexus to an official proceeding, and 3) whether there was corrupt intent.

Often, Mueller’s analysis seemed quite damning. For some of the episodes, he said there was “substantial” evidence that all three of those elements applied; for others, his assessment was more mixed. But he never took the final step of clearly saying Trump broke the law or committed a crime in any instance.

Yet in one last twist, Mueller also said that if he had “confidence” that Trump “clearly did not commit obstruction of justice,” he would say so — and that he is “unable to reach that judgment.” So he implied that, at the very least, Trump’s conduct wasn’t obviously innocent.

What Barr did

As Mueller was wrapping up his work in March, he informed the Justice Department and its new attorney general, Barr, that he wouldn’t reach a judgment on whether Trump obstructed justice.

Barr has testified that he was “frankly surprised” to hear this, and he told CBS this week that he didn’t agree with that call. “He could’ve reached a conclusion. The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office but he could’ve reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity,” Barr said.

Then Mueller may have been surprised at what Barr did next — he decided to step into the void and issue his own conclusion on Trump’s conduct.

Barr says he worked with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and other Justice Department lawyers on this, and that there were two parts to their analysis.

First, he says, he offered up a different interpretation of how the obstruction statutes could be applied to Trump’s actions.

“We didn’t agree with the legal analysis — a lot of the legal analysis in the report. It did not reflect the views of the department. It was the views of a particular lawyer or lawyers and so we applied what we thought was the right law,” he told CBS.

Barr said that, for instance, the president’s firing of an FBI director is a “facially valid exercise of core presidential authority,” so the obstruction of justice statutes shouldn’t apply to it. (He made a similar argument last year in a memo before he got the attorney general job.)

Second, though, he says, he didn’t just “rely on” his team’s alternate interpretation of how the obstruction statutes should be applied — he also examined whether, under Mueller’s interpretation of the obstruction laws, Trump’s actions in any instance satisfied all three elements of the statute (that they were obstructive acts, that they had a nexus to an official proceeding, and that they were done with corrupt intent).

For every single one, Barr said, “we thought long and hard about it, we looked at the facts and we didn’t feel the government could establish obstruction.”

It’s certainly a convenient conclusion for Trump. And it’s curious that we actually haven’t seen any of Barr’s analysis on these topics, beyond his brief letter to Congress.

What are Barr’s responses to the seemingly damning analysis Mueller gave about certain episodes? Did he in fact think “long and hard” about it and seriously study Mueller’s evidence and arguments? Or was it more of a hasty “nothing to see here” whitewash?

How can a president be held accountable for lawbreaking?

Looming over all this are the tremendously important issues of what is to be done when the president of the United States may have committed criminal wrongdoing — and whether the president is in fact above the law.

Currently, there’s no easy answer to this within the US government. The Justice Department, which is charged with investigating and enforcing federal law, is to at least some extent subordinate to the president and run by his appointees. And DOJ has taken the position that it cannot indict a sitting president.

Congress, meanwhile, has the constitutional authority to impeach and remove a president. But it doesn’t really have the ability or expertise to conduct a serious criminal investigation.

Now, Mueller’s role as a Justice Department special counsel required him to submit “a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached” to the attorney general (not to Congress).

Still, some have speculated that Mueller may have truly intended his report for Congress to act on. Under this interpretation, Mueller gathered facts and did the analysis, but one reason for his refusal to take the final step and say that Trump’s conduct was criminal was because he believed that was Congress’s job.

Mueller has never outright said he intended any such thing. But in his remarks Wednesday, the special counsel did mention how “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting President of wrongdoing.”

Barr, however, recoiled at this very concept “The Department of Justice doesn’t use our powers of investigating crimes as an adjunct to Congress,” he told CBS. “Congress is a separate branch of government and they can, you know, they have processes, we have our processes. Ours are related to the criminal justice process. We are not an extension of Congress’s investigative powers.”

And these arguments aren’t baseless. Mueller had no actual obligation or authority under the law to give his final report to Congress, and certainly not to make an impeachment referral. Barr’s critique is that Mueller was a Justice Department special counsel investigating violations of federal criminal law. And the impeachment process has nothing to do with federal criminal law. So why should the special counsel be involved in it?

In any case, Barr did choose to release the report anyway, and Congress now has the ability to decide how it wants to proceed. But the question remains: What should the Justice Department do when it thinks the president may have violated federal criminal law? This whole messy process hasn’t resulted in any clear answer."
Trump Administration Strips India of Special Trade Status,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Ana Swanson', 'Vindu Goel']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/business/trump-india-trade.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Friday that it was stripping India of a special status that exempts billions of dollars of its products from American tariffs, part of a deepening clash over India’s protections for its market.

The White House said that it would terminate India’s preferential market access to the United States as of June 5. The notice claimed that India had not given the United States “equitable and reasonable access to its markets.”

The administration said that it would also apply to India tariffs on solar panels and washers that President Trump announced last year, suspending an exemption it had granted to certain developing countries.

The measure will hit some Indian exporters of products like textiles, jewelry, auto parts and agricultural products, and aggravate tensions between the United States and a country the Trump administration has described as an ally to counter China."
Nunes demands public release of Mueller's 'backup and source documentation',https://www.politico.com,"['Kyle Cheney', 'Katie Galioto']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/nunes-mueller-backup-source-documentation-1349437,"Rep. Devin Nunes argued that accessing Robert Mueller's ""backup and source documentation"" would expose Mueller's effort as a ""fraud."" | Drew Angerer/Getty Images congress Nunes demands public release of Mueller's 'backup and source documentation'

Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, called Friday for the public release of all of special counsel Robert Mueller's ""backup and source documentation,"" a call that goes even further than most Democrats' demands for more transparency around Mueller's report.

Though most Republicans in Congress have lambasted Democrats for continuing to demand access to Mueller's underlying files, Nunes (R-Calif.) argued that accessing those documents — and making them public — would expose Mueller's effort as a ""fraud."" Democrats say they want the same materials because they'll aid investigations into Mueller's evidence that President Donald Trump repeatedly attempted to obstruct his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Story Continued Below

Nunes' argument followed the release by prosecutors of a voicemail left by one of Trump's attorneys in 2017 with a lawyer for Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who became a crucial cooperator for Mueller. The voicemail from Dowd came on the eve of Flynn's decision to abandon a joint defense agreement with Trump and begin working with Mueller. In his report's volume on obstruction of justice, Mueller highlighted excerpts of the voicemail noting that Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, asked for a heads up on any information that ""implicates the president"" and mentioned Trump's ""feelings toward Flynn.""

On Friday, Mueller's team released a full transcript of the voicemail on the order of a federal judge. In the fuller transcript, Dowd had indicated he wanted a heads up ""not only for the president but for the country.""

""Um, just for the sake of...protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any...confidential information,"" Dowd said, according to the transcript.

Nunes pointed to the omission of those lines from Mueller's report as proof of malfeasance on Mueller's part and said it justifies the public release of all of Mueller's backup information.

""This is why we need all backup and source documentation for the #muellerdossier released publicly. It’s all a fraud..."" Nunes tweeted.

Mueller highlighted Dowd's voicemail as part of his evidence suggesting Trump or his allies may have attempted to influence Flynn's willingness to cooperate with investigators. Mueller's argument that Dowd had conveyed Trump's continued warm feelings toward Flynn — combined with public and private efforts by Trump to encourage Flynn to stay strong — could have affected Flynn's willingness to cooperate, or limited the extent of his willingness to help. But Mueller also noted that attorney-client privilege issues prevented him from learning whether Trump ""was personally involved in or knew about"" Dowd's outreach.

Notably, Democrats have met fierce criticism from Republicans for making similar demands. They've accused Democrats of trying to relitigate Mueller's findings and Trump has attacked them repeatedly as seeking a ""do-over"" of Mueller's work. He asserted executive privilege earlier this month at the urging of Attorney General William Barr to shield Mueller's underlying evidence from efforts by Congress to obtain them.

It's not the first time Nunes has broken from the GOP message on the Mueller report. He signed two joint letters with Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) demanding access to all of Mueller's files for the committee, even threatening to subpoena for them if Barr didn't cooperate. Schiff issued that subpoena earlier this month."
Opinion | The High Church of the Low Blow,https://www.nytimes.com,['Bret Stephens'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/opinion/sohrab-ahmari-conservative.html,"Until recently, Sohrab Ahmari was a mainstream conservative — urbane, intelligent and unfailingly good-humored — who wrote energetic defenses of classical liberalism against its enemies on both the progressive left and populist right, including Donald Trump. For several years he was also my colleague, and in some ways my protégé, at the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal.

Then Ahmari saw the light.

To be the polite conservative — the kind who presents well at, say, the Aspen Ideas Festival — was, Ahmari decided, to be a sucker. It was to play by the house rules of the culturally dominant left, in which the house always has the advantage and usually wins the game. It was to bid for the good opinion of people who will never think of conservatism as anything other than the malignant spawn of avarice and stupidity.

From then on it would be no more Mr. Nice Conservative for Ahmari, an immigrant from Iran who is now the opinion editor of The New York Post and an ardent convert to Catholicism. His enemies weren’t just on the left, but also on the insufficiently right. And by insufficient, Ahmari wasn’t thinking only of ideology. He also meant those deficient in the kind of personal nastiness that is supposed to be a virtue in the right’s death struggle against progressive orthodoxies.

All this is now spelled out by Ahmari in a much-discussed (at least on the right) new essay titled “Against David Frenchism,” published in the Catholic magazine “First Things.” For those unfamiliar with the name, David French is a longtime contributor to National Review, a legal advocate for religious liberty and free speech, an evangelical Christian, and a recipient of the Bronze Star for his service in Iraq."

Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hawley-cruz-urge-trump-to-nix-nomination-of-lawyer-catholic-kkk-views,"Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz -- both Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- are calling on President Trump to withdraw the nomination of a lawyer for a lifetime federal court appointment, accusing the nominee of opposing religious freedom and expressing anti-Catholic views.

The nomination of Michael S. Bogren, a Michigan lawyer who was nominated to be a district judge for the District Court for the Western District of Michigan, has been met with fierce conservative resistance for the candidate's likening of religious beliefs to the racist views of the Ku Klux Klan.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FIGHTS BACK AGAINST LONE JUDGES NIXING POLICIES ‘WITH THE STROKE OF THE PEN’

Hawley, a Missouri Republican and a former state attorney general, wrote in an op-ed for the National Review that “the right to religious free exercise enshrined in the First Amendment is the fundamental freedom, and we need judges who will uphold it,” adding that “Michael Bogren’s answers are not acceptable for a judicial nominee. We can and must do better.”

Cruz, a Texas Republican, issued his view in a Twitter message Friday.

“Agree. I’m a NO,"" the senator wrote. ""And POTUS should withdraw this nomination.""

Their opposition stems from Bogren arguing in court against a Roman Catholic farmer who opposed same-sex weddings on his farm, saying such marriages violated his religious beliefs.

He went on to compare his opposition to same-sex weddings on the farm to a KKK member refusing to allow an interracial wedding.

Hawley, a firebrand freshman senator, grilled Bogren on the case last week, asking him whether he still believes a “Catholic family’s pointing to the teachings of their church is equivalent to a KKK member invoking Christianity.”

Bogren said, “I stand by those comparisons,” during the exchange, though noted that “this is not ideological.”

MCCONNELL VOWS TO FILL ANY SUPREME COURT VACANCY IN 2020, RANKLING DEMS

Hawley quoted Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy to emphasize why Bogren’s comparison particularly struck a nerve and why it’s important to continue the scrutiny.

""Let me remind you of a case in the United States Supreme Court that you would be obliged to uphold, the Masterpiece Cake Shop case,” the senator said.

In Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, the Supreme Court decided 7-2 in June 2018 in favor of a Colorado baker who had refused to serve a same-sex couple, citing his religious beliefs.

“In that case, Justice Kennedy wrote for a majority of the court that a government official who compared the petitioner’s invocation of a sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the Holocaust ‘demonstrated impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious belief that motivated his objection.’”

He added: “Your language comparing a Catholic family’s beliefs to the KKK and to the teachings of radical Islam seems to me to be exactly on point with what Justice Kennedy is saying here.”

In addition to Cruz and Hawley, more than 70 prominent conservatives signed a letter opposing Bogren's confirmation.

“We believe that his suspect judicial philosophy as it relates to America’s First Freedom renders him unqualified for this position. We urge that his nomination be withdrawn,” read the letter by Conservative Action Project, a group that includes former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, former U.S. Sen.

'Bare minimum': Britain decides no palace stay or parliamentary speech for Trump in low-key state visit,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bare-minimum-britain-decides-no-palace-stay-or-parliamentary-speech-for-trump-in-low-key-state-visit,"Opening his speech to British parliamentarians in 2011, President Barack Obama said, “I have known few greater honors than the opportunity to address the Mother of Parliaments at Westminster Hall.""

It is an honor that will not be extended to President Trump next week during his first state visit to Britain, one of a number of differences from the trips made by his predecessors.

British and American officials have played down concerns about protests and insist that Trump is being afforded every bit of the usual hospitality — from dinner with the queen to bilateral talks with Theresa May, the prime minister.

But royal watchers said the Trumps will be missing out on many of the trappings of a state visit, such as staying at Buckingham Palace. “Not being invited to speak before Parliament is testament to the fact they know he is going to be rude and there’s going to be massive protests,"" said Marlene Koenig, an author and expert on British and European royalty.

“They are doing the bare minimum of what they would do for a state visit of a major ally.""

Rather than stayinhg with the Queen, Trump will be put up at Winfield House, residence of Woody Johnson, the United States ambassador to the Court of St James's. Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, was appointed by Trump. Winfield House, a neo-Georgian manion in Regent's Park, has the advantage of being set in 12 acres of grounds, safely away from demonstrators.

Several honors afforded visiting American presidents or other heads of state will be missing.

He will not get the usual welcome in Horse Guards Parade, the grand parade ground in central London where visiting heads of state are usually invited to inspect the honor guard with the queen before a carriage procession to Buckingham Palace.

Instead, he will follow the example of President George W. Bush, who was given his royal welcome in the garden of Buckingham Palace in 2003 because of fears protesters would line the route through London. There, Trump will inspect the guard of honor, comprising the Nijmegen Company Grenadier Guards, with Prince Charles.

The reception stands in contrast to the visit of President John F. Kennedy in 1961. Then, some half a million cheering people gathered simply to catch a glimpse of him and his wife Jackie.

Trump will not get to stay at Buckingham Palace with the Queen. Both Bush and Obama, the only two American presidents to have been granted official state visits, stayed at the royal residence, but Trump has been told that renovations to the east wing of the palace meant its guest rooms were out of service.

American officials were eager to play down any hint of a snub and said the timing of the visit — to coincide with the 75th anniversary of D-Day — illustrated the strong bonds between the two countries. “It gives evidence to the fact that the special relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. is real and enduring,” said a senior administration official. “As the president himself has said, ‘It's a bond like no other.’”

The run-up to this visit featured speculation about whether Trump would be invited to address the British Parliament.

In the end, the speaker — the figure who presides over the House of Commons and who had previously said Trump’s attendance would run counter to Parliament’s longstanding opposition to sexism and racism — said he had not been asked by British officials to host the president. Presidents Obama, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton all addressed Parliament.

A U.K. official said Trump had not requested to address Parliament. ""The president not asking to do that is the norm,"" he said. On both sides of the Atlantic, a mutually-convenient cover story of Trump not being asked to be invited in order to avoid being told he will not be invited appears to have been adopted.

But protesters say they can already claim a victory in ensuring Trump will not address MPs and Lords.

“Our voices are being heard,” said Mohammed Ateek, a Syrian refugee and a spokesman for the Stop Trump Coalition. “What a shame if they had allowed him to address Parliament, which stands up for democracy.

“We contributed to this because if there were no voices being raised against Trump, then they would have said, why not?”

Previous visits have sometimes reflected the warm relations between individual leaders.

In 1982 the queen invited Ronald Reagan to stay with her at Windsor Castle and took him horse riding. A decade late, Bill and Hillary Clinton were treated to a night aboard the royal yacht Britannia.

And in 2011, Obama grilled sausages with David Cameron in the garden of Number 10 during an event for British and American service personnel."

Agents will be ""side-by-side"" with local Guatemalan authorities, deployed to locations where US law enforcement has not traditionally operated, according to a senior DHS official.

This is a unique surge of DHS personnel to Guatemala, with a ""significant increase"" in US law enforcement presence in the country, said acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.

The deployment of DHS officers follows an agreement signed earlier this week between the US and Guatemalan governments. It comes as the administration is trying to find a way to stem the influx of migrant families, mostly from Central America, through Mexico to the US.

The number of migrants illegally crossing the the southern US border has been on a steady upswing, resulting in dangerous overcrowding in US holding facilities at the border. The month of May is on pace to have the highest number of border crossings in over 12 years, according to McAleenan.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Federal prosecutors on Friday declined to make public transcripts of recorded conversations between Michael Flynn and Russia’s ambassador to the United States in December 2016, despite a judge’s order.

In a court filing Friday, the Justice Department wrote that it did not rely on such recordings to establish Flynn’s guilt or determine a recommendation for his sentencing.

Prosecutors also failed to release an unredacted version of portions of the Mueller report related to Flynn that the judge had ordered be made public.

Flynn, who served briefly as President Trump’s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and he cooperated with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. He is awaiting sentencing.

The government’s unusual response came after U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in Washington ordered earlier in May that the Justice Department make public various materials related to the case, including transcripts of any audio recordings of Flynn, such as his conversations with Russian officials.

[Judge orders public release of what Michael Flynn said in call to Russian ambassador]

Prosecutors provided one item that Sullivan ordered be released: a transcript of a voice mail left by an attorney for Trump, much of which had already appeared in Mueller’s report. It is unclear how the judge will react to the government’s noncompliance with other elements of his order. Late last year, Sullivan postponed Flynn’s sentencing after angrily lambasting the former national security adviser for his actions, saying, “Arguably, you sold your country out.”

While Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak were described in Mueller’s report and in court documents, the exact words the two men used have not been revealed. U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the existence of recordings, which are classified.

Sullivan made clear he wanted the full transcript of Flynn’s calls to be shared with the public, although he did not provide his reasoning. The Justice Department’s response appeared to duck that order.

Prosecutors Brandon L. Van Grack of the Justice Department’s national security division, who was formerly on Mueller’s team, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Curtis of Washington provided little explanation as to why they were not turning over the transcripts but indicated that the judge had asked for material that was not relevant to Flynn’s eventual sentencing.

In a single line addressing Sullivan’s order, prosecutors wrote that the government “is not relying on any other recordings, of any person, for purposes of establishing the defendant’s guilt or determining his sentence, nor are there any other recordings that are part of the sentencing record.”

Sullivan’s request was atypical, some legal experts said, in that he demanded the release of classified records that prosecutors did not use to prove Flynn’s guilt.

Still, some former prosecutors said the government’s response was also notably spare.

“I’m sure they spent a ton of time thinking about how to do this — to protect intelligence equities, to protect their case, to try not to annoy the judge, to balance all those interests,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney in Michigan.

She noted that although there was no public indication that prosecutors had filed additional material under seal, it was possible that they did.

“If they’re simply trying to avoid the order by sidestepping it and saying ‘it’s not necessary to your sentencing decision,’ judges tend not to be satisfied with such a response,” she added.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington declined to comment.

The transcripts of the Flynn-Kisylak calls would provide a rare glimpse into the power of American surveillance to capture the private discussions of foreign emissaries — and an intimate look at a budding relationship between a top Russian official and one of the president-elect’s most trusted lieutenants in the weeks before Trump took office.

Flynn’s lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador made him the shortest-serving national security adviser in U.S. history: He spent just 24 days in the prestigious White House job.

Sullivan ordered the transcripts of Flynn’s conversations released two weeks ago after The Washington Post filed a motion seeking the release of redacted and sealed documents in the case. The Post argued that the public deserved to know more about the Trump adviser’s role in key events and the information he shared with investigators.

As part of his order, Sullivan had also given the government until Friday to release an unredacted version of portions of Mueller’s report dealing with Flynn.

In declining to release that, prosecutors wrote that the “limited remaining redactions pertain to sourcing of information, such as references to grand jury subpoenas.”

They provided no explanation other than to say that “all of the information in the Report that the defendant provided to the Special Counsel’s Office has been unredacted, as has all of the information in the Report that others provided about the defendant.”

The one item that the Justice Department made public on Sullivan’s order was a full transcript of a voice mail that John Dowd, a private attorney for Trump, left for Flynn lawyer Robert Kelner in November 2017.

Most of the voice mail was quoted in Mueller’s report, which described a message left by a personal counsel to Trump for a Flynn attorney after the former national security adviser began to cooperate with investigators. The special counsel scrutinized the message as part of his investigation into whether Trump sought to obstruct the Russia investigation.

The Trump counsel was Dowd, according to people familiar with the episode.

In the voice mail to Kelner, Dowd described himself as “sympathetic.”

“I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms,” he said, adding that if “there’s information that implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security issue.”

“So you know, ...we need some kind of heads up,” he added. “Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can, without you having to give up any...confidential information....remember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.”

In a statement Friday, Dowd said there was never anything improper about his contact with Flynn’s lawyer and that he had never tried to discourage Flynn’s cooperation with the government.

“This is clearly a baseless, political document designed to smear and damage the reputation of counsel and innocent people,” Dowd said of the special counsel report.

""It's an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,"" Pompeo told reporters Thursday, adding the effort is focused on ""how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world how to engage on those important issues.""

The State Department has declined to comment beyond Pompeo's remarks. But it did issue a public notice in the Federal Register on Thursday that says the body, named the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will provide Pompeo ""advice and recommendations concerning international human rights matters"" and meet about once a month.

""The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,"" according to the notice.

Use of the term ""natural law"" has concerned some advocacy groups and department staff, as it is interpreted in this case as ""God-given"" or religiously-based rights that affect issues like sexuality, abortion rights, and more. In particular, the phrase has been prominent in the work of Princeton professor Robert George.

George has played a prominent role in the creation of the commission, according to a source familiar with the plans for the commission. George, co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, a nonprofit that advocates against same-sex marriage, is among the 15 academics recommended to make up the panel, according to the source.

Author of the 1999 book ""In Defense of Natural Law,"" where he argued against homosexuality and abortion rights and in favor of religious liberty, George also wrote the original concept note that outlined a vision for the commission, the source said.

The commission ""is absolutely about those issues, but it's not explicit in the paper,"" the source said. ""It questions whether and which human rights are universal.""

George did not respond to a request for comment.

Dr. Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning, is listed as the top official on the Federal Register notice. Skinner, who leads the department's long-term foreign policy strategy team, recently raised eyebrows by describing the U.S. rivalry with China as a clash of civilizations and ""the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.""

Along with George and Skinner, the full list of participants has been recommended to the Secretary, but he still has to approve the final list. As part of the process, however, the department had to publish the Federal Register notice, which is dated May 22.

Igniting further concern about the project is the fact that the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor was not consulted in the process, two sources told ABC News.

""The wording of the Commission's mandate raised eyebrows with human rights advocates and congressional staff. The fact that it was announced with no prior outreach to or input from the human rights community immediately raised concerns over its motives... [and] the State Department already has a well-defined understanding of how to advance human rights and maintains several offices dedicated to various human rights issues,"" said Rob Berschinski, who served as deputy assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, or DRL, in the Obama administration.

Pompeo said Thursday the project is ""separate"" from DRL, but ""deeply connected to the work that not only DRL does, but that the entire State Department does around the world.""

Promoting the right to religious freedom has been a high priority for Pompeo, who will host his second summit on the topic this July. But he and the Trump administration, in general, have been criticized for pulling punches on U.S. partners over their human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for example, have been embraced by the top Trump officials despite their crackdowns on political opposition, women's rights activists, and NGOs.

""If the administration truly wants to engage in a meaningful dialogue about respecting human rights, then we are happy to have that discussion. But the fact that this panel was announced without details or consultation with human rights experts suggests that this may be just another instrument to negate rights, rather than protect them,"" said Tarah Demant, director of Amnesty International's Gender, Sexuality, and Identity program."
Migrants at overcrowded border facilities may become violent: DHS watchdog,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/01/migrants-at-overcrowded-border-facilities-may-become-violent-dhs-watchdog/,"Migrants seeking asylum and being held at an overcrowded US Border Patrol facility in Texas could become violent due to the inhumane conditions, an internal Department of Homeland Security watchdog found.

The El Paso Del Norte Processing Center in West Texas had packed 900 people into a building meant to hold just 125 when the agency’s inspector general made a surprise visit to the facility in early May, according to a report released Friday.

One cell built to hold 12 people contained 76 migrants, forcing detainees to stand on toilets to find room to breathe.

“Border Patrol management on site said there is an ongoing concern that rising tensions among detainees could turn violent,” the report found.

On Wednesday, Border Patrol caught 1,036 migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border near El Paso —largest single group ever."
Border Patrol holding 900 at facility fit for 125 in situation that ‘could turn violent’,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,"['U.S. Department Of Homeland Security', 'Office Of Inspector General']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-holding-900-at-facility-fit-for-125-in-situation-that-could-turn-violent,"A government watchdog is warning of a potentially “violent” situation at one Border Patrol station on the U.S.-Mexico border where migrants are held in unsafe conditions. Even so, Homeland Security officials are not planning changes anytime soon.

The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General released a report Friday that found “dangerous overcrowding” among adults being held at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center in West Texas.

During an unannounced trip to the border May 7 to 8, Inspector General Office workers observed 900 people being held at a facility where the maximum capacity is 125 people.

Inspectors peered into cells and found 76 people in one fit for a dozen people. Another cell suitable for eight people held 41. A third cell with capacity for 35 was holding 155 people.

“Border Patrol agents told us some of the detainees had been held in standing-room-only conditions for days or weeks,” the inspector general report states.

CBP’s 2015 National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search standards state that “under no circumstances should the maximum occupancy rate, as set by the fire marshal, be exceeded.”

The report revealed that not only were people being held in overcrowded conditions, they were also being held far longer than Border Patrol policy states detainees can be held before being transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“According to Border Patrol’s custody logs, there were 756 detainees on site when we visited PDT on May 7, 2019. Of those, 502 detainees (66 percent) had been held at PDT for longer than 72 hours [the limit outlined in TEDS], with 33 detainees (4 percent) held there for more than two weeks,” the report states.

CBP said hygiene conditions have sunk because detainees do not have adequate access to showers and clean clothing. Some men and women had been in “soiled clothing for days or weeks.” Because of the overcrowded cells, some were standing on toilets, making it difficult or impossible to use those facilities.

“We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety not just of the detainees, but also DHS agents and officers. Border Patrol management on site said there is a high incidence of illness among their staff,” the report states. “In addition, Border Patrol management on site said there is an ongoing concern that rising tensions among detainees could turn violent.”

An unspecified number of Border Patrol agents have opted to retire early while others were looking at leaving their jobs.

Agents at the station told the inspectors they called ICE on a daily basis hoping new beds would be available so that some detainees could be transferred out of the agency’s custody.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General

The El Paso Border Patrol sector is one of nine on the southern border. Since the start of fiscal 2019 in October, the region has seen the second-highest number of families illegally crossing: 98,052. That figure is up 1,816% from the same time the previous year.

The inspector general’s office said it informed acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about its concerns and was unsatisfied with his department’s response. DHS said it is building a tent near the facility that will be able to hold 500 people by July 31.

“We observed conditions at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center (PDT) Border Patrol facility that represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of detainees and DHS employees … Dangerous overcrowding among single adults in PDT requires immediate action,” inspectors wrote."
Exclusive: Watchdog finds detainees 'standing on toilets' for breathing room at border facility,https://www.wcpo.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.wcpo.com/news/national/exclusive-watchdog-finds-detainees-standing-on-toilets-for-breathing-room-at-border-facility,"The Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General has found ""dangerous overcrowding"" and unsanitary conditions at an El Paso, Texas, Border Patrol processing facility following an unannounced inspection, according to a not-yet released report obtained by CNN.

The IG found ""standing room only conditions"" at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center, which has a maximum capacity of 125 migrants. On May 7 and 8, logs indicated that there were ""approximately 750 and 900 detainees, respectively.""

""We also observed detainees standing on toilets in the cells to make room and gain breathing space, thus limiting access to the toilets,"" the report states.

A cell with a maximum capacity of 12 held 76 detainees, another with a maximum capacity of eight held 41, and another with a maximum capacity of 35 held 155, according to the report.

""(Customs and Border Protection) was struggling to maintain hygienic conditions in the holding cells. With limited access to showers and clean clothing, detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks,"" the report states.

""Corrective action is critical to the immediate health and safety needs of detainees, who cannot continue to be held in standing-room-only conditions for weeks until additional tents are constructed,"" the report adds.

The report comes as the number of migrants coming across the southern border continues to skyrocket. Roughly 109,000 people crossed in April, according to DHS , a number expected to increase in May.

President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to impose tariffs against Mexico if it doesn't step up enforcement, but it's not clear such actions would stem the flow of migrants.

The White House has asked Congress for $4.5 billion in emergency funding for the border.

Border Patrol agents worried about health, safety

The IG also said Border Patrol managers were concerned about an ""immediate risk to the health and safety"" of DHS agents and officers, and that employee morale is decreasing. There is a ""high incidence of illness"" among staff, the report states.

At the El Paso center and others, some employees eligible for retirement have accelerated their retirement dates, and others are looking for work elsewhere.

Five Border Patrol stations and two ports of entry in the El Paso area, including greater El Paso and eastern New Mexico, were part of the unannounced spot inspection visits at CBP holding facilities this month.

DHS and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan have been flagging the rising number of migrants and crowded condition at border camps.

""The current situation on the border represents an acute and worsening crisis. Our immigration is not equipped to accommodate a migration pattern like the one we are experiencing now,"" DHS said in a written response to the IG report.

""The speed with which illegal migrants are transiting through Mexico to reach our southern border is frustrating our best efforts to respond quickly,"" it added.

Recommendations

The IG recommends taking ""immediate steps"" to remedy the overcrowding at the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center.

DHS said that it ""has implemented a multi-layered approach"" that includes the construction of additional structures to house migrants, continued coordination with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and providing staff support.

The agency has constructed a soft-sided structure at El Paso Station that can hold 500 and has been operational since May 2, the response reads. The agency also plans to build additional structures, including an ""800 holding capacity modular facility"" at El Paso Station by July 31 and a permanent centralized processing center for approximately 1,800 people.

The estimated completion date is November 30, 2020."
Elizabeth Warren says she wants to make it legal to indict presidents,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647042/elizabeth-warren-trump-indictment-mueller,"Special counsel Robert Mueller said indicting President Donald Trump was “not an option” this week, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a sitting president from criminal indictments and prosecution.

Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says she would change the policy as president.

Warren, among the first major Democratic 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment, released a two-part proposal on presidential powers Friday. First, she called on Congress to pass a law clarifying that the president of the United States is subject to the same federal criminal code as everyone else. Second, she pledged to appoint an attorney general and assistant AG who would change current Justice Department policy around indicting sitting presidents.

“Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That’s not how our country is supposed to work,” Warren wrote. “I pledge to nominate an [Office of Legal Counsel] head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a President cannot be indicted for criminal behavior.”

On Wednesday, Mueller reiterated he was operating under DOJ policy, as presented by the Office of Legal Counsel, that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime.

“Under longstanding department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,” Mueller said. “That is unconstitutional. ... The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.”

To be clear, what Mueller is referring to is not something expressly written in the Constitution. It’s a large gray area in the nation’s body of law — which Warren says she would address as president.

The question of presidential immunity, briefly explained

The closest the Supreme Court has come to answering the question of presidential immunity recently is a 1997 ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which maintained that a president is subject to civil lawsuits. But whether a sitting president can be subject to criminal prosecution remains an unanswered question in the courts.

Upon review in 1973 and again in 2000, OLC concluded that the best way to address criminal charges is to wait until a president leaves office, leaving impeachment as the avenue for accountability.

As Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained, the most famous argument in favor of making presidents immune from criminal prosecution is from a 1997 law review article by Yale constitutional law professor Akhil Amar and a then-student of his, Brian Kalt, who’s now a law professor at Michigan State University:

Amar and Kalt argue that the president is a unique official, as the sole person ultimately in charge of the executive branch. “If he is arrested, so too is the executive branch of the government,” they write. This distinguishes him from a normal legislator or judge, who can be prosecuted, because there are plenty of other judges and legislators who can carry on their work. “Any distraction of the President from his duties is much more significant than similar distractions of these other, prosecutable officials, and has a much bigger impact on the well-being of the nation and all its People,” they conclude.

But even Kalt says this is unsettled territory. There is an argument to be made that the president should be subject to the same legal standard as everybody else, and that there are structures in place to address a president with “distractions” from his executive duties.

The investigation into Trump, and the special counsel report outlining evidence that Trump may have obstructed justice, has raised this issue into the forefront once again.

Spray cheese would count as food stamp staple under Trump administration proposal,https://www.cbsnews.com,"[""Caitlin O'Kane""]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposal-would-count-spray-cheese-beef-jerky-staple-foods/,"A new policy proposed by the Trump administration would allow foods like spray cheese to be considered ""staples"" for federal food stamps. Staple foods are important to the food stamps program, officially known as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), as regulations require SNAP retailers to stock a certain number of these food staples.

Loosening the rules would allow more retailers like convenience stores to accept SNAP benefits, even if they don't carry much in the way of fresh or healthy food.

A 2001 rule from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) required stores that take SNAP to carry a variety of foods in each of the four ""staple food"" categories: Meat, poultry, or fish; dairy products; bread or cereals; and vegetables or fruits. The stores must also carry at least one perishable item in at least two of the categories.

Under the new proposal, which was introduced in April, canned spray cheese or canned cheese dipping sauce would count as a dairy, pimento-stuffed olives would count as a vegetable or fruit, and beef jerky would count as a meat.

The Department of Agriculture said the new proposal ""provides greater regulatory flexibility to SNAP retailers, particularly small entities, in meeting the enhanced stocking requirements of the 2016 final rule.""

This Obama-era rule required SNAP stores carry a wider variety of foods in each group, increasing the number of products from three to seven in each staple group. Some food industry groups opposed this rule, believing small SNAP retailers ""would struggle to reach seven (7) varieties in the meat, poultry, or fish and dairy products staple food categories and such commenters suggested increasing flexibility for stores in these categories,"" the USDA writes.

The National Association of Convenience Stores, which lobbied for the proposed change, said ""meeting the new requirements can be difficult for convenience stores and other small format retailers who face constraints on supply and delivery.""

""On average, convenience stores get food deliveries 1-2 times a week, which can make stocking certain foods, particularly perishable foods, difficult,"" NACS writes on their website. The proposed changes would address this problem by giving retailers more flexibility, saving small businesses $500 over the course of five years, the Department of Agriculture said.

However, some consumer advocates blasted the proposal for putting retailers' interests ahead of the health and nutrition needs of poor families.

The Center for Science in the Public Interest is urging people to ""tell the U. S. Department of Agriculture that low-income families deserve to shop in stores that offer a meaningful variety of healthy staple foods.""

""You don't have to have a nutrition degree to know that canned spray cheese sauce is not a staple food,"" Margo Wootan, the group's vice president for nutrition, told Bloomberg News, which first reported on the proposal. She compared it to the notorious Reagan administration federal school lunch policy which sought to count ketchup as a vegetable.

""Those are not real food you could serve to your family for dinner,"" Wootan said.

The Department of Agriculture will be taking public comments on the proposal until June 7, when a decision to adopt the new rules will be made."
"William Barr dishes on what Huber, Horowitz, and Durham are investigating",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/william-barr-dishes-on-what-huber-horowitz-and-durham-are-investigating,"Attorney General William Barr gave his clearest explanation yet of the various “investigations of the investigators” being carried out by the Justice Department.

In an interview with CBS’s Jan Crawford, Barr described what tasks U.S. Attorney John Durham, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, and U.S. Attorney John Huber have been assigned regarding the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and the conduct of the DOJ and FBI as they carried it out.

Following pressure from congressional Republicans, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in March 2018 that Huber, a U.S. attorney from Utah, had been picked to review any misconduct by the DOJ and FBI. Some Republicans had been calling for a second special counsel.

Huber’s long-running inquiry has long been shrouded in mystery, but Barr revealed Horowitz and Durham have taken over most of his responsibilities.

Barr said “Huber had originally been asked to take a look at the FISA applications and the electronic surveillance” but that he then “stood back and put that on hold while the Office of Inspector General was conducting its review.”

Barr said Huber “was essentially on standby” in the event that Horowitz “referred a matter to him to be handled criminally.” That apparently has not been necessary, as Barr said “he has not been active on this front in recent months.” Barr said Durham would now be taking over Huber’s role in handling any criminal referrals from Horowitz and Huber’s involvement with Trump-Russia matters was done.

Sessions had also asked Huber in 2017 to look into issues related to the sale of Uranium One and allegations that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had been improperly involved in the process, as well as broader claims of corruption at the Clinton Foundation. Barr seemed to suggest that what evidence Huber found, if any, may soon be revealed.

""The other issues [Huber has] been working on relate to Hillary Clinton” are ""winding down and hopefully we'll be in a position to bring those to fruition,"" Barr said.

[ Also read: William Barr responds to critics of his reputation: 'Everyone dies']

In regards to the DOJ inspector general investigation, Barr said he would not describe Horowitz’s role as small, but rather as very specific. “He’s looking at a discrete area that is, you know, important, which is the use of electronic surveillance that was targeted at Carter Page,"" Barr said. Page was a former Trump campaign adviser who was surveilled by the DOJ and the FBI for months beginning in October 2016.

More than a year ago, in March 2018, Horowitz announced the start of the FISA abuse investigation, saying he was doing so following requests from Sessions and Republican members of Congress. GOP lawmakers alleged the DOJ and FBI had abused the FISA process and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their investigation and surveillance of Trump and his associates during the campaign and Trump's administration.

At the time, the inspector general's office said it would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) relating to a certain U.S. person.” That “certain U.S. person” is Page.

The DOJ inspector general also said it would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” The “source” is Christopher Steele, the British ex-spy whose unverified dossier was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants against Page.

Steele has communicated in recent days that he’d be willing to cooperate with Horowitz but not with Durham.

Barr, who has said that Horowitz’s probe should be ending in May or June, called him a “superb government official” in this latest interview, but pointed out that Horowitz “has limited powers.”

“He doesn't have the power to compel testimony, he doesn't have the power really to investigate beyond the current cast of characters at the Department of Justice,” Barr said. “His ability to get information from former officials or from other agencies outside the department is very limited.”

That’s why Barr said he selected Durham, a U.S. attorney for Connecticut, to head up DOJ’s newest inquiry. Barr was recently given broad declassification authority by Trump, and Durham will have greater investigative powers than Horowitz has at his disposal. Barr praised Durham, saying, “He has, over the years, been used by both Republican and Democratic attorneys general to investigate these kinds of activities. And he's always gotten the most laudatory feedback from his work. So there's no doubt in my mind that he's going he's going to conduct a thorough and fair review of this.”

Barr defended his scrutiny of the actions of the DOJ and FBI in his CBS interview, saying, “I think it's important to understand what basis there was for launching counterintelligence activities against a political campaign, which is the core of our … First Amendment liberties in this country.”

“And what was the predicate for it? What was the hurdle that had to be crossed? What was the process? Who had to approve it? And including the electronic surveillance, whatever electronic surveillance was done? And was everyone operating in their proper lane?” Barr asked."

State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law',https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Commission on Unalienable Rights will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a move that has surprised and puzzled human rights activists. | Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images foreign policy State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law'

The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.

The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.

Story Continued Below

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.

Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.

The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signal a religious component, experts said.

Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.

“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.

The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.

The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.

Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.

State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.

But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.

Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.

“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”

“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.

Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.

The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.

The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.

But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.

It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.

According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."
US Department of Energy is now referring to fossil fuels as “freedom gas”,https://arstechnica.com,['Megan Geuss'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/us-department-of-energy-is-now-referring-to-fossil-fuels-as-freedom-gas/,"Call it a rebranding of ""energy dominance.""

In a press release published on Tuesday, two Department of Energy officials used the terms ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" to replace your average, everyday term ""natural gas.""

The press release was fairly standard , announcing the expansion of a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal at the Freeport facility on Quintana Island, Texas. It would have gone unnoticed had an E&E News reporter not noted the unique metonymy ""molecules of US freedom.""

DOE Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg is quoted as saying, ""With the US in another year of record-setting natural gas production, I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of US freedom to be exported to the world.”

Also in the press release, US Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes refers to natural gas as ""freedom gas"" in his quote: “Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy.""

Slate notes that the term ""freedom gas"" seems to have originated from an event with DOE Secretary Rick Perry. Earlier this year, the secretary signed an order to double the amount of LNG exports to Europe, saying, “The United States is again delivering a form of freedom to the European continent. And rather than in the form of young American soldiers, it’s in the form of liquefied natural gas.”

A reporter at the order signing jokingly asked whether the LNG shipments should be called ""freedom gas,"" and Perry said, ""I think you may be correct in your observation.""

If the DOE is still running with the term as a joke, then the wit in the Energy Secretary's office is bone dry. Ars contacted the DOE to see if ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" are now going to be standard in department communication with the public. We are also curious if any potential drop in LNG exports could result in patriotism bloat. The DOE has not responded, though we'll update the story if it does.

Greenwald'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-why-bill-de-blasio-thinks-he-can-be-president-and-heres-why-hes-wrong,"When Mayor Bill de Blasio announced his bid for president, after months of mulling, New Yorkers—76 percent of whom had said he shouldn’t run— shrugged. That’s to be expected. While being the mayor of the nation’s largest city might seem like a perfect position from which to launch a national political career, New Yorkers don’t take kindly to mayors with national aspirations. History tells us that—contra Sinatra’s boast that “if I can make it there, I can make it anywhere”—being the mayor of Gotham is a dead end job.

New York City is one of the world’s great cities. It has been a center of world finance for nearly 200 years. It birthed the original plutocrats of the Gilded Age, along with industrialism in its modern capitalist form. New York City exemplified the age of mass consumption, popular entertainment, and the department store. It has always sat at the center of the news, media, and publishing universe. It is also home to the United Nations. Given the attention, the city deservedly gets, mayors have the sort of recognition and exposure that makes them household names. Yet while LaGuardia, Lindsay, Koch, Giuliani, and Bloomberg all had national reputations, none of them have held an office outside of New York City.

Add de Blasio to that list. He ran for mayor in 2013 on a progressive platform, vowing to take on the hyper-gentrification and increasing income inequality of the Bloomberg era. His “Tale of Two Cities” theme called for serving and servicing forgotten New Yorkers—or real New Yorkers. New York City has always had this thing for authenticity, as a city of immigrants and migrants that has constantly tried to define itself against the same glamourized media images of it the city that help draw people here.

Having foreseen the blue wave rising, de Blasio has struggled to stay atop it. His administration has been defined in many ways by his public feud with Governor Andrew Cuomo— who battled the mayor over housing, education, infrastructure, transportation, and public health—and who swerved hard to the left himself after the election of Trump in 2016, and is now a key supporter of Joe Biden. New York mayors often feud with governors and presidents; this one has been outfoxed and outflanked.

Moreover, that de Blasio’s further left politics are now closer to the mainstream of the Democratic party hardly makes him—after a term of half limited success and with inequality continuing to widen on his watch—the natural standard bearer for a party that’s now full of progressives, including Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and NYC’s own AOC. (Despite having endorsed her opponent, incumbent Congressman and Queens boss Joe Crowley, De Blasio insisted afterward that ‘“Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is someone who absolutely comes from my wing of the Democratic Party”).

For all the media exposure they get, New York mayors also have to overcome the cultural baggage of Gotham to achieve national office. They are clearly representatives of cosmopolitanism, of the vast multicultural landscape, of urbanism, high finance and big money, as well as unionism and social movements and activist politics. In short, they play against every image we have of middle of the road America. And the electoral college means there’s no political gain in running as America’s mayor, as one of de Blasio’s predecessors (whatever happened to that guy?) tried to do a few years after stumbling into that title in his last days in office.

We have always had a love-hate relationship as a nation with Gotham. There is a whole film culture about its destruction, from King Kong all the way through the Avengers. It is a Hollywood trope to show New York in ruins. Books too, like the concrete eating tiger who destroys whole blocks of Manhattan in Jonathan Lethem’s Chronic City. This dystopian imagining of New York plays because to many Americans, New York is representative of chaos and dysfunction because of its sheer size and its embrace of outsiders. Because New York never settles and never remains still, it is always on the make, on the go, always reinventing itself and its past. It seems to many a place without a tradition, only a chaotic present and a future.

Maybe one day, we’ll have a mayor who can overcome the cultural baggage to make the leap. I would argue that we would be a better nation for it. Scholar Benjamin Barber makes the case in his recent book, If Mayors Ruled the World. The skills it takes to master the local political landscape are massive.

A successful mayor is in charge of our largest city, bigger than some states in population. The budget is staggering. The problems are massive. Because of the ethnic populations and the presence of the United Nations, New York City mayors need to have a foreign policy presence. Because of economic realities, they need to promote jobs, industry and because it is also a progressive city, they need to promote equality. They need to worry about homelessness and hunger—not just in theory—and about the nuts and bolts of basic policy. They truly understand that, as former House Speaker Tip O'Neill famously put it, “all politics is local.”

The country could do much worse than a successful mayor of New York City as president. But, it will not be this mayor."
"DOJ watchdog: Former FBI official illegally leaked court docs, disclosed 'sensitive' information and took gift from media",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-watchdog-finds-fmr-fbi-deputy-assistant-director-leaked-sensitive-information-took-gift-from-media-but-declines-prosecution,"The Justice Department's internal watchdog announced in an investigative summary released Wednesday that an unnamed former FBI deputy assistant director engaged in ""misconduct,"" including leaking ""sensitive"" information to the media, violating federal law by disclosing sealed court records and taking a gift from someone in the media.

Nevertheless, the inspector general (IG) indicated, without explanation, that ""prosecution of the DAD [deputy assistant director] was declined."" The investigation's findings will be referred to the FBI for potential further action, the IG said.

The official became the second high-level FBI employee to be formally rebuked by the IG over media contacts seen as improper. Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe was fired from the bureau in March 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions after an inspector general report revealed that he ""lacked candor"" when discussing his communications about federal probes with members of the media.

The IG first indicated in its June 2018 report on DOJ and FBI misconduct that ""although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed.""

The IG, flagging what it called an apparent ""cultural"" problem at the bureau, said at the time it would announce the conclusion of multiple separate ""investigations"" into the matter at a later date. The Wednesday report appeared to be the opening salvo in those reports. A distinct, comprehensive IG report covering a variety of additional matters, including potential FBI surveillance abuses, is expected in a matter of weeks.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, and John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, are conducting independent parallel probes into the FBI and DOJ. Last week, President Trump authorized Attorney General William Barr to declassify and release materials pertinent to the reviews.

The investigative summary released Wednesday specifically found by a preponderance of evidence that the DAD had ""engaged in misconduct when the DAD accepted a ticket, valued at approximately $225, to attend a media-sponsored dinner, as a gift from a member of the media, in violation of federal regulations and FBI policy.""

STRZOK'S SPECIAL COUNSEL PHONE TOTALLY WIPED BY RECORDS OFFICER WHO ASSUMED NOTHING IMPORTANT WAS ON THERE

The report also assessed that the DAD ""disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal in federal court, in violation of 18 USC § 401, Contempt of Court, provided without authorization FBI law enforcement sensitive information to reporters on multiple occasions; and had dozens of official contacts with the media without authorization, in violation of FBI policy."" Contempt of court can be punished by a jail term or a fine, at the court's discretion.

Media leaks played a central role in advancing the narrative that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Russia, and Republican lawmakers have charged that the FBI and DOJ planted sensitive information to further their own political and investigative goals.

The FBI, for example, extensively relied on news articles -- including one from Yahoo News -- to obtain a surveillance warrant to monitor former Trump aide Carter Page. The FBI did not inform the FISA court that the Yahoo article relied on a source that, according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the FBI knew was politically motivated. Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News also show FBI brass fretting that a senior DOJ officials had similar concerns about a FISA source's bias.

And text messages between ex-FBI employees and former lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, unearthed last year, revealed that government officials were ""leaking like mad"" in the run-up to the Trump-Russia collusion probe.

""In addition to the significant number of communications between FBI employees and journalists, we identified social interactions between FBI employees and journalists that were, at a minimum, inconsistent with FBI policy and department ethics rules,"" the IG wrote in June. ""For example, we identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.""

The IG concluded by describing ""the harm caused by leaks, fear of potential leaks, and a culture of unauthorized media contacts.""

""We do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,"" the IG added. ""Rather, we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.""

The EPA says a chemical in Monsanto's weed-killer doesn't cause cancer — but there's compelling evidence the agency is wrong,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/glyphosate-cancer-dangers-roundup-epa-2019-5,"Gardeners Alva and Alberta Pilliod say they used Monsanto's Roundup spray to keep weeds off their driveway for more than two decades, applying the herbicide while wearing flip flops, shorts, and tank tops. Now, they both have Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). In a lawsuit, they were awarded $2.05 billion in damages in May.

School groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, now in his 40s, also used to spray Roundup up to 30 times every summer. He has the same blood cancer as the Pilliods, and won nearly $80 million in a suit last year.

A third man, Edwin Hardeman, used Roundup for more than 25 years to keep weeds off his oak trees. He got NHL, too. A jury in California ruled in March that Roundup was a ""substantial factor"" in his diagnosis.

More than 13,000 similar lawsuits have popped up in the US. Almost all are being filed by gardeners, groundskeepers, and other professional weed-whackers who allege that their consistent, repeated use of Roundup gave them cancer. One of the latest allegations came this week from 44-year-old groundskeeper Jeffrey Sabraski. Sabraski alleges he sprayed Roundup several times per week, wearing nothing but shorts and t-shirts, and has also developed NHL. He's suing Monsanto, as the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on Wednesday.

Roundup is the most widely-used herbicide in the world, and its key chemical is called glyphosate. The plaintiffs in this recent surge of court cases say that Monsanto didn't sufficiently warn them about the potential health risks associated with the product or tell them how to protect themselves from exposure.

But teasing out the health risks of glyphosate isn't easy. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) says the chemical is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the agro-chemical giant Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, both say glyphosate isn't linked to cancer in any meaningful way.

""EPA continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen,"" the agency said on its website. Canadian health authorities support the US' stance.

However, peeling back the curtain on the scientific studies that have looked at glyphosate thus far can tell us a lot about how the chemical can indeed be dangerous when people and animals are exposed to it in the wrong ways.

What Monsanto and the EPA say about glyphosate

Glyphosate, which has been in use around the world since the 1970s, blocks an enzyme pathway that helps plants grow. The herbicide's patent expired in 2000, and Indian and Chinese farmers are now the weed-killer's biggest buyers.

It's tricky for epidemiologists to say conclusively that something causes cancer, so what we know so far — from thousands of studies conducted in rats, mice, and humans — is that the pesticide might be linked with cancer, or it might not. Glyphosate might make cancer more likely to sprout up, since there's evidence it can encourage DNA damage. But more research is still needed to learn how, exactly, it affects the human body.

Monsanto maintains there's no good evidence the chemical causes cancer. The company often points to a 2017 study of more than 54,000 pesticide sprayers in Iowa and North Carolina (mostly farmers), which found no statistically significant association between glyphosate and cancer.

The company also often highlights the results of large-scale studies of French, Norwegian, and North American farmers that have found glyphosate to be safe.

But farmers are largely protected from the dangers of herbicides and pesticides, since they spray fields using industrial-grade farm equipment. In that same study, in fact, chemical sprayers who had the most exposure to glyphosate were found to have a slightly higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than people who'd never used the weed-killer. The difference, however, was so small that more research is needed to confirm these results.

The EPA has also consistently said that consumers have nothing to worry about when it comes to glyphosate.

""In 2017, EPA published comprehensive ecological and human health risk assessments for glyphosate. No human health risks were identified,"" the agency said in April. However, the EPA cautioned that ""potential ecological risks were identified for terrestrial and aquatic plants, birds, and mammals, primarily from exposure to spray drift.""

Humans, of course, are terrestrial mammals, too. And gardeners who use lots of glyphosate — without much protection — would arguably also be exposed to spray drift.

""The evidence is not as strong so as to be absolutely sure"" Manolis Kogevinas, of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, told Business Insider. ""But yeah, there's definitely a chance that they will develop cancer.""

The IARC has a different stance

In March 2015, the IARC convened a group of 17 experts from 11 countries to determine the potential human health dangers of glyphosate, along with four other pesticides and herbicides. The international, non-partisan committee concluded that glyphosate is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans, based on studies in humans and lab animals.

That's why glyphosate is now a ""Group 2A"" carcinogen, according to IARC. That means that the chemical is considered to be a contributor to cancer, but not on the level of more well known cancer-causers like formaldehyde and UV radiation.

But the IARC also has a complicated history with glyphosate research. Reuters reported in 2017 that the agency had cut sections out of a draft report that suggested glyphosate might not contribute to cancer. In a follow-up letter to Congress, IARC director Christopher Wild wrote that the group revised that draft because some of the data came from ""a review article co-authored by a Monsanto scientist.""

He added that the information from that article ""was insufficient for independent evaluation of the individual studies and the conclusions reached by the Monsanto scientist.""

Why these groups came to different conclusions about glyphosate

A tightly reviewed and vetted paper published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe earlier this year looked into why the EPA and IARC appear to disagree about the risks of glyphosate. It found that the EPA's conclusions relied mainly on ""unpublished regulatory studies,"" many of them industry-funded. The IARC, on the other hand, looked at ""mostly peer-reviewed studies.""

That could explain why 99% of the glyphosate studies that the EPA considered found that the chemical is not a cancer-causer, while 70% of the studies the WHO looked at suggested it probably is.

""It's kind of easy to understand why EPA would say, 'Well, geez, you know, it must be okay,'"" study author Charles Benbrook, an agricultural economist who now serves as an expert witness for plaintiffs involved in Roundup litigation, told Business Insider. ""It was okay because they were looking at a bunch of negative studies that Monsanto [did]. Monsanto repeated essentially the same study like 30 times.""

Benbrook alleges that the reason so many big payouts are being won in court is that Monsanto didn't properly warn people who used Roundup at home or on a small scale that they should wear protective clothing when they applied the weed-killer.

""It's not farmers out in the field with their large, modern spray rigs, where the operator is inside a steel and glass cab with a sophisticated air filtration system that essentially eliminates exposure,"" Benbrook said. ""Some people are spraying Roundup 6 or 8 hours a day for five days a week with this kind of handheld equipment.""

Monsanto maintains that as long as consumers follow the instructions on the label, glyphosate-based herbicides are perfectly safe. The company also points to hundreds of glyphosate studies in EPA databases that were not Monsanto-funded.

""At the end of the day, whether you're in the court of law, regulatory agencies, or court of public opinion, it's the science that should matter here,"" a Bayer spokesman said in an email to Business Insider. ""And the extensive body of science over 40 years, including several recent human epidemiology studies, shows that glyphosate-based herbicides are not associated with NHL. Customers who know these products best continue to rely on them.""

The company also points to the courtroom testimony of Robert Phalen, an environmental scientist who testified in the Pilliod's trial that human skin actually repels glyphosate. (Phalen once authored a textbook with another scientist also named Robert Phalen, who has said modern air may be ""a little too clean."")

Monsanto tweaked its Roundup formula in Europe

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pets stay off lawns and plants that have just been sprayed with glyphosate, since animals can develop digestive or intestinal issues if they touch the substance when it hasn't dried. Glyphosate has also recently been linked to more severe cases of fatty liver disease in people.

But beyond glyphosate, there's another compound in Roundup: soap-like detergents called surfactants that help the chemical penetrate the leaves of plants to work its weed-killing magic. Benbrook believes Monsanto should be doing more to warn people about how surfactants work and how to protect themselves.

""It's the surfactants that are carrying the glyphosate first through the skin and inside the body, and then inside of cells where damage can be done to DNA,"" he said.

In Europe, Benbrook noted, surfactant chemicals have been made less toxic for consumers. In the US, however, there's been less regulatory pressure, so Monsanto has not changed Roundup formulas in the same way. ""When juries learn that Monsanto is making a product that's at least 10 times, maybe 100 times safer all across Europe?"" he said. ""That's not acceptable. That's one of the reasons that I think we can expect a continuation of these mammoth punitive damage awards that have occurred in the first three trials.""

Bayer said that allegation is one ""we don't believe is supported by the extensive body of science.""

The company told Business Insider in an email that ""regulators have specifically assessed the safety of the class of surfactants used in glyphosate-based herbicides; in 2009, the U.S. EPA concluded that these surfactants are not carcinogenic.""

The statement added that Monsanto tweaked the surfactants in products sold in Europe ""due to market preferences or country-specific requirements in the region.""

Traces of glyphosate in food don't seem to hurt people

As lawsuits about glyphosate have entered the spotlight, some people have expressed concerns about the trace amounts of the chemical in our food.

The traces of glyphosate found in a bowl of Cheerios or a glass of wine are probably not going to kill anyone, though.

""Using the internationally accepted limits, an average adult male would have to drink over 1,000 liters of wine a day to reach any level of risk,"" pharmacologist Ian Musgrave recently wrote in The Conversation.

That said, it's worth remembering that different people's bodies can react differently to chemicals. The foods pregnant women eat impact how their fetus grows and develops, for example, and the developing digestive systems of infants and toddlers may be more delicate than others. Scientists are still studying how pesticides can impact childhood brain development.

Kogevinas still doesn't think the chemical's presence in food is much to worry about, though.

""If you ask me, is the glyphosate the problem in my food? No, it is not,"" he said. But he noted that he prefers to buy organic produce to avoid pesticides more generally.

Kogevinas lives in Barcelona, where the Roundup formulations adhere to the European standards, but that didn't affect his decision about whether or not to buy it: He has opted never to use glyphosate in his own garden."

""It will be a statement having to do with the border and having to do with people illegally coming over the border,"" Trump said."" And it will be my biggest statement, so far, on the border. We have brought something to the light of the people. They see now it's a national emergency, and most people agree. The Democrats agree, too, but they won't give us the legislation you need to fix it.""

The president teased the announcement as he left the White House on a trip to Colorado but revealed little when reporters pressed him for more.

""Right now, when you catch somebody, you have to release them,"" Trump answered, blaming Democrats. ""They won't give us the legislation. Whether it's chain migration or whether it's a lottery, they won't give us any. And the asylum procedures are ridiculous. No place in the world has what we have in terms of ridiculous immigration laws.""

Trump's latest political move on illegal immigration comes as administration officials told ABC News in Guatemala that they are now targeting transportation networks for migrants with the same focus and effort as drug smugglers.

It’s the latest push by the administration to try to contain the crisis at the border that’s overwhelmed border communities and tested Trump’s “America First"" policy.

Migrants families are arriving in record numbers this year, with officials expecting to handle some 1 million people at the southern border this year -- double the number of last year. The reasons are complex, ranging from poverty to threats from gangs to weather-related disasters that have wiped out farmland.

The Trump administration also blames court-ordered limits on the ability to detain children past 20 days, insisting that has only encouraged travelers to bring children with the promise of a quick release where they will able to live and work waiting for an overwhelmed immigration court system to take up their case.

Critics counter that the president has done little to address the humanitarian crisis in Central America and say his threats to close the border and build a wall may have even encouraged the latest rush of asylum seekers.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan tells ABC’s Matt Gutman in an interview in Guatemala this week that he was visiting the country to forge a new relationship with the country's security forces. The goal is to break up human smuggling networks that are charging people some $6,000 to $7,000 to reach the U.S.

McAleenan called Guatemala the ""epicenter"" of the migration issue with 40 percent of the migrants arriving at the border coming from there.

""We've got to work with them here to address these smugglers at the front end of the process,"" McAleenan said in the interview.

That view – addressing the root cause of the migration and going after transportation networks -- has long been pushed by the Homeland Security Department, including under McAleenan's predecessor Kirstjen Nielsen. But with the president's repeated promise of ""America First,"" Trump has shown little appetite – at least publicly – to address the crisis through diplomatic channels and foreign aid.

This spring, the State Department announced Trump wanted to cut all direct assistance to Guatemala, as well as El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries that represent the vast majority of asylum seekers arriving at the U.S. border.

Department of Corrections turns over disputed documents to Justice Department,https://www.al.com,"['William Thornton', 'Wthornton Al.Com']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.al.com/news/2019/06/department-of-corrections-turns-over-disputed-documents-to-justice-department.html,"The Alabama Department of Corrections surrendered documents this week that the U.S. Department of Justice said dealt with reports of excessive force and sexual abuse against inmates by correctional officers.

According to a four-page motion filed Thursday by lawyers representing the DOJ, the ADOC provided documents “specifically related to use of force and sexual abuse by staff.” As a result, the DOJ withdrew a petition to enforce a subpoena that it filed last October.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Gray Borden had given both sides until Friday to come up with a solution to the impasse.

There is no word yet on what DOJ will do with the documents. In April the Justice Department released a report on its two-and-a-half-year investigation into violence and poor conditions within Alabama’s men’s prisons. The DOJ concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that conditions in the prisons violate the Eighth Amendment.

Last month, in an effort to get the contested documents, Justice Department lawyers said there are still areas of the investigation that have “not been completed.”

A footnote on the first page of the 62-page report on Alabama’s prisons says that the investigation was opened to look at whether ADOC was adequately ensuring inmate safety from physical and sexual violence between inmates, and whether inmates had safe and sanitary living conditions.

However, the footnote stated that an investigation into a third issue - whether inmates were safe from excessive force and sexual abuse from staff members – is ongoing “because the Department’s petition to enforce its subpoena for documents relevant to that issue is pending with the court.”

On Oct. 12, 2018, DOJ filed a petition requesting the federal court force ADOC to turn over a series of individual prisoner investigative files, and documents on open and closed investigations, including autopsy reports on some inmates and some medical records not previously made available at correctional facilities.

The filing also requested weekly reports from ADOC’s Intelligence and Investigations Division from September 2016 to September 2017.

Since 2012, Alabama men’s and women’s prisons have come under repeated scrutiny for staffing and safety, as well as a pervasive atmosphere of documented sexual and physical abuse."
"Justice Department opinions take on the force of law — but are not, in fact, the law",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Fred Barbash', 'Law', 'Constitution', 'May At Am']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-opinions-take-on-the-force-of-law--but-are-not-in-fact-the-law/2019/05/30/f4efe222-8280-11e9-933d-7501070ee669_story.html,"The Justice Department issues opinions through its Office of Legal Counsel that have been called “the law that presidents make.” (Amr Alfiky/Reuters)

When former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III declared that indicting a sitting president was “unconstitutional,” some legal experts were taken aback. The question has never been litigated and so never decided by the Supreme Court.

The reality, as Mueller said in the same breath — making his first public comments Wednesday on his Russia investigation — is that the prohibition on charging presidents with federal crimes is “long-standing department policy.” It was formulated in two opinions during the administrations of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC).

The opinions of this elite corps of lawyers are binding on the federal government — but are not the equivalent of Supreme Court rulings.

[On question of obstruction, Mueller hewed to untested Justice Department opinion]

For these lawyers are not “umpires,” as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. once described the role of Supreme Court justices. They are the president’s lawyers, whose stated responsibilities include “facilitating the work of the Executive Branch and the objectives of the President, consistent with the law.”

The body of opinions they produce have been called “the law that presidents make.”

And it is no surprise that such law holds that presidents are not subject to criminal prosecution.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Friday in a blog post that as president, she would seek a reversal of that Justice Department policy. “When I’m elected, I will exercise my constitutional authority to appoint an Attorney General who shares my strong conviction that no one — not even a President — is above the law,” she said.

While the OLC is proud of its “independent and principled” judgment, a recent Cornell Law Review study of its work, as well as a review of its publicly available decisions, suggests that it has a hard time saying “no” to its chief client.

The yeses accumulate. And because the Supreme Court tends to stay away from separation-of-powers issues, an OLC opinion becomes precedent for the next OLC opinion on the same subject, and the next one and the one after that.

Before long, it’s all settled as far as the Justice Department is concerned.

That’s how White House claims of “executive privilege” have evolved. What began as a few historical examples of withheld information by a handful of presidents and a passing acknowledgment in the Supreme Court’s 1974 Watergate tapes case, U.S. v. Nixon, is now routinely invoked by presidents as fundamental law.

The OLC’s recent opinion supporting President Trump’s barring of House Judiciary Committee testimony by former White House counsel Donald McGahn is illustrative, citing “nearly five decades” of OLC precedent in support of Trump’s claim.

Similarly, the OLC cited prior opinions and “centuries of historical practice and precedents” in addition to its interpretation of the law, when it determined that Trump could name Matthew G. Whitaker acting attorney general, temporarily replacing Jeff Sessions, despite the fact that Whitaker had held no position confirmed by the Senate.

“Some people have described it as a one-way ratchet,” said Jonathan Shaub, who served in the OLC from 2014 through the summer of 2017. “A president does something. The next president comes along and says, ‘I can do this other thing that’s just a step further.’ ”

The OLC’s precedent, Shaub said, “sets the stage for future presidents, and most favor executive branch authority.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec declined to comment.

Unlike a court, the OLC’s opinion-making process is neither neutral, adversarial nor transparent. Much of its work is kept secret. Some is informal, according to lawyers who have worked there, consisting of emails and purely oral communications.

All this is among the reasons executive branch power keeps expanding, often at the expense of Congress, particularly in areas involving war powers and national security.

On occasion, precedent doesn’t matter so much. The most recent example of that came when the OLC said the appointment of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as adviser to the president, did not run afoul of federal nepotism laws.

The decision, dated on Trump’s Inauguration Day, ran contrary to at least four earlier OLC opinions on similar questions.

The office said it had “reexamined the legislative materials” on nepotism. (The federal anti-nepotism law was enacted after Bobby Kennedy served as attorney general to his brother, President John F. Kennedy, and did not apply to Hillary Clinton, who served as health-care adviser to her husband, because a court ruled the first lady was a “de facto” White House official.)

The most famous reversal was the revocation by the OLC in 2004 of the “torture memos” authorized by the same office for the George W. Bush administration after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

For a Cornell Law Review article, scholar Adoree Kim compared the OLC’s publicly released decisions advising executive branch agencies with those advising the White House and found a sharp divergence. While the office often felt free to say “no” to agency legal interpretations, it was far more obliging to the White House.

“The OLC is deeply deferential to the President and to presidential action,” she wrote, and “this deference is not unique to times of crisis. It is also not limited to the realm of foreign affairs, or to constitutional questions. Rather, the OLC demonstrates systematic partiality toward the President.” The office, she concluded, is indeed the “president’s law firm.”

But “as a practical matter,” said Walter Dellinger, who ran the office for three years under President Bill Clinton, “it is difficult to cut back on opinions expanding executive power,” though it can and has been done.

Deference to the president “is baked into OLC’s culture,” former OLC lawyer Erica Newland wrote recently in The Washington Post. It “proceeds from the assumption that the president is acting consistent with Article II of the Constitution and with his oath of office, both of which require that he ‘faithfully’ execute the laws.”

“But when I was at OLC, I saw again and again how the decision to trust the president failed the office’s attorneys, the Justice Department and the American people. The failure took different forms,” she wrote. “Sometimes, we just wouldn’t look that closely at the claims the president was making about the state of the world. When we did look closely, we could give only nudges.”

Newland left the office in November. “I decided that the responsibilities entailed in my oath were incompatible with the expectations of my job,” she wrote."
Doug Collins suspects ex-FBI leaker is Peter Strzok,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doug-collins-suspects-ex-fbi-leaker-is-peter-strzok,"A top Republican wants to know if a high-ranking FBI official who leaked ""sensitive"" information and improperly accepted a gift from the media was Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who is well known for his text messages displaying a negative opinion of President Trump.

Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, wrote letters to Attorney General William Barr and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Thursday with questions about the DOJ watchdog's investigation into FBI misconduct.

In his letter to Horowitz, Collins asked about a one-page report released on Wednesday that found a now-former FBI deputy assistant director “engaged in misconduct” by disclosing information to the media that had been filed under seal in federal court, maintaining dozens of unauthorized contacts with reporters, and accepting a $225 ticket from a member of the media to attend a dinner sponsored by the media.

The Georgia congressman said he has reason to believe Strzok was the unnamed former official

[Related: DOJ inspector general: Ex-FBI official leaked 'sensitive' info, improperly accepted gift from media]

""While the DAD is not named in the Summary, there are several indications the DAD in question is former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok,"" Collins said. ""For example, the 2018 Report noted, 'Peter Strzok is an experienced counterintelligence agent who was promoted to Deputy Assistant Director (DAD) of the Espionage Section in September 2016.' The 2018 Report also said, '[m]ost troubling, on October 29, 2016, Strzok forwarded from his FBI account to his personal email account an email about the proposed search warrant the Midyear team was seeking on the Weiner laptop. This email included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, which contained information from the Weiner investigation that appears to have been under seal at the time in the Southern District of New York . . .'""

Collins asked Horowitz if Strzok is the individual referenced in the report and pressed the inspector general and Barr on whether prosecution was declined. Despite the FBI official's violations of bureau policy, the inspector general said “prosecution of the [deputy assistant director] was declined"" and the matter was being referred to the FBI for ""appropriate action.""

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server. Upon the discovery of these texts, Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and was later fired from the bureau.

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Among these texts was a reference to a ""media leak strategy,"" which raised concerns last fall among Republican lawmakers and Trump. Despite warnings about ""troubling evidence that the practice of coordinated media interactions"" with the Justice Department and FBI, Strzok's lawyer Aitan Goelman said the term ""media leak strategy"" in his client’s messages refered to a DOJ-wide initiative to detect and stop aides sharing information with the media. ""The President and his enablers are once again peddling unfounded conspiracy theories to mislead the American People,"" Goelman said in a written statement.

Collins, who set a June 7 deadline, also asked Barr and Horowitz about the existence of other investigations into other former FBI officials, including former General Counsel James Baker, former Director James Comey, and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

""Leaking classified and sealed material is a dangerous, illegal action. The DOJ's declination to prosecute leaks is concerning and only emboldens leakers to continue their reckless actions,"" Collins said in a tweet.

Barr testified this month that the Justice Department has ""multiple criminal leak investigations underway.”"
EPA finalizes plan to expand ethanol use,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/epa-finalizes-plan-expand-ethanol-gasoline-summer/story?id=63397761,"Gasoline that contains a higher percentage of ethanol should be available to drivers around the country this summer, the Trump administration announced Friday.

The Environmental Protection Agency finalized a proposal to lift limits on the amount of ethanol in gasoline, saying it will expand the market for biofuels and generate a win for corn producers. Industry groups also said it will help the biofuel industry and give consumers more options at the pump.

“As President Trump promised, EPA is approving the year-round sale of E15 in time for summer driving season, giving drivers more choices at the pump,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a press release.

Trump said he would ask for the change at a campaign rally last March, months before the midterm elections. Expanding ethanol is seen as a way to boost markets for corn produced in Midwestern states and benefit political candidates that support expanded ethanol production.

The head of EPA’s air office, Bill Wehrum, said the proposal helps support renewable fuels and addresses concerns from the oil industry about the regulation of biofuels.

The EPA originally set limits on gasoline with 15% ethanol because of concerns the higher temperatures in the summer could lead to more air pollution. But Wehrum said he doesn't expect a noticeable impact because gasoline with 10% ethanol is already sold in the summer months.

""At the end of the day from an environmental standpoint this doesn't make any significant difference,"" he told reporters Friday.

Critics see the decision as an attempt by Trump to help farmers in the Midwest who have been hurt by the trade war with China and declining commodity prices. Corn growers have called for the administration to allow more ethanol and have opposed waivers from oil refineries exempting them from requirements to include a minimum amount of ethanol.

#E15YearRound is welcome news from the @EPA. @NationalCorn President Lynn Chrisp: ""We thank President Trump for following through on his promise to rural America and @SecretarySonny and supporters in Congress for their outspoken commitment to year-round E15."" pic.twitter.com/lQVuuOK9e8 — National Corn (NCGA) (@NationalCorn) May 31, 2019

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue also applauded the decision in a statement, saying it will help farmers and consumers while the administration looks to grow the market for American-produced ethanol both in the U.S. and in other countries.

Many farmers are facing historic delays in planting corn crops due to severe flooding. Other efforts to help struggling farmers in states impacted by natural disasters have stalled in Congress."
USDA moving ahead with reorganization plan opponents argue would 'eviscerate' research units,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/politics/usda-reorganization-trump/index.html,"(CNN) Hundreds of professional researchers at the US Department of Agriculture are waiting to hear where outside the Washington area their jobs will be relocated -- part of a drive by Secretary Sonny Perdue to cut costs in the federal bureaucracy that many workers also see as a way to disrupt climate research and other work their bosses disagree with.

The looming changes have triggered unionization drives, with workers in charge of research grants set to vote June 11 on joining the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the major federal workers' unions, after USDA economists voted to join earlier this month.

One watchdog group opposed to the relocation says the relocation is a ""back-door"" way to cut staff at the Economic Research Service (ERS), which provides research and statistical analysis for lawmakers, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), which oversees the allocation of federal funding for primarily academic research across the country.

""If Secretary Perdue wishes to eviscerate ERS and NIFA research that is opposed by the White House, let him make that case to Congress, rather than hide behind an unjustified, criticized plan to force world class researchers to make the decision to uproot their families or leave their careers,"" Institute for Agriculture and Trade senior policy analyst Steve Suppan said in a statement

The Trump administration has been focused on remaking the federal bureaucracy , triggering a steady outflow of career civil servants. The Environmental Protection Agency's workforce, for example, has decreased by nearly 1,200 employees in the last two years, according to federal data -- many of whom were scientists, according to records obtained by the Washington Post

The ERS and NIFA units have produced research with conclusions that contradict the Administration's talking points, especially on topics like the impacts of climate change on crop or livestock production, or how changes in trade or tax policy, like tariffs or Trump's tax plan, can affect US agriculture. For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper last year that suggested Trump's 2017 tax reform would benefit the wealthiest farmers at the expense of lower-earning farm households , according to the New York Times.

The relocation initiative has brought simmering discontent at USDA to a head. The agency, which handles everything from farm management to school lunches, was among those hit by last winter's record-setting partial federal government shutdown . It has seen the largest drop in employee engagement -- a measure that gauges satisfaction and commitment -- falling 6.9% between 2017 and 2018, the most out of any of the large agencies surveyed, according to an annual government survey.

""These are knowledge-based organizations,"" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, which tracks the federal bureaucracy. ""Employee engagement is directly correlated to performance.""

The USDA says workers will be able to remain in their jobs, but for most, that will mean moving from Washington, DC, to a new location.

Three location finalists -- Indiana, Kansas City or North Carolina's Research Triangle -- were announced earlier this month by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. In addition to the relocation, Perdue plans to move both the ERS and NIFA under the Office of the Chief Economist, a political branch of the department.

The USDA said the only goal is efficiency.

""It's been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient and customer-focused department in the entire federal government. In our administration, we have looked critically at the way we do business, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the best service possible for our customers, and for the taxpayers of the United States,"" Perdue said in a statement to CNN. ""In some cases, this has meant realigning some of our offices and functions, or even relocating them, in order to make more logical sense or provide more streamlined and efficient services. None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our ERS or NIFA employees.""

But three longtime agency employees, one from ERS and two from NIFA, told CNN that researchers and economists view the move as an intentional decision to undercut their work. All three employees requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation.

These workers described a steady flow of coworkers leaving since Perdue's initial announcement about the relocation plans last year, with one saying they are receiving goodbye emails from colleagues at a rate of roughly two per week.

""People who have families are hanging in limbo,"" one of the NIFA employees said. ""Many of the decisions they have to make are based on the school year and they simply can't make those decisions without any certainty.""

The ERS employee said that ERS employees have been told that there will be a limited number of buy-outs and that they will be offered on a first come, first served basis. The rest will have to choose whether to move or quit. They've been told they will receive some kind of assistance with a move, but those details aren't clear.

A USDA spokesperson told CNN that USDA has not yet determined how many people will be offered separation or retirement packages.

""We continue to openly and transparently share information with our employees, stakeholders and Congress,"" the spokesperson added.

Peter Winch, an American Federation of Government Employees representative who helped organize the ERS union, said that the union will try to stop the move and, failing that, will bargain to help make the transition as ""soft as possible.""

Winch said that there are about 225 NIFA staff eligible to participate in the June 11 unionization vote, which covers all professional and non-professional employees. There were 204 ERS staffers eligible to vote earlier this month, Winch said.

According to notes in the USDA budget, there were 350 staff at NIFA and 320 at ERA at the end of 2018.

The relocation plan has drawn opposition from House Democrats , who included language in their budget banning USDA from using funds allocated by Congress to relocate either NIFA or ERS outside the capital. A group of Democratic senators have also introduced legislation that would bar USDA from moving and reorganizing ERS and NIFA

The USDA's inspector general is also investigating whether Perdue has the legal authority to move the agencies.

Former USDA officials and scientific and agricultural associations have also come out against the plan, arguing that it may push trained staff out the door and pose a risk to the agency's independent and objective analysis.

""ERS is ranked as number three in the world of institutions in the field of agricultural economics, a reflection of our leadership in economic research,"" 56 former USDA officials wrote in a letter submitted to Congress . ""This proposal puts a world-renowned research agency at risk and could set back the federal statistical system at a time when the United States should be leading the world in innovation.""

Other agencies within the USDA are also experiencing tumult.

Last week, USDA announced it will cease operating the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers, which help train low-income, rural students on how to respond to national emergencies, and will transfer them to the Department of Labor. Nine out of the 25 centers are expected to close as part of the move, according to the announcement, and a union spokesperson from the National Federation of Federal Employees told CNN that the move will cut more than 1,000 jobs

The ERS employee said that even if the move never happens, damage may already have been done.

""My fear is that the quagmire will continue to bleed us,"" the ERS employee said. ""That's what is so nefarious about all this, just how strategic this feels."""
U.S. police chiefs call for meeting with Homeland Security over immigration issues,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tom Jackman', 'Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally', 'May At Pm']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/05/30/us-police-chiefs-call-meeting-with-homeland-security-over-immigration-issues/,"

Houston police Chief Art Acevedo presides over a meeting of the Major Cities Chiefs Association in Miami on Wednesday. (Major Cities Chiefs Association/Major Cities Chiefs Association)

MIAMI — The police chiefs of America’s largest cities on Thursday called on the federal Department of Homeland Security to meet with them as their departments struggle with the influx of immigrants from the southern border. The chiefs said they want to hear how federal immigration authorities plan to deal with relocating immigrants to their cities and how they will handle “sanctuary city” status declared by local governments, and the police want a voice in the federal policymaking process.

The Major Cities Chiefs Association, comprising the chiefs and sheriffs of the 69 largest law enforcement agencies in the United States, formed an immigration working group at its meeting here, led by Houston police Chief Art Acevedo, who has openly opposed a Texas law banning sanctuary cities. Acevedo and other chiefs here said they do not take immigration status into account when performing their duties, only whether someone is breaking the law or has been a crime victim. They see immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not one for local police.

“From our perspective,” Acevedo said in an interview, “there is no such thing as a ‘sanctuary city’ in terms of taking action against those who would do harm to members of our communities.” Police have long felt that taking on immigration enforcement by routinely checking a person’s status will deter immigrants from reporting crime or cooperating with investigations. Acevedo said there had been a nearly 43 percent drop in reporting of sexual assaults in Houston by its Hispanic community in 2017.

The chiefs’ working group wants to discuss the federal policy on Immigration and Customs Enforcement civil detainers for undocumented immigrants, which a number of police departments and jails have refused to recognize since they are not criminal warrants. They also want to talk about the issue of notifying ICE before releasing prisoners who have immigration detainers. “The immigration authorities have to pick them up,” Acevedo said. “We don’t turn them over.”

Some chiefs told Acevedo that their local social service agencies are being overwhelmed by busloads of suddenly relocated immigrants. “There needs to be a sense of urgency,” Acevedo said, “when we see asylum seekers that are being distributed throughout the country. We need to know what is the plan and what is the impact on public safety. We need to be part of the discussion because while immigration enforcement is a federal issue, these decisions have an impact on the safety and security of the American people, and that is our primary responsibility.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency “has repeatedly and extensively worked with our country’s law enforcement officials to address the current immigration crisis facing our homeland and keep our communities safe. In fact, former Secretary Nielsen met with the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, co-chaired by Chief Acevedo, this past February to discuss law enforcement concerns and Acting Secretary McAleenan continues to meet with various law enforcement leaders to seek feedback and identify viable, lasting solutions to the ongoing crisis and achieve the Department’s humanitarian and security mission.”

US 10-year yield collapses to 2.13% as Trump's surprise Mexico tariffs stoke recession worries,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/31/us-bonds-fresh-trade-tensions-and-recession-fears.html,"U.S. government debt yields added to steep May declines on Friday after President Donald Trump's new tariff threats on all Mexican imports took investors by surprise and aggravated an already-stressed U.S. trade outlook.

At 4:07 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was lower at around 2.135%, off a fresh 20-month low around 2.125% hit earlier in the session. A portion of the yield curve remained inverted as the yield on the 3-month Treasury bill held at 2.351%. The 2-year rate dropped 13 basis points to 1.926%, it's lowest level since January 2018.

The 10-year German bund yield hit a low of -0.213%, its lowest level ever back through records that began in 1988.

The flight to safety on Friday came after Trump said the night before that he will impose a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports starting June 10 if Mexico didn't take unspecified steps to shore up the border, potentially undermining the recently negotiated deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

""While the essential ingredient to the overnight rally is unquestionably the President's threat of tariffs on Mexican goods unless illegal immigration is stopped, the broader backdrop is equally as supportive for Treasuries,"" Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in an email.

""The ongoing policy quandary of 'what will it take to get the Fed to cut?' has been complicated by the gradual nature of the stock selloff which has kept equity volatility, and therefore the tightening in financial conditions, relatively tame,"" he added. ""Nonetheless, financial conditions are at the tightest level seen since January and the pace of the move is comparable to December.""

Trump's Mexico tariffs also represent the White House's latest attempt to pressure an economic partner through the use of trade levies, a tactic Trump has relied on throughout his negotiations with China. The administration imposed 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports earlier this month following a breakdown in talks between Beijing and Washington.

The stall in U.S.-China talks triggered — in addition to the more expensive imports — a paradigm shift in Wall Street's upbeat markets and economic outlook. Traders who had been betting on a lukewarm to positive resolution with China punished risk assets like equities in favor of safer assets like U.S. Treasurys, sending the prices of debt higher and yields lower.

The S&P 500 — down 6.5% this month — tracked a 34-basis-point drop in the 10-year Treasury rate, which in turn inverted a portion of the yield curve. Such inversions are often seen as a recession indicator as those who buy debt from the U.S. government for years are compensated with poorer rates than those who loan money for a matter of months.

The difference between the rate on the 3-month Treasury bill and the 10-year Treasury note was last seen at -21.8 basis points. The spread between the 10-year yield and the 2-year yield remained at a positive, albeit flattish 21 basis points.

But while market focus on Friday centered on Trump's latest tariffs, other bond strategists noted what the larger change in outlook could mean for the Federal Reserve. A growing number of investors now expect the Fed to cut its overnight lending rate later in 2019 as the boost from Trump's tax cuts gives way to mounting trade disputes and weaker economic data overall.

""At the beginning of the year, I said that the 10 year was heading to a 2.25% yield, in my opinion, and maybe even through that. I now believe we are heading to a 2.00% yield for the 10 year Treasury,"" Mark Grant, chief global strategist of fixed income at B. Riley FBR said in an email.

Chair Jerome Powell said in March 2018 that ""there's no thought that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook,"" has in recent months tweaked his rhetoric, especially around Europe and China. Twelve months following those first comments on the Trump administration's trade tactics, Powell said that the weaker overseas outlook is dampening domestic growth estimates.

""Much discussion is made of this suggesting a Recession is forthcoming but that is not my take,"" Grant added. ""The Fed, for its own portfolio, has not bought Treasury Bills, a policy that I think will be reversed, and then the Yield Curve will begin to normalize as the Fed's assets include the shorter end of the Curve."""
Mark Meadows sends referral to DOJ about mysterious UK communique about Christopher Steele,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-referral-to-doj-about-mysterious-uk-communique-about-christopher-steele,"Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a referral to the Justice Department about a message a top United Kingdom national security official delivered to the Trump transition team a week before President Trump's inauguration.

Congressional investigators told the Hill that in January 2017 then-U.K. national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant hand-delivered a memo to soon-to-be national security adviser Michael Flynn's team that asserted the U.K. government had doubts about the credibility of British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Recent reports suggest Steele had briefed British intelligence officials on his dossier after the 2016 presidential election, and the heads of MI5 and MI6 were made aware of the contents of the dossier by late November.

“A whistleblower recently revealed the existence of a communique from our allies in Great Britain during the early days of the Russia collusion investigation,” Meadows said.

“Based on my conversations with that individual, and the credible timelines that are supported by other events, I made a referral to Attorney General William Barr and Inspector General Michael Horowitz for further investigation,” the North Carolina Republican added. “There now is overwhelming evidence to suggest that on multiple occasions the FBI was warned that Christopher Steele and the dossier had severe credibility issues.”

Steele compiled a dossier that contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and was paid, in part, by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. His dossier has become a flashpoint of concern for Republicans after the declassification of a House Intelligence Committee memo that said the FBI used the unverified research to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants beginning in October 2016 to wiretap onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

GOP investigators learned of the communique's existence within the past few weeks by a whistleblower who was part of Flynn's team and are pressing for answers ahead of Trump's visit to the United Kingdom early next month. Its existence came to light a month after the revelation of a State Department official's notes about an October 2016 meeting with Steele, sent to the FBI, that warned he was unreliable and that he had said he was being encouraged to get his allegations out prior to the 2016 presidential election.

The communique could be significant as it would have been delivered before the FBI applied for three FISA renewals against Page in 2017 using Steele's research. Sources said Flynn was not aware of its existence until he was questioned as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian envoy, and therefore Trump too was likely not told about it.

The possible misuse of Steele's dossier has come into greater focus in recent weeks, including questions about whether the dossier contained possible Russian disinformation and whether former FBI Director James Comey or former CIA Director John Brennan tried to include the dossier in the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

At least three federal investigations are looking into alleged FISA abuse, and other matters related to the way the FBI and the Justice Department conducted the Trump-Russia investigation, and several top ex-officials. Among them are Barr's examination of the origins of the counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign. He has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review. Barr says he is working closely with Horowitz, who is nearing completion of his FISA abuse investigation.

Steele is reportedly open to speaking with Horowitz but has declined to cooperate with Barr."

U.S. Justice Department prepares Google antitrust probe: sources,https://www.reuters.com,"['Diane Bartz', 'Min Read']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-doj-probe/us-justice-department-prepares-anti-trust-investigation-of-google-wsj-idUSKCN1T22SU,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is preparing an investigation of Alphabet Inc’s Google to determine whether the tech giant broke antitrust law in operating its sprawling online businesses, two sources familiar with the matter said.

FILE PHOTO: An illuminated Google logo is seen inside an office building in Zurich, Switzerland December 5, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann

Officials from the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division and Federal Trade Commission, which both enforce antitrust law, met in recent weeks to give Justice jurisdiction over Google, said the sources, who sought anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.

The potential investigation represents the latest attack on a tech company by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused social media companies and Google of suppressing conservative voices on their platforms online.

One source said the potential investigation, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, focused on accusations that Google gave preference to its own businesses in searches.

A spokesman for the Justice Department said he could not confirm or deny that an investigation was being considered. Google declined comment.

Early in 2013, the FTC closed a long-running investigation of Google, giving it a slap on the wrist. Under FTC pressure, Google agreed to end the practice of “scraping” reviews and other data from rivals’ websites for its own products, and to let advertisers export data to independently assess campaigns.

Google’s search, YouTube, reviews, maps and other businesses, which are largely free to consumers but financed through advertising, have catapulted it from a start-up to one of the world’s richest companies in just two decades.

Along the way, it has made enemies in both the tech world, who have complained to law enforcers about its market dominance, and in Washington, where lawmakers have complained about issues from its alleged political bias to its plans for China.

TripAdvisor chief executive and co-founder Stephen Kaufer welcomed news that Google could face Justice Department antitrust scrutiny.

“TripAdvisor remains concerned about Google’s practices in the United States, the EU and throughout the world,” Kaufer said in a statement.

“For the good of consumers and competition on the internet, we welcome any renewed interest by U.S. regulators into Google’s anticompetitive behavior.”

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has pushed for action to break up Google, as well as other big tech companies. Senator Kamala Harris, who is also running for president on the Democratic ticket, has agreed.

“This is very big news, and overdue,” Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican Google critic, said on Twitter, regarding the investigation.

Google has faced a plethora of overseas probes.

Europe’s competition authority, for one, hit Google with a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.7-billion) EU fine two years ago for unfairly promoting its own comparison shopping service.

Google has since offered to allow competitors to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page, giving them the chance to compete on equal terms."

""We also urge Department users to minimize the use of personal web email for business, as some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these actors to automatically forward copies of all composed emails to an undisclosed recipient,"" read a 2011 memo that bore his signature.

Clinton was a recipient of the memo, but Boswell could not confirm whether the secretary of state actually read it.

Boswell, who stepped down from his position in 2012, said he and other former State Department officials had spoken about Clinton's use of the private email address clintonemail.com as a ""general issue.""

""We were surprised,"" he added.

Boswell participated in a deposition this month as part of a court-ordered discovery related to Clinton’s use of an unauthorized email server during her time as secretary of state. A federal judge ruled that several Obama administration officials would have to answer conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch's questions about whether Clinton intentionally attempted to evade the Freedom of Information Act by using a nongovernment email system.

Boswell also warned Clinton against her use of Blackberry devices in the executive offices of the State Department. In a previously declassified memo to Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, Boswell said the secretary of state should discontinue her use of the device due to ""vulnerabilities and risks."" Although Clinton assured Boswell she read the internal memo and ""gets it,"" an email obtained by Judicial Watch indicates she still carried the device ""[a]gainst the advice of the security hawks.""

The debate over whether Clinton's home-based email server, which she claims was set up for convenience, remains alive today. During a hearing with Attorney General William Barr this month, Rep. Louie Gohmert accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of a pro-Clinton cover-up by not pressing the intelligence community for proof that it was not hacked by China.

Also this month, partially redacted documents were released by the FBI that were part of the bureau's ""Midyear Exam"" investigation, which looked into Clinton's mishandling of classified information on her unauthorized private email servers while serving as secretary of state. The documents put on display a sense of alarm among Clinton's staff following what they feared to be a hack of the server and glaring security oversights.

The FBI investigation into Clinton's emails came to a conclusion during the 2016 presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey publicly recommended in 2016 that no charges be brought against Clinton, who was then a candidate for president, but admonished Clinton and her colleagues for being ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information.

One of the main controversies stemming from Clinton's emails was how a technician managing the server deleted 33,000 emails. The FBI was only able to recover about 5,000 of the emails, which were released in tranches up until earlier this year as part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit. Clinton has said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,"" but the FBI found 110 emails did contain classified information.

Clinton has long blamed the FBI's handling of the investigation as a reason for her 2016 loss to President Trump."
DHS awards $276M contract for CDM dashboard,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Billy Mitchell'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.fedscoop.com/continuous-diagnostics-mitigation-cdm-dashboard-ecs-federal/,"Written by Billy Mitchell

The Department of Homeland Security has awarded ECS Federal a $276 million contract to provide a governmentwide dashboard for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program.

The Fairfax, Virginia, company will receive $7.7 million in the base year of the potential six-year contract, according to data on the Federal Procurement Data System. DHS’s goal is to improve how security information about federal networks is visualized for IT personnel in agencies across the government.

The General Services Administration’s FEDSIM office issued the contract on behalf of DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), formerly the National Protection and Programs Directorate.

The dashboard “will provide a total integrated technology solution for the CDM Federal and Agency dashboards, and will provide DHS with an integrated Dashboard solution for continuous monitoring and mitigation of cyber threats and vulnerabilities to the Federal .gov environment by expanding and enhancing the current instance of the Federal Dashboard through a suite of integrated hardware and software tools resulting in a ‘CDM Dashboard Ecosystem,'” a CISA official told FedScoop via email. “The enhancement of the CDM Dashboard through this [task order] will provide Federal agencies with a user-friendly and intuitive solution that can be utilized to visualize and prioritize risks and vulnerabilities in an Agency’s cybersecurity posture.”

The overall purpose, the official said, is to “provide actionable information to allow agencies to ‘fix the worst problems first'” across their networks.

CDM Program Manager Kevin Cox recently described the next steps for the program now that the initial contracts have been awarded and basic tool sets are available.

“It’s a question of: Will the CDM program become this wider sense of getting full cybersecurity solutions in place across all these different capability areas, or will we be more targeted on high-value assets, specific environments, etc.?” Cox said.

Cox also explained how the dashboard will open agencies up to new tools, analytics and business intelligence.

“If one agency has an incident, there’s a greater likelihood that spreads and gets to other agencies or that it’s happening at the same time across many agencies,” he said. “So we wanted to get that visibility.”"
DOJ demands to see CoreLogic's MLS data in antitrust probe,https://www.housingwire.com,"['Jessica Guerin Is An Editor At Housingwire Covering Reverse Mortgages', 'The Housing Wealth Space. She Is A Graduate Of Boston University', 'Has A Master S Degree Northwestern S Medill School Of Journalism. She Worked Previously As The Editor-In-Chief Of The Reverse Review Magazine', 'Which Was Recently Acquired Housingwire.']",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49198-doj-demands-to-see-corelogics-mls-data-in-antitrust-probe,"The Department of Justice recently sent a letter to CoreLogic requesting access to its MLS data regarding buyer broker compensation, a clear sign that the federal authorities are actively investigating allegations of antitrust violations among multiple listing service providers.

The DOJ’s letter follows two class-action lawsuits recently filed against the National Association of Realtors and brokerages, including Realogy, HomeServices of America, RE/MAX and Keller Williams, that center around the practice of requiring that a buyer’s broker be compensated in a home-sale transaction.

Both suits allege that NAR and the MLS providers conspired to drive up seller costs and reduce competition by requiring a home seller to pay compensation to the buyer’s broker, even though their involvement in the transaction is minimal.

For its part, NAR has said that it has no role in determining the buyer broker’s fee and has promised to fight the allegations, calling them “baseless” and full of “an abundance of false claims.”

But it appears the DOJ isn’t so convinced.

In a letter to CoreLogic, which was posted on the website Notorious R.O.B, the DOJ specifically requests “all documents relating to any MLS member’s search of [listings] based on compensation offered by listing brokers to buyer brokers, or the type of compensation, such as a flat fee, offered to listing brokers by buyer brokers.”

It also requests any documents relating to a possible antitrust issue regarding the ability to search based on the type of compensation offered.

Meanwhile, a form filed by CoreLogic with the Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday stated that the company’s chief legal officer, Arnold Pinkston, will be leaving in mid-June to pursue an opportunity elsewhere.

Although Pinkston will be leaving the company in the midst of the DOJ investigation, the filing explicitly states that his decision was not based on a disagreement with the company.

CoreLogic spokesperson Alyson Austin confirmed to HousingWire that the company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the DOJ “relating to an investigation of practices of residential real estate brokerage services in local markets in the United States.” Austin said the company intends to comply with the request and is not the focus of the investigation."

The Paralympic-style competition, which will be hosted in 2020 by the Marine Corps, brings together injured, ill or wounded active-duty service members and veterans to compete each year for the honor of their branch of service.

Events in the 2019 games, which will take place in June in Tampa, Florida, include archery, cycling, shooting, sitting volleyball, swimming, track and field, wheelchair basketball, indoor rowing, powerlifting, and time trial cycling.

""When they win a medal, they win it for their team. And they don't play their national anthem. They play their service song,"" said retired Marine Maj. Gen. Juan Ayala, the director of the city's San Antonio Office of Military and Veteran Affairs.

The games can mean a great deal to wounded service members like Marine Cpl. Mathew Maddux.

Maddux, the Marines' ambassador for the 2020 games, was injured in 2017 when a malfunction in his tank caused a nuclear, biological and chemical system to overheat and combust next to him. The blast left him with burns on his face, impaired peripheral vision, vertigo problems and a prosthetic ear.

Waking up after the incident, Maddux said he knew right away life would be different. Like the Marine he is, Maddux learned to adapt and overcome, competing in the 2018 Warrior Games.

""I was the ultimate champion last year -- did all the sports,"" Maddux said. ""I got a bronze medal in the 4x100, like a relay team.""

More than physically, he says, the games helped him mentally.

""Mentally reassuring yourself that you can still go out there and be an athlete,"" Maddux said. ""Still go out there and still be in a fight.""

Ayala, who the 2015 Warrior Games when he was still in the Marines, says the competition is special.

""They're focused on the recuperative powers to make that athlete feel like he or she are back in the game, they're back in the unit, they're back in the fight,"" Ayala said.

"Sterigenics created cancer risk 10 times higher than federal EPA standards in Willowbrook, new report says",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Michael Hawthorne'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-sterigenics-epa-cancer-risks-20190529-story.html,"Ethylene oxide emitted by Sterigenics continued to pose high cancer risks after the company installed new pollution-control equipment last summer, according to a new federal study based in part on months of air quality testing in Willowbrook and nearby west suburban communities.

Top officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Wednesday that toxic pollution from the company’s Willowbrook sterilization plant was responsible for long-term cancer risks up to 10 times higher than what the EPA considers acceptable.

Cancer risks remained high in the area despite improvements Sterigenics voluntarily undertook to prevent all but one-tenth of 1% of the ethylene oxide it used from escaping into surrounding neighborhoods.

“Based on current science, there are very high levels of risk,” said William Wehrum, the Trump administration’s top air official, who told sometimes angry residents at a public meeting in Burr Ridge that he takes their concerns “very, very seriously.”

Responding to questions, EPA officials said pollution from Sterigenics increased the risk of developing cancer for people living as far as 25 miles away from Willowbrook. The biggest risks were in six suburbs — Willowbrook, Darien, Burr Ridge, Hinsdale, Indian Head Park and Western Springs — and declined steadily the farther away a neighborhood was from the facility, according to a map the EPA posted online and statements from agency officials during the meeting.

Wehrum and other EPA officials suggested the company could take more aggressive steps that would allow its now-shuttered facility to safely resume operations. But bipartisan state legislation sent Thursday to Gov. J.B. Pritzker would ban Sterigenics from reopening unless medical equipment suppliers — the company’s main clients — certify their products can only be sterilized with ethylene oxide.

The new EPA report comes as the federal agency is pledging to adopt more stringent restrictions on sterilization facilities nationwide, a rare departure from attempts by Wehrum and other Trump appointees to block, delay or undermine environment and public health regulations.

Willowbrook is a focal point in the ongoing debate, largely because EPA scientists determined last year that neighborhoods near Sterigenics are among just a few dozen throughout the U.S. where breathing toxic chemicals is responsible for more than 1 case of cancer for every 10,000 people exposed during their lifetime.

Like in the Willowbrook area, ethylene oxide is the main chemical of concern in nearly all of those other areas. The volatile gas has been on the federal list of carcinogens since 1985, and in 2016 the EPA released a long-delayed reassessment linking it more conclusively to breast cancer, leukemia and lymphomas at extremely low levels of exposure.

Several residents at the Wednesday meeting said they don’t trust the EPA or Sterigenics to protect them. Agency officials, they noted, acknowledged that local cancer risks likely were significantly higher in the past when the Willowbrook facility emitted up to 169,000 pounds of ethylene oxide a year.

“The only appropriate resolution … is for Sterigenics to permanently shut down,” said Margie Donnell, a member of the Stop Sterigenics community group.

More than 19,000 people live within a mile of the Willowbrook facility. Four schools and a day care center also are close by, including Hinsdale South High School in Darien and Gower Middle School in Burr Ridge.

Laws and regulations don’t allow the EPA to force Sterigenics to close for good, Wehrum said, but the agency can take action to ensure cancer risks posed by the company’s pollution are within federal guidelines.

Wednesday’s meeting was the third public forum organized by federal and state officials since the EPA released its latest National Air Toxics Assessment in late August.

A Chicago Tribune analysis of agency data revealed that of 73,057 census tracts in the United States, seven tracts near Sterigenics are among just 109 nationwide with long-term cancer risks exceeding the agency’s guidelines. The findings prompted months of intense pressure from elected officials and the public, forcing the EPA to pay closer attention to a once-obscure industry.

“It is not lost upon us, and it certainly isn’t lost upon me, the depth to which this has affected you,” John Kim, acting director of the Illinois EPA, told residents. “We are doing everything we can to bring you relief.”

After months of meetings with Wehrum and his staff, Sterigenics is vowing to overhaul its facility again, even as the company contends that other sources of ethylene oxide were responsible for spikes of the toxic gas recorded by monitoring equipment deployed near its facility between November and March."
Macomb Township petition granted by Department of Justice,https://www.clickondetroit.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/macomb-township-petition-granted-by-department-of-justice,"DETROIT - Macomb Township General Counsel, Thomas D. Esordi, has been notified by the United States Department of Justice that Macomb Township’s petition for remission of $66,000 has been granted.

Macomb Township will receive this money after the submission of administrative paperwork which is being prepared.

After an investigation by the FBI, the Department of Justice determined that Macomb Township was the victim of “extortion and bribery” related to a business transaction.

This remission represents a full and complete recoupment of the funds lost. The $66,000 was forfeited to the government on behalf of former trustee Dino Bucci on December 10, 2018.

"States Can’t Block Legal Hemp Shipments Within Their Borders, USDA Says",https://www.marijuanamoment.net,"['Kyle Jaeger', 'Chris Roberts']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/states-cant-block-legal-hemp-shipments-within-their-borders-usda-says/,"Advocates, industry representatives, regulators, health professionals and marijuana legalization opponents stood up before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday to share their perspectives on how to best approach regulating the cannabis compound CBD.

There are lots of questions, including many related to safety we will need to answer to ensure that FDA is taking an appropriate, well-informed, and science-based approach to the regulation of cannabis and cannabis derivatives, including CBD. — Dr. Ned Sharpless (@FDACommissioner) May 31, 2019

The first-of-its-kind public meeting is meant to inform the FDA’s approach as it considers developing alternative pathways to regulate cannabidiol, which is not currently permitted in the food supply or as a dietary supplement.

Here’s a look at the discussions that took place at the event:

Advocates and opponents

Jonathan Miller, general counsel at U.S. Hemp Roundtable, said there is “an urgent need for an efficient regulatory framework for CBD” and noted that it was the intent of Congress to provide for the marketing of hemp-derived CBD products when it passed the 2018 Farm Bill, federally legalizing the crop and its derivatives.

Interestingly, Miller said his organization has been working with lawmakers in recent weeks to draft standalone legislation to regulate CBD if the FDA determines that the task is too complicated for the agency to complete on its own. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who led the charge on hemp legalization, previously suggested that further legislative action may be necessary to unlock the full potential of the hemp economy.

The National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA), which represents a wide range of industry stakeholders, made a similar argument in its testimony.

Andrew Kline, the group’s director of public policy, said “we strongly recommend [that] FDA act quickly to clarify the regulatory environment.”

“Because there are significant confusions in the market, businesses don’t know what is legally permissible and some are making health claims in the absence of clear regulatory guidance,” he said. “Most significantly, banks and payment processors don’t understand [the regulatory rules] and as a result many CBD companies are at risk of losing financial services.”

NCIA also provided the panel with extensive written testimony it compiled from more than 100 industry representatives, scientists and attorneys in support of establishing clear regulatory guidelines for CBD.

“The bottom line is this: an overwhelming preponderance of evidence indicates that cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds present minimal safety concerns,” Kline said. He added that the FDA should create universal testing and labeling requirements to “help protect the public from health and safety risks.”

On the opposing side, members of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) Canada and the Marijuana Victims Alliance offered testimony that touched on CBD regulations but mostly served to express opposition to marijuana reform more broadly.

“The public is up against a narrative that is at war with science,” SAM Canada’s Pamela McColl said. She claimed that marijuana is addictive, leads people to harm themselves and damages DNA.

“The subversion of truth and science and what is going on in North America [is a source of] great concern and reason to pause and do risk assessments on these drugs and analyze the influence of the billionaires and in the industry that have influenced public sentiment and dictated a very deceitful campaign,” she said.

Sally Schindel, the representative from Marijuana Victims Alliance, said that her son committed suicide, which she attributed in large part to his cannabis use.

“What we need is our federal government enforcing federal laws,” she said. “We need FDA to be more involved and take a leading role in marijuana research and policy formation.”

Shawn Hauser, a hemp and cannabinoid attorney with the law firm Vicente Sederberg LLP, represented the Cannabis Trade Federation at the hearing. “The appropriate regulation of products containing lawful cannabinoids already exists, and that data arising out of the state-regulated regime supports such regulation,” she said.

But “whether right or wrong, the current situation has created a vacuum. It opens the door to bad actors,” which ought to inform the FDA’s next steps.

“Cannabis products can be safely regulated under the existing dietary supplement framework and where products are intended for non-medicinal purposes, it is appropriate to regulate them as such,” she said. “The years of data from these state regulatory regimes are an important source of data for the agency to consider in determining the regulatory pathway. We stand ready to advance to the next level as a partner with FDA in effective federal regulation of cannabinoid products.”

Regulators

Represents from state regulatory agencies in Virginia, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania also addressed the uncertainty that’s prevalent throughout the industry without updated FDA guidelines.

“Currently, states are struggling with the lack of sound scientific research available in CBD and long-term health impacts, including those to children,” Pam Miles of the Virginia Department of Agriculture, said. She added that her department “is hopeful that FDA will begin to supply significant leadership as it related to CBD, including research related to its health impacts.”

Brenda Morris, representing the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, talked about the “patchwork of laws” surrounding CBD and how that has fostered an environment where “anything is allowed.”

“Without the FDA’s guidance and leadership, individual states may carve out their own regulatory exceptions for CBD,” Joseph Reardon of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, said, noting that his state’s hemp industry has greatly expanded in recent years. “We urge the FDA to resolve the statutory issues and properly establish a legal pathway for CBD products to enter the market place.”

Health and consumer advocates

The Alzheimer’s Association argued that existing research is insufficient to substantiate claims about the therapeutic potential of cannabis for Alzheimer’s and dementia. The group said the “lack of evidence creates a substantial risk for individuals and their families.”

The American Epilepsy Society expressed similar concerns, despite CBD being an FDA-approved drug in the treatment of seizures in the form of Epidiolex.

“We support reducing regulatory barriers to research of cannabis-derived compounds,” a representative for the group said. “We strongly urge the FDA to classify the compounds and drugs under the complete jurisdiction of the FDA. We also advocate for ongoing studies on the efficacy of cannabis drugs.”

Ashley Morgan of the American Veterinary Medical Association told the FDA panel that “we believe there is therapeutic potential in the development of cannabis-derived and cannabis-related compounds and we would like to see the potential realized.”

“We believe FDA must seriously consider the need for efficacy and safety data when therapeutic claims are made” about CBD products, she said. “To facilitate the development of such products for veterinary use is imperative [for the FDA to] provide pathways to ensure the regulatory clarity and predictability and economic viability of the industry. The agency must make enforcement priorities known and consistently and intentionally act on the priorities.”

Another interesting testimony came from Larry Walker at the University of Mississippi, which is currently the site of the nation’s only federally authorized marijuana manufacturer for research purposes. He raised some concerns about potential adverse effects of CBD but made a series of recommendations to the FDA about how to minimize risks.

“A possible path forward, it seems to us, is prudent to have a multitrack approach with these products that are cannabis-related,” Walker said.

“It would be outstanding if the FDA could conduct some basic studies in this realm. It is a national need,” he said. “We need a national testing program for cannabinoid quality and standardization, a national adverse reporting program for whatever products are out there and a rapid response program for products where there are serious incidents. We need analytical backup on many of these things where the serious incidents have occurred. Finally, if possible, together research outcomes in the state medical programs.”

Sue Sisley, an internal medicine physician at the Scottsdale Research Institute, expressed frustration over the fact that the DEA “has not processed” applications to increase the number of authorized manufacturers for research-grade cannabis “despite members of Congress repeatedly urging” the agency to do so.

“Sadly, because of the limitations with the current drug supply, we are forced to import study drugs from a Canadian manufacturer and that is disappointing to us,” she said. “We would like to see our own domestic variety of domestic manufacturers. The point is that researchers need access to options. Scientists need options when it is to embolden scientific freedom.”

James Beck, representing the Parkinson’s Foundation, noted that while traditional pharmaceuticals can treat some of the symptoms Parkinson’s patients experience, many remain unaddressed, leaving the community “seeking alternative ways in which to control the symptoms.”

He said that marijuana doesn’t seem to treat tremors, but “it may be helpful on a targeted level for nonmotor symptoms, sleep, anxiety.”

“Bottom line, we really need more research to understand the utility of cannabis for Parkinson’s disease,” Beck said. “I don’t know that there’s very other circumstances we have a drug that is life-saving.”

Jacqueline French of the Epilepsy Foundation said that the group wants the FDA to “preserve access to CBD for those who need it as a life-saving medication.” However, she emphasized the need to create “manufacturing standards” to avoid contamination from mold and other contaminants.

Americans for Safe Access’s Heather Despres talked about standards that her organization has developed, recommending that the FDA consider integrating some of their best practices on “cultivation, manufacturing, distribution and laboratory operations.”

“There are many challenges facing the cannabis industry. There are solutions available,” she said. “We have worked with state regulators to develop and implement a standard, [and] we look forward to working with you, together, to help implement those standards.”

FDA reaction

Amy Abernethy, the FDA principal deputy commissioner who helped organize the public meeting, identified several themes that emerged during the talks.

In general, there is a need to “further clarify the regulatory framework to reduce confusion in the market,” to provide that clarification in timely manner, to collect data on CBD to ensure that the products are safe and to create labeling standards so consumers know what they’re getting.

Here is some of what I am hearing… First, there is a need to further clarify the regulatory framework to reduce confusion in the market. The product questions apply to people and animals. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Key questions about product safety need to be addressed. Data are needed to determine safety thresholds for CBD; datasets/information should be objective, of adequate quality and available for transparent review. Lab testing and data analyses need to be replicable. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Consumers need consistent information and labeling. State/government entities need support in knowing what to do. And we really need to understand the implications for children when they take CBD-containing products at different dosage ranges. More updates later today. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Another theme that seemed to develop is the lack of information about dosing guidelines. Several experts who testified were unable to give clear answers to the FDA panel when asked about what the proper doses are in different contexts, and what their affects on consumers are.

Many people use these products. For CBD, info presented suggests that many consumers think that regulatory pathways are fully in place to keep products safe. Meanwhile speakers reinforced that regulatory pathways are unclear. We must sort this out in service of public health. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Today’s meeting illuminated many different issues encountered by manufacturers, researchers, local governments, etc (e.g., labeling, marketing, access to research product, terminology, manufacturing, standards). — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Systematic studies are needed. It sounds like a number of studies are available or underway. We also wonder if real-world evidence derived from electronic health records, personal monitors, administrative data, etc, can be used to address critical questions in this space. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

I suspect that the public docket will expand our understanding, add new information, and reinforce observations today. We will work as quickly as possible to define a way forward. Appreciate a speaker’s observation: “You guys have a tough job. Good luck with that.” Indeed. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Interested parties can submit public comments to FDA’s docket on CBD issues through July 2.

This story was updated to include testimony delivered later in the day.

"Homeland Security, Guatemala bust illegal immigrant smuggling cartel",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/29/homeland-security-guatemala-bust-illegal-immigrant/,"Homeland Security agents and Guatemalan authorities busted a significant smuggling organization Wednesday, arresting nine people who were involved in transporting thousands of illegal immigrants from across the globe through Latin America and into the U.S.

The bust was the first fruit of a new cooperation agreement signed this week between the U.S. and Guatemala, authorizing the two countries to pool information and resources to go after the smugglers who are fueling the illegal immigrant surge.

Authorities dubbed the operation the Merida organization, after Lidia Fausta Merida-Lopez, whom a Homeland Security official identified as the ringleader. The organization had assets of $10 million, and facilitated smuggling of people from Guatemala, elsewhere in Central America and South America, and even from terrorist-connected countries such as Somalia and Pakistan.

“They’ve moved thousands of people,” the official said. “They’re diverse, they’re connected and linked to narcotics smuggling organizations, they’re truly a transnational criminal organization.”

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan was in Guatemala on Wednesday where he is engaged in meetings with Central American governments, looking to find ways to stop the surge of their people fleeing their countries and headed north.

Earlier this week he inked the cooperation deal with Guatemala, which he said is a geographic “chokepoint” for migration from the south up through Mexico. If the U.S. can stiffen Guatemala’s enforcement, it can cut into the overall flows.

“You’ve got to come through Guatemala, so if we can create a border security situation that’s more robust on the Guatemalan border with Honduras, the Guatemalan border with El Salvador … that’s going to disrupt this cycle,” Mr. McAleenan said.

If successful, that could give the U.S. other options besides relying on Mexico, which U.S. officials say has been an iffy partner, swinging from tough talk to lax enforcement.

The agreement he reached with Guatemala commits the U.S. to helping provide better training, information sharing and support as authorities there try to take down some of the smuggling operations that are siphoning its people away. The agreement does not call for any additional financial assistance for Guatemala, the Homeland Security official said.

He said Homeland Security Investigations agents, who are part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), began looking into the Merida organization in January, and found it was moving “special interest aliens,” or people from countries outside the ones that usually make up illegal migration to the U.S.

The organization would charge up to $3,500 to smuggle a child into the U.S. and up to $12,500 for adults, depending on where in the U.S. the wanted to reach, and the mode of transportation it took to get them there.

Latin American press accounts said nine of the Merida organization’s 10 leaders were arrested in Wednesday’s operation. Some migrants being held by the organization were also arrested.

Both U.S. and Guatemalan authorities said the organization was set up like a franchise operation, with smugglers able to control different pieces of the methods and routes, and the organizers chiefly facilitating the passage among those operators.

They used word of mouth, their reputation for getting people successfully into the U.S., and sometimes social media to advertise their services.

The nine arrested Wednesday will be prosecuted in Guatemala.

Mr. McAleenan said taking out smuggling organizations will cut into the flow of people headed north.

“Without those organizations migrants can’t move out of the country,” he said

The operation comes as the border crisis remains a heated debate in Washington.

Congress left town last week without a deal on the $4.5 billion emergency spending request President Trump made to provide better care for the record numbers of illegal immigrant children and families streaming into the U.S. each month.

Most of that money is designated for Health and Human Services, which under a law passed by Congress is required to care for unaccompanied alien children (UAC) who arrive at the border. But some of the money is designated for Homeland Security, and would be used to feed and care for the families and children, and to replenish ICE’s detention budget.

Mr. McAleenan said he was “extremely concerned” that Congress hasn’t approved the money.

“The failure to act on that request is frankly unconscionable, and putting children at risk,” he said.

As for ICE, he said it will face “very stark choices” of either releasing more new border crossers, releasing criminals caught in the country’s interior, or slashing money in other accounts to fund ICE’s detention beds.

“I don’t like any of those choices. I prefer that Congress act on the request,” the acting secretary said.

"Cornell team, EPA to partner on emissions big data project",https://news.cornell.edu,[],,,,https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/05/cornell-team-epa-partner-emissions-big-data-project,"A team from associate professor Max Zhang’s lab will work with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the next year on a machine learning model designed to predict fossil fuel emissions. The project was a winning entry in the EPA-sponsored EmPOWER Air Data Challenge.

Zhang directs the Energy and the Environment Research Laboratory at the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. His collaborators on the EPA project are Ye Jiang and Vignesh Rao, students in the Cornell Engineering master’s program in computer science; and doctoral student Jeff Sward.

The project, “Predicting the Environmental Performance of Power Plants Using Machine Learning,” will apply the machine learning model to air pollution monitoring data from the EPA’s Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) to predict emissions rates from fossil fuel-burning power plants. The group will develop the model further to identify anomalies in CAMD data to enhance the quality of the data.

According to the EPA, most of the fossil fuel-fired, electricity-generating units in the U.S. submit quarterly reports on their hourly nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions, along with operating parameters such as hourly heat input and gross electricity generation.

“Electronic data auditing involves a massive data set,” Zhang said. “Any power plant larger than 25 megawatts in the United States, including generators at Cornell, is equipped with the continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS). To maintain the quality of the data is very important for the environment, and we will develop a better data-driven tool to improve the quality of the CEMS data.”

Zhang said his lab initially developed the machine learning model for emissions as part of a project funded by the NewYork State Energy Research and Development Authority to evaluate the impact of clean energy initiatives in the state. “The timing was perfect to compete for this EmPOWER Air Data Challenge,” he said, “because we had some results already.”

The EPA and the Sibley School have signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the project, to be completed by June 2020. One of the agency’s goals is to advance power sector-related research and knowledge.

The Cornell team will work with and have direct support from EPA staff, experts and peers in the research community, to assist with CAMD tools and data analysis.

The EPA selected three winning EmPOWER projects for the 2019-20 academic year, including Zhang’s. The others chosen are at the Georgia Institute of Technology, on data engagement in the classroom; and the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Oregon, a joint project applying satellite data on pollution to estimate health impacts from a decline in coal emissions.

Zhang sees Cornell’s EmPOWER project as a good opportunity for students to gain practical experience working with a government agency on environmental issues.

“I have a number of computer science students working in my lab this academic year. They are all very motivated to make a real-world impact,” he said. “I’d welcome computer science and engineering students to look at what we’re doing and join us for socially relevant research projects.”"
DOJ watchdog says assistant US attorney admitted to eating marijuana edibles,https://thehill.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/446196-doj-watchdog-says-assistant-us-attorney-admitted-to-eating-marijuana,"A Department of Justice watchdog has alleged that an assistant U.S. attorney ate marijuana edibles and did not properly disclose the use of a controlled substance on a security form, according to a new report.

The report, released Thursday by the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), said the unnamed assistant U.S. attorney self-reported to the OIG that they possessed, transported and consumed the edibles in August or September 2016 for back pain.

The attorney's spouse allegedly threatened to report the use to the Justice Department during a marital dispute because they assumed the attorney had not disclosed it on their Questionnaire for National Security Positions form, according to the OIG report.

The report stated that the attorney noted that when they submitted this form in February 2017, it erroneously said they had not used a controlled substance in the past seven years.

The Justice Department watchdog concluded the attorney violated federal and state criminal law and “lacked candor” in an interview with the OIG, during which they said their incorrect responses on the form were inadvertent. Federal and state authorities opted against any criminal prosecution.

The OIG noted that it has provided its report to the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility and to the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys “for action they deem appropriate.”

“As Director I take any allegation of AUSA misconduct very seriously,"" James A. Crowell IV, director of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, said in a statement to The Hill. ""Due to the Privacy Act I cannot comment further on personnel matters.”
