Nancy Pelosi told Dems she wants to see Trump 'in prison': report,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brie Stimson', 'Remark Attributed To House Speaker Nancy Pelosi', 'According To A Report']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nancy-pelosi-says-she-want-to-see-trump-in-prison-report,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told senior Democrats on Tuesday that she ultimately wants to see President Trump “in prison,” according to a report.

The speaker reportedly made the remark while defending her stance against impeaching the president in an evening meeting with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler and other top Democrats, according to Politico.

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” she said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel also reportedly attended the meeting.

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.” — Remark attributed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, according to a report

IMPEACHMENT DAM BREAKING AS PELOSI DEPUTIES TIP HAND: ‘WE’VE ALREADY BEGUN’

Pelosi wants to hold the president accountable, the sources said, but thinks voters should get him out of office in 2020, after which he could possibly face criminal charges.

Nadler and dozens of Democrats have been pressing Pelosi to hold impeachment hearings, but the speaker reportedly believes there should be public and bipartisan support to launch the process, according to Politico.

Pelosi has previously said the president’s actions “are villainous to the Constitution of the United States.""

A Pelosi spokesperson told the New York Post the lawmakers “had a productive meeting about the state of play with the Mueller report. They agreed to keep all options on the table and continue to move forward with an aggressive hearing and legislative strategy, as early as next week, to address the president’s corruption and abuses of power uncovered in the report.”

The spokesperson did not directly address whether Pelosi made the remark about Trump that was attributed to her.

Trump Administration Sharply Curtails Fetal Tissue Medical Research,https://www.nytimes.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/fetal-tissue-research.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced Wednesday that the federal government would sharply curtail federal spending on medical research that uses tissue from aborted fetuses, mainly by ending fetal-tissue research within the National Institutes of Health.

The move goes a long way toward fulfilling a top goal of anti-abortion groups that have lobbied hard for it; it is just the latest in a string of decisions that have pleased such groups. But scientists say the tissue is crucial for studies that benefit millions of patients.

Besides ending N.I.H. research, the Department of Health and Human Services said it would immediately cancel a $2 million-a-year contract with the University of California, San Francisco, for research involving fetal tissue from abortions; the contract started in 2013. Other university research projects would be subject to case-by-case review.

“Promoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trump’s administration,” the department said in a statement. It added that about 200 research projects involving fetal tissue and conducted at universities with N.I.H. grants would be allowed to continue until their funding expires, but that ethics advisory boards appointed by Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, would review and recommend whether to fund future individual projects involving aborted fetal tissue."

The Fort Worth Independent School District announced Wednesday they voted 8-0 to terminate the contract of Georgia Clark.

Clark posted a string of tweets to President Trump from a now-deleted Twitter account. Clark tried to expose the school district for being ""loaded with illegal students from Mexico,"" as she wrote in one tweet, CBS Dallas / Fort Worth reported.

""Carter-Riverside High School has been taken over by them,"" Clark wrote to Mr. Trump. ""Drug dealers are on our campus and nothing was done to them.""

Georgia Clark The Fort Worth Independent School District

Clark asked the president for a contact in Fort Worth ""who should be actively investigating & removing illegals that are in the public school system."" The teacher admitted to the tweets, CBS Dallas Fort Worth reported.

CBS Dallas/Fort Worth reporter Erin Jones shared screenshots of several tweets Clark sent to the president.

Superintendent Kent Scribner addressed the offensive tweets in a message to parents last week.

""There has been much talk in the news and on the Internet about the use of social media by our staff,"" Scribner wrote. ""Our mission is to prepare ALL students for success in college, career and community leadership. Let me reiterate our commitment that every child in the District is welcome and is to be treated with dignity and respect.""

""I've lived in an America where abortions were illegal and understand this: Women still got abortions,” Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, told host MSNBC's Chris Hayes. “Now, some got lucky on what happened and some got really unlucky on what happened.""

Warren asserted that the Hyde Amendment disproportionately affects poor women.

“Women of means will still have access to abortions,"" she said at Fort Wayne event. ""Who won’t will be poor women, will be working women, will be women who can’t afford to take off three days from work, will be very young women who have been raped, will be women who have been molested by someone in their own family.”

WARREN'S REBOUND? MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR REGAINS FOOTING IN POLLS

Other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates like Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Bernie Sanders of Vermont have also come out in favor of repealing the Hyde Amendment.

Biden, the former vice president and longtime U.S. senator from Delaware, voted for it in 1976 and recently said he still supports it.

In the hour-long MSNBC interview, she also said that after she finished reading the Mueller report she concluded that impeaching the president was necessary and if Trump were any other person he’d be “carried out in handcuffs.”

“Some things are bigger than politics,” she said. “This matters for our democracy — not just now, but under the next president, and the next president, and the next president."" She added that “no one is above the law.”

"An Orwellian Tale? Trump Denies, Then Confirms, ‘Nasty’ Comments About Meghan Markle",https://www.nytimes.com,['Katie Rogers'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/meghan-markle-nasty-trump.html,"WASHINGTON — By the time he left London on Wednesday, President Trump somehow ended his state visit there a full 360 degrees from where he started. Which was referring to the Duchess of Sussex, the American-born Meghan Markle, as “nasty.”

Assessing the perceived degree of nastiness of the duchess in an interview before he left the United States kick-started an Orwellian saga — one that the president single-handedly created, forcefully denied and then revived again just before jetting off for the next leg of his European tour.

The fracas began with an interview with the British tabloid The Sun last weekend, when Mr. Trump was recorded saying that he was not aware that the duchess had made “nasty” comments about him during the 2016 presidential campaign.

“What can I say?” Mr. Trump said. “I didn’t know that she was nasty.”

It was not the way previous American presidents have let the British know they were coming. The reaction to a sitting president commenting on the perceived nastiness of a member of Queen Elizabeth’s family — who put on a state dinner at Buckingham Palace, to impress and placate him — was reliably parsed along tribal lines."
"Anti-China sentiment is rising in Washington and Beijing needs to pay attention, former US official says",https://www.cnbc.com,['Weizhen Tan'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/06/anti-china-sentiment-and-trade-war-could-cause-growth-slowdown-expert.html,"Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Anti-China sentiment is rising in Washington — and Beijing should not underestimate that, a former under secretary for international affairs at the U.S. Department of Treasury said on Thursday.

""I worry that Chinese authorities ... underestimate how broadly the anti-Chinese sentiment is in Washington — it runs across the full political spectrum,"" said Tim Adams, who is now president and chief executive of the Institute of International Finance (IIF), a trade association.

Even though the current administration is the one that has led the charge on the trade war with China, he said, ""almost all"" the 24 Democrats running for president in 2020 have ""some sort of anti-Chinese sentiment"" — whether it be trade or something larger.

""Washington has become decidedly anti-China,"" Adams told CNBC at the IIF meeting in Tokyo on Thursday.

Similarly, he is concerned that Washington does not understand the rhetoric from Beijing.

""I worry that there are those in Washington who think they understand the Chinese mindset, and that they can force President Xi Jinping to bend (to) the will of Washington's desires, and maybe not appreciate ... the rhetoric coming out of China, "" he said.

His comments come as skirmishes between the world's two major powers intensified in recent weeks.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced in early May that tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would go up from 10% to 25%. The U.S. has also started looking into whether another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods will be subjected to tariffs. China responded with its own levies on $60 billion of American imports.

Last week, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanhui said that provoking trade disputes amounted to ""naked economic terrorism. "" Chinese media also warned the U.S. that Beijing could cut off industrially significant rare earth minerals as a retaliatory measure in the escalating trade battle.

Both sides have ramped up the battle on the tech and education fronts as well.

On Tuesday, China issued a warning to its citizens about working, studying and traveling in America, noting that the U.S. has recently placed certain restrictions on some Chinese student visas.

Adams warned that the world powers could make ""miscalculations"" as tensions ramp up, and that could trigger a growth slowdown.

Turning to the U.S. economy, he said: ""I don't think the economy is going to hit a wall anytime soon, unless we make serious policy mistakes — which we're capable of doing.""

However, he pointed out that there could be ""miscalculations"" in Washington, Beijing and other capitals, where trade and nationalism are concerned, and that could ""potentially trip us into a lower growth trajectory."""

""These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,"" Reagan said in a speech on the 40th anniversary.

Reagan’s predecessor, President Jimmy Carter, actually was the first U.S. president to visit the site, in 1978, but his visit did not coincide with the anniversary.

Many presidents since Reagan have continued the tradition of visiting on the anniversary, an act of remembrance for the lives lost that day and to celebrate their contribution to the ultimate victory of the allied forces.

Ten years after Reagan’s visit marking the 40th anniversary, President Bill Clinton also made the pilgrimage.

Forces Out Official Who Worked on Plan That Led to Ex-Employer’s Arms Deals,https://www.wsj.com,"['Dion Nissenbaum', 'Alex Leary', 'Dion.Nissenbaum Wsj.Com', 'Alex.Leary Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-dept-forces-out-official-who-worked-on-plan-that-led-to-ex-employers-arms-deals-11559772745,"The State Department has forced out a senior official who played a role in crafting a plan that led to billions of dollars going to the defense firm he formerly represented as a lobbyist, according to current and former U.S. officials.

Charles Faulkner, who previously represented Raytheon Co., took part in an unusual Trump administration move to declare an emergency over tensions with Iran to fast-track $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, circumventing normal congressional review, these people said.

He resigned as a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department in early May after working on efforts leading to the emergency declaration, these people said.

Mr. Faulkner’s role in the process has raised concerns in Congress, where Democratic lawmakers want to know if Mr. Faulkner violated Trump administration ethics rules by taking part in discussions on the declaration, which cleared the way for Raytheon’s $2 billion deal to sell precision-guided missiles to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

“Should he be making decisions about arms sales he was working on before he came to government?” asked a congressional aide.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans a hearing on next Wednesday on the State Department decisions, according to the panel, and Mr. Faulkner’s role is expected to be a focus of the questioning.

Mr. Faulkner has been a polarizing figure, according to the current and former officials at the State Department, where he served for the last two years as both deputy assistant secretary and acting assistant secretary for legislative affairs, which manages relations with Congress.

Mr. Faulkner declined to comment, referring questions to the State Department, where officials said they couldn't comment on personnel matters.

Amid the rising tensions with Iran, the State Department sought ways to push through the stalled arms sales to the Gulf, according to the current and former U.S. officials.

Related Trump Invokes Emergency Arms Sales Authority to Counter Iran (May 24)

Under a new U.S. law, Secretary of State Pompeo had to order a suspension of some American military support to the Saudi-led coalition unless he assured Congress in writing that the Gulf nation was doing enough to minimize civilian casualties in Yemen.

At the time, Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) had placed a legislative freeze on Raytheon’s $2 billion proposal to sell 120,000 precision guided missiles to the two Gulf allies in the midst of concerns about their use of American weapons in Yemen.

In last year’s debate, Mr. Faulkner and the legislative affairs team were the only ones to urge Mr. Pompeo to certify that Saudi Arabia was doing enough to satisfy U.S. concerns, according to people familiar with the decision.

Mr. Faulkner and the legislative affairs unit said a failure to do so would jeopardize pending arms sales to the Gulf, which included the stalled Raytheon deals, these people said.

At the time, Mr. Pompeo overruled most others on his team and sided with Mr. Faulkner and the legislative team, these people said, and issued the emergency declaration certifying that Saudi Arabia satisfied U.S. concerns about civilian casualties in the conflict.

Since then, members of Congress have expressed increasing alarm about America’s support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen.

More than 10,000 civilians have been killed by the Saudi-led coalition, according to the U.N., and Congress recently voted to cut off all American support to the Gulf countries amid concerns that they weren’t doing enough to minimize civilian casualties in airstrikes using U.S.-manufactured missiles. Mr. Trump vetoed the measure.

Saudi Arabia’s standing in Washington has also been hit by the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and Washington Post writer killed last year by a Saudi hit team at the country’s consulate in Istanbul.

Mr. Trump has been a steadfast advocate of arms sales to allies in the Middle East. When he defended his close ties with Saudi Arabia after Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, he cited arms sales as a major reason.

Newsletter Sign-up

In a statement in November, he wrote, referring to the military needs of Gulf allies: “$110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be enormous beneficiaries – and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business.”

U.S. lawmakers question Mr. Faulkner’s work on the arms sales and want to know if he violated government ethics rules by working on a decision that directly affects Raytheon.

Mr. Faulkner took part in more recent discussions over whether the department should use the emergency provisions of the arms export control laws to fast-track arms sales to Middle East allies, according to the current and former U.S. officials.

He already was preparing to leave the State Department when the discussions over the arms sales arose, the officials said. But his work on the issue contributed to his departure on May 10, the officials said.

The Trump administration required political appointees like Mr. Faulkner to sign ethics pledges that bar former lobbyists from working on issues “directly or substantially related” to former clients for two years while serving in government.

The administration has granted some limited waivers to the pledge, but Mr. Faulkner’s name does not appear on an administration waiver list.

On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Mr. Menendez, announced plans to try and halt the arms sales. The 22 senators said they would work to convince Congress to reject the deals if Mr. Pompeo doesn’t withdraw his decision, potentially setting up a new showdown with the White House.

“We have an obligation to ensure the adequate guardrails are in place and that weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates do not exacerbate the [Yemen] conflict,” said Sen. Todd Young, (R., Ind.). “Iran remains the world’s leading state sponsor of terror, but the current threats that have been briefed to members of Congress do not justify taking this dramatic step.”

Mr. Menendez, in a statement, said: “We will not stand idly by and allow the president or the secretary of State to further erode congressional review and oversight of arm sales.”

"CNN analyst Mudd: Christopher Steele should not talk to DOJ, could turn into 'car wreck'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cnn-phil-mudd-christopher-steele-should-not-talk-to-doj,"A former FBI official and frequent critic of President Trump said Tuesday that Christopher Steele should avoid being questioned by the Justice Department, warning it could turn out disastrously for the former British spy.

Phil Mudd was responding on CNN to reports that Steele agreed to be questioned by investigators about his salacious and unverified dossier on Trump's ties to Russia.

Steele's interview would reportedly happen within weeks in London and it would come on the heels of Attorney General Bill Barr appointing a U.S. attorney to review the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.

The DOJ inspector general is also looking into how Steele's Democrat-funded dossier was used by the FBI to secure surveillance warrants for a former Trump campaign adviser in 2016, despite questions about its credibility.

BLACK LIVES MATTER ACTIVIST SHAUN KING SAYS MANAFORT DOESN'T DESERVE RIKERS

Mudd said this could turn into a ""car wreck"" for Steele if he goes forward.

""If you go to car races looking for car wrecks, this is significant. This will be a car wreck,"" said Mudd, doubting whether Steele will have sufficient answers on how he compiled the dossier.

NEW STRZOK-PAGE TEXTS REVEAL OTHERS WERE 'LEAKING LIKE MAD' IN LEAD UP TO TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE

“I can’t believe he has perfect answers about the origins of the Steele dossier. I’m not even sure why he’s showing up. If I were him, I’d go to Disney World. I would not go to the Department of Justice, because it will not end up well,"" he said.

Mudd then speculated that Steele wants to be interviewed in an attempt to clear his name so he can resume doing the same kind of work in the private sector.

“Let me give you how this game ends. Christopher Steele shows up in front of the Department of Justice and I’m guessing doesn’t have terrific answers for the quality of the information in that Steele dossier,” said Mudd.

Republicans have long accused former FBI officials of relying too heavily on Steele's dossier in 2016, when a counterintelligence investigation was launched into the Trump campaign."
V.A. Prepares for Major Shift in Veterans’ Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jennifer Steinhauer'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/va-health-care-veterans.html,"In the 2018 fiscal year, 1.7 million veterans used some form of private care. That number, based on the department’s eligibility projections, could increase as much as 30 percent under the new Mission Act, adding just over a half-million veterans to the pool seeking private care — although both critics and supporters of the change believe that number is low.

“I think it’s safe to assume that over the next several years you will see more veterans getting their health care in the community,” said Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America — an advocacy group with ties to the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch — which has pursued expanding the use of private health care for veterans. Democrats on Capitol Hill agree.

Even so, it will take some time to see whether the expanded access to private care results in a gentle migration of veterans who are not being well served by nearby V.A. centers, or in a shift of a significant share of veteran care to an increasingly expensive private health care marketplace, starving the V.A., as critics have warned. The quality of care in the private system, as well as wait times within it, will be closely monitored by both opponents and supporters of private care.

“I don’t expect a flood of veterans coming in tomorrow or next week saying I want to go into the private sector,” Robert Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, said Tuesday in an interview. “I’m confident that we will have a good rollout. I’m looking forward to it.” Mr. Wilkie said he will visit the V.A. in Salem, Va., on Thursday to observe the start there.

Mr. Wilkie has repeatedly said that most veterans would continue to seek care at department health care centers because they largely like the care and the understanding of veterans’ issues. Several studies underscore the V.A.’s popularity."
Why Trump's Vietnam comments matter on D-Day,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/d-day-anniversary-us-presidents-service/index.html,"(CNN) On the 75th anniversary of a defining battle of the defining war of human history so far, it's clear that military service has never been less important to American voters.

Six US presidents served overseas during World War II, but none since President George H.W. Bush have gone abroad, if they served at all. At this point, we might get a President who served in Afghanistan or Iraq -- that's South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard or Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton -- but it's almost certain the US will never have a commander-in-chief who served in Vietnam.

It has had three, including Trump, who found a way around the draft. That's old news, but it doesn't mean Trump won't still have to answer questions about it, as he did in Wednesday's interview with the British journalist Piers Morgan, who asked him if he would have liked to have served.

Trump ""was never a fan"" of Vietnam

The interview was conducted in the underground bunker where Winston Churchill led the British government during the Blitz and World War II.

""Do you wish you'd been able to serve? Would you have liked to serve your country?"" Morgan asked.

Trump replied by questioning Vietnam, mirroring some of the anti-war sentiment of the '60s and '70s.

""Well I was never a fan of that war. I'll be honest with you. I thought it was a terrible war. I thought it was very far away. Nobody ever -- you're talking about Vietnam at that time and nobody ever heard of the country,"" Trump said, adding the non sequitur that, today, the government of Vietnam has been successful negotiating in global trade.

He went on to say that he wasn't active in protesting the war as a young man, but he didn't think the US should ever have taken part.

""But, uh, nobody heard of Vietnam and then say well what are we doing. So many people dying. So I was never a fan of -- this isn't like I'm fighting against Nazi Germany. I'm fighting -- we're fighting against Hitler. And I was like a lot of people. Now I wasn't out in the streets marching. I wasn't saying, you know, I'm going to move to Canada, which a lot of people did. But no, I was not a fan of that war. That war was not something that we should have been involved in.""

Making up for lack of service with spending

When Morgan followed up, Trump said he's making up for his lack of military service by being President.

""Would you have liked to have served generally - perhaps in another (way)?"" Morgan asked.

""I would not have minded that at all. I would have been honored. But I think I make up for it now. I mean look, $700 billion I gave last year and then this year $716 billion and I think I'm making up for it rapidly because we are rebuilding our military at a level that it's never seen before.""

This deserves a quick fact check. Trump did not personally give the military $700 billion or $716 billion. Congress did, when it passed appropriations bills last year. Trump signed them, and it is his administration's responsibility to now spend the money.

But it says something about how he views his role as President and the dismissive way he's treated Congress and its responsibilities, that he takes personal credit for spending taxpayer money.

It's also more than a bit awkward for him to argue that the military will be built up to a level it's never seen before under him when he's preparing to commemorate D-Day, when the entire country was mobilized in the war effort. More than 16 million Americans served in World War II from a US population of around 140 million in 1940. It was a total war, even for the US, which was far from any of the front lines.

Fewer Americans serve

The portion of the population that served in World War II is much larger than the portion that served during Vietnam, when more than 8.7 million Americans were in the military from a population of 203 million in 1970.

Despite the conflict in Afghanistan lasting longer than any in US history, fewer and fewer Americans have served in the military. The VA does not list a total number of service members during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but there are currently about 1.3 million people in the military, coming from a population of close to 341 million, according to Census projections

6 Presidents served overseas in World War II

In the years after World War II, military service was almost a prerequisite for politicians and presidents for generations during and after World War II. Dwight Eisenhower, who was Supreme Allied Commander during World War II and gave the order for D-Day 75 years ago, went on to serve two terms as President. He ended hostilities in the Korean War shortly after taking office.

No more.

No presidents with Vietnam service

Three of the last four US presidents -- Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Trump -- had no military service at all. George W. Bush was a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard -- his way around Vietnam.

Two other politicians who were of military age during Vietnam are running against Trump as Democrats. They also deferred military service or sought to be exempt. All three are in their 70s, which makes it likely this is the last presidential election in which a Vietnam-era politician will be featured.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent who is running for President as a Democrat, applied to be a conscientious objector during Vietnam . The application was ultimately rejected, but he was too old to be drafted at that point. In 2015, he said during a CNN debate that he's no longer a pacifist.

Two other politicians who came of age during Vietnam are running in the Democratic primary. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee received a student deferment and had a high draft number for his birth year, as did former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper

Plenty of Vietnam veterans have sought the White House, including medal of honor winner Bob Kerrey, who did not get very far. Several Vietnam veterans got their party's nomination, including Al Gore, John Kerry and John McCain.

Since the election of Bill Clinton over decorated former military pilot and wartime president George H.W. Bush in 1992, American voters have shown that avoiding service during Vietnam is not a dealbreaker.

A new generation of warrior politicians

A real question in 2020 is whether it's a desirable plus. There has been no draft since Vietnam, and there have been many fewer Americans serving in the military.

But there are multiple younger presidential aspirants who volunteered for the military and served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Gabbard has made her military service a centerpiece of her campaign and cites it as the impetus for her platform of disentangling the US from foreign conflicts.

Democrats are now reportedly looking into whether Faulkner violated Trump’s ethics rules by partaking in the discussions on the declaration, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee will scrutinize Faulkner’s actions at a hearing scheduled for next week. Faulkner reportedly declined to comment."
Interior has 5 versions of the secretary's schedule -- but they don't always match,https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/david-bernhardt-conflicting-calendars-interior/index.html,"Washington (CNN) During the early days of the Trump administration, lawmakers and government watchdogs complained agencies weren't turning over Cabinet secretaries' schedules as has been practice. Now, one department has presented those groups with the opposite problem, creating new questions about a lack of consistency and transparency.

The Interior Department has released five different versions of Secretary David Bernhardt's schedule for the first five months of 2019.

The department released Google calendar entries, two versions of daily cards -- which are synopses of the secretary's calendar given to him as a reminder of upcoming events, according to Interior -- briefing book pages and secretary's schedules, which are released on the same section of the Interior website as press releases.

But many of these sources give conflicting information when compared side by side on any given day.

With none of the five sources apparently being the definitive record, it raises questions about what the secretary is actually using to schedule his days and why the public doesn't have access to it.

Conflicting schedules

Take January 10 of this year.

At 9:30 a.m., Bernhardt had a meeting titled ""deputy secretary lapse working group."" Or did he? That information comes from his Google calendar entry, a schedule page and the daily cards for that day. So, it seems clear.

But the briefing book entry for the day says Bernhardt attended a staff meeting at that time. Is that the same meeting or a different one?

Then, according to the briefing book, he had two vaguely described entries -- another staff meeting at 11 a.m. and an ""external lunch off the record"" at noon.

So, what do the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page have at that time? No mention of an 11 a.m. meeting, but an additional 11:45 a.m. meeting with Matt Pottinger and Eric Johnson (NSC) and no mention of a 12 p.m. lunch but a 12:30 p.m. meeting with Brian Jack (OPA), according to the Google calendar and daily cards. NSC stands for the National Security Council and OPA stands for Office of Political Affairs, an office in the White House. The department schedule page seems to confirm that information in a more opaque way, listing an 11:45 a.m. meeting with NSC and a 12:30 p.m. meeting with OPA.

Depending on which calendar you pick, at 2 p.m., Bernhardt either had a meeting with ""Bremberg & Leggit (DPC)"" according to the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page, or he had an ""external call - TRCP,"" according to the briefing book. TRCP stands for Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. A spokesperson for the group confirmed that a member of their organization had a phone call with Bernhardt on that day and time.

At 4:15 p.m., Bernhardt was either in a staff meeting, according to his Google calendar and secretary's schedule page, or he was in an ""AS/WS Operations Meeting,"" according to two versions of the daily cards for that day.

Maybe those are the same, since an operations meeting would presumably be with staff. And that's just one day.

""Like most (if not all) of us, the Secretary of the Interior has a daily schedule that is subject to constant change,"" Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said.

""Appointments that were expected get canceled, unexpected appointments arise and plans get interrupted by events. The department seeks to ensure that the public has access to the secretary's activities by posting online the various tools used to plan his day by different staff members,"" Block said. ""We are constantly working to ensure that the public has a window into the work the secretary is doing on behalf of the American people.""

Five calendars, no consensus

Not all of the calendars conflict every day. On certain days, all five versions of Bernhardt's schedule line up. In some cases, external meetings that don't include meeting attendees on the daily cards have meeting attendees listed in the secretary's schedule page for the same day. Since mid-March, versions of the secretary's schedule pages have included more names of meeting participants.

But there are too many discrepancies to know what the secretary is doing other days. On February 21, there are at least three discrepancies between the name or subject of the meeting, and another 10 instances of meetings and departure times not listed on all the calendars.

And it's not just the entries themselves that don't line up. The different sources of Bernhardt's scheduling information don't cover all five months of 2019. The department posted Google calendar entries from January to May, two versions of daily cards from January to April 16, briefing book pages from January to March and webpages with the the secretary's schedule page from January to March and April 28 to May 24.

The Center for Western Priorities, a watchdog group that focuses on environmental issues and has been critical of the Trump administration, feels the deluge of contradictory information is not just a matter of sloppy record keeping, but rather a concerted effort to conceal the secretary's activities from the public.

""Despite numerous requests from the public, the press, and Congress, David Bernhardt still refuses to release his actual calendar -- the one that tells him not just where to go, but what his meetings are about,"" Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss told CNN. ""It's not just a lack of transparency. It's Bernhardt taking repeated steps to conceal his actions.""

Some of the entries include vague terms like ""external"" and ""internal"" meeting, which Bernhardt has been criticized for in the past, because it gives little insight into who he's meeting with and for what purpose they're meeting.

A CNN review found 88 entries in Bernhardt's daily cards that use the term ""external"" or ""intergovernmental"" to describe a meeting without any further details.

""No one keeps a day planner that only says 'internal briefing' and 'external meeting' with no details. You simply couldn't' function,"" Weiss said.

Calendar controversy continues

Bernhardt, a former fossil fuel lobbyist, previously came under scrutiny from watchdog groups and Democratic members of Congress for not releasing his full schedule publicly. When asked by the House Natural Resources Committee to provide his complete schedule earlier this year, Bernhardt said he had ""not personally maintained a calendar for years,"" and that he had ""no intention of doing so now,"" in a letter to the committee.

A week before his confirmation vote in the Senate, Interior published hundreds of pages of documents containing new details about some meetings that were left off of previous versions of Bernahrdt's calendars.

The House Oversight Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee requested interviews with four Interior staff members to further investigate recordkeeping practices at the department in March.

Before becoming secretary, Bernhardt served as deputy secretary to former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. When Zinke resigned amid a host of ethics scandals at the end of 2018, Bernhardt stepped in to lead the agency in an acting role and was confirmed to the post in April.

When Zinke announced his resignation in December, he referred to the allegations against him as ""false.""

""I love working for the President and am incredibly proud of all the good work we've accomplished together,"" Zinke wrote on Twitter. ""However, after 30 years of public service, I cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations."""
"DOJ reveals Dems acknowledged Barr subpoena was 'overbroad'; Nadler fires back, offers to meet 'without conditions'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-fires-back-after-house-dems-announce-barr-contempt-vote-dubs-subpoena-unworkably-overbroad,"Hours after the Department of Justice (DOJ) slammed House Democrats for planning a contempt vote against Attorney General Bill Barr -- and charged that Democrats had privately admitted their subpoena requests were ""overbroad"" -- House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler announced late Tuesday that he is open to negotiating with the DOJ ""without conditions.""

The remarkable turn of events reopened the possibility that Barr's contempt vote may be postponed or canceled, if both sides return to the negotiating table. Nadler, however, pointedly refused to cancel the planned contempt vote prior to beginning any new negotiations, as the DOJ had demanded.

At the same time, Nadler criticized what he called DOJ ""brinksmanship,"" and blamed the Justice Department for purportedly cutting off negotiations on May 7.

The brouhaha began Tuesday morning with a DOJ letter, written by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, that blasted House Democrats and Nadler, D-N.Y., for announcing they would vote next week on whether to hold Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SCHOLAR: CONGRESS HEADING INTO 'WORLD OF HURT' WITH BARR CONTEMPT VOTE

In its letter to Nadler, the DOJ publicly revealed that Democrats had acknowledged in a May 24 letter they were open to ""further negotiations"" regarding concerns that their subpoena demands were ""unworkably overbroad."" Nevertheless, Democrats announced just days later their plans to hold Barr in contempt for allegedly failing to comply with those demands.

The DOJ said it was ""prepared to resume negotiations with the committee regarding accommodation of its narrowed Subpoena"" -- as long as Democrats removed the ""threat of an imminent vote by the House of Representatives to hold the attorney general in contempt.""

""The department was disappointed by the committee's abrupt termination of ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching a reasonable accommodation that respects both sides' legitimate interests regarding the materials sought,"" Boyd wrote to Nadler. ""Further, the department is disappointed by news reports indicating that Democratic leaders have scheduled a contempt vote in the House of Representatives for June 11, 2019.""

In his response late Tuesday, Nadler took issue with the DOJ's characterization of Democrats' May 24 letter, and insisted that Democrats had ""always remained open to continuing negotiations. ... We are here and ready to negotiate as early as tomorrow morning.""

""I ... take exception to your characterization of how our prior accommodation efforts ended,"" Nadler wrote back to Boyd. ""Contrary to the account in your letter, the Committee has always remained open to continuing negotiations. We had an offer on the table late on the evening of May 7 when the Department suddenly declared an end to the accommodation process. My staff was still in their offices after the close of business hours awaiting a counteroffer when the Department broke off negotiations with a letter demanding that the contempt vote—scheduled to begin the next day— be cancelled if we wished to proceed with the accommodations process.""

Nadler continued: ""At any rate, we are ready to proceed without conditions—as shown by the initiative we took with our detailed May 24 offer. I should add that, contrary to your argument that the Committee’s continuing accommodation efforts somehow suggest that our prior requests were overbroad, our offer to compromise was intended to respond to your prior objections by seeking a middle ground. We urge the Department to do the same.""

The DOJ's letter, meanwhile, had called on the House Judiciary Committee to ""moot"" its May 8 vote to hold Barr in contempt, which the DOJ called ""premature and unnecessary."" That vote came after congressional Democrats subpoenaed Mueller's full and unredacted report on his probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.

WHY DID MUELLER EDIT TRANSCRIPT OF VOICEMAIL WITH FLYNN LAWYER TO ELIMINATE KEY DISCLAIMERS?

Republicans have countered that federal law protecting secretive grand-jury information would prevent Barr from turning over the entirety of the report. The DOJ has offered Democrats the opportunity to review the report, minus those grand jury-related redactions, in a secure setting -- but those offers have been rebuffed. (In a rare public statement last week, Mueller specifically remarked, ""I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith"" in deciding to make the report ""largely public."")

""It would hardly make sense for the full House of Representatives to act upon the committee's prior recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt for not complying with a subpoena that even the committee now appears to acknowledge was overbroad in seeking immediate disclosure of the entirety of the special counsel's investigative files,” Boyd wrote.

That was a conspicuous reference to the previously unreported May 24 letter to the DOJ, in which the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wrote to privately emphasize ""the Committee's willingness to engage in further negotiations to resolve this dispute"" -- only to resort to public political posturing, the DOJ charged.

The Democrat-led committee also offered to ""identify specific materials that if produced would be deemed to satisfy the subpoena"" in an effort to make the subpoena more workable, according to the DOJ, which quoted the Committee's letter verbatim.

""In your May 24, 2019, letter, the committee appears to recognize that the subpoena is unworkably overbroad and offers -- for the first time -- to narrow the subpoena's scope to cover a much more limited set of documents,"" the DOJ wrote. ""The department believes that the committee's new offer reflects a more reasonable request and could mitigate some of the legal barriers to disclosure that we have discussed.""

ANALYSIS: BARR DETERMINED TO FIND TRUTH BEHIND ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE -- AND DEMS ARE WORRIED

The letter continued: ""The committee held its contempt vote only 19 days after issuing the subpoena. Traditionally, congressional committees have only proceeded with contempt votes after lengthy periods of negotiations have failed to reach an accommodation. For example, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee negotiated with the department over the Operation Fast and Furious subpoena for months, and only voted to cite Attorney General [Eric] Holder for contempt 252 days after issuing its subpoena.""

Since 1975, according to the DOJ, ""committees and subcommittees have averaged 103 days between issuing a subpoena to an executive branch official and holding a contempt vote. By any measure, the committee rushed its decision and bears responsibility for the termination of the accommodation process.”

But in his letter, Nadler took issues with those characterizations.

""We cannot agree that the House’s sense of urgency here is 'premature and unnecessary,'"" Nadler wrote. ""It has been over 100 days since we first initiated the accommodations process on February 22, 2019. The pace with which we are proceeding is consistent with the exceptional urgency of this matter: an attack on our elections that was welcomed by our President and benefitted his campaign, followed by acts of obstruction by the President designed to interfere with the investigation of that attack. All of this misconduct was documented by the Special Counsel in the documents we now seek.""

In a statement, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., highlighted the DOJ's revelation that Nadler apparently signaled a willingness to work with the DOJ.

“After racing to hold Attorney General Barr in contempt, Chairman Nadler finally seems ready to join the Justice Department at the negotiating table,"" Collins said. ""When Judiciary Democrats wield subpoena power like a sword instead of a plow, their investigations bear little fruit. The House Intelligence Committee has shown us that working with the Justice Department in good faith yields documents. Abusing subpoena and contempt authority, however, has left the Judiciary Committee with little to show for its obsessively unreasonable demands.""

As for McGahn, the White House has instructed its former top lawyer not to testify, saying he is legally immune from being compelled to testify about privileged discussions occurring in the course of his official duties. Democrats have responded that McGahn waived that privilege by agreeing to speak to Mueller.

Trump did not assert executive privilege to shield any aspect of the Mueller report itself, and has derided Democrats' efforts as politically motivated attempts to keep what he's called the ""Russia collusion hoax"" alive -- and to distract from or derail -- Barr's own ongoing probes into Justice Department and FBI misconduct.

News of the planned contempt vote came days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation. Last month, Barr appointed the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, John Durham, to lead the investigation, which is to focus on the use of FBI informants and the alleged improper issuance of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to monitor a variety of individuals, including former Trump aide Carter Page.

A Barr contempt vote would be historic, but not unprecedented. In 2012, the GOP-controlled House's vote to hold the attorney general at that time, Holder, in contempt for failing to comply with investigations into the Obama administration's failed gun-running sting operation, ""Fast and Furious."" Holder became the first-ever sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress in that manner.

The resolution scheduled for a June 11 floor vote would allow the Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement of its subpoenas in federal court.

Such an approach would rule out so-called ""inherent contempt,"" a process in which Congress technically can enforce contempt citations on its own -- whether by arrest or fine. In May, Barr reportedly joked about that possibility with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, asking, ""Did you bring your handcuffs?""

DOE offers plan to speed nuclear waste cleanup at SRS,https://www.thestate.com,"['The State', 'The Associated Press']",,,,https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article231181298.html,"The Savannah River Site near Aiken is home to deadly high-level nuclear waste File photograph

The U.S. Department of Energy is proposing to ship what has long been considered some of the world’s most deadly nuclear waste from South Carolina to burial grounds in the western United States under a plan to reclassify some of the atomic refuse as less dangerous.

According to plans, the energy department would classify some of the Savannah River Site’s high-level waste as low-level waste, a type of atomic refuse that is considered less toxic. That, in turn, would allow the material to be shipped to low-level nuclear waste disposal sites in the deserts of Utah and Texas.

“We want to look at taking the waste stream in South Carolina and reclassifying it and moving it out of state,’’ said Paul Dabbar, the energy department’s undersecretary for science.





As it stands, the country does not have a high-level waste burial ground, meaning SRS must keep the deadly waste at the Aiken area weapons complex indefinitely.

The DOE’s plan for reclassifying and shipping waste from SRS is part of a larger proposal to change the definition of nuclear waste at weapons complexes in other parts of the country. The agency says it has historically considered much of the waste that resulted from Cold War weapons production to be high-level. Now, it will consider how radioactive the material is, the DOE said.

In addition to the Savannah River Site, nuclear weapons sites in Washington and Idaho that also have high level waste could benefit from the department’s plan to change the definition of nuclear waste, the agency said.

The SRS proposal and a companion plan for nuclear sites across the country, released Wednesday, drew immediate criticism from environmental groups, which said the plans are potentially dangerous.





But the Department of Energy says reclassifying some of the high level waste would occur only after a thorough analysis and environmental studies.





Federal records show the agency will look at whether 10,000 gallons of Savannah River Site wastewater should still should be classified as high level waste or downgraded to another category. For now, the DOE said it is only considering the 10,000 gallons for disposal at a licensed faciliity outside South Carolina, records show. The wastewater comes from the Defense Waste Processing Facility, an industrial plant that converts high-level waste into glass in an effort to neutralize its danger.

Reclassifying waste would speed cleanup at the Savannah River Site, the agency said. The 310-square-mile weapons complex has tons of atomic refuse left over from Cold War weapons production. Much of that waste is held in about four-dozen aging tanks, some of which have cracked. A handful of tanks have been emptied, but most still contain waste.

Nuclear waste disposal is a hot button issue in South Carolina, where leaders have expressed frustration with the Department of Energy’s failure to clean up high level atomic refuse through the years.

Gov. Henry McMaster found out about the DOE plan Monday during a phone call with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the governor’s office said. McMaster likes what he’s seen so far, spokesman Brian Symmes said.

“If the department’s study and analysis shows that this waste can be safely reclassified and transferred elsewhere, then the governor is in full support of any plan that would reduce risk in South Carolina,’’ Symmes said in an email.





Attorney General Alan Wilson’s office also said he hopes any rules change would result in the removal of radioactive waste from South Carolina.

Critics said redefining high level waste and shipping it to low level waste dumps in the West would only shift the problem from South Carolina to other communities.

Don Hancock, who follows nuclear issues for the Southwest Research and Information Center, said the plan would not go over well with some residents of Texas and Utah. Low-level waste disposal sites were not designed to take highly radioactive material.

Geoff Fettus, who tracks nuclear waste issues for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said reclassifying waste might also allow officials at SRS to avoid cleaning up some material altogether.





Fettus said that if some of the waste at SRS is no longer considered high level, the DOE could leave the material there and walk away. If that happens, it would not be the first time at SRS. In 2002, the energy department offered plans to reclassify waste so some residual material could remain in the tanks.

“That is the big thing,’’ Fettus said. “I think this is just as much about what stays in the tanks, as to what comes out.’’

Fettus said the environmental group has serious reservations about the plan being advanced by President Donald Trump.





“The Trump administration is moving to fundamentally alter more than 50 years of national consensus on how the most toxic, radioactive and dangerous waste in the world is managed and ultimately disposed of,’’ Fettus told The State newspaper. “No matter what they call it, this waste needs a permanent, well-protected disposal option to guard it for generations to come.’’

Tom Clements, who heads Savannah River Site Watch, also said the proposal is unwise and unsafe.





“DOE’s questionable rewriting of the regulations is simply a cost-cutting measure designed to get thousands of HLW (high level waste) containers dumped off site,’’ he said in an email.

Any waste that is reclassified would not be sent to South Carolina’s Barnwell County low-level nuclear waste site near SRS, but to commercial facilities near the Texas-New Mexico border and in Utah, energy officials said. The low-level Utah waste site is owned by the same company that runs the aging Barnwell County low-level waste dump, which has leaked.





“It allows us to dispose of this into facilities ... in Texas or in Utah,’’ Dabbar said.





“We are very excited about actually increasing the pace of reducing risk in South Carolina,’’ he said.

In a news release Wednesday, the DOE said the agency has for decades managed reprocessing waste streams as high level waste, regardless of how radioactive the material is. But it now plans to look at the waste more carefully to determine if some of it is less radioactive. Less dangerous material could be disposed of, according to plans.





“Recognizing this failure, this administration is proposing a responsible, results-driven solution that will finally open potential avenues for the safe treatment and removal of the lower level waste currently housed in three states,” Dabbar said in the news release. “DOE is going to analyze each waste stream and manage it in accordance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards, with the goal of getting the lower-level waste out of these states without sacrificing public safety.”





The DOE’s proposal to study reclassifying SRS waste and shipping it off-site to low-level waste dumps was released Wednesday but is part of a plan under discussion since last fall. That plan, which drew thousands of public comments, said the DOE would redefine its interpretation of high-level waste. On Wednesday, the agency department said how it would redefine the waste."
Amazon Offered Job to Pentagon Official Involved With $10 Billion Contract It Sought,https://theintercept.com,[],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://theintercept.com/2019/06/03/amazon-defense-department-jedi-contract/,"In a federal lawsuit, the tech giant Oracle has provided new details to support its accusation that Amazon secretly negotiated a job offer with a then-Department of Defense official who helped shape the procurement process for a massive federal contract for which Amazon was a key bidder.

Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are now the two finalists to win the highly contested $10 billion contract for what is known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI. The deal, one of the largest federal contracts in U.S. history, would pay one company to provide cloud computing services in support of Defense Department operations around the world.

But the contract has been hotly contested since the department began soliciting proposals last year. Two of Amazon’s competitors, IBM and Oracle, filed complaints with the Government Accountability Office saying that the winner-take-all process unfairly favored Amazon, which is seen as an industry leader in cloud computing. When its claim was rejected, Oracle sued the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

Since the court battle began in 2018, Oracle has aggressively lodged conflict-of-interest accusations involving a former DOD official named Deap Ubhi, who left the department in 2017 to take a job at Amazon. In a court motion filed on Friday, Oracle alleged that while Ubhi worked on the preliminary research for the JEDI program in the late summer and fall of 2017, he was also engaged in a secret job negotiation with Amazon for months, complete with salary discussions, offers of signing bonuses, and lucrative stock options.

The motion further alleges that Ubhi did not recuse himself from the JEDI program until weeks after verbally accepting a job offer from Amazon and that he continued to receive information about Amazon’s competitors and participate in meetings about technical requirements, despite a government regulation that forbids such conflicts of interest.

“Neither Ubhi nor [Amazon Web Services] disclosed the employment discussions or job offer to DOD — not when the employment discussions started, not when the informal job offer occurred, not when the formal offer occurred, and not even when Ubhi accepted the offer,” Oracle’s motion reads.

As America’s technology companies have continued to outpace the Pentagon, the Defense Department has looked to recruit talent from Silicon Valley to help enhance its information technology.

Ubhi is a venture capitalist and technology entrepreneur who worked for Amazon before his time in government. He took a job working on a Defense Department initiative aimed at collaborating with Silicon Valley to modernize the Pentagon’s information technology systems. After working as part of a four-person team to help shape the Pentagon JEDI procurement process, he left the department and returned to Amazon in November 2017.

A spokesperson for Amazon Web Services declined to comment and declined to make Ubhi available for an interview, citing ongoing litigation. Elissa Smith, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense, also told The Intercept that “we don’t comment on pending litigation.”

In a previous court filing, U.S. government lawyers accused Oracle of a “broad fishing expedition primarily [intended] to find support for its claim that the solicitation at issue is tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.”

According to Oracle’s motion on Friday, Ubhi began job negotiations with Amazon in August 2017, while he was working on the early stages of the JEDI program. Oracle claims says that “deep discussions” about employment began in late September and that Ubhi “verbally committed” to take the job on October 4. But according to the filing, Ubhi did not recuse himself until October 31, 2017. Oracle alleges that he continued to influence the program in the meantime.

Under the Procurement Integrity Act, government officials who are “contacted by a [contract] bidder about non-federal employment” have two options: They must either report the contact and reject the offer of employment or promptly recuse themselves from any contract proceedings.

“Contracts should be awarded fairly based on merit,” Mandy Smithberger, director of the Center for Defense Information at the Project on Government Oversight, told The Intercept. “The Procurement Integrity Act seeks to ensure that job offers and other financial conflicts of interest don’t influence that process.”

Last year, a Defense Department review found that “there were four instances where [department] individuals with potential financial conflicts of interest” had worked on the JEDI program, according to court records, but the Pentagon concluded that this hadn’t unfairly impacted the contracting process. Two follow-up reviews — one by the GAO in November 2018 and another by the Defense Department in April 2019 — came to similar conclusions.

The second Pentagon review came after the department said that it had received “new information” about Ubhi and would investigate it. According to Oracle’s motion on Friday, the “new information” came from a “belated submission from [Amazon]” to the DOD’s contracting officer that finally acknowledged the monthslong employment talks.

According to Oracle, Ubhi provided a “false narrative” to the contracting officer at the time of his recusal, saying that he was stepping away from the project because Amazon had offered to acquire a company that Ubhi had a stake in. That was a pretext to mask the fact he had been negotiating for months to obtain a job at the company, Oracle’s filing said.

The filing also alleges that between Ubhi’s verbal commitment to accept Amazon’s offer and his recusal from JEDI, he continued to participate in Pentagon meetings about the project’s technical requirements and to receive submissions from Amazon competitors. It also alleges that Ubhi downloaded material from a JEDI project Google Drive to his own laptop.

In its filings, Oracle has argued that Ubhi was instrumental in persuading the Pentagon to seek services from a single vendor — a decision widely seen to improve Amazon’s chances. Oracle cites workplace messages on the platform Slack in which Ubhi tries to persuade his colleagues to come around to that view, but the company does not cite any messages suggesting what his reasons or motive may have been."
State Department suspends funding of anti-Iran Group which targeted journalists and activists,https://www.cnn.com,['Alex Marquardt'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/us-suspends-funding-anti-iran-group/index.html,"(CNN) The US State Department has suspended funding for an organization whose hardline stance against the Iranian regime saw it targeting American journalists, activists and academics whom they didn't consider tough enough on Tehran, according to a State Department spokesperson.

The Iran Disinformation Project claims it ""exposes and counters the nefarious influence of one of the world's few remaining totalitarian regimes."" It has been funded through the State Department's Global Engagement Center which combats foreign propaganda and disinformation.

But the organization was so aggressive that social media accounts linked to it went after people it perceived to be too soft on Iran, at a time when the Trump administration is exerting what it calls ""maximum pressure,"" ratcheting up military and economic pressure on Iran after pulling out of the landmark nuclear deal known as the JCPOA.

The Guardian was first to report that the State Department had suspended funding.

Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post columnist and CNN contributor, told CNN Wednesday that an account associated with the organization was ""attacking me, other journalists, human rights advocates and others who have taken a more nuanced approach to US Iran relations and are opposed to war and crippling sanctions on that country.""

Rezaian, who is Iranian-American, spent 18 months in prison in Tehran and is a firm and frequent critic of the regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a column Wednesday, he highlighted the organization's ""slander and libel"" against American citizens.

""For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran's 'mouthpieces,' 'apologists,' 'collaborators,' and 'lobbyists' in the West,"" he wrote.

Another target was Human Rights Watch's Tara Sepehri Far who researches human rights abuses in Iran. She recently wrote that American sanctions are ""collectively punishing"" ordinary Iranians and limiting their access to medicine.

In an April 25 tweet, the IranDisinfo account called Far a ""supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime"" and accused her of ""working hard to prove [Foreign Minister Javad Zarif's] claims.""

On Friday, Far tweeted: ""Many of us accepted that toxic slandering is part of the cost of being an analyst or doing human rights work in a very polarized climate of the US government's maximum pressure campaign, but now we realize that part of the slandering is actually being funded by US taxpayers.""

The State Department says it suspended the organization's funding on May 31, until it ""takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work.""

""The bulk of the work by @IranDisinfo has been in line with the scope of a project with the Department of State. We have, however, identified recent tweets that fall outside the scope of the project to counter foreign state propaganda or disinformation,"" a State Department spokesperson said.

The Global Engagement Center was set up in April 2016 under President Barack Obama and refocused after the presidential election primarily to combat Russian disinformation campaigns in the wake of their meddling in the campaign. Brett Bruen, who served as director of global engagement under Obama, said it was funded with $80 million.

""The problem was the Trump administration didn't really want to spend it because that meant recognizing that what Russia was doing on information warfare was a real threat,"" Bruen told CNN on Wednesday in an appearance alongside Rezaian.

Commerce officials to answer on census citizenship question amid contempt threat,https://thehill.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/447119-commerce-officials-agree-to-interviews-on-census-citizenship-question-amid,"The House Oversight and Reform Committee said Wednesday that three Commerce Department officials have agreed to sit for voluntary interviews as committee Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsPelosi privately told Democrats she wants Trump 'in prison': report Pelosi privately told Democrats she wants Trump 'in prison': report Judge says he's not ready to rule on new claims about census citizenship question MORE (D-Md.) threatens a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrNadler: 'It may very well come to' opening a formal impeachment inquiry Nadler: 'It may very well come to' opening a formal impeachment inquiry Judge says he's not ready to rule on new claims about census citizenship question MORE and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossJudge says he's not ready to rule on new claims about census citizenship question Judge says he's not ready to rule on new claims about census citizenship question Supreme Court should postpone decision on Trump's citizenship census question MORE in contempt.

The committee said in a statement that the Commerce Department agreed late Tuesday to let the committee conduct interviews with the three agency officials — general counsel Peter Davidson, deputy chief of staff and policy director Earl Comstock, and former senior adviser and counsel to the secretary James Uthmeier — after Cummings circulated a resolution to subpoena the men.

That subpoena vote has now been delayed, according to the panel. The committee is seeking the current and former officials' testimony as part of their investigation into the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The panel said Wednesday that it had first requested transcribed interviews with the officials on March 20 and sent letters requesting the interviews directly to the men on May 7.

Cummings on Wednesday also reiterated his threat to hold contempt votes within his committee for Barr and Ross if they fail to turn over certain documents on the citizenship question by Thursday.

“Our Committee has a constitutional responsibility to oversee the Census, and we will not relinquish this responsibility because of a coordinated effort to obstruct our investigation by the Trump Administration,” Cummings said in a statement. “If [the documents] are not produced by tomorrow, we will be forced to move forward with holding Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross in contempt of Congress.”

“These documents are critical to our oversight efforts, and we plan to use them in our interviews of top Administration officials in the coming weeks.”

Cummings first announced Monday that he was scheduling committee votes to hold Ross and Barr in contempt after they failed to comply with congressional subpoenas for documents about the citizenship question.

The announcement came on the heels of new evidence filed last week in a court case challenging the citizenship question's addition to the 2020 census, alleging that a late GOP redistricting strategist played in a role in the question's orchestration and that Trump officials obscured his involvement. The claims undercut the administration's assertion that the question is necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act.

The Department of Justice sought to refute the claims in a court filing Monday, claiming that Trump officials involved in the question did not lie in their testimony and were unaware of a 2015 study the strategist, Thomas Hofeller, conducted showing that asking about citizenship would help Republicans in redistricting.

But the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the new allegations, said in a court filing late Tuesday that the Justice Department ""does not deny that damning new evidence reveals hyper-partisan and racially discriminatory motives at the root of the citizenship question.""

A federal judge in New York will hold a hearing Wednesday afternoon on whether to impose sanctions on Trump officials in light of the new evidence.

The Supreme Court is also set to issue in the coming weeks its decision on whether the citizenship question will be allowed on the 2020 census."
Pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt expects to pay $15 million to settle DOJ drug bribing probe,https://www.cnbc.com,['Ashley Turner'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/05/mallinckrodt-expects-to-pay-15-million-to-settle-doj-drug-bribing-probe.html,"Shares of pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt seesawed Wednesday after it announced a tentative deal with the U.S. Justice Department to settle a drug bribery probe into Questcor Pharmaceuticals, which it acquired in 2014.

Mallinckrodt said it expects to pay $15.4 million to the DOJ after two whistleblower lawsuits claimed Questcor improperly promoted and bribed doctors to prescribe its popular drug H.P. Acthar Gel. The suits also claimed Questcor defrauded Medicare by illegally marketing the drug, which is used for treating multiple sclerosis and seizures in children.

The terms of agreement have yet to be finalized and do not admit wrongdoing on the company's part. The company said the agreement does not cover allegations relating to Questcor's charitable foundation activities, only the company's sales and marketing activities.

The government is still seeking unspecified monetary damages from Mallinckrodt related to alleged improper conduct at a Questcor charitable foundation between 2010 and 2014, the company said. The government accused Questcor of using a foundation as a ""conduit"" to pay illegal kickbacks in the form of co-pay subsidies to market Acthar as ""free"" to doctors and patients, despite raising its price.

""Illegal inducements increase the costs paid by the American taxpayer and distort the market forces that otherwise could control those costs,"" Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the DOJ's Civil Division said in a statement. ""This lawsuit and prior enforcement actions make clear that the department will hold accountable drug companies that pay illegal kickbacks to facilitate increased drug prices.""

The company's shares jumped as much 8.5% on the news before tumbling by more than 3% in intraday trading.

Mallinckrodt General Counsel Mark Casey said in a statement that the company looks forward to finalizing its agreement with the government relating to Questcor's sales and marketing activities.

""As we have said repeatedly, where we can resolve legacy legal matters in a reasonable and manageable way, we will do so,"" Casey said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, that has not been possible to date regarding the allegations relating to Questcor's charitable foundation activities, despite what we believe was lawful and appropriate activity. We are confident that the litigation process will focus the contested issues and be a productive step in reaching resolution.""

H.P. Acthar Gel accounted for 35% of Mallinckrodt's net sales in 2018. The drug is known for its sharp price hike in 2007. That year Questcor raised the price of one vial of the medicine to $28,000 from $2,000 — it now costs nearly $39,000."
"Energy Department Plans to Reclassify High-Level Toxic Waste as Low-Level, Angering Environmental Advocates",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Audrey Mcnamara'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/energy-department-plans-to-reclassify-high-level-toxic-waste-as-low-level-angering-environmental-advocates,"The Trump administration’s Department of Energy on Wednesday announced plans to reclassify dangerous, high-level radioactive waste as low-level in a move that has sparked alarm among environmental advocates. The plan would shift authority over toxic waste disposal to the federal government, making it easier to transfer the high-level radioactive waste to new sites. The change would effect more than 100 million gallons of high-level waste currently stored in South Carolina, Washington, and Idaho, allowing it to be shipped to low-level nuclear waste disposal sites in the deserts of Utah and Texas, according to the National Resource Defense Council. The DOE says the move would also save $40 billion in cleanup costs. The reclassification would only occur after a thorough analysis and environmental studies, according to the DOE.

The change was immediately criticized by the NRDC, as well as some government officials in the affected states. Washington Governor Jay Inslee (D) and Attorney General Bob Ferguson released a statement condemning the administration’s actions. “The Trump Administration is showing disdain and disregard for state authority with these actions,” the statement read. “The Trump administration is moving to fundamentally alter more than 50 years of national consensus on how the most toxic and radioactive waste in the world is managed and ultimately disposed of,” said Geoff Fettus, a senior attorney at NRDC, in a statement. “No matter what they call it, this waste needs a permanent, well-protected disposal option to guard it for generations to come.”"
Trump’s latest church visit was crass politicization of a house of worship,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Michael Wear', 'June At Pm']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/06/05/presidents-visit-churches-not-like-trump-did/,"

Church visits from a president are complicated affairs, requiring layers of careful thought and planning for the potent mixture of the temporal and the eternal. President Trump is not known for holding fragile things with care, and his drop-in at McLean Bible Church on Sunday proved that yet again, in a significant departure from the approach of his predecessors.

The break with tradition is not that Trump appeared at a church. Church visits by politicians are common on both sides of the aisle, and many Democratic presidential hopefuls have spoken from pulpits in the past few months.

In my book, “Reclaiming Hope: Lessons Learned in the Obama White House About the Future of Faith in America,” I describe the significant logistical and atmospheric challenges for a president to attend church. It is inherently disruptive, because he brings the office of the presidency when he attends.

Much attention has been focused on how the church should or could have handled this situation differently, but not enough of that focus has considered the egregious course of action taken by Trump and his staff that forced this situation on the church in the first place.

What was truly outrageous about the president’s visit to McLean are those details that are specific to this president and his staff’s conduct. There we can see a manipulation and crass politicization of a house of worship that is, to my knowledge, without precedent at a national level outside of “House of Cards.”

Platt said in a statement he didn’t know Trump was coming until he had finished his sermon. Apparently, Trump’s staff notified someone at the church that he would be dropping by while en route from the golf course. I cannot overstate how unusual, how deeply disrespectful this course of action is to the local church, the sanctity of worship and the welfare of the church. This was the co-option of worship, the crashing of a service by the apparatus of the presidency.

When we approached a religious leader to discuss plans for any public partnership or involvement I tried to discuss the risks, and never pressured those who did not seem to be prepared or willing to take them. And this is what makes Trump’s appearance at McLean abhorrent to me as a Christian and as someone who has tried to engage religious communities in a way that empowers, not disempowers, them: Trump’s White House, intentionally or not, arranged its visit in a way that drastically limited the agency of the church.

The president, for all the power of his office, should never assume entree to a church stage or pulpit. The doors of the church must always be open, but a church must be given all deference to dictate its service as it sees fit. Trump and his staff know how divisive his presidency is, how much discord it has caused, and they decided to impose that conflict on a congregation. They left the church no opportunity for discernment, prayer and discussion to prepare for such a visit. It is inexcusable.

Trump is a transactional man who believes he has done much for conservative evangelicals. This latest antic provides another glimpse into just what he expects in return.

What a church visit from a president looks like

Church visits from presidents generally require multiple security and planning meetings, including many conversations with church staff. Presidential visits to St. John’s Church, which is across from the White House, became less intensive during both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations because they attended multiple times and the church has protocol in place for such visits. I can speak definitively for the Obama presidency, and with significant familiarity with previous presidencies, that the pastor of any church a president would visit was expecting it and had time to prepare for that visit.

Presidential church visits can be burdensome on the church, as they often require security measures such as screening of all attendees. The president’s presence can be a distraction to the congregation’s worship, and attention from the congregation can be a distraction to the president’s worship. Then-president-elect, Obama planned to attend a historically black church weeks before his inauguration. But word leaked the previous evening, so tourists turned out and displaced much of the church membership.

The first family would sometimes have tourists’ cameras flashing in their eyes as they walked down the aisle to receive the Eucharist. The challenges can be worth it if the president desires to worship in a church, and churches are typically honored to host a president regardless of their politics, but the apparatus of the presidency is not without its burdens when it comes to attending church.

And, of course, church visits are often on politicians’ political calendars, not their personal ones. Even if attendance is driven by personal devotion, presidents and their staff can never forget that any move they make has implications. Churches and pastors must always be cognizant of those professional implications, as well. Even the most earnest president understands that there are political opportunities and costs associated with attending church. The church’s pastor, history and beliefs are often subject to press and unfriendly political interest.

Religious forums are often twisted for partisan gain. This is strikingly apparent in evangelist Franklin Graham’s call for a day of prayer to support the president this past Sunday, which happened to coincide with Trump’s visit to McLean Bible Church. As Michael Gerson wrote for The Washington Post, “Graham made clear that the real purpose of the event was not to pray for the president, but to pray in his political favor.” Graham’s call amounts to the utilitarian appropriation of prayer for partisan ends. Those ends were intentionally obfuscated to achieve their purpose of placing a religious veneer on what was an electoral effort.

This is not to say that prayer should ever be separated from a Christian’s politics. The Christians who prayed for an end to slavery were right to do so, and I believe their prayers honored God. I believe Christians need to be praying more about politics, not less. But prayer in politics, like all prayers, must be put under the will of God and divine intentions. Prayer should never be a cover for political mobilization or manipulation.

Politically or religiously convenient engagement

There are scripture-based arguments for and against hosting political figures at churches, and I believe both sides have merit. What is interesting is how the same people will invoke different arguments when they are politically convenient.

Many of the same people invoking biblical admonitions to pray for Trump argued during Obama’s terms that giving special attention to the president amounted to complicity with evil or undue esteem for political officeholders. Many of the same people who are calling today for pastors and Christian speakers to unload their disagreements and anger with the president in his presence viewed similar behavior as unprecedented disrespect when it happened during Obama’s time. This is why criticisms of Trump appearing at a church are so easily dismissed by the political right, and why explanations for why a church might host Trump are so easily dismissed by the left.

Churches that welcome political leaders should do so with the intention to share the gospel and uphold the biblical ideas of righteousness and justice, while understanding that politicians’ motivations do not always align with those intentions. Churches who reject entreaties from politicians should be careful about applying such prohibitions without a clear and consistent standard.

There will always be room in the Christian tradition for different approaches to the engagement of political leaders and issues. The line we must defend: Those decisions are ours to make, not subject to the whims and interests of politicians like Trump, who view all forums as a potential venue for their self-aggrandizement.

(CNN) In the latest in the slew of controversial and restrictive immigration provisions put in place by the Trump administration, the US State Department announced this week that nonimmigrant visa forms had been updated to require ""most"" visa applicants to provide information about ""their social media handles along with other information"" going back five years. In a diffident statement to The New York Times, the State Department played down the potential impact of the new requirement, saying: ""We already request certain contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants."" The new screening requirements, officials added, were put in place to ""protect US citizens.""

Rafia Zakaria

Both premises, that the demand for social media information is not more intrusive than other existing provisions and that it is required to protect American citizens, are questionable at best.

When applicants fill out a visa application for a nonimmigrant visa to the United States, one of the primary things they must provide is evidence that they do not intend to overstay their visas. Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USCS 1184(b)) states : ""Every alien ... shall be presumed to be an immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of application for admission, that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant status."" In plain language, this means that in the process of applying for a visa, the presumption is against the applicant, who must prove to the satisfaction of the consular officer that he or she will not come to the United States and never leave.

Sharing five years of social media posts, likes, retweets and other information is likely to make it even harder for nonimmigrant visa applicants to satisfy the requirements. When considered against the legal requirements, these measures seem designed to provide consular officers more reasons to reject those applying for nonimmigrant visas. This is a particular problem, given the fact that the consular officer has total discretion and those whose applications are denied cannot appeal the decision

Social media posts from three or four or five years ago, ones that say something like, ""I wish I could get away from here,"" or, ""I wish I lived in New York,"" could be construed as evidence of the intent to stay, as could any number of the ambiguous or reactive statements that people routinely make on social media platforms.

US Commerce Department offers solution for obtaining minerals critical to the military,https://www.defensenews.com,"['Kelsey Reichmann', 'Kelsey Reichmann Is A General Assignment Editorial Fellow Supporting Defense News', 'Fifth Domain', 'Federal Times. She Attended California State University.']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2019/06/05/us-commerce-department-offers-solution-for-obtaining-minerals-critical-to-the-military/,"A report by the U.S. Commerce Department recommends the government strengthen relations with foreign companies that provide minerals critical to military development.

The report was released Tuesday amid a trade war between the United States and China.

“The United States is heavily dependent on critical mineral imports. If China or Russia were to stop exports to the United States and its allies for a prolonged period — similar to China’s rare earths embargo in 2010 — an extended supply disruption could cause significant shocks throughout U.S. and foreign critical mineral supply chains,” the report states.

The report also notes that the U.S. is import-reliant on 31 of the 35 minerals designated as critical by the Department of the Interior. Furthermore, the U.S. completely relies on imports for 14 of these minerals.

The report also says the country’s imports of “critical mineral commodities” exceed 50 percent of its annual consumption. These rare earth minerals are often used in the production of aircraft, computers and GPS systems.

Last year China produced 78 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals, according to researchers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

“These critical minerals are often overlooked but modern life without them would be impossible,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a news release. “Through the recommendations detailed in this report, the Federal government will take unprecedented action to ensure that the United States will not be cut off from these vital minerals.”

One solution to this problem is to enhance international trade and cooperation in relation to rare earth minerals, according to the report.

However, the Government Accountability Office in April found that the U.S. is reliant on China for several critical minerals. And China has noted that it could cut off the U.S. from some rare earth minerals should the trade war continue.

The report from the Department of Commerce proposes a continued expansion of rare earth minerals trading with Canada, Australia, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. It notably does not include China.

The report does, however, mention China as an area to which American production companies relocated, and it called for more investment in the National Defense Stockpile program.

The NDS program, which would provide critical materials to support industrial investments to help civilian needs in an emergency, is not financially sustainable, according to the report."
EPA exempts farms from reporting pollution tied to animal waste,https://thehill.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447151-epa-exempts-farms-from-reporting-pollution-tied-to-animal-waste,"A new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would lift requirements for major farms to report the pollution they emit through animal waste.

The rule, released late Tuesday, spurred criticism from environmental groups who say nearby communities would no longer have access to information about harmful gasses being released into the air.

Across many industrial farms in the U.S., animal waste is collected and stored in open pits often called lagoons. As the manure decomposes it emits

ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which are linked

to respiratory issues and other health problems.

People who live near farms have long complained of the odor, but they also attribute asthma, headaches, nausea and a stinging sensation in their lungs to farm pollution.

Farms have called the reporting requirements onerous.

“I appreciate this administration’s deregulatory approach toward the American farmer and rancher, who need a reprieve from government red tape,” Sen. Pat Roberts Charles (Pat) Patrick RobertsEPA exempts farms from reporting pollution tied to animal waste EPA exempts farms from reporting pollution tied to animal waste Conservatives spark threat of bloody GOP primaries MORE (R-Kan.) said in a statement lauding the rule.

The rule gives farms and the EPA the latest win in what has been a long battle between the agency, Congress and environmental groups to determine to what extent large farms must report pollution that could be hazardous to human health.

Large farms have been required to report pollution tied to animal waste since the 1980s, but the George W. Bush Administration first tried to carve out an exception in 2008. Environmental groups sued and won the resulting court battle nearly a decade later in 2017. Trump’s EPA then issued a guidance exempting farms from reporting pollution tied to animal waste, which spurred more lawsuits.

Carrie Apfel, an Earthjustice attorney who helped sued over the guidance, said the group will also sue over the new rule.

She said Congress made clear under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act that this information must be passed to state and local governments so that emergency responders and neighbors know how to respond to nearby pollution.

“A lot of the health impacts from farms disproportionately impact low income and minority communities, she said. People with chronic health problems are seeking medical care from doctors who are asking what they might be exposed to — information they currently can only get from the reports.

EPA has maintained that Congress intended to remove state-level reporting requirements for farm waste when it got rid of the federal ones -- something environmental groups dispute.

The agency told The Hill on Wednesday that it received comments from farmers that reporting requirements for air emissions from animal waste would be confusing and unnecessary.

Farm groups issued statements hailing the new rule.

“Routine emissions from agricultural operations are not a threat to local communities,” the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said in a statement. “We are glad to see EPA fully implement the law by providing relief from burdensome state and local reporting requirements.”

On the morning of July 4, 1801, a bareheaded President Thomas Jefferson, his “grey locks waving in the air,” watched from the front steps of the White House as crowds celebrated America’s 25th birthday with a military parade, horse races and cockfights. At noon, the president opened the doors to greet guests including ordinary citizens, diplomats, military officers and five Cherokee chiefs.

The Marine Band played in the entrance hall. Inside, about 100 guests were served cakes, wine and punch. “All appeared to be cheerful, all happy. Mr. Jefferson mingled promiscuously with the citizens,” said a woman who attended the event.

In contrast to President Donald Trump’s plans to insert himself into the national celebration in Washington this Fourth of July, early presidents took part in more low-key events. Presidents George Washington and John Adams attended celebrations in various towns around the country. Adams, however, did spark the association of celebrations with the Fourth of July. After Congress approved the Declaration of Independence in July of 1776, Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, that the date “ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other from this time forward forever more.”

As the first president to reside in the White House on a July 4, Jefferson started the tradition of holding receptions on Independence Day. President James Madison hosted “heads of departments” one year. In 1825, President John Quincy Adams went to Capitol Hill to hear a reading of the Declaration of Independence before hosting a White House gathering.

In 1841, President John Tyler hosted a dinner that included turtle soup made from a 300-pound turtle from Key West, Fla. “That evening Tyler and his guests walked out onto Lafayette Square to enjoy a fireworks display,” according to the White House Historical Association.

[Jefferson’s powerful last public letter reminds us what Independence Day is all about]

In 1845, President James K. Polk featured fireworks at the White House itself. Unfortunately, the presidential pyrotechnics had a tragic end. Nearly 8,000 people gathered “to witness a most magnificent display of fireworks,” the Washington Union reported. Near the close of the display, 12 rockets were accidentally fired into the crowd. “Mr. James Knowles, a worthy and industrious citizen of Washington, was transfixed through the heart by one and was instantly killed.” A woman, Georgiana Ferguson, also was hit and died the next day.

July 4 was a fateful day for some presidents as well. Both John Adams and Jefferson died on that day in 1826. President James Monroe died on July 4, 1831. Then there was President Zachary Taylor. On a steamy July 4, 1850, “Old Rough and Ready” walked over to ceremonies at the location where the Washington Monument was being built. Later, back at the White House, he gulped down cherries and iced milk. He came down with cholera and died on July 9.

In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln gave what became known as his “Fourth of July” speech from a second-floor window of the White House to a crowd accompanied by a band celebrating the fall of Vicksburg. The date was July 7, but the speech got its name because Lincoln talked about the importance of the Fourth of July to the nation.

President Ulysses S. Grant began a new July 4 tradition for presidents in 1872, according to research by James Heintze, author of “The Fourth of July Encyclopedia.” Grant left town and went to Long Beach, N.J. In 1892, President Benjamin Harrison spent the Fourth in Cape May, N.J. In 1902 President Theodore Roosevelt traveled to Pittsburgh, where he gave a speech to 200,000 people.

In 1909, President William Howard Taft was at his new “summer White House” in Beverly, Mass., when the District of Columbia conducted its first official Independence Day celebration. More than 40,000 people turned out to see daylight and evening fireworks on the Ellipse behind the White House. The celebrations have continued every year since.

President Harry S. Truman is the only president to ever take an active role in the Washington celebration. With more than 150,000 people at the Mall on July 4, 1951, for the 175th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, Truman gave a speech from the Washington Monument about progress in the Korean War.

President Richard Nixon videotaped a message that was played on the Mall at July 4 ceremonies in 1970 when bottle-throwing anti-Vietnam War protesters disrupted the event.

In 1976, the nation celebrated its bicentennial year with a record of more than 1 million people jamming onto the Mall. President Gerald Ford watched from the White House after speaking at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.

President Ronald Reagan got involved in the 1983 Washington celebration when his Interior Secretary James Watt banned the Beach Boys from singing at festivities on the Mall. Watt said the group would draw “the wrong element.” He replaced the rock group with the family-friendly U.S. Army Blues band and Las Vegas crooner Wayne Newton.

President Reagan, at the behest of his wife, Nancy, overturned the ban. Mrs. Reagan said her children grew up listening to the Beach Boys’ music, and the group’s members “are fine, outstanding people.” The group didn’t perform that year, but it did the next before more than half a million people. Lead singer Mike Love drew cheers when he addressed the crowd as “all you undesirable elements.”

President Bill Clinton reviewed Navy ships in New York on July 4, 2000. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama presided over naturalization ceremonies for new U.S. citizens. Last year on July 4, President Trump and his wife, Melania, hosted a White House picnic for military families.

This year President Trump has tweeted about a “Salute To America” that would feature “an address by your favorite President, me.” Trump plans to speak from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Critics said that would turn the historically nonpartisan celebration into a Trump political rally.

It’s too soon to say how the plans will work out. What does seem certain about this year’s July 4 celebration is that, in more ways than one, there will be fireworks.

EPA chief attacks the media in speech to agency science advisers,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-wheeler-tells-agency-science-advisors-not-to-believe-the-media-a9d8587fc5f5/,"The head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Andrew Wheeler, chose to go “off script” Wednesday morning when he warned the agency’s Science Advisory Board (SAB) against trusting the media.

“I caution you to be careful what you read in the media,” Wheeler said, concluding his remarks to the public meeting — the first time the SAB has meet in a year.

Wheeler was specifically referring to a tweet by Yahoo News journalist Alexander Nazaryan on Monday which quoted Wheeler telling the National Press Club, “‘The media does a disservice to the American public’ by reporting on global warming, says EPA head Andrew Wheeler. Wants more positive coverage.”

And indeed, on Monday, Wheeler did take time to list five things he believes the press “consistently gets wrong” — this included reporting that the environment is getting worse. Instead, the press should be talking more about how it’s been getting better since the 1970s, Wheeler argued.

Nazaryan’s tweet was quickly circulated around the internet, including by a New York Times journalist and the Sierra Club. In response, the EPA sent out a press release stating that the tweet was “misleading,” and accused the Yahoo journalist of choosing to “deliberately spread false information on Twitter.”

This argument was reiterated on Wednesday by Wheeler, who said the fact that the Sierra Club started promoting the tweet made him wonder whether the media and environmental groups were “colluding” for fundraising purposes.

Under the Trump administration, however, the EPA has actively worked to rollback environmental protections, often in line with fossil fuel or other industry interests. Most recently this includes challenging the underlying risk calculations that support clean air rules.

The media has played a critical role in reporting on, and investigating, not just these various policy decisions but also potential ethics controversies and conflicts of interest plaguing the agency.

But Wheeler urged scientists not to trust the media and come to him or other top EPA officials if they had questions or concerns.

This isn’t the first time that the Trump administration’s EPA has “fact-checked” the media or been antagonistic toward reporters. Last year, reporters from major news outlets, including the Associated Press and CNN, were banned from attending a summit on harmful chemicals; one journalist was even forcibly removed by security.

And in September 2017, the EPA’s press office sent out a press release titled “EPA Response To The AP’s Misleading Story,” which accused AP reporter Michael Biesecker of writing an “incredibly misleading story” about Superfund sites and Hurricane Harvey. (The EPA did not, however, contradict any facts in Biesecker’s story.)

Meanwhile, the EPA has used articles written by climate science deniers, including the Heartland Institute and the Daily Caller, as their own press releases rather than citing expert staff members — a move which the National Association of Science Writers labeled “unprofessional” and “unethical.”

All of this is part of the larger confrontational relationship with the press promoted by President Donald Trump, who consistently calls media “fake news” and has repeatedly encouraged violence against the media."
"DOJ: Carnival Re-Polluted, Then Tried to 'Drown Its Deceit'",http://www.newser.com,['Jenn Gidman'],06-05-2019,2019,6,http://www.newser.com/story/276105/doj-carnival-re-polluted-then-tried-to-drown-its-deceit.html,"(Newser) – Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice—still shame on you, and you're going to pay big for it. That's essentially the Justice Department's message to Carnival Corporation, which just got busted, again, for its ships polluting the waters they sail in, and for trying to cover it all up, the New York Times reports. The company's Princess Cruises had already been convicted and sentenced in April 2017 on felony charges related to one of its ships dumping oil-contaminated waste, and staff then trying to conceal those actions, per a DOJ statement. For those infractions, Princess had to pony up $40 million and was placed on ""environmental probation."" Now an additional $20 million penalty against Carnival and Princess has been tacked on, with six probation violations noted, including dumping plastic into Bahamian waters from the Carnival Elation.

Other violations cited in the court filing Monday include falsifying environmental training records on two cruise ships, as well as interfering with court-supervised inspections. ""A corporation is responsible to its shareholders and board of directors to be profitable, but not by breaking the law and destroying the very environment in which it navigates for profit,"" says US Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan for the Southern District of Florida. ""Carnival's failure to comply with the terms of its probation and later, its attempt to drown its deceit goes against the fiber of corporate compliance."" Per the Miami Herald, via the Times, Carnival's CEO, Arnold Donald, said at a Monday hearing, ""I do take responsibility for the problems we have. I am extremely disappointed that we've had them."" He pledged that the company is ""fully committed"" to resolving these issues. (Read more Carnival Cruise Lines stories.)

"Democrats grill FBI, DHS officials on white supremacy threat",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-grill-trump-administration-officials-white-supremacy-threat/story?id=63478001,"House Democrats grilled officials from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security in a Tuesday hearing focused on how the Trump administration is addressing the growing threat of violent white supremacist extremists.

The House Oversight subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties hearing, titled 'Confronting White Supremacy: Adequacy of the Federal Response,' was the latest effort by Democrats to spotlight ways they say the Trump administration has systematically cut back on resources used to address threats from domestic extremists even as the FBI has reported a 30-40% rise in domestic terrorism cases just since October.

Federal officials in attendance at Tuesday's hearing included FBI Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Michael McGarrity, FBI Deputy Assistant Director for Criminal Investigations Calvin Shivers and DHS Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Neumann.

Committee chairman Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., opened the hearing by raising issue with the amount of resources he says the FBI devotes towards investigating cases of international terrorism versus domestic terrorism.

Citing figures from the Anti-Defamation League, Raskin noted that from 2009-2018, far-right extremism was responsible for 73% of extremist murders, while international terrorism was responsible for 23% of terrorism deaths.

""The FBI has testified the bureau allocates its resources almost exactly backwards than the problem would suggest,"" Raskin said. ""Devoting 80% of field agents to stopping international terrorism including Islamic extremism and only 20% to stopping domestic terrorism including far right and white supremacist extremism.""

But McGarrity pointed to the success that FBI agents have so far had in disrupting potential domestic attacks in the past several months, and said successful arrests prior to domestic attacks actually outnumbered those arrested prior to attacks in international terror cases.

""In fiscal year 2018 FBI (Joint Terrorism Task Forces) across the country proactively arrested approximately 115 subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations before they could mobilize into violence,"" McGarrity said. ""So far (since Oct. 1 of last year), our JTTFs have disrupted approximately 66 subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations by arrest.""

Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, D-Fla., pressed Neumann on a report that the department recently disbanded and slashed funding for a section of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, which focused on producing reports on domestic terrorism and which Democrats warn could result in a reduction of available data on threats from white supremacist groups.

Neumann countered that the funding dedicated to the department was only inflated due to millions in grant funding committed during the Obama administration, but later in the hearing gave a candid assessment regarding DHS' overall counterterrorism strategy, saying that the administration is actively working to find ways to improve its prevention strategy.

""We know we're not doing enough,"" Neumann said. ""Things haven't been institutionalized. In order for government to work, we have to institutionalize it, you either need to authorize it through Congress or you need to get it in executive order or national security presidential memoranda.""

Following the terror attack on several mosques in New Zealand in March carried out by an alleged white supremacist, President Donald Trump told reporters he didn't see white nationalism as a rising threat to the U.S.

The hearing followed a briefing just two weeks earlier from a senior FBI counterterrorism official who gave sobering statistics to reporters regarding the domestic threat environment.

The official revealed the FBI currently has a total of just under 5,000 open terrorism cases, including 850 domestic terror-related cases, and acknowledged that far more Americans have been killed in domestic terror attacks than Islamic terror attacks since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

According to the official, a significant issue that the bureau faces is that the federal criminal code has made it more challenging to bring charges against domestic terror suspects than in cases involving international terrorism or foreign terrorist organizations.

That's because, according to the FBI Agents Association, ""domestic terrorism"" itself is not a federal crime.

""Domestic terrorism is about political violence,"" Tom O'Connor, the president of the FBI Agents Association said in a statement to ABC News. ""Congress must do everything in its power to provide law enforcement with the tools needed to combat this threat to our country.""

Investigators often are forced to rely on other federal crimes to charge suspects with or rely on state or local laws, such as in the recent case of Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson, who despite being accused in court of plotting mass murder ""on a scale rarely seen in this country,"" is currently facing only gun and drug charges from U.S. attorneys in Maryland.

And while then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions initially described the Charlottesville, Virginia attack by James Fields Jr., which resulted in the death of Heather Heyer, as ""the definition of domestic terrorism,"" Fields in March pleaded guilty to 29 counts of violating federal hate crime law.

The issue surfaced in a contentious exchange between Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and McGarrity, where McGarrity was pressed on why the 2015 Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, and last year's Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh were treated as ""hate crime incidents"" rather than acts of domestic terrorism.

""That's not correct,"" McGarrity said, pointing out that while the attacks are considered instances of domestic terrorism by the Department of Justice, ""there's no domestic terrorism charge.""

In an emotional exchange on the subject later in the hearing, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-MI, read a death threat letter sent to her and fellow Muslim congresswoman Rep. Ilhan Omar that cited the New Zealand mosque attacks and remarked, ""the only good Muslim is a dead one.""

""How is that not enough to fall under domestic terrorism?"" Tlaib said through tears. ""How come we don't have enough tools right now to pull these people in?""

McGarrity expressed sympathy for Tlaib and urged her to bring her concerns directly to the Department of Justice, after earlier noting he personally would welcome Congress passing a law that makes domestic terrorism a federal crime.

“I will say as a former prosecutor and as a former investigator, I want every tool in the tool box,” McGarrity said."

Global Opinions writer

Even after spending a year and a half in prison in Tehran, I knew that if I wanted to go on writing about Iran, I would be a target for plenty of public attacks despite the abuse I had suffered at the hands of the Islamic Republic. And so it has been.

But I never imagined the U.S. State Department would be funding my attackers.

Last week, several astute Iran watchers drew attention to a series of inflammatory tweets associated with the Iran Disinformation Project, a State Department-funded initiative that its website claims “brings to light disinformation emanating from the Islamic Republic of Iran via official rhetoric, state propaganda outlets, social media manipulation and more.”

So the @StateDept uses taxpayer money to fund online attacks on @HRW because the organization is researching the human cost of US sanctions in #Iran.



Is this even legal? https://t.co/PGVuizRq93 — Negar Mortazavi (@NegarMortazavi) May 30, 2019

What other @StateDept funded organizations claiming to promote democracy in #Iran are using taxpayer money to harass, intimidate, threaten and slander American journalists & academics?

Follow the money folks. — Farnaz Fassihi (@farnazfassihi) May 31, 2019

On Friday, in response to the complaints, the State Department suspended the initiative’s funding “until the implementer takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work,” a department official said.

One of the “steps” thus far has been to delete many of the tweets in question. But that is hardly sufficient.

Ironically, the Iran Disinformation Project was funded by the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which was begun to combat online extremism and propaganda.

The targets of the tweets included think-tank analysts, human rights activists and journalists (including me). The common thread is that we are all perceived by regime change proponents and supporters of the Trump administration’s so-called maximum pressure policy to be soft on Iran because we are critical of crushing economic sanctions and the threat of the use of military force against it.

For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran’s “mouthpieces,” “apologists,” “collaborators,” and “lobbyists” in the West.

I won’t speak for others who have been attacked, and my own views are irrelevant to this situation. From what I can see, though, we all appear to share the view that Iran should be secular and democratic. The main difference between us and those spreading these falsehoods against us is how we envision that change in Iranian politics coming about.

As a matter of principle, I try to avoid impeding anyone else’s right to free expression — even when it’s used to attack me. If a claim against me is demonstrably false, I will state it clearly and openly. Yet, I believe it’s important to allow others — even faceless ones hiding behind anonymous social media accounts — the opportunity to criticize me, my work and my credentials. It’s part of what you sign up for when you take this job.

I also openly acknowledge that others who have been abused by Iran (such as me) have the right to hold whatever political positions they choose and the right to defend and promote them passionately. Yes, even if it means they advocate war or sanctions directed at the people of that country. They have their views and I have mine.

Slander and libel are a different story, however, and @IranDisinfo may have crossed the line.

What Bahman Kalbasi, one of the #IranDisinfo mouthpieces in @BBC doesn't tell you, is that the number of Jews in #Iran before the Islamic Revolution was around 100K. After the mass executions, assassinations, and confiscation of properties, now the number is less than 10K. https://t.co/rfhb6kwFk1 — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) May 28, 2019

In the past 16 months, thousands of protestors have been arrested in #Iran, and most are anonymous. @sepehrifar of @hrw, a supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime, instead of documenting+proving these human rights violations, is working hard to prove @JZarif's claims. https://t.co/CvWzqULihT — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) April 25, 2019

So we’re faced with the irony that an initiative aimed at combating Tehran’s disinformation campaigns is resorting to disinformation campaigns of its own, using taxpayer funds to spread lies about U.S. citizens. We need programs that fight the spread of falsehoods and propaganda, but such efforts shouldn’t combat lies with other lies — and certainly not with public funding.

This is just one more small incident in the long moment of reckoning our democracy is facing. It will pass quickly, but it’s an important stress test.

How can individuals who are not willing to adhere to the norms of American civil society be entrusted with resources to promote civil society in other countries?

The State Department can easily fix the problem. It needs to perform a transparent assessment of who received the funding and why. Once the facts are clear, the grant should be terminated.

Transparency and accountability are fundamental to the rule of law. Anyone who claims otherwise cannot be entrusted with taxpayer money to promote American ideals — at home or abroad.

At the heart of the matter lies a fundamental question: Do we support our long-cherished ideals of democratic fair play or the “by any means necessary” approach that is becoming more prevalent in the current political climate?

Put personal politics aside for a moment and look back through history. Do peddlers of disinformation contribute or detract from our health as a society? The answer is obvious, and the State Department should take a clear stance on the side of honest and responsible discourse.

If the State Department declines to address the issue, Congress should investigate.

Mnuchin to meet with Chinese central banker at G-20 gathering,https://www.cnbc.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/05/mnuchin-to-meet-with-pboc-governor-yi-gang-at-g-20-in-japan.html,"US Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin testifies during a House Committee on Financial Services hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, May 22, 2019.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is scheduled to meet with People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang this weekend at a gathering of G-20 finance leaders in Japan, marking the first face-to-face discussion between key U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators in nearly a month.

A Treasury spokesman confirmed the meeting along with nine other bilaterals for Mnuchin on the sidelines of the Group of 20 gathering in Fukuoka.

Talks aimed at ending a festering trade war between the world's two largest economies broke down in early May, and no face-to-face meetings have been held since May 10, the day that U.S. President Donald Trump sharply increased tariffs on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods to 25%.

Since then, acrimonious rhetoric and trade threats between Beijing and Washington have steadily increased, especially after the United States imposed severe sanctions against Huawei Technologies Co, China's premier telecommunications equipment firm.

The Treasury did not offer any other details about the meeting with Yi, who has been a fixture on the Chinese negotiating team led by Vice Premier Liu He. Mnuchin has previously met with Yi on the sidelines of G20 finance meetings to discuss global finance and economic issues.

Mnuchin also will hold bilateral meetings with Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria, South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Hong Nam-Ki, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Secretary General Angel Gurria, the Treasury said."
USDA calls Indiana farm workers' actions 'unacceptable',https://www.theindychannel.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theindychannel.com/news/call-6-investigators/usda-calls-indiana-farm-workers-actions-unacceptable,"FAIR OAKS, Ind. — The Indiana State Board of Animal Health is working with law enforcement concerning allegations of animal abuse and mistreatment at Fair Oaks Farms in northwest Indiana.

Indiana State Veterinarian Bret D. Marsh has directed the Board of Animal Health (BOAH) staff to collaborate with local law enforcement regarding any appropriate next steps they may take, said spokeswoman Denise Derrer.

The Newton County Sheriff's Office has opened an investigation after the Animal Recovery Mission, a Florida-based animal welfare group, released undercover footage gathered between August and November 2018 after one of their investigators was hired as a calf care employee at the Fair Oaks Farms Prairies Edge North Barn.

The undercover video captured employees throwing calves in and out of their huts, calves kicked and slammed to the ground, a worker sitting on top of a calf.

The state was not made aware of the video or abuse allegations until June 4, said Derrer.

“No representative of ARM has contacted BOAH to report their concerns and findings or share video images they gathered,” said Derrer. “After watching the video, BOAH officials reviewed compliance records and complaint logs for Fair Oaks Farms. No reports of animal abuse or neglect have been filed with the agency since the farms’ founding in the mid-1990s.”

RTV6 also checked with the United States Department of Agriculture, which deferred to Indiana and local agencies.

“The actions depicted on the Animal Recovery Mission video are unacceptable,” read a USDA statement to RTV6. “USDA has full confidence that Indiana state and local authorities will investigate this particular case and take appropriate action.”

The USDA statement said Fair Oaks Farms is not a federally inspected slaughter facility, and therefore is not within USDA’s regulatory authority.

“However, any allegations of animal cruelty must be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated by the proper authorities to ensure all animals are treated with care and dignity,” read the USDA statement.

USDA's authority to regulate the treatment of animals includes the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act and the Animal Welfare Act. The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act protects animals when they are presented for slaughter at federally inspected establishments, according to the agency.

The Animal Welfare Act allows the USDA to ensure the proper care of live animals when used in biomedical research, testing, and exhibition.

“Policies for humane handling of animals consist of a combined effort of federal, state, and local authorities, as well as private industry,” read the statement. “When animals fall within our authorities, USDA acts to prevent animal cruelty such as this. The animals depicted in this video do not fall within our authority.”

PREVIOUS STORY | Undercover video shows animal cruelty at Fair Oaks Farms, founder admits

Fair Oaks Farms founder Mike McCloskey provided the following statement to RTV6 Tuesday in which he called the employees’ actions “despicable.”

“This morning I was made aware of an animal abuse video that the group Animal Recovery Mission (ARM) produced and has released to the public and the press. Most of the footage for this video was captured on one of the dairies that belongs to Fair Oaks Farms. While we were made aware a couple months ago of the fact that ARM had gone undercover at Fair Oaks Farms, and had proactively made a statement ( link ), we had no idea what kind of footage had been captured or what – if any – abuse had occurred.

It is with great disappointment to find, after closely reviewing the released ARM video, that there were five individuals committing multiple instances of animal cruelty and despicable judgement. Of the five, four were our employees and one was a 3rd party truck driver who was picking up calves. Of the four who were our employees, three had already been terminated prior to us being made aware months ago of the undercover ARM operation, as they were identified by their co-workers as being abusive of our animals and reported to management. So, in this instance our policy of cow care training - “see something, say something” - worked. After reviewing the video frame-by-frame, those three employees are responsible for the overwhelming majority of offenses seen in this video.

Unfortunately, the fourth employee’s animal abuse was not caught at that same time. Although he underwent another training session in animal care when we discovered there was an undercover ARM operation on our farm, after viewing the extent of his animal abuse, he is being terminated today.

As to the individual who worked for the transportation company, today, we will notify the company that he works for and he will not be allowed on our farms again. It is our position that any companies that come in contact with transportation of our animals, should be well-versed in and adhere to our industry’s animal welfare practices which can be found in FARM ( https://nationaldairyfarm.com [nationaldairyfarm.com ).

Months ago, when I first learned of the undercover activity, I requested a 3rd party review and we went through a re-training process throughout the dairies. While the review came back favorable, I am not letting my guard down and will institute more thorough monitoring and training so that this abuse can never happen again. This video and any future videos will be immediately handed over to the authorities for review and potential prosecution.

Regardless, I am disgusted by and take full responsibility for the actions seen in the footage, as it goes against everything that we stand for in regards to responsible cow care and comfort. The employees featured in the video exercised a complete and total disregard for the documented training that all employees go through to ensure the comfort, safety and well-being of our animals.

It is a shock and an eye-opener for us to discover that under our watch, we had employees who showed disregard for our animals, our processes and for the rule of law. This ARM video shines a light on an area that – despite our thorough training, employee onboarding procedures and overall commitment to animal welfare – needs improvement. However, as I have stated before, the fact that ARM takes months before notifying owners or authorities regarding on-going animal abuse is concerning. I have personally reached out to ARM’s founder, Richard Kudo, to discuss a more symbiotic relationship but he has yet to reach back.

A full investigation of all aspects of the video is underway, during and after which disciplinary action will be taken, including termination and criminal prosecution, of any and all employees and managers who have violated either our animal care practices or the law or both.

The statement that we grow and sell drugs on our farms is false. The plants featured in the video are an invasive perennial species that is rampant on farms all over the Midwest. With that said, I am disappointed to learn of potential drug use on our properties. Months ago, the individual seen smoking by the barn and doing drugs in a truck was turned in by his co-workers to one of our managers. That manager notified local law enforcement about the drug use and, accordingly, a police report is on file.

It is with a heavy heart that I prepare this statement today. As a veterinarian whose life and work is dedicated to the care, comfort and safety of all animals, this has affected me deeply. I am disappointed for not being aware of this kind of awful treatment occurring and I take full responsibility for what has happened. I also take full responsibility to correct and ensure that every employee understands, embraces and practices the core values on which our organization stands.

I am and will continue to be deeply involved in the resolution of this matter, down to every one of our employees, so that I can guarantee that these actions never again occur on any of our farms.”

The Newton County sheriff said his office has requested the names and identifiers of those terminated for animal cruelty by Fair Oaks Dairy Farms.

Warren calls for replacing Commerce Department in jobs plan,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-commerce-department-in-latest-policy-proposal,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Tuesday called for doing away with the Department of Commerce and several other smaller agencies, and replacing them with a new department responsible for creating new jobs.

Warren, who currently sits in the middle of the pack in a crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders, wrote in a post on Medium that this new department would have “the sole responsibility to create and defend quality, sustainable American job.”

“The new Department — the Department of Economic Development — will replace the Commerce Department, subsume other agencies like the Small Business Administration and the Patent and Trademark Office, and include research and development programs, worker training programs, and export and trade authorities like the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,” Warren wrote.

She added: “The new Department will have a single goal: creating and defending good American jobs.”

2020 DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT BIDEN AT CALIFORNIA CONVENTION

Warren’s new proposal is part of her ""economic patriotism"" agenda – one of a series of ambitious policy proposals that have become a trademark of her campaign – and comes ahead of her first campaign tour of Michigan. The state, which was once a Democratic stronghold, went to President Trump in the 2016 presidential election – largely thanks to Trump’s appeal with blue-collar workers in the state’s manufacturing base.

Warren’s visit to Detroit and Lansing, and her economic proposal, are both aimed squarely at Midwesterners who have watched millions of manufacturing jobs disappear in recent decades.

“My Administration will pursue fundamental, structural changes in our government’s approach to the economy, finally putting American workers and middle-class prosperity ahead of multinational profits and Wall Street bonuses,” she wrote on Medium.

The Trump campaign mocked Warren's call for ""economic patriotism"" as a recycled Obama idea.

But it's also unclear how Warren would turn some of her most costly policies into reality, especially if Democrats don't win back control of the Senate in next year's elections. The last time Congress approved a significant new Cabinet-level department was 2002, when the Department of Homeland Security was created. And the $2 trillion price tag of Warren's clean energy manufacturing plan would prompt plenty of Republican critics.

That plank of her agenda is directly tied to the Green New Deal, a framework for dramatically cutting the nation's dependence on fossil fuels that's championed by rising liberal star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

WARREN THE LATEST 2020 DEMOCRAT TO LAND ON TIME MAGAZINE COVER

As outlined in her Green Manufacturing Plan for America – another policy proposal she released on Tuesday – Warren would pay for her program with proceeds from her proposed new tax on corporate profits and by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies and rolling back some provisions of the GOP's 2017 tax law.

“According to the independent Moody’s analysis of my plan, nearly its entire cost is covered by my Real Corporate Profits Tax — a tax that ensures that the very largest and most profitable American corporations don’t pay zero corporate income tax — ending federal oil and gas subsidies, and closing corporate tax loopholes that promote moving good jobs overseas,” Warren wrote.

Warren is betting that her campaign pledges will power her forward with Midwestern swing voters who are open to deserting Trump. Her clean manufacturing plan comes hours after another Democratic contender, former Vice President Joe Biden, released his own Green New Deal-linked agenda, which would spend $1.7 trillion over 10 years.

Biden is perceived as a threat to Trump in the Midwest, but Michigan Democrats see ample room for Warren to break through in a state that's twice elected women to its highest office. And although Warren burnished her reputation as an advocate for the working class by criticizing the bailout of Wall Street banks while serving as a watchdog of the government's 2008 financial rescue, she spoke more favorably at that time of the agreement that spent billions of dollars to keep U.S. automakers afloat, a position she is sure to highlight in Michigan.

""Wages have not grown, and people look at layoffs being imminent or threatened, not just in the auto industry,"" said former Michigan Democratic Party chairman, Mark Brewer. ""They're looking for somebody on their side, who understands their problems. Why Trump had such appeal in 2016 was that he tapped into that economic anxiety.""

NPR reports that the inspection comes three years after laptops used to check in voters in Durham County malfunctioned on Election Day in 2016. The faulty laptops reportedly told people they had already voted that day, even though that was not the case.

Election officials stopped using the laptops and switched to paper poll books to ensure voters could cast their ballots without further issues.

Florida-based VR Systems, the vendor that supplied the equipment, was discovered in 2017 to be a target of Russian attempts to interfere in U.S. elections, prompting fresh concern over the malfunctioning equipment.

Now, DHS will inspect the equipment as it seeks to better understand the extent of Russia’s interference efforts.

""This support may help to provide a better understanding of previous issues and help to secure the 2020 elections,"" Sara Sendek, a spokesperson for DHS, told NPR.

One weird part of the Trump era (and there are many weird parts) is the rise of Donald Trump the Self-Appointed Elections Expert. In between tweets about the wall, the Mueller Witch Hunt and trade, the president regularly takes to Twitter and talks about why he won in 2016, why the polls are where they are and other topics that the wonks typically obsess over. Here’s his latest:

If the totally Corrupt Media was less corrupt, I would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy, maybe Best Ever! If the Corrupt Media was actually fair, I would be up by 25 points. Nevertheless, despite the Fake News, we’re doing great! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2019

I’m a big believer in leading with the positive and trying to find something good in everything — even this — so let’s start with what the president gets right here. Americans are genuinely happy with the state of the economy and Trump’s performance in that area. According to the latest Economist/YouGov poll, 53 percent of registered voters approve of how the president has been handling the economy, and CBS found that 70 percent of Americans believe the economy is good. Trump’s overall approval rating is in the low-to-mid 40s range, so he’s right to identify the economy as one of his biggest strengths.

But things get a bit thornier for the president’s theory after that.

Trump is right that media coverage of him has been negative. A study by Pew Research Center showed that early coverage of his presidency was more negative than coverage of Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush or Bill Clinton.

But he implies that negative coverage is mostly a product of unfairness or “corruption.” That, to me, seems wrong. If the president wanted the media to cover the economy more often, he could have focused on it more. Instead, he tried to pass a series of unpopular Obamacare repeal-and-replace bills; nominated two Supreme Court justices, one of whom was extremely controversial and had an extended, contentious confirmation fight; passed a traditional Republican tax reform bill; lost the House in the midterm elections; shut the government down over border wall funding; picked fights with protesting NFL players; went through a special investigation; got into trade fights with Canada and Mexico; and characterized white supremacists as “very fine people.”

Reasonable people can make (and have made) the case that the media has a liberal bias. But it’s impossible to look at the events of the last two-plus years and think that the media just decided not to focus on the economy or invent stories that made Trump seem ineffective. If Trump wanted to get more positive coverage for his economic policies, he could probably do so by actually getting started on “Infrastructure Week,” and staying on message about the state of the economy and what he believes to be the impact of his tax cuts.

The specific numbers Trump cite have an odd ring to them, as well. If Trump’s overall approval exactly mirrored his approval rating on the economy, he’d be at +10: Fifty-three percent of registered voters approve of his handling of the economy per YouGov, while 43 percent disapprove, and 53 minus 43 equals 10. But even even if the media only covered the economy, it’s not clear Trump would get to a +10 margin. Only 11 percent of Americans said the economy was the most important issue to them in that same YouGov poll, while most Americans listed primarily non-economic issues as the most important: 50 percent listed abortion, gun control, foreign policy, education, gay rights, terrorism, the environment or immigration as their top issue. If someone disapproved of Trump for cultural reasons, then changing the tone of coverage or shifting to the economy may not be enough to get them aboard the Trump train.

Most significantly, it would be tough for any president to get to a +15 or +25 net-approval rating based on the economy alone. For much of the 20th century, the economy had a strong pull on presidential approval ratings: If the economy was good, people were generally happy with the president; and if the economy was bad, they’d get angry. But that trend broke down during the Obama administration, and neither Obama’s numbers nor Trump’s have closely tracked economic indicators. We’re in an era when the political lines are primarily cultural and demographic. And it’s not clear that some tweaks to media coverage would create a groundswell of support for Trump, without a change in his actual behavior, which would likely cause a massive shift in his polling.

Trump obviously has real political talents and insights — he won a Republican primary and a presidential election. But as his tweet shows, he’d probably be better off if he focused on governing and spent less time trying to beat political analysts at their own game.

Treasury officials also said travel permissions would be denied for private and corporate aircraft and boats, though commercial flights would continue. “Cuba continues to play a destabilizing role in the Western Hemisphere, providing a communist foothold in the region and propping up U.S. adversaries in places like Venezuela and Nicaragua by fomenting instability, undermining the rule of law, and suppressing democratic processes,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. “It kills the people-to-people category, which is the most common way for the average American to travel to Cuba,” Collin Laverty, head of Cuba Educational Travel, one of the largest Cuba travel companies in the U.S., told the AP."
EPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees,https://thehill.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/446897-epa-sued-for-keeping-scientists-off-of-advisory-committees,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was reportedly sued on Monday by a nonprofit over a directive keeping many scientists off of agency advisory panels, according to Reuters.

The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), alleges that an Oct. 31, 2017, directive from former EPA chief Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittEPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage EPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees MORE overturned decades of EPA practices “for no good reason” and without required public comment.

The NRDC claimed that the directive has been used to remove qualified scientists from the agency's roughly 23 advisory committees, allowing EPA to replace scientific advisers with industry representatives, Reuters reported.

The nonprofit environmental advocacy group seeks to set aside the directive and all decisions that have been based on it.

A spokesperson for the EPA told The Hill it does not comment on pending litigation.

Pruitt's 2017 directive bars anyone who receives EPA grant money from serving on advisory panels, citing a need for the committees to be more independent.

The former EPA chief, who resigned in July 2018 amid a growing number of ethics and spending scandals, argued that serving on a committee like the Science Advisory Board would be a conflict of interest for someone receiving agency money to conduct scientific research.

“We want to ensure that there’s integrity in the process, and that the scientists who are advising us are doing so with not any type of appearance of conflict,"" Pruitt said at the time. ""And when you receive that much money … there’s a question that arises about independence.""

Opponents countered that Pruitt wanted to increase representation from the fossil fuel industry and other Trump administration allies on the influential committees.

Since the directive took effect, representation for regulated industries and their allies has grown on the committees, at the expense of academics and researchers, The Hill reported in February.

A legal challenge to the directive fell short that month.

Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee to the District Court for the District of Columbia, dismissed the lawsuit from public health groups, saying it does not dictate who can be appointed to advisory boards.

The laws and regulations at issue “do not dictate whom administrators must, or even should, appoint to federal advisory committees,” McFadden wrote in a ruling dismissing the case.

“To say that certain individuals may not serve is very different than saying that the rest must serve,"" he wrote. ""Agency heads retain substantial discretion to determine membership on federal advisory committees.”"
State Department says it is now requiring social media info from 'most' visa applicants,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/02/politics/state-department-social-media-visa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The State Department has begun requesting ""most"" US visa applicants provide information on their social media accounts, a department official said in a statement.

The move was expected following an announcement in March of last year that outlined plans to require nearly all US visa applicants to submit their social media handles and other information.

The State Department statement over the weekend said the forms for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants had been updated ""to request additional information, including social media identifiers.""

According to the official's statement, the move is a result of a memorandum issued by President Donald Trump in 2017 on ""vetting"" for people coming to the US and a provision of an executive order from around the same time that sought to block entry to the US for people from several majority-Muslim countries, which included a provision on vetting standards.

CNN previously reported that the change was expected to affect around 15 million people.

Immigrant kids are dying in DHS custody. Pediatricians can help.,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Colleen Kraft', 'Jordan Blum', 'Staff Writer', 'Alex Stuckey', 'Houston Chronicle', 'Chandler Rome', 'John Tedesco', 'Lise Olsen', 'Robert Downen', 'Staff Writers']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/Immigrant-kids-are-dying-in-DHS-custody-13937192.php,"As a pediatrician, before I begin an exam, I talk with the parents and children about what’s going on in their lives. The 16-year-old patients I care for in my practice in Southern California are starting to drive, starting to date, to talk about colleges. Their eyes are on the horizon, brimming with life and expectation of the future.

Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez was also a 16-year-old boy, but that is where the similarities end. Carlos did not get to dream of any of the rosy milestones my patients share with me. He simply dreamed of living in a land where he might be safe, free from the threat of violence, and with the possibility of a brighter future.

Instead, he died alone, without family, from an illness that is usually treatable in the U.S. He died in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the sixth child to die in nine months in the custody of the federal government. More children will continue to die if we do not make immediate, permanent changes to the way we treat them when they come here.

Carlos and countless children like him are put in DHS-run facilities in which they are forced to sleep on cement floors, where the lights are on 24-7 and the temperatures are frigid. Staff confiscate and destroy medications to treat chronic conditions such as type 1 diabetes, asthma and seizure disorders, and most of the children have no access to pediatricians.

No child should be subjected to these facilities. The American Academy of Pediatrics has made repeated offers to assist in providing medical care, to review screening and treatment protocols, and to make processing of children more child-friendly. Our pleas have gone unheeded.

In direct opposition to AAP recommendations, DHS leadership and a panel they appointed to look at children and families in custody have argued as recently as May 22 — the week Carlos died — that they should be allowed to detain children with their parents for weeks, months or years, through a legislative change to alter the Flores Settlement Agreement. During his testimony before the Senate Homeland Security committee, Acting Secretary McAleenan said that while the agency wants to move children as quickly as possible out of border-patrol custody, “detention for a child is for the safety of the child.”

That’s false. A review of the evidence shows that no amount of time in detention is safe for a child. Even short amounts of time in detention are harmful. When children are detained, they experience physical and emotional stress, placing them at risk for serious short- and long-term health problems. Congress must immediately reject the proposal to extend the time children and families spend in detention.

For children under 18, conditions in DHS custody are not only unsafe but potentially deadly. This agency has proven repeatedly that it cannot care for children. Security personnel are not medical professionals. They play an important role in cyber security and preventing illegal drugs and weapons from entering our country; they should not be charged with meeting the basic needs of children.

Children are not just small adults, and their signs of illness are subtle. They need providers who can recognize the differences between a mildly ill child and a seriously ill child.

America needs to stop detaining and separating children from their parents and stop threatening the community of family members, caregivers and sponsors by putting their housing, financial security, and immigration status in jeopardy. Most of all, our country needs to ensure that no child ever again dies on our watch.

When I send a 16-year-old patient with influenza home from my California practice, he has a parent to care for him, a bed to sleep in, a home in which to recover, and medication to ease the symptoms. He has a pediatrician his parent can call if things get worse.

Carlos did not have any of those comforts. I think about him every day.

Until I see this inequity between immigrant children like Carlos and my patients resolve, until I see our government pursuing policies based on science and designed with compassion, I will continue speaking out. I do so for Carlos, Jakelin, Felipe, and all the other immigrant children who have died in our country, striving for a better life.

Senior official at Treasury agency investigated for employee bullying,https://www.politico.com,['Victoria Guida'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/04/employee-bullying-treasury-1492846,"The top human resources official at a Treasury Department agency allegedly created a hostile work environment in which employees feel belittled and afraid to speak up. | Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images finance & tax Senior official at Treasury agency investigated for employee bullying

The top human resources official at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is under an internal investigation over claims of bullying and harassment, allegations that echo complaints against her in a previous government position, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.

Cassandra Cuffee-Graves, hired as deputy comptroller for human capital at the bank regulator in April 2018, has created a hostile work environment in which employees feel belittled and afraid to speak up, five OCC staff members said in interviews. Multiple employees argued that Cuffee-Graves was not properly vetted before being given the job, raising broader questions about hiring practices at the agency, which oversees national banks.

Story Continued Below

Cuffee-Graves and her deputy, Bianca Green, are the subject of an administrative inquiry by the OCC’s legal office, according to the employees, who said they were informed of the probe in March. The employees asked to remain anonymous.

OCC spokesperson Joseph Adamoli said the agency, which is an independent bureau within the Treasury Department, does not comment on personnel matters. Cuffee-Graves and Green did not respond to requests for comment.

Similar allegations were made about the two women when they were top HR officials at the Department of Education. A July 8, 2016, letter to then-Education Secretary John King, signed by human resources staff, claimed a “hostile work environment, fear of retaliation from leadership, verbal abuse, violation of the merit system principles, and collusion against employees.” A signatory of the letter told POLITICO that 19 employees were involved in drafting it.

“Several employees with years of service and no prior suspensions have been suspended for submission of work products that were performed under limited direction by management with the sole intent of using the disciplinary process against the employees,” the letter alleged.

In one instance, an employee was suspended by Green without pay for 30 days for failing to complete certain tasks. A case report published in September 2018 by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that hears appeals from government employees, reversed that decision. The board found that whistleblowing by the employee related to hiring practices at the agency was a “contributing factor” in the suspension.

The employee, Christine Reese, had previously alleged “violations of merit principles and prohibited personnel practices” by several management officials, including Cuffee-Graves, in complaints to the department’s inspector-general and the Office of Special Counsel.

In one of those complaints, she claimed Green was wrongly placed in her position because the department did not follow proper procedures to ensure a competitive hiring process, a claim also lodged by human resources staff in their 2016 letter.

MSPB did not rule on the merits of Reese’s claims but decided in her favor upon finding she was a whistleblower.

The MSPB investigation also found that Cuffee-Graves had imposed an “unreasonable” deadline on the suspended employee, less than 24 hours for a project, which was not completed on time -- one reason for the punishment.

Reese was suspended on April 1, 2018, just a few weeks before Cuffee-Graves started her new position at the OCC. Cuffee-Graves hired Green for a newly created deputy position at the OCC that October, shortly after the case report was finalized.

Cuffee-Graves and Green first worked together in 2012, when both were at Customs and Border Protection.

According to court records, Cuffee-Graves was in bankruptcy proceedings when she was hired by the agency, which the OCC employees believe should have raised questions about her suitability for a management position at a key financial regulator.

According to a review of documents from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland, Cuffee-Graves filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in August 2017 and her plan was confirmed in June 2018.

When applying for a job at the OCC, candidates are asked whether they are delinquent on any federal debt, such as taxes or federally insured student loans or mortgages.

Rich Delmar, an official with the Treasury Department’s IG, asked whether the watchdog had any open investigations into the OCC’s office of human capital, said the office “can’t discuss investigative matters.”

The Education Department IG in its annual plan for fiscal year 2018 said it intended to conduct an audit of the department’s hiring practices, but IG spokesperson Catherine Grant said that audit has been put on hold.

“We do not comment on whether we have received an allegation or complaint, nor do we generally confirm whether we are conducting an investigation,” she said."
A Brief History of Old Guys Who Became President of the United States,http://nymag.com,['Ed Kilgore'],06-05-2019,2019,6,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/age-and-the-american-presidency-a-brief-history.html,"Trump has replaced Reagan as the oldest president in U.S. history. Photo: Dirck Halstead/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty

In 2020, at least one of the two major-party nominees is going to be the oldest in U.S. history, since Donald Trump, at 74, will be a record-setter (beating out Ronald Reagan ’84, Bob Dole ’96 and John McCain ’08). There’s a decent chance, however, that the 2020 contest will feature the two oldest nominees ever, if one of the two current Democratic front runners, Joe Biden (who will be 77 on Election Day) or Bernie Sanders (who will be 79) is nominated in Milwaukee next July.

Age hasn’t been a big issue in discussions of any of these esteemed gentlemen so far. Trump is so unusual in so many ways that his calendar age seems almost incidental. Sanders’s strong youth following has probably insulated him from some age-related inquiries. And it’s unclear whether voters really know how old any of these people are in the first place. But given the evidence that some voters are concerned about age, you have to figure some of Biden’s and Sanders’s Democratic rivals might find ways to hint at it (e.g., lots of talk about a “new generation” of leadership, or “fresh thinking,” etc.). An incident that suggests an age-related disability could raise eyebrows and fears, as it did for Dole and for Hillary Clinton.

The age of 2020 candidates may help create the impression that there is an upward trend in the age of presidents (or would-be presidents), which would make sense given steadily increasing life expectancies over the decades and centuries. And indeed, two of the three septuagenarian presidents, Reagan and Trump, were in office in the last 40 years. (Eisenhower, who at the end of his presidency was very briefly as old as Trump was when he began his, is the third.)

But actually, if you separate the 45 presidents into three chronological groups of 15, you get a surprise: The oldest is the first group of 15 presidents, from Washington through Buchanan (1789–1861), which averaged 57.1 years of age upon inauguration. The last 15, from Hoover through Trump (1929–present) averaged 56.3 years of age upon inauguration. (In case you were wondering, the middle group, from Lincoln through Coolidge, was by far the most youthful, averaging 51.6 years at inauguration, with nary a one taking office over 60).

What’s really changed is the relationship of presidential age to that of the relevant (for everyone other than Barack Obama) white male population. Statistics are spotty for the early years of the republic, and relatively high infant-mortality rates skew them, but average age expectancy at the turn of the 19th century was around 40. It was under 45 when William Henry Harrison took office at the age of 68 in 1840. It didn’t hit 50 until the early years of the 20th century. It passed 60 in the 1930s, and 70 around 1980. So most recent presidents were not as old compared to the voters who chose them. Today Bernie Sanders’s age is right at the life expectancy of white men. Compared to those early presidents, he and Biden really don’t stand out.

But just because Americans are living longer doesn’t necessarily mean they are immune from physical and cognitive decline, and that’s the real reason there might be some practical ceiling on presidential age, as I discussed in an earlier piece on the subject of presidential candidates who would turn 80 during their first term:

There are certainly octogenarians who are physically fit, sharp as a tack, and as competent at work as any whippersnapper. But it’s no secret that when people, particularly men, get to that age, the risk of mortality rises significantly (a 75-year-old man has a 22 percent chance of dying within six years), and along with it the possibility of cognitive deterioration (an estimated 15 percent of people between the ages of 80 and 84 suffer from some form of dementia). If voters fear any of that happening, it could (particularly with some encouragement from the kind of intensely hostile conservative media that Sanders and Biden were spared in 2016) affect their electability in ways that are not easy to anticipate in scope and power. And even more obviously, if a 77- or 79-year-old candidate suffers from any real or perceived impairment, the issue could take over the campaign to an extent that makes Hillary Clinton’s email problem look minor.

So from a historical perspective, Trump, Sanders, and Biden (and Elizabeth Warren, who will become a septuagenarian later this month) aren’t too old at all as compared to the rest of the population. From a health point of view, it’s hard to say if they are riskier propositions than younger pols. There is the cautionary tale of Reagan, whom many observers thought was showing signs of serious cognitive impairment during his second term. On the other hand, another president who was clearly impaired, Woodrow Wilson, was only 62 when he suffered a debilitating stroke, and three presidents (excluding those who were assassinated) never made it out of their 50s (and a fourth, the physically vigorous Teddy Roosevelt, barely did). So it’s always going to be a matter of individual capacities and health conditions.

If older-than-ever presidents really do become the wave of the future, it does suggest that the current trend of taking vice-presidential nominations seriously — and not simply awarding them to achieve ideological or geographic balance — is a good idea. “Accidental” presidents John Tyler and Andrew Johnson were calamities for their party and (arguably) their country, and Chet Arthur might have been had he not liberated himself from the political bosses who had owned him. The decision of Democratic leaders to substitute Harry Truman for Henry Wallace as veep in 1944 based on their justified fears about FDR’s health had enormous consequences. If the Donkey Party does nominate a 2020 presidential candidate who would require a raging fire of birthday candles, the second spot on the ticket should be occupied by someone who is more than a ticket-balancer. And if one of them wins and thrives, we can begin thinking about a “ceiling” for candidates that’s even higher."
Trump's latest Interior pick wins unexpected support from environmentalists,https://thehill.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447105-trumps-latest-interior-pick-wins-support-of-some-environmentalists,"President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi privately told Democrats she wants Trump 'in prison': report Pelosi privately told Democrats she wants Trump 'in prison': report Warren invokes Obama, Trump when asked about electability MORE’s most recent Interior Department nominee is garnering support from an unexpected group: environmentalists.

Robert Wallace, nominated to help oversee the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service (NPS), is bucking the trend of opposition from green groups, even though he ticks several boxes that would otherwise draw a strong rebuke from environmentalists: He’s a Trump appointee, earns thousands of dollars from stock in the oil industry and spent nearly two decades as a lobbyist for General Electric Energy.

Wallace currently works as president of the Upper Green River Conservancy and as a partner at the investment firm i2Capital.

The Wyoming native testified this week before the two Senate committees that oversee Interior.

In addition to words of praise from Republicans and some Democrats, several environmental groups said they plan to endorse Wallace, citing his background and their experience working with him. His work on protecting habitat for the sage-grouse also seems to have won over a number of green groups.

The National Park Conservation Association (NPCA), Ducks Unlimited and the National Wildlife Refuge Association all have or will endorse Wallace. Other groups are staying silent instead of opposing his nomination.

“In NPCA’s experience, Wallace understands the many diverse opinions surrounding national parks and has shown his commitment to inclusive community-based dialogue and solutions,” the association wrote in a letter to senators. “He has been a dedicated participant and leader in public lands and wildlife management and most recently has demonstrated his ability to bring diverse stakeholders together to preserve sage grouse habitat in Wyoming.”

In confirmed, Wallace would be the first assistant secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks since 2011.

Before his career as a lobbyist, Wallace worked for the National Park Service, both as a park ranger right out of college and later as a congressional liaison for NPS during the Reagan administration. He also worked as chief of staff for former Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) and later as the Republican director of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

In both hearings, Wallace stressed his willingness to work in a bipartisan manner and improve the contentious relationship between the government and partners at the state, tribal, and local level who have a strong interest in federal land management.

“Partner is an easy word to say, but a hard word to implement,” he told senators Wednesday. “The federal government always shows up as the alpha, and that’s a model I will work to better equalize.”

Green groups have largely been at odds with Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency since Trump took office, flagging ethical issues among the top brass and bemoaning the number of former lobbyists employed at the agencies.

And not all environmental groups have high praise for Wallace.

“Just when you thought the Trump administration couldn’t possibly fill the swamp with any more lobbyists, they nominate another one whose former employer has business before Interior,"" Chris Saeger, executive director of the Western Values Project, said in a statement. ""Following in ex-mega lobbyist turned-Interior Secretary [David] Bernhardt’s footsteps, Wallace would immediately be in a position to influence decisions that could benefit the special interests he used to work for.”

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee have yet to schedule votes on Wallace's nomination."
The Trump Administration Might Be Too Incompetent to Undermine Environmental Regulations,https://slate.com,['Richard L. Revesz'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/trump-administration-cant-actually-undermine-environmental-regulation-too-incompetent.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Nivellen77/iStock / Getty Images Plus and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

The Trump administration appears to be entering an alarming new stage of its attack on environmental protection. For the past two-plus years, it has used a retail approach, targeting Obama-era environmental rules one by one, trying to suspend compliance deadlines. This strategy has been met with limited success—more than 90 percent of the administration’s deregulatory efforts are being defeated in court, mostly due to sloppy agency actions. But the Environmental Protection Agency has recently decided it will undertake a new approach in its effort to launch a wholesale attack on environmental regulation—it will change the way it collects and processes data, to provide better justification to dismantle the analytical foundation of its rules. These moves fly in the face of established economics and health sciences, and are inconsistent with the practices of administrations of both parties over four decades. The consequences for the environment and public health could be disastrous. But even as this approach might be more deliberate, these actions are unlikely to survive court challenges as well.

The EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards.

In the coming weeks, the EPA plans to finalize vastly weakened versions of two important climate rules: a regulation controlling greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and standards to limit emissions from vehicles. The draft proposals for the Trump administration’s revisions to each of these rules were rife with analytical problems. In the power plant rule revision, the agency exercised its discretion in a manner that imposed billions of dollars’ worth of net harm on the American public. And the vehicle rule analysis is justified by claims about improved safety that rest on a wholly implausible and discredited economic analysis: It assumes that people will buy more—as opposed to fewer—vehicles as they become more expensive. These failures are likely to reappear in the final rules as well, because the administration would be unable to justify its chosen actions without mangling the underlying analysis. As a result of these analytical failures, the rollbacks will be highly vulnerable to legal challenges and could add to the administration’s string of court losses.

Perhaps sensing urgency as these losses mount and the president’s term slips away, the EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards. The agency has taken steps to begin an assault on the core foundations of environmental rulemaking, signaling that it plans to alter the building blocks of the economic analysis that underlies its rules. This new EPA attack features three dirty tricks that would erase the bulk of the benefits of critical environmental policies. These benefits—tens of thousands of averted deaths and hundreds of thousands of averted hospitalizations for strokes, heart attacks, and respiratory ailments—would, of course, still be there. The administration’s analysis would just pretend otherwise.

One EPA method involves calling into question the benefit of reducing pollution below the level of the national ambient air quality standards. Since the late 1970s, every administration—Republican and Democratic—has acknowledged that more stringent standards would provide greater health benefits. But earlier this month, William Wehrum, who oversees air quality for the EPA, brazenly cast doubt on this long-established, science-based approach, telling the New York Times that counting these benefits in regulatory analyses “doesn’t make any sense” because the standards are set at “safe” levels, thereby implying that there can be no benefits at concentrations below the ones that the EPA deems to be “safe.”

The problem with this understanding is that the Supreme Court has made clear that “the word ‘safe’ does not mean ‘risk-free.’ ” And, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which hears all the challenges to national ambient air quality standards, explained that in setting these standards, EPA must “ ‘select … standard levels that … reduce risks sufficiently to protect public health’ ” even while recognizing that “ ‘a zero-risk standard is [not] possible.’ ”

Wehrum should know better, or at least, he did not too long ago. He had previously served under President George W. Bush in senior positions in EPA’s air office between 2001 and 2007. During that time, in setting national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and for ozone, the EPA acknowledged that significantly higher benefits would accrue to the American people if the agency set the standards at levels more stringent that the ones it ultimately chose. The significant concern with this approach is that it will pave the way for the EPA to support laxer standards without having to acknowledge that there is a cost to human life in doing so.

A second EPA trick involves concealing “co-benefits”—the indirect (and often enormous) benefits that result when a regulation reduces pollutants besides the ones being directly targeted by a particular regulation. EPA has launched an attack on co-benefits most directly as part of a revision to a finding related to a major mercury pollution rule—it’s trying to argue that the $37 billion to $90 billion in health co-benefits resulting from reductions in harmful particulate matter pollution don’t exist. If the administration’s goal is to obscure the value of environmental rules, undermining co-benefits will certainly help.

Co-benefits are so universally accepted as a worthwhile thing to consider that even the Trump EPA’s own handpicked Science Advisory Board recently highlighted the importance of considering them. Furthermore, a landmark guidance document on regulatory analysis issued by the Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush explicitly requires the consideration of indirect benefits, though the EPA has consistently taken co-benefits into account since the Reagan administration. Courts have also ruled that the indirect costs of regulations must be considered, so ignoring indirect benefits would create a lopsided and unjustifiable analysis. Indeed, counting indirect effects when they are negative but ignoring them when they are positive is the embodiment of the type of arbitrary and capricious conduct that the law categorically prohibits. But the Trump EPA now wants to make this the norm.

The EPA’s final dirty trick involves questioning foundational scientific studies on the harmful health impacts of particulate pollution. The detrimental health effects of particulate matter emissions are exceptionally well-documented. Two foundational studies performed in the 1990s found that people in cities with the highest levels of these pollutants were dying two years earlier than those in the least-polluted cities. The results were independently verified by two groups of outside researchers, and these studies have helped inform several major air pollution regulations. But an EPA rule proposed last year would bar the consideration of studies like these, even though they are widely regarded as state-of-the-art, because their individual patient health data cannot be shared publicly, because of patient confidentiality rules. The administration’s approach would make it virtually impossible for regulatory policy to rely on epidemiological studies, a science-denying approach that is unlikely to find a receptive ear in the courts.

During the retail phase of the Trump administration’s attack on environmental rules, the EPA cut corners, which led to most of its actions being overturned in court. This new wholesale attack on environmental rulemaking is far more pernicious than the last. The Trump administration is actively trying to undermine and minimize science that has served as a universal baseline for decades. But once again, it’s pursuing its case sloppily, which means the courts are likely to still see through these dirty tricks and stop them before they have a massively negative impact on public health."
DOJ May Investigate Google Again Over Antitrust Issues,https://www.seroundtable.com,['Barry Schwartz'],,,,https://www.seroundtable.com/doj-google-antitrust-issues-27679.html,"The Wall Street Journal reported (WP link) that the Department of Justice may open up an antitrust probe against Google again.

Let me directly upfront that I know very little about legal issues, little about the DOJ and government politics and law. I know when I watch congressional or senate questioning about a topic I know about, it shows how little our government reps know about the topic.

I know Google won a previous antitrust case years ago. But this case, if it is happening, is unclear:

The exact focus of the Justice Department’s investigation is unclear. The department began work on the matter after brokering an agreement with the government’s other antitrust agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to take the lead on antitrust oversight of Google, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.

The folks at WebmasterWorld are saying some fun things:

We'll have to wait and see what happens. In the past these things have ""started"" and never gone anywhere.

I am sure that ""Alphabet"" anticipated this since a very long time, and is prepared ... so that, at the end nothing will really change happy!

Its about freakin time. Obviously I’m not the only who who’s been writing letters!

Looks like FTC, Justice, and Congress are all taking up investigations. Google (Alphabet, Search, Ad biz, YouTube), Facebook, Amazon ... all are up for investigation(s).

The icing on the cake is Google's restraint of trade - not allowing websites to link to each other. I'll make damn sure the DOJ knows about that little infraction.

Greg Sterling who is way smarter than me wrote it up at Search Engine Land earlier this week. Also Rand Fishkin wrote up his thoughts at Sparktoro. Rand also posted this stream of thoughts on Twitter:

First, the argument/case being made is NOT: ""Google has a monopoly in search and that's wrong/unfair"".

The DOJ (and concerned citizens) are arguing: ""Google used its monopoly in search to give themselves unfair advantages in other businesses"".

And now with Google Hotels/Flights, are they treating all travel competitors fairly in search? Does everyone get the same opportunity for visibility (in both paid & organic), or does Google give favored treatment to Alphabet-owned properties? /4 — Rand Fishkin (@randfish) June 2, 2019

These are the types of questions that show use of monopoly power in one business/field to unfairly compete in others. That's where the issues are, and that's where I'll focus my post. If you have Qs, suggested links, examples, etc. I would LOVE help! Thanks all 🙏 /fin — Rand Fishkin (@randfish) June 2, 2019

If there are other parts of Google's behavior you think are clear cut cases of anti-competitive behavior, or unfair use of monopoly power that I should cover, please let me know (esp. if you've got good resources I can check out/cite). Thanks! — Rand Fishkin (@randfish) June 3, 2019

I honestly have no real thoughts on this. When it comes to politics, taxes, and governments - I personally find I rather spend my time working on stuff I can make a real impact with. So I spend the time and energy on other things than that topic. I just have zero interest in these topics - I know, I am weird.

If some law comes out where Google needs to make changes, then I'd cover that and what it means to the SEO community. I think we have some time for that...
