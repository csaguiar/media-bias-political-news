Trump DOJ scores rare win on sanctuary city crackdown in appeals court,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doj-scores-rare-win-on-sanctuary-city-crackdown-in-appeals-court,"President Trump notched a win on Friday in a federal appeals court, which upheld a Department of Justice method for cracking down on sanctuary cities.

In a 2-1 decision that overturns a nationwide injunction, the DOJ is now allowed to give preferential treatment for community policing grants to cities that don't defy federal immigration enforcement.

""The department is pleased that the court recognized the lawful authority of the administration to provide favorable treatment when awarding discretionary law enforcement grants to jurisdictions that assist in enforcing federal immigration laws,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

DHS LEADING INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO RAID LEAKS

While the Trump administration has faced numerous obstacles in cutting funding to sanctuary cities, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appears to make an exception for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program, which is meant to help cities hire more police officers.

Other factors in the program's ""points"" system include the hiring of veterans, and the occurrence of school shootings within a jurisdiction. In 2017, the DOJ under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented points that benefit non-sanctuary cities.

Judges Sandra Ikuta and Jay Bybee, who ruled in the DOJ's favor, were appointees of President George W. Bush.

""Cooperation relating to enforcement of federal immigration law is in pursuit of the general welfare, and meets the low bar of being germane to the federal interest in providing the funding to 'address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise ... enhance public safety,'"" Ikuta stated."
House Passes $733 Billion Defense Bill Checking Trump’s War Powers,https://www.nytimes.com,['Catie Edmondson'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/trump-iran-vote.html,"Mr. Trump vetoed legislation in April that invoked the War Powers Act to cut off American military support to the campaign.

Another amendment, also passed Thursday, would prevent the Trump administration from using emergency authority to transfer munitions to the kingdom.

Progressives who initially wavered on whether they would support the defensive bill were encouraged by those provisions, as well as by an amendment that would reinstate transgender people to military service, reversing Mr. Trump’s ban. Another would phase out the authorization of military force passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which has been used since then to justify military actions around the world.

Those provisions were enough to provoke the ire of House Republicans. But the main objection of Republicans to the defense bill was that it does not allocate enough money to the Defense Department. The legislation authorizes $733 billion in military spending — and includes a 3 percent pay increase for troops — while the Senate version allocates $750 billion, meeting the figure the White House requested.

A series of bipartisan amendments led by Republicans did pass the House, including a measure from Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin that would require the Commerce Department to keep Huawei, the Chinese telecom company, on its blacklist until it can certify the company does not pose a threat to the United States’ telecommunications and infrastructure. Mr. Trump had recently promised to ease the ban for the company, despite concerns that the company could pose a threat to national security.

Lawmakers also roundly defeated twin amendments from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, that would have prevented the president from deploying troops to the Mexican border to enforce immigration law and would have barred the Defense Department from housing migrants at its centers.

But taken as a whole, there were too many “problematic” provisions in the policy bill for Republicans to support, said Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee.

“It’s shameful. They’re failing fundamentally to uphold our constitutional duty, and they’re failing in the most important thing we do, which is be worthy of the sacrifice of those men and women who put on the uniform and go to protect all of us,” said Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican. “When Congress politicizes the National Defense Authorization Act, we are not worthy of the men and women who are defending us on the front lines today.”"
Donald Trump is right about bitcoin,https://www.marketwatch.com,['Brett Arends'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/donald-trump-is-right-about-bitcoin-2019-07-12,"Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump’s comments about bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies on Thursday were right on target.

He’s right: Their value is “based on thin air.” Your typical cryptocurrency is basically a “frequent flyers” program, only without any airline attached. You hope someone will accept your “miles” for something real. But there’s no guarantee.

He’s right: They are ”highly volatile.” In the past two years bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.41% has gone from $19,000 to $3,200 and back up to $11,000 and change.

He’s right: They can “facilitate unlawful behavior.” I’d argue that’s their main use.

And he’s right: If Facebook FB, +1.81% wants to launch its own currency, it should seek a banking charter.

The president made his comments after palling around with techies at a “social media” summit at the White House. (His glowing references to the U.S. dollar — “...stronger than ever... by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World...” — also suggest that Larry “King Dollar” Kudlow, his chief economic adviser, has been whispering recently in his ear.)

They come as another cryptocurrency bubble, or mania, threatens to reinflate.

Bitcoin has trebled so far this year, and is back above $10,000. Cryptocurrencies are like a virus that won’t die. They keep metastasizing. There are still more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, and their theoretical total value is about $318 billion — more than the value of Procter & Gamble PG, +0.53% , and only slightly less than that of Exxon Mobil XOM, +0.08% .

I know which I’d rather own.

Cryptocurrencies are a pure gamble with no discernible fundamentals whatsoever. The cryptocurrency “markets” are rife with fraud, scams and manipulation. I’d love them if I were a con artist.

Have fun. But you are better off wagering your money at the race track: At least there you can see the horses.

Cryptocurrency fans were cheering Trump’s comments on Thursday, because their market feeds on attention. Trump caused a brief — very brief — spike in the price of Bitcoin.

But they can’t contradict a single one of his arguments. He’s right. He’s so right, his comments are truisms.

It was Ohio State coach Woody Hayes who said allegedly that when a quarterback throws a pass, only three things can happen, “and two of them are bad.” But cryptocurrencies are even worse. When cryptocurrencies boom, only two things can happen, and both of them are bad.

The first is that they can boom, and then they can crash — at which point you find that lots of ordinary retail investors have been hosed, in dotcom style, by insiders.

Plenty of that happened in 2017. Some of the cases are now making their way through the courts.

That’s bad.

The second is that cryptocurrencies can boom, and then NOT crash.

If that happens, congratulations: You’ve just helped create a shadow currency system that can be used worldwide by terrorists, extortionists, drug dealers, child pornographers, hit men, and anyone else who doesn’t want to go through the regular banking system.

That’s even worse than the first outcome.

Some of the biggest fans of cryptocurrency: Hackers who use ransomware to extort money from hospitals, municipalities and others. The global WannaCry ransomware attack of 2017 helped put Bitcoin on the map.

Yes, by all means let’s make that even easier, shall we?

Cheerleaders for cryptocurrencies like to present themselves as noble, heroic champions of monetary “freedom.” Digital currencies will “democratize” money, break up power structures, “decentralize” the world, and so on.

It’s all nonsense.

Anarchy doesn’t help the weak, it helps the powerful. It doesn’t serve the interests of the honorable, but of the ruthless. Read up on the Dark Ages, folks. Read up on the Wild West.

The naive who rail against regulation and big government need to study more about what the world was like before these terrible, terrible things came along.

In some parts of the crypto cult, there’s more than a whiff of paranoia about banks and “international financial interests.” Cue: Illuminati, Elders of Zion, the Rothchilds, Federal Reserve, and so on.

(How ironic, incidentally, that Trump was happy to pander to those people during his election campaign)

But one aspect of bitcoin isn’t often talked about. It isn’t really forward-looking. It’s incredibly retro.

Bitcoin is tight money. There’s only a limited supply of bitcoins . The number in existence cannot be expanded by much, and only very slowly. And we’ve seen this movie before. Tight money helped cause the Great Depression of the 1930s and probably the previous great depression of the 1870s. Tight money helped make the European debt crisis much worse. Money is a medium of exchange. If there isn’t enough of it to go around, the economy simply slows down.

Tight money — once based on gold — was a disastrous financial superstition.

Actually, the current debate in finance is about how loose you can make money. Modern Monetary Theory argues, in effect, that you can pretty much loosen it all you want. That may be the other extreme. But at least it makes money the servant of the economy, not the other way around."
Trump administration asks for Supreme Court intervention over border wall construction,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Shannon Bream', ""Shannon Bream Currently Serves As Anchor Of Fox News Channel'S"", 'Fnc']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-asks-for-supreme-court-intervention-over-border-wall-construction,"The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to lift an injunction imposed by a lower court that blocks the administration from using $2.5 billion in military funds to construct a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

The filing went to Justice Elena Kagan, who has given environmental groups who brought the original lawsuit until 4 p.m. July 19 to respond with their own brief.

PENCE VISITS MIGRANT DETENTION CENTER NEAR SOUTHERN BORDER TO 'SEE FIRSTHAND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS'

Kagan will also likely ask all her colleagues to weigh in, but it’s unclear when an order will be issued.

Earlier this month, a divided three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco agreed with a lower court ruling that prevented the government from tapping Defense Department counterdrug money to build high-priority sections of the planned wall in Arizona, California, and New Mexico.

At stake is billions of dollars that would allow Trump to make progress on a major 2016 campaign promise heading into his race for a second term.

Trump declared a national emergency after losing a funding fight with the Democratic-led House that led to a 35-day government shutdown. Congress agreed to spend nearly $1.4 billion on barriers in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings, an amount well below the $5.7 billion the president requested.

Trump grudgingly accepted the money but declared the emergency in order to siphon up to $8.1 billion for wall construction. That amount includes $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion from Defense Department counterdrug activities and $600 million from the Treasury Department's asset forfeiture fund.

Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper has yet to approve the transfer of the military construction funds.

E.P.A. Plans to Curtail the Ability of Communities to Oppose Pollution Permits,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/climate/epa-community-pollution-appeal.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to weaken rules that for the past quarter-century have given communities a voice in deciding how much pollution may legally be released by nearby power plants and factories.

The changes would eliminate the ability of individuals or community advocates to appeal against E.P.A.-issued pollution permits before a panel of agency judges. However, the industrial permit-holders could still appeal to the panel, known as the Environmental Appeals Board, to allow them to increase their pollution.

The draft plan was described by three people familiar with the document, who requested anonymity because the proposal is not yet public. The document has been largely completed, they said, and the next step would be to announce the proposed rule change and seek public comment.

“This is outrageous,” said Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard. “Individuals in communities will lose a way to seek relief from pollution that has historically been very effective. But industry will still be able to seek relief to pollute more.”"
Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan under federal investigation for alleged leaks,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Pablo Martinez Monsivais'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/acting-dhs-secretary-mcaleenan-under-federal-investigation-for-alleged-leaks-officials,"Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan is at the center of a federal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to call off a nationwide operation, three senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

Following the publishing of sensitive leaked law enforcement information on June 21, then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team followed department protocol and reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate. JIC is an agency office that handles internal investigations of personnel misconduct, sexual abuse, staff neglect, or violations of responsibilities that may have contributed to such incidents.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It's not clear if JIC has referred the matter to the DHS Office of the Inspector General.

“Any investigation into the malicious, unauthorized disclosure of the operations is completely justified. Any causal observer would logically deduce that McAleenan’s dodgy response and coy behavior warrant additional scrutiny,” a second senior official said late Thursday.

A third official said the department’s decision to pursue the investigation of the acting secretary in itself was “very troubling.”

“It’s worrisome that it took days for the acting secretary to acknowledge and then deny the allegations, and it’s telling that he didn’t call for the investigation in the first place. More than anything, it’s unfortunate that people are even having this discussion at all,” the official wrote in a text.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak, charging he wanted to sabotage ICE’s monthslong plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

“That’s our belief,” one official told the Washington Examiner in late June, when asked if McAleenan was behind the leak. “The secretary was not supportive from day one.”

The acting secretary, who was in El Paso Thursday to show mayors from southern border cities conditions of Border Patrol facilities, has not mentioned the investigation in the weeks since the leak.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week, but on Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which border patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE is now planning to carry out raids nationwide this weekend, though it is not clear if the same people targeted in the canceled ones from June will be the focus of these new ones. The raids were reported Friday as having started earlier than expected."

The Justice Department is asking the Supreme Court to step in to lift court orders blocking President Donald Trump from proceeding with his plan to spend billions of dollars on border wall construction despite Congress’ efforts to limit that spending.

Administration lawyers filed a stay application Friday afternoon seeking to lift an Oakland-based federal judge’s order blocking border wall projects in California, Arizona and New Mexico.

Story Continued Below

Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the high court that the injunction is impairing federal officials’ ability to cut drug trafficking across the border with Mexico.

“The harm to the government and the public from enjoining DOD’s use of the transferred funds during litigation is significant. The injunction frustrates the government’s ability to stop the flow of drugs across the border in known drug-smuggling corridors,” Francisco wrote.

Justice Elena Kagan gave the environmental and border groups that obtained the injunction until next Friday to respond to the request.

The current injunction puts on hold about $2.5 billion Trump’s plan sought to spend through a provision allowing available Defense Department construction funds to be spent on unforeseen needs.

However, the language Congress passed adding that flexibility says that authority can’t be used for budget items previously denied by lawmakers. Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for border wall work in the current budget, and nothing for the specific projects covered by the injunction, but Trump aides devised a plan to spend more than $8 billion on the broad effort.

Trump’s move in May, which included efforts to open up funding by declaring a state of emergency, immediately drew a series of lawsuits from environmentalists, border residents, states and the House of Representatives. The suits argue Trump is acting illegally by spending funds without the approval of Congress, which must approve all appropriations under the Constitution.

Last week, a federal appeals court panel voted, 2-1, to deny the Justice Department’s stay request.

“The Constitution assigns to Congress the power of the purse. Under the Appropriations Clause, it is Congress that is to make decisions regarding how to spend taxpayer dollars,” 9th Circuit Judges Richard Clifton and Michelle Friedland wrote. “Congress did not appropriate money to build the border barriers Defendants seek to build here. Congress presumably decided such construction at this time was not in the public interest. It is not for us to reach a different conclusion.”

The appeals judges were unsparing about some of the Trump administration’s arguments. Clifton and Friedland deemed “not credible” the Justice Department’s contention that Congress had not denied the administration the funds it was seeking to spend.

The groups that obtained the injunction, the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition, said they’ll urge the justices not to lift the order.

“The courts have twice ruled against Trump’s requests to stay this important court order stopping construction of his ruinous wall. Now he is asking the Supreme Court to step in and save his wall, but we will continue to vehemently fight these tactics,” Sierra Club attorney Gloria Smith said.

The Justice Department filing with the high court asks the justices to rule on the application by July 26 to allow the funding process to be completed by September 30. Previous filings from the administration said that process needed to begin by early July to be carried out while the funds are still available.

However, administration lawyers also told the Supreme Court on Friday they’ve discovered a mechanism that might allow that process to be compressed, permitting officials to formally obligate funds for the border projects closer to the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30."

An ICE spokesperson told Fox News on Friday that the agency referred the leak to DHS’s Joint Intake Center after “operational plans” were leaked last month.

DHS BOSS MCALEENAN ACCUSED OF OPPOSING, LEAKING PLANNED ICE RAIDS

The Joint Intake Center (JIC) is the division of the agency that handles and investigated allegations of professional misconduct.

It is unclear, at this point, how long the investigation will last.

An official told Fox News that leaks on plans are sensitive and “jeopardize law enforcement safety.”

A senior administration source also told Fox News Friday that the investigation was opened after a request made by senior ICE officials.

McAleenan has vehemently denied the leak claims. In an interview with Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio last month, he said: ""Categorically, I did not and would not leak details of a law enforcement operation.""

McAleenan came under fire last month after officials and other sources publicly, and privately, accused him of leaking details of planned ICE deportation raids. The report in question, which was published by Washington Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn in major cities.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff less than 24 hours before the story was published. The source also said that when the raids were in a planning phase, McAleenan was opposed and even ordered Morgan to call off the operation -- though Trump told him to proceed. The president, though, put the operation on hold after the leak amid talks with Congress.

The deportation operation was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country, including Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami.

A senior administration official told Fox News last month that after the alleged leak, ""He’s lost the confidence and trust of both the workforce and his superiors, with no viable path to proceed with any confidence and credibility."""

Trump issued the order after courts ruled against having the citizenship question on the 2020 census. The order was also issued to avoid delaying the census any longer.

""To achieve that goal, I have determined that it is imperative that all executive departments and agencies provide the Department the maximum assistance permissible, consistent with law, in determining the number of citizens and non-citizens in the country, including by providing any access that the Department may request to administrative records that may be useful in accomplishing that objective,"" the executive order states.

All agencies are being ordered to provide the citizenship data to an interagency working group that will be created to process the information.

State information on citizens will also be sent to the Commerce Department.

In the order, Trump outlines which information will be sent by which federal agency:



Department of Homeland Security: National-level file of Lawful Permanent Residents, naturalizations, F1 and M1 nonimmigrant visas, national-level file of customs and border arrival/departure transaction data

Department of State: refugee and asylum visas, national-level passport application data

Social Security Administration: Master beneficiary records

Department of Health and Human Services: CMS Medicaid and CHIP Information System

Trump has instructed the Commerce Department begin planning the administrative processes necessary to add the citizenship question to the census in 2030."
"Government Could Breach Debt Ceiling in September, Mnuchin Warns",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Emily Cochrane', 'Jim Tankersley']",07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/debt-ceiling.html,"“It’s time that we got serious on a bipartisan basis to try to work this out and not have the kind of chaos that goes along with our inability to come together on these kind of important issues,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, at a news conference on Tuesday.

The federal government has already run a $747 billion budget deficit for the 2019 fiscal year, which ends in September — a 23 percent increase from the year before. That is an unusually large increase given the strength of economic growth.

Total personal and corporate income tax levels are down slightly from the previous year, Treasury Department statistics show. Federal spending has risen — particularly for national defense and health care programs — and so have the interest costs on the growing national debt. Those trends reflect Washington’s free-spending ways and the rising costs of an aging population as the baby boom generation draws Social Security and Medicare benefits.

Those dynamics have yet to prompt a renewed interest in the deficit, but they are intensifying pressure on lawmakers to raise the debt limit — or risk economic catastrophe if they do not.

A 2018 budget deal in Congress suspended the limit, which constrains the amount of money the government may borrow to continue paying its bills, until this past March 1. Once that deadline passed, the Treasury Department was forced to begin employing “extraordinary measures” in order to maintain the borrowing needed to keep paying soldiers, issuing Social Security checks and otherwise funding the government.

Those measures include premature redemption of Treasury bonds owned by federal employees’ retirement accounts, borrowing cash set aside to smooth exchange rate fluctuations and stopping contributions to some government pension funds.

Mr. Mnuchin’s letter is a warning that those sleight-of-the-balance-sheet efforts cannot last forever. When the Treasury Department runs out of them, it will not have enough money coming in to pay its spending obligations. That would necessitate either sharp and immediate spending cuts, or a government default on some of its obligations — not paying workers, contractors, lenders or citizens it owes money to."

Although some activists have urged the government to abolish its immigration enforcement arm, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) came out in favor of eradicating the entire Department of Homeland Security.

The department’s creation after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, significantly threatened American civil liberties, Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday on the WNYC podcast “the New Yorker Radio Hour.” She said she wanted to get rid of Homeland Security, the formation of which she called an “egregious mistake.”

“People sounded the alarm back then, that these agencies are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight, and it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies,” she told the New Yorker’s editor, David Remnick.

Conservative political figures immediately castigated the congresswoman’s proposal.

“Moronic, stupid, naive and dumb,” former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said on Fox News.

""Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner.

[‘Outright disrespectful’: Four House women struggle as Pelosi isolates them]

The usefulness of a Department of Homeland Security, however, wasn’t always taken for granted. President George W. Bush’s administration initially had “zero interest” in creating a new department to protect against terrorism, The Washington Post previously reported. Vice President Richard B. Cheney thought it would needlessly increase the size of government.

“Creating a Cabinet post doesn’t solve the problem,” White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said in March 2002, according to The Post.

Some members of Congress worried the White House was concealing the department’s true cost to avoid alienating Republicans who opposed the growth of government, USA Today reported in 2002. Certain conservative Republicans, meanwhile, said they would not oppose Bush’s proposal but wanted to move slowly, according to the Houston Chronicle.

When the House of Representatives initially voted on the department’s creation the following July, 132 members opposed the move, including 10 Republicans. Congress eventually passed the Homeland Security Act and Bush signed it into law that November, creating the Department of Homeland Security.

Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday that her proposal was “not that radical,” citing the reluctance of some members of Congress to support the department’s creation less than two decades ago.

“When DHS was 1st formed by Bush 17 years ago, many members of Congress were concerned — incl GOP — that we were setting up a ticking time bomb for civil liberties erosion & abuse of power,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.

It’s really not that radical.

Like some members of Congress, non-politicians also criticized the new department, which merged 22 federal agencies tasked with securing the country’s borders, protecting its infrastructure and guarding against terrorism.

James Bamford, a journalist and filmmaker who covers intelligence agencies, told CBS News in 2002 that creating Homeland Security was a public relations move that could actually decrease efficiency.

“Instead of moving people together, you should be moving information together,” Bamford told CBS. “You should be taking information and finding better ways to distribute it; faster ways to distribute it among people.”

In a 2003 article in National Review, conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru criticized Bush’s record as president, noting that Bush had “raised defense spending, given new powers to law enforcement, federalized airport security and created a new cabinet department for homeland security. . . . More people are working for the federal government than at any point since the end of the Cold War.”

Homeland Security was originally staffed by 180,000 employees from the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal offices. It also encompasses the agencies that oversee immigration, including Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Homeland Security now has a workforce of more than 240,000, making it the government’s third-biggest department, behind Defense and Veterans Affairs.

The Transportation Security Administration, which screens passengers at airports, was absorbed into Homeland Security just a year after it was created in response to 9/11 in November 2001. Conservatives at the time expressed concern that the new agency was unnecessarily bureaucratic and gave too much power to the government.

“Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state — of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove — was mistrust,” Slate reported. “The second most common opinion was fear.”

Republicans’ ire for the TSA survived a decade after the agency’s creation. Then-Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) in 2011 said Americans were “no safer today than they were before 9/11,” according to Forbes. The GOP’s 2012 presidential platform called for the privatization of airport security.

Calls to abolish Homeland Security are now made year after year, in publications ranging from policy journals to mainstream news outlets. In a tweet from 2018 shared by Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday, Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) recalled a time when conservatives viewed Homeland Security as overly bureaucratic.

“Conservatives used to want to abolish DHS — as well as many other departments and agencies that bloat government,” wrote Amash, who announced on the Fourth of July that he was leaving the Republican Party. “If only today’s members of Congress cared as much about defending the Constitution as they do about defending ICE, an agency that’s existed only since 2003.”

Updated at 1:09 p.m. ET

Debbie Baker thought she qualified for a federal program that helps teachers such as her, as well as nurses, police officers, librarians and others. The Department of Education program forgives their federal student loans if they make their payments for 10 years and work in public service.

For 10 years, Baker, who was a public school teacher in Tulsa, Okla., checked in with loan servicing companies and was told she was on track.

""I said, 'I'm qualifying for public service loan forgiveness,' and they said, 'OK, great,' "" she says.

But it turns out that her $76,000 in student loans didn't get forgiven. Baker was finally told she was in the wrong type of loan. If she'd known that at the beginning, she could have switched loans and ended up qualifying. But she says nobody ever told her.

""When this hit ... I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, get mad,"" she says. ""I honestly did not think the federal government would do this to someone.""

Now, Baker is a plaintiff in a lawsuit being brought by one of the biggest teachers unions in the country against the Department of Education. The suit alleges the loan forgiveness program for millions of public service workers is in such a shambles that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

Have you had problems qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Share your story with NPR.

The American Federation of Teachers filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court. In the complaint obtained by NPR, the union is asking the court to order the department to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that it meets legal standards. It's also asking the department to come up with an appeals process for people who believe they have been treated unfairly.

Congress created the program more than a decade ago to encourage public service. So, if you make loan payments for 10 years and you work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit, the program promises to forgive the remainder of your federal student loan debt.

That promise sounded really good to a lot of people. More than 1 million have filed official paperwork to take part in the program. But there's a problem.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" says Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""This is a debacle.""

Plenty of consumer watchdogs agree.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" says Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

By the department's last count, only 1% of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson says, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven.""

He says they've made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves.""

As happened with Debbie Baker, if a student loan borrower is in the wrong type of loan, or the wrong type of repayment plan, they can't qualify for loan forgiveness.

There are different kinds of federal loans and a wide array of payment plans. If a student loan borrower is told they need to switch from one type to the other to qualify for the program, that's easy enough to do. For public service loan forgiveness, borrowers need to have a ""direct federal loan."" But if their loan servicer never tells them that, they can remain in the wrong type of loan or plan for years, thinking they're making progress toward loan forgiveness only to find out later that none of those payments counted towards forgiveness.

The teachers union lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education ""knows of — but completely disregards — repeated misrepresentations made by [student loan] servicers to borrowers who are attempting to qualify ... resulting in unwarranted denials of loan forgiveness.""

In other words, people like Baker aren't given the right information or advice, and many end up in the wrong types of loans or repayment plans and get unfairly disqualified. Government reports and investigations have found similar problems with borrowers getting bad information.

The lawsuit also alleges that loan servicers are having trouble keeping track of the number of qualifying payments people make — even when they are in the correct loan and payment plan and manage to do everything right.

Weingarten says the program is hurting the very people it's supposed to help. ""It is so broken, it is so unfair that it violates our basic United States Constitution requirement of due process,"" she says.

Another problem with borrowers getting rejected after many years of thinking they were on track is that many make life decisions based on the expectation of loan forgiveness.

Janelle Menzel is a high school math teacher in Brainerd, Minn. She says people would ask her: ""You have a degree in math, why are you teaching?"" She says they would tell her she could make ""so much more money in the private sector.""

Menzel says she loves teaching. And she thought she was going to get her student loans forgiven, so financially she decided it made sense. ""Oh yeah, definitely. That was a factor in it,"" she says.

But Menzel says that after 10 years of making payments, she was told by her loan servicer that she was in the wrong type of payment plan and couldn't qualify.

If a call center worker had told her that 10 years before, she easily could have switched into the right kind of loan. But she says nobody ever told her. And so that never happened.

She remembers after contacting her loan servicer repeatedly, trying to find a way to appeal, a call center worker told her, ""Look, you just need to give up.""

""And I remember sitting at the table watching my kids running around and playing and just thinking, man, I am stuck with this now,"" Menzel says. Thoughts of ""the freedom that would come with being released of the student loan debt kind of came crashing in in that moment,"" she adds.

Congress passed a partial fix, called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, that was designed to help at least some borrowers. But the teachers union lawsuit alleges the Department of Education ""has mismanaged [that program] as well."" As of March 2019, only 3.6% of applications for that new program have been approved.

The Department of Education says it can't comment on ongoing litigation. But the department's press secretary, Liz Hill, said in a statement to NPR on Thursday, ""the Department has improved internal processes and enhanced communications and outreach to borrowers."" As an example, Hill pointed to an automated PSLF Help Tool that assists borrowers in determining whether they are in the right types of loans and payment plans, and which forms to submit.

She also pointed to a department blog post about avoiding common mistakes.

The teachers union is asking the court to order a new appeals process through which the department could use its power to forgive or ""discharge"" loans for borrowers who were treated unfairly.

But in its statement, the department says it ""expects few people to be immediately eligible for a loan discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program due, in large part, to complexities of the program Congress created more than a decade ago.""

For those borrowers interested in the program, the Education Department says submitting an Employment Certification Form annually is key to making sure that borrowers are on track to qualify for forgiveness.

Navient, one of the nation's largest loan servicer companies, is not commenting on the lawsuit. But the company said in a statement to NPR, ""We understand the frustration borrowers face in navigating a complex federal loan program, which is why we consistently advocate for policy reforms to simplify the system.""

The Department of Education recently implemented a dramatic fix to a different program, TEACH Grants, that's now returning grant money to thousands of people who had grants taken away unfairly.

The bill, H.R. 299, enables homebuyers using a VA loan to borrow above the 2019 limit of $484,350 for most counties, without any down payment.

A VA spokesperson told HousingWire that the loan limit will be lifted for loans that are guaranteed or appraised on or after January 1, 2020, and that guidance for lenders would be coming ahead of this date, published on the VA home loan circular page of its website.

The VA also clarified other changes that will go into effect as a result of the bill.

In addition to alleviating limits for veterans looking to purchase a home, H.R. 299 temporarily increase rates for certain loans by 0.15-0.30%, the VA said.

The slight bump in loan fees is intended to help finance health care costs for veterans who are suffering the effects of Agent Orange exposure as a result of their service.

Additional changes to the VA’s loan guaranty program include the elimination of funding fee differences for borrowers who are veterans versus those who are members of the Reserve.

It also removes the loan limit for the Native American Direct Loan Program, exempts Purple Heart recipients from paying loan fees, and authorizes VA-designated appraisers to rely on third parties for appraisal-related information.

The bill’s passage comes after years of lobbying on behalf of numerous trade groups, including the National Association of Realtors, which teamed with other housing industry trade groups to ensure veterans’ health care benefits would be extended without a significant increase to VA loan fees.

Now that the bill has passed, it is expected to “fast-track” disability compensation for as many as 90,000 affected former service members, according to military.com.

The VA said it does not have any formal projections as to how the changes brought on by the bill will its home loan guaranty program."

""Administrator Wheeler, I'd like to ask you to please support a fair contract for EPA workers,"" Loreen Targos, an EPA scientist in the Great Lakes area, is seen saying in a video provided by the union. ""Please reward my award-winning labor by negotiating a fair contract.""

Targos was receiving a Silver Medal award on stage at EPA headquarters when she unveiled a banner reading ""Care about EPA workers having a fair contract to address public health & climate change, Do you?"" She also criticized the agency's recent unilateral change to the master bargaining agreement with the American Federation of Government Employees, one of several unions representing EPA employees.

Targos said a fair contract is needed to continue research into ""fighting climate change.""

This comes on the back of several instances where government workers have spoken out against the administration's policies, including when employees of the Department of Agriculture turned their backs to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue at a meeting last month in protest of the announced office relocation to Kansas City.

""Kids are not prisoners of war. They do not belong on military bases,"" argued Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-TX) in vain on Friday, as the House defeated her plan to prevent military base from being used as immigrant detention facilities.

The House also rejected a similar amendment from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and defeated another plan from the New York Democrat which would have restricted the use of soldiers along the southern border, if their assignment is to help enforce immigration law.

""There is no need for this,"" argued Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL), who labeled the Ocasio-Cortez plan a ""wrongheaded amendment,"" as more than 50 Democrats joined Republicans in voting against the measure.

""Our recent unannounced inspections revealed a situation far more grievous than those previously encountered by our inspectors,"" said Jennifer Costello, the acting IG at DHS.

Costello described one facility in Texas - which had a maximum capacity of 125 people in detention - was actually holding 750 immigrants. And by the next morning, that had swelled to 900.

""These issues pose a serious and imminent threat to both DHS personnel and detainees, and require the Department's immediate attention and action,"" Costello said in testimony before the House Oversight Committee, echoing her report from early July which included photos of detainees crammed together in makeshift holding cells.

The agency tapped Dr. Gil Alterovitz, a Harvard Medical School professor and member of the Computational Health Informatics Program at Boston Children’s Hospital, to spearhead its efforts to improve veteran care through AI-enabled solutions. Alterovitz will be based within the agency’s research and development office, according to a blog post on the VA website.

Beyond his professional medical experience, Alterovitz comes to the job with a number of government bona fides under his belt. He served as a presidential innovation fellow in 2017 and recently helped the White House update its national AI research and development strategy. According to his LinkedIn profile, he also sat on the Obama administration’s Precision Medicine Task Force.

In his new role, much of Alterovitz’s work will center on deriving more insights from the troves of data the agency holds on the more than 9 million veterans in its care, according to the department. Because AI can analyze so much information at once, medical professionals see enormous potential for the tech to spur new medical breakthroughs, improve diagnoses and personalize patient treatment.

“That is what you need to do optimal AI—a lot of deep knowledge,” Alterovitz said in the post. “AI is key to really taking advantage of that data to help vets and potentially others, as well.”

According to the post, he’s already leading an effort to connect the department with AI experts in academia and industry, which could ultimately lead to more research collaboration and information sharing. Alterovitz is also taking stock of the various AI projects already underway in different parts of the department, the department wrote.

“Given how health care is evolving, AI is really the only way to move forward in terms of reducing costs and providing better care,” Alterovitz said."

But, in a highly unusual move, the White House refused to approve Dr. Schoonover’s written testimony for entry into the permanent Congressional record.

The reasoning, according to a June 4 email reviewed by The New York Times, was that the science cited in Dr. Schoonover’s testimony did not correspond with White House views. Ultimately, Dr. Schoonover did deliver the oral testimony before the committee, but his accompanying written statement was not included in the official record of the hearing.

Steele was interviewed as part of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's probe of how the FBI used the unverified dossier, including its role in obtaining a surveillance warrant against then-Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

California Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee’s amendment specified that “any new authorization for the use of military force to replace the 2001 [Authorization for Use of Military Force] should include a sunset clause” that clearly defines its objective.

Lawmakers have long agreed that a new AUMF is necessary and that the 2001 and 2002 versions now in place are hopelessly outdated. However, there is far less of a consensus on what should replace it and how much latitude to give the president.

The House adopted the amendment by a 242-128 margin. It declares that the 2001 AUMF “has been utilized well beyond the scope that Congress intended, that it has served a blank check for any president to wage war at any time and any place.”

The amendment was written as tensions between the U.S. and Iran reached a boiling point and lawmakers feared President Trump could use military force against Tehran without Congress’ approval. Citing his existing authority, Mr. Trump said he ordered a planned retaliatory airstrike on Iran in the wake of the downing of an unmanned American military drone before calling it off at the last moment last month.

The Republican-controlled Senate’s version of the underlying bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, does not contain a similar provision on the AUMF, and the White House is expected to oppose the Lee amendment as well.

"Justice Dept.

Mueller III’s deputies from testifying before Congress, potentially jeopardizing an agreement for two of the former prosecutors to answer lawmakers’ questions in private next week, according to two government officials familiar with the matter.

The department told the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees last week that it was opposed to the testimony and had communicated its view to the two former members of Mr. Mueller’s team, Aaron Zebley and James L. Quarles III, according to a senior congressional official familiar with the discussions. A Justice Department official confirmed that account and said that the department had instructed both men not to appear.

It is unclear what effect the Justice Department’s intervention will have on the men’s eventual appearances, but it raises the prospect that a deal lawmakers thought they had struck last month for testimony from Mr. Mueller, the former special counsel, and the two prosecutors could still unravel.

Both Mr. Zebley and Mr. Quarles have left the Justice Department and are now private citizens, meaning that the department most likely cannot actually block their testimony. But the department’s view — depending on how strongly it is expressed — could have a chilling effect on two longtime employees and give them cover to avoid testifying."

U.S. District Judge George J. Hazel in Maryland wrote in a six-page order that he shared the concerns of a federal judge in New York who similarly blocked the Justice Department maneuver this week, but noted that in his district, unlike the other judge’s, attorneys do not have to provide “satisfactory reasons for withdrawal.” He wrote he was concerned that “a shift in counsel at this late stage may be disruptive to an already complicated and expedited case.”

But Hazel also wrote that he was “inclined to ultimately permit the withdrawal” — if the Justice Department would, among other things, provide assurances that the new team was “aware of and prepared to address potential conflicts between recent developments in this case and positions repeatedly taken before this Court by the withdrawing attorneys.”

[Federal judge rejects Trump administration’s bid to swap out lawyers for census case on citizenship question]

The decision marks yet another headache for the Justice Department in what has become a fraught case. Earlier this week, the department sought to replace the team of lawyers assigned to it, after at least some career attorneys on the case grew frustrated with the Trump administration’s sudden shift in position on whether it could keep fighting.

That fight, which once seemed at its end, intensified Wednesday when a group of conservative lawmakers wrote a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr urging him to support President Trump adding the question to the census by executive order.

The letter controversially states that assessing the citizenship question is “germane to carrying out our duty to apportion representatives.”

The Trump administration has denied that adding the question is meant to boost its political fortunes through redistricting, but many Democrats charge that the question is meant to scare away Latinos from participating in the census, resulting in an undercount of that population.

The department filed motions this week to remove the lawyers in cases that are ongoing in multiple federal courts.

U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York was the first judge to block the move, though he said the Justice Department could refile its request and provide more specific reasons for the change.

Hazel wrote that, because the Justice Department already had entered new lawyers into the case, his denying their request to replace the team would “not prevent the attorneys who have been representing the Defendants’ interests thus far from simply receding into the background as new counsel take the lead.”

He wrote he was “less focused on the formality of whose names appear at the bottom of future pleadings and more focused on the need for a transition of counsel that does not disrupt the orderly administration of justice.”

Hazel added that “while the Court is inclined to ultimately permit the withdrawal, under the unique circumstances of this request, more specific assurances will first need to be provided.”

The department, he wrote, would “need to provide specific assurances to the Court that one or more of the withdrawing attorneys are remaining available to the new DOJ team, as necessary, or provide detailed reasoning for why such an arrangement is untenable.” He questioned whether the new team could proceed without any help from the previous lawyers.

“As a practical matter, the Court cannot fathom how it would be possible, at this juncture, for a wholesale change in Defendants’ representation not to have some impact on the orderly resolution of these proceedings unless Defendants provide assurance of an orderly transition between the withdrawing attorneys and new counsel,” Hazel wrote. “This requires more than just the effort of the new DOJ team, but the involvement and availability of the withdrawing attorneys.”

Hazel also noted that the new lawyers should be prepared to address questions about the previous lawyers’ possibly misleading assertions to the court. Just last week, those lawyers believed the matter was over, because of an imminent deadline to start printing census forms and a Supreme Court decision that prevented the administration from adding a citizenship question. But Trump ordered the department to keep looking for ways to continue the fight, raising questions about what it had earlier told the court about the deadline.

“Defendants must realize that a change in counsel does not create a clean slate for a party to proceed as if prior representations made to the Court were not in fact made,” Hazel wrote. “A new DOJ team will need to be prepared to address these, and other, previous representations made by the withdrawing attorneys at the appropriate juncture.”

A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.

Obama's DHS secretary on upcoming ICE raids: 'We simply have to enforce the law',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/obamas-dhs-secretary-on-upcoming-ice-raids-we-simply-have-to-enforce-the-law,"Jeh Johnson, who served as secretary of homeland security under President Barack Obama, said there is nothing unusual with the upcoming raids from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that are targeting illegal immigrants who have orders for deportation.

""Deportations occur all the time. Of those who have been ordered deported by an immigration judge, hopefully after they have exhausted their appeal rights and had an opportunity to have their asylum case heard, we simply have to enforce the law, particularly if someone has been ordered deported,"" Johnson said on Morning Joe Friday.

""In other words, they’ve exhausted all their appeal rights. And so, it's important for migrants to know they have rights. But enforcement actions themselves are not extraordinary,"" he added.

Johnson has been a unique voice in speaking out against Democrats' recent rhetoric on immigration. When Democrats started to criticize the Trump administration for keeping migrants in ""cages,"" Johnson said that practice did not begin when Trump became president.

“Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented on Jan. 20, 2017, OK?"" he said.

He also called out the 2020 Democrats' proposal to decriminalize border crossing because that ""is tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders."""
Trump dossier author Steele gets 16-hour DOJ grilling,https://www.politico.com,['Natasha Bertrand'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/09/christopher-steele-trump-dossier-doj-1403318,"During the 2016 election, Christopher Steele was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS to research President Donald Trump’s Russia ties. | Victoria Jones/AP Photo Foreign Policy Trump dossier author Steele gets 16-hour DOJ grilling The interview was contentious at first, according to two people familiar with the matter, but investigators ultimately found his testimony credible and even surprising.

Christopher Steele, the former British spy behind the infamous “dossier” on President Donald Trump’s ties to Russia, was interviewed for 16 hours in June by the Justice Department’s internal watchdog, according to two people familiar with the matter.

The interview is part of an ongoing investigation that the Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has been conducting for the past year. Specifically, Horowitz has been examining the FBI’s efforts to surveil a one-time Trump campaign adviser based in part on information from Steele, an ex-British MI6 agent who had worked with the bureau as a confidential source since 2010.

Story Continued Below

Horowitz’s team has been intensely focused on gauging Steele’s credibility as a source for the bureau. But Steele was initially reluctant to speak with the American investigators because of the potential impropriety of his involvement in an internal DOJ probe as a foreign national and retired British intelligence agent.

Steele’s allies have also repeatedly noted that the dossier was not the original basis for the FBI’s probe into Trump and Russia.

The extensive, two-day interview took place in London while Trump was in Britain for a state visit, the sources said, and delved into Steele’s extensive work on Russian interference efforts globally, his intelligence-collection methods and his findings about Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, who the FBI ultimately surveilled. The FBI’s decision to seek a surveillance warrant against Page — a warrant they applied for and obtained after Page had already left the campaign — is the chief focus of the probe by Horowitz.

The interview was contentious at first, the sources added, but investigators ultimately found Steele’s testimony credible and even surprising. The takeaway has irked some U.S. officials interviewed as part of the probe — they argue that it shouldn’t have taken a foreign national to convince the inspector general that the FBI acted properly in 2016. Steele’s American lawyer was present for the conversation.

The interview was first reported by Reuters.

During the 2016 election, Steele was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS to research Trump’s Russia ties. His work was funded in part by a law firm that represented the Democratic National Committee.

Since then, Steele has become a villain to Trump allies who claim that anti-Trump DOJ officials conspired to undo the results of the 2016 election. Conservatives have also seized on Mueller’s conclusion that no criminal conspiracy existed between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin as evidence that Steele’s sensational dossier was a fraud.

But the extensive interview with Steele, and the investigators’ sense that he offered new and important information, may dampen expectations among the president’s allies who’ve claimed that Steele’s sensational dossier was used improperly by the bureau to “spy” on the campaign.

Page had been on the FBI’s radar since 2013, when he interacted with undercover Russian intelligence agents in New York City. A trip to Moscow in the summer of 2016 further aroused the bureau’s suspicions, according to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant the FBI got approved in October 2016, allowing the bureau to intercept his electronic communications.

Steele’s defenders have noted that the information he provided which made it into the FISA warrant application to monitor Page was not far off. According to Steele’s sources, Page met with high-level Russian officials while in Moscow in July 2016, including the CEO of Russia’s state-owned oil giant Rosneft.

Page denied the claim publicly until pressed under oath by lawmakers in 2017, when he acknowledged meeting “senior members of the presidential administration” during his trip, as well as the head of investor relations at Rosneft. Page had originally claimed only that he went to Moscow to give the commencement address at the New Economic School."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Shuran Huang/NPR Shuran Huang/NPR

Thursday marks one year since a divided Senate confirmed Brian Benczkowski to lead the Justice Department's criminal division.

The 51-48 vote reflected Democrats' worry that he'd try to interfere with the investigation into Russia's attack on the 2016 election.

Things didn't work out that way.

Benczkowski promised to consult with career officials about any possible conflicts with the special counsel probe, but he said this week that never became necessary.

""I've kept the promises that I made,"" Benczkowski said. ""I didn't have anything to do with the Mueller investigation. Nothing came across my desk. There was nothing that I had to deal with.""

Instead, Benczkowski has spent the past year advancing the administration's priorities: punishing transnational gangs; cracking down on corrupt doctors and pharmacists who fuel the opioid crisis in Appalachia and beyond; and making the process of investigating companies and business executives more transparent.

United States v. Guzman

It started with what Benczkowski said could be the biggest criminal trial in U.S. history: the effort to bring to justice former Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.

That trial extended nearly three months and coincided with a federal government shutdown, bringing uncertainty to DOJ lawyers about whether their hotel bills would ever be paid.

In the end, prosecutors from the criminal division at Justice worked with their counterparts in U.S. attorney's offices in Brooklyn and Miami to secure conviction of Guzman on all 10 of the drug and conspiracy charges.

Authorities recently asked for forfeiture in the amount of $12,666,181,704. Guzman faces mandatory life imprisonment when he is sentenced in New York City on July 17.

Benczkowski said he plans to be in court to support the team.

DOJ's opioid strike force

Benczkowski expressed concern early in his tenure that DOJ wasn't targeting the region that was hardest hit by the opioid crisis. So the criminal division put together a strike force that spans 10 areas in Appalachia.

He secured approval and funding to send 14 health care fraud prosecutors into the region, culminating in dozens of indictments of doctors, pharmacists and other medical professionals last April.

That team continues to crunch data from health care providers and insurance programs to help uncover fraud. Benczkowski said he anticipates another round of prosecutions in Appalachia before the end of the year.

""We're going to keep going at it until we drive down the addiction rate and we drive down the overdose rate in those districts,"" he said.

The white-collar cases

Benczkowski said his third priority is bringing more ""transparency"" to white-collar crime investigations.

So the Justice Department issued new guidelines for prosecutors about recommending independent monitors to oversee errant corporations. Benczkowski also revamped the way that prosecutors assess whether a company is complying with the Justice Department.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Shuran Huang/NPR Shuran Huang/NPR

Now, DOJ publishes online the times it declines to bring charges against companies that have behaved appropriately and deserved credit for that.

That sends a message, he said, and it makes his own prosecutors work ""a little bit harder."" Lawyers defending companies can point to those decisions and fashion arguments for their own leniency.

""Certainly it's going to give outside lawyers a little bit more ammunition to advocate with,"" he said, arguing that transparency will make government decisions more just.

Benczkowski's comment may prove controversial with consumer protection and shareholder advocates, as well as critics who argue the Justice Department has abandoned its responsibility to police corporate misconduct.

But the Justice Department said it has charged 211 people with fraud so far this year, about half of whom have pleaded guilty, an increase from last year in the same period. Benczkowski also said financial recoveries from corporate resolutions this year will be ""well north"" of $2 billion, about double the amount in 2018.

Benczkowski said he expects to pick a new chief of the DOJ fraud section, which prosecutes such offenses, by the end of the month.

Robert Zink has been filling the job in an acting role since January and may be in line to get the job on a permanent basis, two sources told NPR.

The ransomware menace

Prosecutors are also in the middle of responding to a wave of ransomware attacks that have victimized small and midsize cities in Florida, Georgia, Maryland and elsewhere.

Benczkowski said criminal groups are becoming sophisticated in how they identify their targets: municipalities big enough to afford to pay ransom, but not so sophisticated they're prepared for these kinds of threats.

Benczkowski said he has a message for those cities:

""Invest in the basic cybersecurity protections for your systems that you need, have redundant offline systems that you can turn to in the event that you're attacked, come to law enforcement early in the process ... so that we can help you get better prepared."""

An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old wealthy hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

""In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein’s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,"" the statement said. ""Staff, supporters of the foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein’s New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He’s not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and he has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.”

Separately, claims in court showed that President Trump may have flown on the jet at least once, as well.

CUSHY PLEA BARGAIN WITH EPSTEIN WAS SO BAD IT BROKE THE LAW, JUDGE RULES

Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Barr said he has recused himself from the matter ""because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time.""

On Saturday evening, Christine Pelosi, a Democratic National Committee official and daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, warned conspicuously that it is ""quite likely that some of our faves are implicated"" in the ""horrific"" sex-trafficking case.

""This Epstein case is horrific and the young women deserve justice,"" Pelosi tweeted. ""It is quite likely that some of our faves are implicated but we must follow the facts and let the chips fall where they may - whether on Republicans or Democrats.""

For his part, Trump previously called attention to Clinton's dealings with the financier.

""Nice guy -- uh, got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island, with Jeffrey Epstein,"" Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in 2015, referring to Clinton's connections with Epstein. ""A lot of problems.""

Meanwhile, Trump biographer Tim O'Brien this weekend reposted an excerpt fom a 2002 profile of Epstein in New York Magazine, in which Trump told a reporter, ""I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""

Trump banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago estate “because Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,” according to court documents filed by Bradley Edwards, the lawyer who has represented several Epstein accusers. That claim has not been confirmed by Trump or Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein appeared Monday in a hearing that lasted about 30 minutes wearing a blue prison top with a brown T-shirt underneath, in addition to orange slip-on sneakers. Prosecutors said in the 36 hours since Epstein's arrest, multiple attorneys and several individuals have come forward and said they were victims, none of whom had previously been spoken to.

FORMER FBI OFFICIAL: INDICTMENT OF JEFFREY EPSTEIN IS 'PLACEHOLDER,' EXPECT DOZENS MORE CHARGES IN NEAR FUTURE

Epstein allegedly created and maintained a ""vast network"" and operation from 2002 ""up to and including"" at least 2005 that enabled him to ""sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls"" in addition to paying victims to recruit other underage girls.

""This allowed Epstein to create an ever-expanding web of new victims,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a news conference.

Berman added that nude photographs ""of what appeared to be underage girls"" were discovered at Epstein's Manhattan mansion during a search following his arrest Saturday. The hundreds of photos were discovered in a locked safe, according to officials.

Prosecutors also allege Epstein ""worked and conspired with others, including employees and associates"" who helped facilitate his conduct by contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 66-year-old at his mansion in New York City and Palm, Beach, Fla.

At Epstein's multi-story mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, prosecutors said that victims would be escorted to a room with a massage table where they would perform a massage on him.

""The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, were told by Epstein or other individuals to partially or fully undress before beginning the 'massage,'"" prosecutors wrote. ""During the encounter, Epstein would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's genitals.""

In Monday's court appearance, prosecutors said that the massage room in New York was set up exactly as how the alleged victims described it 15 years ago.

CHRISTINE PELOSI WARNS IT'S 'QUITE LIKELY THAT SOME OF OUR FAVES ARE IMPLICATED' IN 'HORRIFIC' EPSTEIN CASE

Victims would be paid hundreds of dollars in cash by either Epstein or one of his associates or employees, according to prosecutors. The 66-year-old also allegedly ""incentivized his victims"" to become recruiters by paying the victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each girl brought to him.

""In so doing, Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit,"" federal prosecutors said.

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said that Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey at 5 p.m. on Saturday ""without incident."" Epstein is now being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail near the Manhattan courthouse where he appeared Monday afternoon.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Luis M. Alvarez/AP Luis M. Alvarez/AP

A former State Department employee was sentenced to 40 months in prison for concealing her interactions with two Chinese intelligence agents, along with the extravagant gifts they gave her in exchange for government information.

Candace Claiborne began to work as an office management specialist at the State Department in 1999, according to court documents. She had a top secret security clearance and served overseas in such cities as Baghdad, Beijing and Shanghai.

But she ignored her responsibility to report foreign contacts, prosecutors said as they announced her sentence on Tuesday.

""Claiborne was entrusted with privileged information as a U.S. government employee, and she abused that trust at the expense of our nation's security,"" Acting Assistant Director John Selleck of the FBI's Washington Field Office said in a statement. ""The targeting of U.S. security clearance holders by Chinese intelligence services is a constant threat we face,"" he added.

Over the course of five years, Chinese agents allegedly gave Claiborne and her family ""tens of thousands of dollars"" in gifts and perks – including wired cash, a monthly stipend, overseas trips, tuition at a Chinese fashion school and an apartment that was fully furnished. In exchange for the gifts, Claiborne gave them a window into the State Department's inner workings through copies of internal documents about dignitary visits and other topics.

Prosecutors said she told a co-conspirator that the agents were ""spies"" and wrote in her journal that she could ""Generate 20k in 1 year"" by working with one of the agents.

Federal public defender David Walker Bos, Claiborne's attorney, did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.

Her arrest came in March 2017 after a sting operation in January of that year. An FBI agent, posing as a Chinese agent, approached Claiborne on a street in Washington, D.C. She welcomed him to her home and their lengthy discussion ended with the undercover agent thanking her for helping the ""Ministry,"" NPR previously reported.

After the arrest, she pleaded not guilty to charges of obstruction and making false statements to the FBI. In April 2019, she pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States. In the plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to drop the other charges.

A judge ordered Claiborne detained pending sentencing, but she requested to self-surrender on June 5, the document stated.

In addition to a 40-month prison sentence, Claiborne received three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000.

Her sentence comes after former CIA officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee pleaded guilty this spring to spying for China – and as U.S. officials have warned that Chinese espionage is the country's most serious security threat."
Judge Rejects Justice Dept. Request to Change Lawyers on Census Case,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Michael Wines', 'Katie Benner']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/census-citizenship-question.html,"On its face, Judge Furman’s order only enforces a court rule governing changes of legal counsel. Practically, however, it presents the department with a difficult choice: Either reverse course and leave its old legal team in place, or produce sworn explanations that could prove both embarrassing and damaging to the administration’s case.

The department’s legal campaign had already undergone head-snapping changes in strategy this month. Department lawyers first said they were abandoning the case in the face of a Supreme Court ruling blocking the question, only to reverse course the next day, after President Trump called their statement “fake” and said the case would continue. They then told a federal judge that the administration was exploring a “legally available path” to restoring the question.

But that handed opponents of the citizenship question a legal opening: In a motion in Judge Furman’s court last week, they argued that the government had repeatedly said the lawsuit had to be resolved by June 30, when the printing of the 2020 census forms had to begin. The department’s announcement that it would continue to press for the question in July belied that explanation, opposition lawyers said.

They also suggested that the administration had set a false deadline for resolving the case to keep opponents from uncovering evidence that the citizenship question had been driven by a desire to help the Republican Party gain power when census figures are used to draw new political boundaries in 2021. The challengers said they would pursue sanctions against the defense for its conduct.

The Justice Department announced the switch in legal teams two days later on Sunday. While the department has not explained the change, multiple people familiar with the case have said that the lawyers resigned from the lawsuit out of ethical concerns and a belief that the suit was unwinnable.

Those people have said that many of the lawyers did not see a path forward on the case, given that any argument they made could appear to contradict statements to district judges and to the Supreme Court that the administration had to have a decision by June 30. Just as important, they faced a conflict of interest in trying to represent a client — the President of the United States — who had just publicly branded them liars."

Loreen Targos, an EPA employee in Chicago, unfurled a banner on stage next to Wheeler reading, “I care about EPA workers having a fair contract to address public health and climate change. Do you?”

Targos was on stage with the rest of a team being honored for cleaning up refinery waste near Muskegon Lake in Michigan.

In

a video

released by American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 704, based in the Great Lakes region, Targos can be heard asking Wheeler if he supports a fair contract for EPA workers.

EPA employees have been outraged by a recent contract that went into effect Tuesday that remains unsigned by union leaders and scales back union protections.

In an interview with The Hill, Targos said Wheeler did briefly respond to her.

“I did look at him and ask him and ask if he was going to support a fair contract and he said something along the lines of agency talking points of ‘We tried to come to the bargaining table but you guys refused.’”

The fight between the EPA and the union began over how much of the contract was even negotiable. The EPA wanted to renegotiate the entire contract, while the union wanted to renegotiate a narrower slice.

Under the latest contract, union employees would have to give up office space within the EPA offices and union leaders would not be able to use the intranet or agency billboards to communicate with members. It would also limit the amount of time union leaders could spend helping rank-and-file employees with labor disputes and other issues by 75 percent. It also changes how employees can arbitrate their grievances.

Targos said the new contract was “unilaterally imposed.” The AFGE has already filed an unfair labor practice charge against the EPA.

“There was all this pomp and circumstance to highlight the good work of EPA employees,” Targos said. “Why take away the conditions that supported such award-winning work?”

The EPA said it issued the new contract after years of fruitless negotiations.

“Administrator Wheeler was proud to host the National Honor Awards ceremony for the first time in 10 years and recognize the outstanding achievements of more than 700 EPA staff,” a spokesman told The Hill. “This collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired 12 years ago, the Trump EPA has worked with AFGE for the past two-and-half years to reach a new CBA and EPA is not the party refusing to come to the negotiating table.”

Targos said a security officer stopped her later and asked if she was actually an EPA employee.

“When I said yes he asked if I was really here to receive an award for that team and if I had just snuck on stage, so I said, ‘Yes I was in that group and supposed to get an award with that team,’” she said.

Targos said she was hoping to get more of a response from Wheeler.

“There’s always a part of you that hopes they will be better than what they say about them in the media, and it’s a sad thing to always be disappointed and realize, 'Oh you’re as bad as they say you are.'”"

In a letter to lawmakers on Capitol Hill made public Thursday, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of the department’s share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July Fourth “Salute to America” at the Lincoln Memorial at $2.45 million.

Bernhardt called the use of public funds justified, and cited past administrations’ spending for concerts, parades and other celebrations in and around the National Mall.

Interior’s costs included crowd accommodations, such as temporary fencing and portable toilets.

The disclosure confirms what The Washington Post had previously reported: that close to $2.5 million was diverted from the National Park Service, which normally uses the money from entrance and recreation fees to make improvements to U.S. parks.

Arizona Democrat Raul Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the public funds were used to “celebrate President Trump.”

There are further concerns from local leaders as well.

In a Tuesday letter to Trump, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the president’s Fourth of July event on the National Mall, as well as protests by others, have left the city’s security fund bankrupt, and that it will be running at a deficit of more than $6 million by the end of September.

She attributed the Emergency Planning and Security Fund (EPSF) numbers to estimates by the District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency and said the total cost for the District is estimated at $1.7 million.

The EPSF covers public safety at events, anti-terror efforts and support for the Secret Service.

Security for the annual “A Capitol Fourth” concert, which was held the same day on the National Mall, was provided by the federal Capitol Police and U.S. Park Police, not D.C. police.

Bowser also said D.C. still hasn’t been reimbursed the $7.3 million extra it spent for Trump’s 2017 inauguration.

“These overages can be attributed to declining reserves, increased demand for heightened security, and a one-time draw down of $7.3 million to cover security costs associated with the 2017 presidential inauguration,” Bowser wrote.

The White House debates that figure.

Reached for comment about Bowser’s letter, the White House said: “We have received the letter and will respond in a timely manner.”

Senators are also seeking to probe the cost of the event, which included military flyovers and tanks on the National Mall.

WTOP has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request with the National Park Service, via the Interior Department, to see a cost breakdown for the event.

A Defense Department spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the Pentagon spent $1.2 million on the “Salute to America” celebration, which does not factor in the cost of flyovers, since the flyovers are being listed as training flights to “facilitate flying hours, which are imperative to military readiness.”

That puts known cost estimates for “Salute to America” at $5.35 million.

Judge denies DOJ request to change lawyers in census citizenship question case,https://www.foxnews.com,['Louis Casiano'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-judge-denies-doj-request-to-change-lawyers-in-census-citizenship-question-case,"A New York federal judge barred the Justice Department on Tuesday from changing its lawyers in a legal fight over the Trump administration's effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

U.S. District Court Judge Jesse Furman, an Obama appointee, said government lawyers' motion for the change was ""patently deficient"" except in the case of two lawyers who have already left the department or the civil division which is handling the case.

""Defendants provide no reasons, let alone 'satisfactory reasons,' for the substitution of counsel,"" Furman wrote.

TOP DEMOCRAT ON HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS PANELS WILL FIGHT TO OPPOSE TRUMP CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON CENSUS

The Justice Department sought to switch out its legal team Monday after some of its attorneys seemed to be giving up on the legal fight. Attorney General Bill Barr told the Associated Press that he had learned from a top DOJ civil attorney leading the litigation effort that multiple people on the team preferred not to continue.

Trump reacted to the ruling hours after it was issued.

""So now the Obama appointed judge on the Census case (Are you a Citizen of the United States?) won’t let the Justice Department use the lawyers that it wants to use. Could this be a first?"" he tweeted.

The American Civil Liberties Union praised Furman's ruling in a Tuesday statement.

TRUMP SLAMS 'FAKE' REPORTS THAT CITIZENSHIP QUESTION FIGHT IS OVER

“The Justice Department owes the public and the courts an explanation for its unprecedented substitution of the entire legal team that has been working on this case,"" said Dale Ho, ACLU voting rights project director. ""The Trump administration is acting like it has something to hide, and we won’t rest until we know the truth.”

Trump has vowed to continue his effort to include the question, even after the U.S. Supreme Court last month temporarily blocked him from introducing it. The president has indicated he would use his executive order power to add the question to the census.

Furman also questioned how the Justice Department would meet deadlines in the case if a batch of new attorneys came on board, noting that government lawyers have three days to submit written arguments in the case.

""As this court observed many months ago, this case has been litigated on the premise — based 'in no small part' on Defendants’ own 'insist[ence]' — that the speedy resolution of Plaintiffs’ claims is a matter of great private and public importance,"" he wrote. ""If anything, that urgency — and the need for efficient judicial proceedings — has only grown since that time.""

The judge ordered that any DOJ lawyer who wished to withdraw from the case submit a signed sworn affidavit with a sufficient reason.

On Tuesday, the president blasted the Supreme Court on Twitter over the citizenship question decision and its 2012 ruling that held the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- which he has tried to repeal -- in place.

""I have long heard that the appointment of Supreme Court Justices is a President's most important decision. SO TRUE!"" he posted.

Justice Department probing Deutsche Bank’s dealings with Malaysia’s 1MDB,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/11/justice-department-probing-deutsche-banks-dealings-with-malaysias-1mdb/,"The US Justice Department is investigating whether Deutsche Bank violated foreign corruption or anti-money-laundering laws in its work for state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday.

The news comes after the bank announced plans to scrap its global equities unit, cut some fixed-income operations and slash 18,000 jobs globally in an $8.34 billion restructuring program.

Deutsche Bank’s work for 1MDB included helping to raise $1.2 billion in 2014 as concerns about the fund’s management and financials had begun to circulate, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.

Prosecutors are mainly looking into the role of Tan Boon-Kee, a colleague of a former Goldman Sachs executive, Tim Leissner, who worked with him on 1MDB-related business, the paper said.

She left Goldman to become Asia-Pacific head of banking for financial institutions clients at Deutsche Bank, where she was involved with further 1MDB dealings, it added.

In an emailed statement, Deutsche Bank said it had fully cooperated with all regulatory and law enforcement agencies that made inquiries about the fund.

“As stated in asset forfeiture complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, 1MDB made ‘material misrepresentations and omissions to Deutsche Bank officials’ in connection with 1MDB’s transactions with the bank,” the bank told Reuters.

“This is consistent with the bank’s own findings in this matter,” it added.

A DoJ civil asset forfeiture complaint repeatedly describes Deutsche Bank as being misled by 1MDB officers, the WSJ said.

Tan left Deutsche Bank last year, after it discovered communications between her and Jho Low, the Malaysian financier whom the Justice Department has described as the central player in the 1MDB scandal, it added.

A representative of insurance company FWD Group, Tan’s current employer, said the company and Tan declined to comment.

The DoJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters."
Trump Admin’s ‘Pro-Women’ Human Rights Panel Stacked With Anti-Abortion Figures,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Emily Shugerman', 'Gender Reporter']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-loads-pro-women-commission-on-unalienable-rights-with-abortion-opponents,"A new Trump administration commission on human rights will be filled with anti-abortion advocates, including a former ambassador to the Holy See who declared that abortion is “related to the coarsening of the social fabric.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the creation of the Commission on Unalienable Rights last week in a Wall St. Journal op-ed, in which he claimed the discussion around human rights had become diluted. The new group, he wrote, would “ground our discussion of human rights in America’s founding principles.”

The announcement drew concern from human rights groups like Amnesty International, who worried the commission would seek to limit the scope of human rights domestically and abroad. And while the State Department claims the group will not discuss abortion, the conservative makeup of the commission has reproductive rights advocates on edge.

“Appointing these ideologues to a commission purporting to safeguard human rights will have the opposite effect and will endanger the health and well-being of countless women,” Michelle Kuppersmith, director of reproductive rights group Equity Forward, said in a statement.

“This is a clear extension of the Trump administration’s anti-women, anti-reproductive health campaign, and a blatant attempt to restrict the rights of vulnerable populations around the globe.”

The chair of the 12-person commission, Harvard Professor Mary Ann Glendon, is a former U.S. ambassador to the Holy See who led the Vatican’s delegation to the United Nations Conference on Women in 1995. At the time, she told The New York Times she “could not agree more” with Pope John Paul II, who was known for his traditional Catholic stances on abortion and contraception. She later went on to receive Notre Dame’s Evangelium Vitae Medal for “Heroes Of The Pro-Life Movement.”

‘The whole question about abortion is related to the coarsening of the social fabric,” Glendon told the Times in 1995. “It promotes a certain callousness which has frightening implications for the future.”

Also serving on the commission is F. Cartwright Weiland, a Texas-based attorney who studied under Glendon at Harvard Law. Weiland helped write Supreme Court amicus briefs supporting Texas’s restrictions on abortion providers and served on the Council For Life’s “Role of Rights” education panel.

Commission member Shaykh Hamza Yusuf Hanson, the president of Zaytuna College, published an article last year calling abortion “an assault on a sanctified life,” while fellow member Christopher Olaf Tollefsen co-authored the book Embryo: A Defense of Human Life, which argues against stem-cell research and promotes the idea that life begins at conception.

“There is nothing potential about the life of the fetus, the embryo, or the zygote: it is actually alive,” he wrote in a 2010 journal article. “Nor is there anything potential about the humanity of that life: it is an actual human life.”

Commission member Jacqueline Rivers, a sociology lecturer at Harvard, spoke on a 2017 Harvard Law Students For Life Panel Entitled “Why We Are ProLife: Dignity, Equality, Human Rights,” where she discussed how her pro-life views are rooted in her Christian faith. (The year before, she had delivered a letter to Hillary Clinton from more than 20 black church leaders asking her to address “justice for the unborn.”) In 2016, commission member Paolo Carozza spoke about a pro-life approach to international develeopment on the Notre Dame Right To Life Panel.

A senior administration official did not answer The Daily Beast’s questions about whether any members of the commission support abortion rights. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the commission would be advisory in nature and would not address “policy questions” like abortion rights. Instead, the official said, it would attempt to ground human rights in the founding principles of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”

“This is really a commission devoted to principles of inalienable rights,” the official said. “The commission has nothing to do with those kinds of domestic policy debates of the day; it will not discuss them.”

“ The commission is the most pro-women commission in the world, because it doesn't distinguish between men and women. ” — Senior administration official

“The commission is the most pro-women commission in the world, because it doesn't distinguish between men and women,” the official added.

The Trump administration has repeatedly tried to reduce its commitment to reproductive rights internationally, pushing to remove references to “sexual and reproductive health” from U.N. documents and threatening to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution on rape as a weapon of war because it mentioned reproductive health services. The State Department has also removed all data on reproductive rights from its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.

In a press release, the Center for Reproductive Rights called the new commission “part of a comprehensive effort by this Administration to erase sexual and reproductive health and rights from global discourse.”

“Contrary to its asserted purpose, there is no need to redefine or develop foundational principles on human rights,” they said. “There is a clear and unequivocal consensus by U.N. human rights treaty bodies and independent experts that reproductive rights are human rights, grounded in the right to life, health, equality, non-discrimination and freedom from cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, among other rights.”

Amanda Kasling, the Human Rights Watch Acting Co-Director for Women’s Rights, added that interpretations of international law define abortion is a human rights issue. Even a limited discussion of of “inalienable rights,” she said, would have include access to health care—including access to family planning and abortion—as well as prevention of maternal mortality.

“For women to actually be able to fully enjoy and have a fulfillment of their human rights, you have to ensure access to reproductive health care, full stop,” she said."
Mining company rejects EPA order for Superfund cleanup work,https://www.sltrib.com,['The Associated Press'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2019/07/11/mining-company-rejects/,"Durango • A mining company says it won’t carry out cleanup work ordered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as part of a Superfund project in southwest Colorado.

The Durango Herald reported Wednesday that Sunnyside Gold Corp. sent the EPA a letter saying the company isn’t responsible for pollution flowing from inactive mines in the area.

The EPA wants Sunnyside to help pay for some of the initial investigations into the Bonita Peak Superfund cleanup, citing the company's previous mining activity there.

The EPA says it will review Sunnyside's letter before deciding its next step.

ICE Raids Are Beginning This Sunday. Here's What We Know,https://time.com,['Jasmine Aguilera'],,,,https://time.com/5625372/president-trump-ice-raids/,"President Donald Trump on Friday confirmed that potentially 2,000 undocumented immigrants will be swept up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in raids beginning this Sunday.

“It starts on Sunday and [ICE is] gonna take people out and they’re going to bring them back to their countries or they’re gonna take criminals out, put them in prison, or put them in prison in the countries they came from,” Trump told reporters outside the White House before departing to an event in Wisconsin — he was joined by secretary of labor Alex Acosta, who earlier in the day announced his resignation. “We’re focused on criminals as much as we can… we’re taking them out by the thousands, we’re getting them out.”

On Thursday, The New York Times cited three anonymous Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials who discussed the plan to detain and deport families who have received a deportation notice, and “collateral” immigrants who happen to be near the raids at the time — potentially detaining children.

Matthew Bourke, an ICE spokesperson, said in a Thursday statement to TIME that the agency would not discuss details related to enforcement operations. “As always, ICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security….However, all of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and—if found removable by final order—removal from the United States.”

The recent threat of ICE raids began on June 17, when President Donald Trump shared on Twitter that ICE raids would begin in the week to come. Many became critical of the move, including Democrats and members within the ICE and DHS agencies, and on June 22, Trump announced a two-week delay on the raids to “see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the ICE raids “brutal” and said they would “tear families apart” at a Thursday press conference. “Families belong together, everyone has rights…We pray that the President thinks about this,” Pelosi said after reading aloud legal advice for undocumented immigrants.

The operation, known as “Family op” by ICE and DHS according to The Washington Post, planned to target immigrants who received a deportation notice—many of whom failed to show up to their immigration hearing.

Immigration attorneys are arguing that deporting undocumented immigrants who have not had the chance to appear before a judge to plead their case is unlawful, and four legal aid and advocacy organizations including the ACLU have filed a joint lawsuit against the Trump Administration. The lawsuit argues that many immigrants did not show up to their hearings because of bureaucratic errors and misdirection by immigration enforcement agencies. “The agencies’ flagrant and widespread errors made it impossible for people to know when their hearings were being held,” the ACLU wrote in a public statement on Thursday.

Protests against the planned raids have started in San Fransisco and Philadelphia, and more are being planned in New York City, Chicago and El Paso, Texas, so far.

Here is what we know so far about the planned ICE raids.

What exactly is expected to happen?

Major cities across the country are the targets of the ICE raids. According to legal nonprofit RAICES, those cities are Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, Baltimore, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City and San Fransisco—all cities with large immigrant populations.

Starting Sunday, and over the course of the days after, it is understood that immigrants who have received a notice of deportation will be arrested. “Collateral” arrests are expected to happen, according to the Times, meaning undocumented immigrants caught in the middle of a raid might also get arrested even if they might not have been the original target.

“We anticipate that there will be many people who are unlawfully picked up this weekend,” Jess Morales Rocketto, chair of Families Belong Together, an immigrant advocacy organization, tells TIME. “They will be United States citizens, children of United States citizens and others.”

Julie Pasch, an immigration attorney with the Houston Immigration Legal Services Collaborative, says she expects to see children detained along with their parents—which ICE can legally do if the child has final orders of removal from the U.S.

“I can only imagine how terrifying that would be for a young child who sees his or her parents arrested in handcuffs and then to be led away with them in what is very much an arrest. I can only imagine how horrifying that would be,” Pasch tells TIME. “But if what happens this weekend follows what has been said and what has been reported, I think we will likely see that.”

Many city and state leaders have come forward to defend immigrants, including Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, New York City District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and California Governor Gavin Newsom. The offices have also been spreading legal advice to their constituencies.

“The President’s planned ‘ICE raids’ will make us less safe,” Vance said in a public statement. “They will further erode the trust and partnership built over decades between undocumented New Yorkers and law enforcement agencies like mine that proudly serve and protect them. They will make undocumented people less likely to report a violent crime against themselves or their neighbors, and less likely to testify in court to help us bring that assailant to justice. They will not deliver ‘law and order,’ but rather greater impunity for criminal perpetrators.”

What are the laws about ICE raids?

ICE raids have been a common practice for years before the Trump Administration began. Surprise workplace raids or raids targeting a specific individual were frequent throughout the Obama Administration as well, and have happened ever since ICE and DHS were established in 2002, under the Bush Administration in response to the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Ohio saw one of the largest ICE raids in the agency’s short history when 200 federal agents arrested 114 undocumented immigrants at a gardening center in Sandusky on June 6, 2018.

“And that was considered to be a very strict roundup,” Rocketto says, comparing the 114 arrests last year to the 2,000 people ICE plans to detain this weekend.

“They’re not signaling that this is a one-time operation either,” Rocketto adds. “So if they’re consistently trying to get to 2,000 people every time they do a raid, that is very scary.”

Legally, ICE is within its rights to detain and deport anyone who has already received a final removal order, according to Pasch. However, immigrants, no matter their legal status maintain some constitutional protections. They have the right to remain silent, and ICE agents need a permit signed by a judge in order to enter their home. Undocumented immigrants also have the right to plead their case before an immigration judge, but do not have a right to government-appointed legal council.

What should you do if ICE picks you up?

Pasch, Rocketto, organizations and government offices across the country advise that undocumented immigrants who are worried they might get arrested by ICE have a phone number memorized for an immigration lawyer, a qualified immigration nonprofit, a hotline or a loved one who can contact an attorney on their behalf.

“I think the single most important thing that people who might be impacted can do is be aware of their rights,” Pasch says. “Go visit an immigration lawyer or a qualified immigration nonprofit and see if there’s anything that you can do to preemptively work on your immigration case.”

Even those who cannot afford a lawyer can still access legal information at free clinics organized by nonprofits in almost every major city.

Pasch and Rocketto add that an order for removal may not necessarily be the end of an undocumented immigrant’s case, and some might still have a chance to appeal it.

“We also advise people to stay calm and remain silent,” Rocketto says. “That way agents cannot use anything [immigrants] say against them.”
