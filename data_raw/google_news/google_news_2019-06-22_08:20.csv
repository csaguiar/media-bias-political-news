Trump responds to accusation of '90s sexual assault,https://www.cnn.com,"['Veronica Stracqualursi', 'Caroline Kelly']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/21/politics/trump-new-york-magazine-assault-e-jean-carroll/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump on Friday responded to allegations of sexual assault after magazine advice columnist E. Jean Carroll alleged he had attacked her at a New York luxury department store in the late 1990s.

Carroll details the allegations in her forthcoming book, ""What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal,"" excerpts of which were published earlier Friday in New York Magazine . While Carroll does not appear to name Trump in the printed excerpt of the first-person account, he is named in the headline, which reads: ""Hideous Men Donald Trump assaulted me in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room 23 years ago. But he's not alone on the list of awful men in my life.""

Trump denied the allegations in a statement Friday, saying he had ""never met this person."" He accused Carroll of sharing her account to raise book sales, comparing her to women who ""falsely accused"" Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious confirmation hearings. The article published Friday includes a photo of Trump and Carroll talking in a group.

""Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda -- like Julie Swetnick who falsely accused Justice Brett Kavanaugh,"" Trump said. ""It's just as bad for people to believe it, particularly when there is zero evidence. Worse still for a dying publication to try to prop itself up by peddling fake news -- it's an epidemic.""

Carroll claims that she encountered Trump in the fall of 1995 or spring 1996 at the Bergdorf Goodman department store, where she says he attacked her in one of the dressing rooms.

"Urged to Launch an Attack, Trump Listened to the Skeptics Who Said It Would Be a Costly Mistake",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Peter Baker', 'Maggie Haberman', 'Thomas Gibbons-Neff']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/politics/trump-iran-strike.html,"WASHINGTON — He heard from his generals and his diplomats. Lawmakers weighed in and so did his advisers. But among the voices that rang powerfully for President Trump was that of one of his favorite Fox News hosts: Tucker Carlson.

While national security advisers were urging a military strike against Iran, Mr. Carlson in recent days had told Mr. Trump that responding to Tehran’s provocations with force was crazy. The hawks did not have the president’s best interests at heart, he said. And if Mr. Trump got into a war with Iran, he could kiss his chances of re-election goodbye.

However much weight that advice may or may not have had, the sentiments certainly reinforced the doubts that Mr. Trump himself harbored as he navigated his way through one of the most consequential foreign policy decisions of his presidency. By his own account, the president called off the “cocked & loaded” strike on Thursday night with only 10 minutes to spare to avoid the estimated deaths of as many as 150 people.

The concerns that Mr. Trump heard from Mr. Carlson reflected that part of the presidential ID that has always hesitated at pulling the trigger. Belligerent and confrontational as he is in his public persona, Mr. Trump has at times pulled back from the use of force, convinced that America has wasted too many lives and too much money in pointless Middle East wars and wary of repeating what he considers the mistakes of his predecessors."

""Going forward if they think the president is going to do the same thing, if they shoot anything else down, I think he's going to and the pressure is going to be on him so much that there will be a response that last night will pale in comparison to,"" Kinzinger told guest host Ed Henry.

TRUMP CONFIRMS HE CALLED OFF RETALIATORY IRAN ATTACK '10 MINUTES BEFORE THE STRIKE'

Trump confirmed early Friday that he called off a retaliatory attack on Iran in response to the downing of a U.S. drone “10 minutes before the strike,” saying the number of expected casualties was not ""proportionate"" to what Tehran did.

Kinzinger, who disagreed with Trump's decision, found it interesting that Democrats were unsatisfied with the president's change of heart.

""I disagreed with the president's decision. But that said, this should be the thing that those that were claiming that president Trump was a warmonger, was going to start World War III and he can't be trusted, and John Bolton and all this kind of stuff, they should now be celebrating that he is not what they said he was, but they are not,"" Kinzinger said.

""While I'm being consistent and I disagree with this decision, I think the president will use military force as something like this happens again, it is amazing to see the dichotomy of things.""

Trump taps Army Secretary Mark Esper to lead Pentagon,https://www.politico.com,['Jacqueline Feldscher'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/21/trump-taps-army-secretary-mark-esper-to-lead-pentagon-1376704,"Army Secretary Mark Esper will probably face questions from Congress about his close ties to industry. | Chuck Burton/AP Photo defense Trump taps Army Secretary Mark Esper to lead Pentagon

President Donald Trump will nominate Army Secretary Mark Esper to be the next secretary of Defense, the White House said Friday night, in the administration's latest attempt to resolve months of uncertainty at the top of the Pentagon.

The news comes three days after the abrupt resignation of acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan, whose hopes of getting the job collapsed amid ethics questions, complaints about his leadership style and media scrutiny of his troubled family history.

Story Continued Below

Trump had said in early May that he intended to nominate Shanahan for the post, but he never submitted the paperwork to the Senate.

The White House also said Friday that Trump will nominate Pentagon comptroller David Norquist — the brother of anti-tax activist Grover Norquist — to be deputy Defense secretary, and Army Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy to be Army secretary.

Esper, a West Point graduate and Gulf War veteran, is already set to become acting Defense secretary when Shanahan's resignation takes effect on Sunday. But federal law may force him to bow out of that post once Trump formally nominates him.

Esper has been secretary of the Army since November 2017, after spending seven years as a top lobbyist for defense contractor Raytheon. He also worked on Capitol Hill as national security adviser for former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and as a professional staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Much like Shanahan, who was a long-time Boeing executive, Esper will probably face questions from Congress about his close ties to industry — one of the key sticking points when senators previously considered Esper's nomination to be Army secretary. Esper has recused himself from matters involving Raytheon for two years, but that period will end in November.

One of the biggest issues could be whether he will need to sit out negotiations with Turkey over its purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system. The U.S. has been urging Russia to buy the American Patriot missile defense system instead, which is made by Raytheon, and some defense experts have said Esper could not advocate for buying a system from his former employer.

Another complication is the Vacancies Act, a 1998 law that lays out the succession rules for a Senate-confirmed position within the administration.

Under that law, Esper cannot serve as acting Defense secretary while the Senate is considering his nomination to be the permanent secretary. Under the Pentagon’s order of succession, the new acting Defense secretary would probably be Navy Secretary Richard Spencer.

Trump would have to nominate Esper before July 30, because the act says a position can have an acting official for only 210 days. That clock began running when former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned effective Jan. 1, according to a memo from Arnold Punaro, a retired Marine officer and CEO of The Punaro Group consulting firm.

As Army secretary, Esper has been a close ally to the president, including on the deployment of active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. But he has differed from the president on other issues, including Trump’s ban on transgender service members. Esper testified last year alongside Gen. Mark Milley, who has been nominated to be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that no readiness concerns arise from letting transgender troops serve.

Esper received a commission as an infantry officer after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy in 1986. He also served in the National Guard and Army reserves before retiring in 2007, according to his Army biography."
Chip stocks fall after Commerce Dept bars 5 more Chinese companies from buying US parts,https://www.cnbc.com,['Yun Li'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/chip-stocks-fall-after-commerce-dept-bars-5-more-chinese-firms-from-buying-us-parts.html,"The U.S. Commerce Department has banned five more Chinese entities from buying U.S. components after blacklisting telecom giant Huawei last month.

Higon, Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit, Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology, Sugon and Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology are the five Chinese firms added to the department's entity list, according to a filing.

The department said the activities of these companies ""pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.""

Shares of U.S. semiconductors came under pressure after the announcement. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled more than 3%, while Xilinx and Nvidia also fell 2.2% and 1.5%, respectively.

The move came before President Donald Trump's key meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit this month to discuss the lingering trade differences. The U.S. and China have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods, while ramping up tit-for-tat threats in the ongoing trade war.

The Commerce Department said Sugon and the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology are the leaders in China's development of exascale high-performance computing.

Sugon has publicly acknowledged ""a variety of military end uses and end users of its high-performance computers,"" the department said. Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology's mission is ""to support China's military modernization,"" the department noted.

The U.S. restrictions on Huawei have forced many American chipmakers and tech companies including Google to cut ties with the Chinese giant. Huawei's U.S. chip suppliers, including Qualcomm and Intel, are reportedly quietly lobbying to ease the Huawei ban."

Global Entry is a Customs and Border Protection program that ""allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival"" in the US. The Trusted Traveler Programs website , which includes Global Entry, already has an alert warning applicants that the ""extended partial government shutdown has resulted in a backlog,"" of applications and renewals.

The personnel shift comes amid a swell of migrant families and children that have arrived at the US border this year. The influx has strained DHS immigration resources and caused concerns about overcrowding and delayed US Border Patrol processing.

In response to efforts at the border, ""CBP is temporarily reducing staff at Global Entry Enrollment Centers nationwide and reassigning them to support frontline traveler processing during the busy summer months,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

""Regrettably, this situation has forced the cancellation of some scheduled appointments and may make it difficult to schedule an immediate interview,"" the statement said.

(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)

The State Department condemned China and Iran on Friday for treating religious minorities as national security threats meriting surveillance, imprisonment and sometimes death.

In introducing the annual report on International Religious Freedom, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck an unusual personal note, noting he had been a Sunday school teacher and a church deacon, and took a swipe at Washington.

“That might sound unusual to a lot of people inside the Beltway,” he said. “But I am one of millions of Americans, and billions of people across the world, who live in the knowledge of a higher power. I often humbly reflect on how God’s providence has guided me to this office, to defend this cause.”

Samuel Brownback, the ambassador for religious freedom, said: “We believe there is no more important time for the United States to promote religious freedom than now.”

The annual report looks at the government policies that violate religious belief and practices in every country of the world except the United States.

China and Iran are among 10 countries of particular concern when it comes to religious freedom, meaning they may face sanctions. The chapters are considerably longer than those of North Korea, which Brownback called “horrible” for religious freedom, or on Myanmar, where ethnic Rohingya have been subjected to harassment and violence.

The report was released amid growing tensions between the United States and Iran, as well as China.

The United States and China have been in a trade war for nearly a year. While talks go on, the Trump administration has shied away from placing sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the detention of 1 million or more ethnic Uighurs and other minority Muslims in the northwest region of Xinjiang. Brownback said some sanctions have been placed on the manufacturers of equipment used to surveil religious minorities, and the United States frequently raises its concerns publicly.

Iranian Christians and other religious minorities are among those who have lost opportunities to emigrate to the United States as part of deep cuts in refugee admissions from Iran. Brownback said the criteria for religious minorities getting preference as refugees changed during the Obama administration, and it is time for the policy to be reviewed.

The religious freedom report lists detailed accounts of religious minorities in countries around the world who were subjected to “death, forced disappearances, and organ harvesting in prison because of their religious beliefs or affiliation.”

Pompeo has spoken forcefully against the treatment of Uighur Muslims sent to what he has called “reeducation camps.” U.S. attempts to berate the Chinese have sparked little change, however. After Pompeo met with four Uighurs in March to discuss human rights abuses, the aunt and uncle of one of them, a U.S. citizen, learned his aunt and uncle had been moved from a camp and sentenced to eight years in prison.

The report said Chinese Christians also have been increasingly oppressed, with authorities closing churches, burning bibles and ordering believers to renounce their faith.

The chapter on Iran accuses the government of meting out harsh punishments to those who are not Shiite Muslims. Iran’s penal code specifies death for crimes like enmity against God, corruption on earth and insulting the prophets.

But there is little the U.S. government can do about it, except protest publicly. With no diplomatic relations between Tehran and Washington, the report says, U.S. diplomats “did not have opportunities to raise concerns directly with the government over its religious freedom abuses and restrictions.”"
"Trump's Pentagon pick is Army veteran, defense lobbyist",https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Eric Tucker']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/06/21/trumps-pentagon-pick-is-army-veteran-defense-lobbyist/23754346/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's pick for new defense secretary is an Army veteran who served in the first Iraq war and also has experience as a national security adviser on Capitol Hill as well as a defense industry lobbyist.

Trump announced Friday that he would nominate Mark Esper to lead the Pentagon. Trump had already named Esper, his current Army secretary, to lead the Defense Department on an acting basis, starting Sunday.

""I know Mark, and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job!"" the president tweeted Tuesday.

He later told reporters: ""He's very experienced. He's been around all of the things that we've been talking about for a very long period of time.""

Tuesday's move came after acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan withdrew from the job before his formal nomination had gone to the Senate, citing a ""painful"" family situation that would hurt his children and reopen ""wounds we have worked years to heal.""

Esper was sworn in as Army secretary in November 2017 following a seven-year stint as vice president for government relations at defense contractor Raytheon. That lobbyist background raised immediate alarms from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which said that Raytheon had recently won multiple government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

""While Esper may not have had sway over these types of deals as Secretary of the Army, as acting Secretary of Defense he will have potential influence over such deals,"" as well as a proposed merger between Raytheon and United Technologies Corp., CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement.

Esper previously served a national security adviser for former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.

He was policy director for the House Armed Services Committee and a professional staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations committee and also advised former Obama administration Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel when Hagel was in the Senate.

He's also served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense and was a war planner on the Army staff.

Esper spent more than a decade in the Army, including serving in the Persian Gulf War in 1990 and 1991 with the 101st Airborne Division. He has won the Bronze Star Medal and other awards.

""He has a great background. I know him and I think he'll do very well in the acting role,"" said Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., a close Trump ally who speaks frequently with the president.

It is not clear whether Esper's defense industry background might complicate any confirmation prospects.

Shanahan, for instance, came under scrutiny because of his prior career as a Boeing executive and persistent questions about possible conflicts of interest.

The Defense Department's Inspector General cleared Shanahan of any wrongdoing in connection with accusations he had shown favoritism toward Boeing during his time as deputy defense secretary, while disparaging Boeing competitors.

But even so, Bookbinder said Shanahan's past work at Boeing overshadowed his decisions at the Defense Department.

""His successor will likewise risk being tainted by his previous work for a major defense contractor,"" Bookbinder said.

""I think there was a lot of hope at first with the change of leadership that things would open up substantially,"" Ambassador at Large Sam Brownback said at the State Department's release of the 2018 Report on International Religious Freedom . ""We need to see actions take place in a positive direction, but they continue to be one of the worst actors in the world on religious persecution.""

The report, prepared annually for Congress, catalogs Saudi Arabia's extensive religious freedom abuses in 2018.

""Freedom of religion is not provided under the law. The government does not allow the public practice of any non-Muslim religion. The law criminalizes 'anyone who challenges, either directly or indirectly, the religion or justice of the King or Crown Prince.' The law criminalizes 'the promotion of atheistic ideologies in any form,' 'any attempt to cast doubt on the fundamentals of Islam,' publications that 'contradict the provisions of Islamic law,' and other acts including non-Islamic public worship, public display of non-Islamic religious symbols, conversion by a Muslim to another religion, and proselytizing by a non-Muslim,"" it notes.

The report describes discrimination against and abuse of Shiite Muslims, including up to 34 individuals who faced possible execution. Saudi Arabia executed 37 men , the majority of them Shiites, in April 2019. One of them was crucified. Three were minors when the kingdom said they carried out their crimes.

""We will continue to raise these issues with Saudi Arabia,"" Brownback said.

Saudi Arabia has been a ""Country of Particular Concern"" since 2004. This designation, given by the secretary of state to nations with severe violations of religious freedom, can be coupled with sanctions. However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo waived the sanctions that would have accompanied the most recent designation.

The International Religious Freedom report also documents violations from countries like Myanmar, Russia and China. Pompeo has repeatedly spoken out about the abuses of Uighur Muslims in China, and did so on Friday as well.

""History will not be silent about these abuses -- but only if voices of liberty like ours record it,"" he said in remarks at the report's release.

The 2018 report has a special section documenting abuses against the Muslim minority in China's Xinjiang province, ""given the scope and severity of reported religious freedom violations specific to the region this year.""

The Chinese government has detained ""possibly more than 2 million Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and members of other Muslim groups, mostly Chinese citizens, in specially built or converted detention facilities in Xinjiang and subjected them to forced disappearance, torture, physical abuse, and prolonged detention without trial because of their religion and ethnicity since April 2017,"" the report notes."

Chinese telecom giant Huawei has filed a civil lawsuit against the U.S. government accusing the Commerce Department of mishandling equipment that it seized from the company in 2017.

According to the complaint filed Friday, the U.S. government took possession of several pieces of equipment, which were being shipped from an independent testing facility in the United States to China, in order to determine if the technology was subject to export controls.

Story Continued Below

Huawei contends it provided the necessary documentation and was told such disputes are usually resolved in 45 days. Nearly two years later, Huawei believes the equipment is still sitting in an Alaskan warehouse, according to the complaint.

Huawei is not seeking financial compensation but instead wants the court to force the Commerce Department to decide whether export control clearance is necessary and, if not, release the equipment.

A spokesperson for the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit comes as tensions between Huawei and the U.S. government have reached a fever pitch.

The Justice Department charged Huawei earlier this year with violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and stealing trade secrets from U.S. competitors. Meanwhile, Huawei sued the U.S.government, saying a law passed by Congress that banned federal agencies from doing business with the company was unconstitutional.

What's more, the Commerce Department slapped severe trade restrictions on Huawei last month that prevent U.S. companies from selling vital equipment to the company, a penalty that Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei recently said could cost the company $30 billion in lost sales over two years.

Hundreds of migrant caravan members found to have US criminal histories: DHS files,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hundreds-of-migrant-caravan-found-to-have-criminal-histories-dhs-files,"Hundreds of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the southern border as part of massive migrant caravans were found to have criminal histories in the U.S., according to newly obtained Department of Homeland Security documents.

The DHS files were provided to House Oversight Committee Republicans in May and included internal data showing more than 1,000 migrants traveling as part of caravans to the border within the past nine months had “U.S. criminal histories” and hundreds had “U.S. criminal convictions.”

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

The files detailed one migrant caravan of nearly 8,000 individuals that started toward the border in October 2018 and arrived south of California by December. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 660 of them had U.S. criminal convictions—with 40 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and three convicted of murder.

In January 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracked another caravan that left Honduras with more than 3,300 migrants. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) team identified that 860 of those individuals had U.S. criminal histories, including more than 20 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, nearly 30 convicted of sexual offenses, two convicted of violence against law enforcement, and one convicted of attempted murder.

The documents, provided to House Oversight Republicans, also revealed that CBP is currently monitoring another “movement of several groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 4,000” in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Veracruz, but did not specify how many of those migrants are believed to have criminal records.

In a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday, committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, requested further information about caravan members with criminal backgrounds to “assist” in their “oversight of the crisis at the southern border and better understand the threat posed by large caravans.”

Jordan requested arrest warrants, court documents and other materials detailing the criminal histories of the migrants in the January 2019 and October 2018 caravan; an update of CBP’s monitoring of the caravan movement in Mexican states; and summaries of ICE HSI materials by July 5.

In his letter, Jordan referred to President Trump’s decision in February to declare a national emergency and referred to his comments that the “southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics” threatening “core national security interests.”

The newly revealed DHS information comes amid a stunning surge across the border this year. Last month, the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border skyrocketed to levels not seen in over a decade, with CBP reporting nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible—more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. The number was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years, officials said.

“We are in a full-blown emergency,” Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said earlier this month. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

FOOTAGE SHOWS MIGRANTS WALKING AROUND BORDER WALL TO ENTER US

McAleenan, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also warned that 90 percent of asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the U.S.

The continued crisis at the border comes as Trump has sought to extend and shore up the border wall, declaring a national emergency in a bid to divert billions toward construction -- an effort being challenged in the courts.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

Through the agreement, the U.S. is slated to extend its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. also committed to accelerating asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare, and education according to its principles.”

The deal also stated that Mexico will take “decisive action” to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border.

Justice Department files antitrust suit to stop massive acquisition by Quad/Graphics,https://www.jsonline.com,"['Rick Romell', 'Published A.M. Ct June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2019/06/21/justice-department-files-antitrust-suit-stop-big-quad-graphics-acquisition/1519957001/,"CLOSE

The U.S. Justice Department is suing to block Quad/Graphics Inc.'s proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of LSC Communications, saying the merger would combine the only two significant magazine, catalog and book printers in the country.

""LSC is Quad’s primary competitor,"" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a statement. ""If this deal were allowed to proceed, Quad would dominate the markets for magazine, catalog, and book printing services and be able to raise prices and reduce quality at the expense of publishers, retailers, and, ultimately, American consumers.”

The two companies are by far the largest printers in the U.S. and their ""intense, head-to-head competition"" has benefited customers, the department said.

Sussex-based Quad, one of the largest private employers in Wisconsin, said it would ""vigorously defend"" the proposed acquisition. The firm said the Justice Department is ignoring ""dynamic conditions"" in commercial printing and the fact that printers compete not just with each other but with burgeoning digital advertising channels such as Google and Facebook.

""Given the continued migration of advertising dollars to digital channels,"" printers have pursued consolidations to reduce overcapacity and battle more effectively with digital competitors, Quad said in a statement.

Neither Quad nor LSC has been a stellar performer of late. LSC lost money in two of the last three years. Over that same period, Quad netted 1.5% on its sales and saw revenue decline.

Both, though, are large companies, with dozens of manufacturing and distribution plants and tens of thousands of workers.

Quad as of December had the equivalent of 20,600 employees, including 8,000 in Wisconsin and 16,900 across the U.S. Sales last year hit $4.2 billion.

Chicago-based LSC was created in 2016 when RR Donnelley & Sons Co. spun off the wing of its business that concentrated on printing magazines, catalogs, retail inserts and books.

LSC employed 22,000 people as of December, including 18,700 in the U.S. Its 2018 sales totaled $3.8 billion.

In an interview last fall, Joel Quadracci, Quad's chairman, president and CEO, said the acquisition of LSC would give Quad the scale and cash-generating capacity to smooth its transition toward becoming not just a printer but ""more of a marketing services partner"" to its customers.

""This is a defining moment in Quad’s 47-year journey,"" Quadracci said.

Sprinkled throughout the Justice Department's complaint, filed Thursday in federal court in Chicago, are examples of how the government says intense competition between Quad and LSC has benefited customers.

When the two printing giants dueled for a contract with a major book publisher, the government alleges, one LSC executive, likening the competition to the Battle of Gettysburg, declared, ""We must win"" — only to see Quad scoop up the account by offering the publisher a deal that would save it $37 million over its current arrangement.

In another case, the complaint says, Quad tried to keep a magazine publisher from switching to LSC by offering a 25% price cut. But when the publisher told LSC of the ""Godfather deal"" Quad had offered, LSC responded with even better terms. It won the contract, and the publisher realized $6.5 million in immediate benefits, the complaint says.

Such episodes, the government alleges, demonstrate why LSC's chief executive told investors a merger with Quad could lead to ""pricing stability"" and eliminate such battles between the companies.

According to the complaint, Quad and LSC control a high percentage of web offset presses in the U.S. and all rotogravure presses — the types of equipment publishers turn to for printing long runs of magazines.

Meanwhile, the government said, a presentation by Quad’s board of directors described LSC and Quad as holding a combined 69% of the catalog printing market.

In a statement, Quadracci said merging with LSC would help ensure print's viability as a channel for publishers and retailers.

""Our goal is to make print a more effective and affordable media option to that of digital giants such as Google and Facebook,"" Quadracci said. ""The DOJ does not appear to recognize the competitive effect of digital media on the print industry.""

The government, for its part, said in its complaint that people will continue to demand printed magazines, catalogs and books. Because of that, a digital-only platform is not an effective substitute to print for many publishers, the complaint said.

EPA to connect Loudoun homes contaminated by landfill to public water,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://wtop.com/loudoun-county/2019/06/epa-to-connect-loudoun-homes-contaminated-by-landfill-to-public-water/,"The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with Loudoun County and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of drinking water contamination in the Board Run Farms community that was first discovered in 1989.

More than 120 properties in the Broad Run Farms community affected by Hidden Lane Landfill superfund site groundwater contamination will be hooked up to the public water system by the federal Environmental Protestion Agency, according to Virginia’s Loudoun County.

The construction won’t cost property owners a dime but it will cost the agency millions.

The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with both the county and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of Broad Run Farms drinking water contamination first discovered in 1989.

The chemical that was discovered is called trichloroethylene, or TCE. According to the National Toxicology Program (an interagency group coordinated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), it’s primarily used in two ways: to make hydrofluorocarbon chemicals, especially refrigerants, and as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts.

The NIH also says it’s a known carcinogen and can increase the risk of cancer.

“We are grateful to the EPA for this decision and while we advocated for the extension of public water to the entire Broad Run Farms community, this is a significant action that will benefit those residents most directly impacted in the community,” Algonkian District Supervisor Suzanne Volpe, who represents the area on the Board of Supervisors, said in a Thursday news release.

“I would also like to commend the dedicated and long-term efforts of Loudoun County staff as well as the Virginia Department of Health and the Department of Environmental Quality for getting us to this milestone.”

There’s no word yet on when construction of the new water lines is slated to begin.

Trump tells Fox News DOJ looking into whether his phone calls were monitored,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'President Trump', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hannity-campaign-launch-justice-department-phone-calls-monitored,"One day after formally launching his 2020 presidential bid, President Trump told Fox News' ""Hannity"" exclusively on Wednesday that investigators are working to determine whether his personal phone calls were secretly monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 campaign -- a possibility he called ""the ultimate.""

Trump also hammered House Democrats for putting his former top communication advisor Hope Hicks ""through hell,"" after pictures of Hicks testifying before a closed-door session on Capitol Hill earlier in the day leaked on social media.

Hicks is the Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer for Fox Corporation, and Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation.

""What's happened to the Democrats -- and in the meantime, they're not doing any work in Congress,"" Trump told Sean Hannity, calling the party ""unhinged.""

""They're not allowed to do that. It's probably illegal,"" Trump said, referring to the leaked pictures of Hicks. Some Democrats complained that Hicks, in her appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, was ordered by the White House to stay quiet about her time as an aide to Trump, citing legal privileges.

But, Trump condemned Democrats' ongoing hearings on collusion and obstruction as an attempt at a ""do-over"" of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Take a look at Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""How come the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC? Just think about that one, Sean."" That was a reference to the DNC's decision in 2016 to turn over its server to the private security firm Crowdstrike, rather than the FBI, after what prosecutors said was a Russian-led hack.

The Hill's John Solomon reported earlier Wednesday that the FBI, in search warrant affidavits, relied heavily on leaked Ukrainian financial documents concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- even though the bureau was repeatedly warned that the documents were untrustworthy and likely fake.

Earlier this year, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko opened a probe into the so-called ""black ledger"" files that led to Manafort's abrupt departure from the Trump campaign. The investigation commenced after an unearthed audio recording showed that a senior Ukrainian anticorruption official apparently admitted to leaking Manafort's financial information in 2016 -- including his ties to pro-Russian actors in Ukraine -- to benefit Clinton.

CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' TRUMP SAYS

A Ukrainian court recently ruled that the Manafort leak amounted to illegal interference in the U.S. election. A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one."" — President Trump

Trump told Hannity the episode was hardly surprising, given that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), through the firm Fusion GPS, funded British ex-spy Christopher Steele's creation of an unverified and largely discredited dossier. The FBI went on to cite the dossier in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

""I think it's a disgrace,"" Trump said.

Numerous issues with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Mueller's report made plain, for example, that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

""The fact is, they were spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies to do it. ... We're trying to figure out whether they listened to my calls. That would be the ultimate. We'll see what happens. If that happens, we'll probably find out. If they spied on my campaign and they may have, it will be one of the great revelations in history of this country. It will be very interesting. I think we're gonna find out.""

Trump said Attorney General Bill Barr is working ""very hard"" to get to the bottom the matter.

DOJ INVESTIGATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AS PART OF ONGOING REVIEW OF FBI MISCONDUCT

The lengthy phone conversation began with Trump recounting the Tuesday night launch of his campaign in the jam-packed Amway Center in Orlando. Thousands of Trump supporters arrived more than 40 hours in advance to secure a spot, despite sweltering Florida heat. Some had been camped in chairs for several nights.

""It was an incredible scene -- and outside there were thousands of people,"" Trump told Hannity, comparing the atmosphere to that of a national college football championship. ""It was just an electric evening. ... It's a tailgate party for our country.""

Trump noted that the U.S. has become ""number one in the world in energy,"" referring to the fact that the U.S. is the world's leading crude oil producer. The head of the International Energy Agency said in 2018 that, because of the ""shale revolution,"" the U.S. ""is becoming the undisputed leader of oil and gas production worldwide.”

The positive economic indicators, Trump said, have led Democrats to desperately pivot to discussing obstruction, now that Mueller's report found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign, despite multiple efforts by Russian-linked actors to involve the Trump team in its hacking efforts.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one,"" Trump said, before touting his administration's economic successes. ""We have the best, lowest unemployment rate for blacks, Asians, Hispanics -- nobody's ever seen numbers like this... If the other side had won, we'd have gone into a depression.

""We have more poeple working today -- almost 160 million people -- than have ever worked in the history of our country,"" Trump added. ""Think of it -- it's a great number.""

Trump also denied a Wall Street Journal report that he will live-tweet the upcoming Democrat primary debates, but suggested it might not be a bad idea.

""Instead of fake news, I'll make them correct news -- and maybe that's OK,"" Trump joked.

""When I make a speech, like last night -- there was a fantastic woman in the front with a sign, 'Please keep tweeting, it matters,'"" Trump continued. ""And, I think it does matter. I don't do it because I enjoy it. When somebody says an outright lie on MSNBC or CNN ... I can counteract those lies, and I have many more followers than they do."""
"White, bright dot in Dayton sky could be part of DOD program",https://www.whio.com,[],,,,https://www.whio.com/news/local/mysterious-bright-white-dot-dayton-area-may-part-department-defense-program/fDedxeoSef2yHdP8TASuFM/,"Published: Thursday, June 20, 2019 @ 1:12 PM



— A bright, white dot spotted over the Dayton area and numerous suburbs of the city could be part of the U.S. Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, also known as DARPA.

>> Live Doppler 7 Radar

“DARPA launched three balloons from Cumberland, Maryland, in a flight test for the Adaptable Lighter Than Air Program,” said Heather Babb, spokeswoman for the Department of Defense. “ALTA will demonstrate capability for wind-borne navigation of a lighter-than-air vehicle over extended ranges.”

>> PREVIOUS: What was that bright, white dot hanging over parts of the Miami Valley?

Babb stopped short of confirming that the bright, white dot spotted by numerous News Center 7 viewers was indeed a DARPA balloon, however another spokesperson for DARPA said given the location it was likely one of their balloons.

Sightings of the object were reported Tuesday to News Center 7 from viewers in Xenia, Englewood, West Milton, West Carrollton and Eaton.

DARPA’s ALTA program’s balloons can fly at altitudes of more than 75,000 feet.

“While they do not have independent propulsion, the ALTA vehicle is designed to navigate by changing altitude and thus taking advantage of different wind profiles aloft,” according to DARPA’s website.

DARPA dates back to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and also has played roles in precision weapons and stealth technology, and other technology advances such as the Internet, automated voice recognition, language transition and GPS.

DARPA is comprised of about 220 government employees in six technical offices, who oversee about 250 research and development programs."
Reparations Won’t Start With Congress. A President Needs to Do That.,https://www.politico.com,"['Jack Shafer', 'Theodore R. Johnson']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/21/reparations-hearing-2020-candidates-congress-227194,"Theodore R. Johnson is a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice.

On Wednesday, exactly 154 years after a promise was made to newly freed black Americans, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties convened a hearing to discuss reparations for the breaking of that promise. The date of the hearing marked Juneteenth, a holiday that commemorates the abolition of slavery and the associated “absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property” that were to follow. The denial of those equal rights, however, led to massive racial inequalities that still plague the United States.

At the center of the hearing was H.R. 40, a bill that’s been introduced in every Congress for the past three decades that “establishes a commission to study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations” for slavery, Jim Crow and their lingering effects. The bill represents one of the most serious efforts to jump-start a national inquiry into reparations, an idea that emerged with new urgency after Ta-Nehisi Coates’16,000-word Atlantic article in 2014 on the issue. Though 80 percent of white people still oppose reparations, their support has doubled, from 6 percent in 2014 to 13 percent today, since the publication of that essay.

Story Continued Below

For all the attention the congressional hearing got this week, Congress is the wrong venue if America is really going to move forward with a reparations study. It’s highly unlikely such a contentious measure would ever make it through the House or the Senate, assuming either would even put it to a vote. Instead, the push is going to have to come from the White House.

Though it won’t happen in the Trump administration, this idea is no longer as outlandish as it once might have seemed. The United States is now heading into its first presidential campaign where several candidates have expressed their support for studying reparations for the descendants of enslaved black Americans. The White House has unique power to focus national attention, and a presidential commission—far more than the congressional commission discussed this week—would have the prestige and traction to pull in national leaders and shape public opinion.

To date, of the 2020 Democratic candidates, only Julián Castro has specifically said he would create a commission to study the issue, but most of the top candidates ranging from Elizabeth Warren to Kamala Harris to Cory Booker have expressed support for the idea in some form. Many of them have expressed support for H.R. 40 and the congressional commission specifically. But executive action on reparations is an issue that each candidate should address more specifically. The creation of a presidential commission for a hot-button issue like reparations is well within the range of what presidents have done: Throughout the 20th century, presidential commissions and similar entities exploring a range of issues became a mainstay of American governance. From 1901 to 1929 alone, nearly 500 such commissions, councils, committees, task forces and the like were created by just five presidents. And the pace continues with modern presidents. Just last year, President Donald Trump announced two new commissions in the span of three days—one on school shootings and another on prisoner reentry.

On a controversial issue like reparations, it should be the president who steps up to the plate and commissions a study because state actions like making official apologies and reparations should ultimately be led by heads of state.

Presidential action is also necessary because it’s the surest route to a study, and such a study might be the only viable first step in the process because it could grease the wheels for a more productive national discussion on the issue. And on a controversial issue like reparations, improving the terms of the debate is essential to moving forward.

In a recent paper, political scientists David Miller and Andrew Reeves found that presidential commissions can be successful in accomplishing a range of political objectives—allaying constituents’ demands, incorporating diverse perspectives and fostering consensus, conferring credibility on policy ideas and proposals and providing a public framing for the issue in question that provides a point of reference for the national discourse. These benefits are particularly useful for the reparations debate, because too much of it is dominated by caricatured views that distort the issue. A reparations study could make the issues of racial inequality and embedded racial disadvantages plain by documenting their origins, entrenchment and present impacts.

In particular, the study can drill into some of the most controversial parts of the reparations debate: its focus on cash payments and its narrative framing that pits citizens against one another. Figures from economists on the cost of a reparations package range as high as $8 trillion to $14 trillion, making the $500 million proposed by presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, the only candidate to explicitly argue for direct cash payments, seem paltry. A study can give voters a real idea of what that figure might look like. And too many Americans believe reparations consists of white Americans alive today being held culpable for slavery and Jim Crow and personally responsible for compensation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell echoed these sentiments in a recent interview, saying “I don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago when none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea.” Both of these views are usually followed by technocratic arguments about the amount of money it would take or trying to determine citizen’s eligibility.

The study could address these questions head-on. It would show that reparations are an issue not between white and black Americans, but between the American government and the citizens it didn’t protect from racial violence and political, economic and social disenfranchisement. Because we are a capitalist society that accumulated wealth from the labor of enslaved people, financial penalties as restitution to close today’s racial wealth gap are often the default measures to address the historical wrongs. But we are also a democratic republic, so the study could explore other innovative means of reparations, such as this thought experiment on weighted voting in which African American’ votes are given more value than white votes for a designated period of time.

Because of the ease with which presidential commissions are created and the number of them presidents establish, they are sometimes cast as ineffective, low-cost tools to satisfy political demands without actually delivering policy solutions or reform. But when it comes to matters of civil rights and racial injustice, history demonstrates that American presidents have had to use the powers of the presidency to force the nation to confront its race issues rather than waiting on congressional action.

The two most consequential commissions regarding race relations in the past century are instructive on this point. Lynching and racial violence terrorized black Americans throughout the nation in the early 20th century, yet anti-lynching legislation routinely failed to make it through Congress. Civil rights activists pressed presidents to take action and finally met with some success after Harry Truman ascended to the White House. After hearing details about state and vigilante violence against black Americans, Truman exclaimed, “""My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that! We've got to do something!"" Three months later, he signed Executive Order 9808, which established the President’s Committee on Civil Rights in 1946 to investigate ways to strengthen civil rights protections. The group published its findings in a report a year later, recommending improved oversight of civil rights protections, anti-lynching measures, improvements in fair employment practices and the abolition of poll taxes. As a result, Truman desegregated the military and federal workforce by executive order, a move that helped ensure his improbable election victory in 1948. (As for anti-lynching legislation, Congress has still not sent a bill to any president’s desk.)

Twenty years after Truman’s Committee finalized its report, President Lyndon Johnson signed Executive Order 11365 creating the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders to analyze the causes behind a rash of race riots across the country. Commonly referred to as the Kerner Commission, it published its report in February 1968 and found that the root of the uprising was black Americans’ lack of economic opportunity. The report did not mince its words, placing fault at the feet of racism and calling for federal housing, jobs and societal desegregation programs. Johnson mostly dismissed the report, but the information moved public opinion. When Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated two months after the report’s release, Johnson signed the Fair Housing Act of 1968 into law.

Of course, the study is just a first step. Any recommendations that come out of such a presidential commission would be nonbinding, subject to the president’s discretion and probably would require legislative action and judicial review before implementation. But given the evolving politics of reparations, a study can set the tone for wherever the debate goes next.

DHS to Move Biometric Data on Hundreds of Millions of People to Amazon Cloud,https://www.nextgov.com,['Jack Corrigan'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2019/06/dhs-move-biometric-data-hundreds-millions-people-amazon-cloud/157837/,"The Homeland Security Department is looking to upgrade the software it uses to analyze biometric data on hundreds of millions of people around the globe, and it plans to store that information in Amazon’s cloud.

The agency’s Office of Biometric Identity Management will replace its legacy biometric analysis platform, called the Automated Biometric Identification System, or IDENT, with a new, more robust system hosted by Amazon Web Services, according to a request for information released Monday.

IDENT essentially serves as an enterprisewide clearinghouse for troves of biometric and biographic data collected by the Transportation Security Administration, Customs and Border Protection, Secret Service and other Homeland Security components. The system links fingerprint, iris and face data to biographic information, allowing officials to quickly identify suspected terrorists, immigration violators, criminals and anyone else included in their databases.

In total, IDENT contains information on more than 250 million people, a Homeland Security spokesperson told Nextgov.

According to the solicitation, Homeland Security is in the process of replacing IDENT with the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System, or HART. The new system will include the same biometric recognition features as its predecessor, and potentially additional tools that could identify individuals based on DNA, palm prints, scars, physical markings and tattoos.

Whereas IDENT stores records in government-run data centers, the Homeland Security solicitation states “HART will reside in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) FedRAMP certified GovCloud.” Further, “biometric matching capabilities for fingerprint, iris, and facial matching will be integrated with HART in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud.” Amazon Web Services will also store HART’s biometric image data.

Amazon Web Services’ GovCloud US-East and US-West regions are data centers specifically built by the company to house some of the government’s most restricted information. AWS is no stranger to hosting sensitive government data, having already claimed the CIA, Defense Department, NASA and other federal agencies as customers in part because of perceived security improvements over government legacy systems.

When reached for comment, an AWS spokesperson referred inquiries to DHS.

In 2018, Northrop Grumman won a $95 million contract to develop the first two stages of the HART system, and its contract is set to expire in 2021. The department plans to use responses to the latest solicitation to inform its strategy for further developing the platform, the DHS spokesperson said.

Specifically, officials are asking vendors for ideas on how to build those multiple identification functions into the new system, while leaving room to add any new recognition “modalities” as they arise. Officials also want input on developing a handful of general reporting, analytics and search tools, as well as desktop and mobile web portals where Homeland Security employees can access the system.

Interested vendors must respond to the request by July 17.

In addition to the hundreds of millions of records stored locally in its IDENT system, Homeland Security can also access swaths of biometric information housed at other agencies.

According to the solicitation, the agency shares biometric data and technology with the Defense Department and the FBI, which can access some 640 million photos for its own facial recognition operations. Officials also said they can tap into the State Department’s Consular Consolidated Database—which contained nearly 500 million passport, visa and expat records as of 2016—as well as the databases of “several foreign governments as well as state, local, tribal and territorial law enforcement agencies.”

The government’s use of biometric technology, particularly facial recognition, has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months. Members of the House Oversight Committee have expressed broad bipartisan support for reining in the use of biometrics at agencies like the FBI, and on Monday, a group of lawmakers raised concerns about CBP’s expanding facial recognition program.

DOJ investigating Jared Kushner transactions in Deutsche Bank money-laundering probe,https://www.salon.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/20/doj-investigating-jared-kushner-transactions-in-deutsche-bank-money-laundering-probe/,"The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into potential money laundering by Deutsche Bank, including transactions linked to White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.

The investigation apparently centers on why Deutsche Bank officials failed to alert the Treasury Department about potentially suspicious transactions by Kushner’s family and company in 2016, including transactions involving Russian individuals, the New York Times reports.

Reportedly, bank officials did not submit the reports to Treasury, even though its employees prepared ""suspicious activity"" reports on the Kushner transactions and others. A spokesperson for Kushner Cos., the family's real estate corporation, told the Times that the firm is not under investigation.

The DOJ has already contacted Tammy McFadden, a former anti-money-laundering compliance officer at the bank who told the Times in May that she flagged transactions involving Kushner’s company but that her superiors had declined to file the suspicious activity reports with the federal government.

Some of McFadden’s colleagues had similar experiences in 2017 when they flagged transactions by entities owned by President Trump. It is unclear whether the FBI is investigating the bank’s handling of those transactions, according to the Times' report.

Congressional Democrats have already received some files from Deutsche Bank as they probe the bank’s dealings with Trump. Deutsche Bank was the only mainstream financial institution willing to lend Trump money after a series of high-profile bankruptcies and defaults in the 1990s. The bank lent him more than $2 billion over the last two decades, including $350 million that Trump still owes, the Times reported.

Two House committees have subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records related to Trump but the president sued to block the bank from turning the files over. A federal judge rejected Trump’s request to block the subpoena and the president's lawyers are currently appealing that ruling.

Deutsche Bank has been under a DOJ investigation since 2015, according to the Times, when agents probed the bank’s role in laundering money for wealthy Russians. The bank was hit with steep fines in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, but has not faced any criminal charges. The DOJ expanded its investigation last fall.

McFadden told the Times last month that she was fired by Deutsche Bank last year after raising concerns over the bank’s practices and has since filed complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.

On Wednesday, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) also called on the Federal Reserve System to investigate whether Deutsche Bank had violated the law by refusing to submit the suspicious activity reports on the Kushner and Trump transactions.

“Deutsche Bank’s careless attitude towards banking compliance laws and failure to police its accounts may now be impacting American government at the highest levels,” said CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder. “Questions about transactions between President Trump and foreign actors whose conduct seemingly warranted suspicious activity reports, potentially facilitated by Deutsche Bank, harms the public legitimacy of the institution of the presidency itself.”"
Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress,https://thehill.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449626-former-epa-staffer-says-wheeler-lied-congress,"A longtime former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staffer is accusing Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress California official blasts EPA head over car standard negotiations MORE of lying in a letter he wrote to Congress Thursday that denied agency staff were shut out as EPA developed a controversial rollback on Obama-era fuel standards.

Critics of the rollback have long contended that the EPA sidelined its Office of Transportation and Air Quality when developing the rule. The office is home to the agency’s in-house lab for testing vehicles emissions.

Wheeler denied that accusation this week, but Jeff Alson, a former senior policy advisor to that office, said Wheeler is not telling the truth.

“I know that is a lie because I was there. I was one of 20 people at EPA working on this for a decade,” Alson told The Hill. Alson retired in April of last year after working 40 years at the agency.

The issue of sidelined staffers came to a head as lawmakers probed the stalled negotiations between EPA and California, which has long had more stringent standards for vehicle fuel economy and is fighting the EPA rollback.

As lawmakers grilled EPA officials over the failed negotiation, the EPA delivered a letter from Wheeler that blamed California for the standstill.

It also accused the state’s negotiator, California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols, of incorrectly saying the Office of Transportation and Air Quality were shut out of the rulemaking process.

""Her testimony that EPA professional staff were cut out of this proposal's development is false,"" Wheeler wrote.

Alson said the administration has denied pushing aside career staff before, but he found this instance particularly grievous.

“To see it in a formal letter that was given to Congress and to specifically accuse someone else of lying when in reality that person was being truthful and when Administrator Wheeler was the one doing the lying, it just put me beyond the point of no return,” he said.

The EPA said Wheeler's letter speaks for itself.

""Career, professional staff within the Office of Air and Radiation were involved in the development of the proposal and continue to be involved in the final stages as we work with NHTSA to finalize this rule,"" a spokesperson said in an email to The Hill.

A key pillar of former President Obama's environmental legacy involved strengthening fuel emissions standards for cars to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2026. But Trump's rollback would freeze the average fuel economy at 37 mpg.

Alson said his office did have two or three “check the box” meetings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the other agency involved in drafting the rollback, but he said the agency did not collaborate with his EPA office in developing the standards and would not share any of their information with the EPA.

“NHTSA would say nothing about what they were assuming. They wouldn’t give us a copy of their models, they wouldn’t share their assumptions, they wouldn’t share their projections of how much the standards were going to cost,” he said. “They wouldn’t give us anything.”

When Bill Wehrum, EPA’s head of the Office of Air and Radiation, appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thursday, several Democrats questioned him about the role of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality.

Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress Democrats grill Trump officials over fuel standard rollback MORE (D-N.Y.) pointed a Government Accountability Office report that said, “NHTSA cannot be expected to have the same level of in-house expertise related to vehicle power train design and environmental issues as EPA.”

When Tonko pressed Wehrum on the Office of Air and Radiation’s involvement, Wehrum said their work with NHTSA was a “very powerful combination.”

“EPA has had a substantial amount of involvement,” Wehrum said.

Alson said retirement has freed him to talk in ways his colleagues who still work at the EPA cannot. He has been vocal in his opposition to the rollbacks, including penning an op-ed in The Hill, but said he has held back from addressing inaccuracies from administrator's until now.

“The truth is Mary Nichols is telling the truth and Administrator Wheeler is lying, and it’s shameful and it breaks my heart that the man that heads up the agency where I worked for 40 years and spent my life trying to make the world a little bit better can blatantly lie to the American public.”"
"A worthless degree? Betsy DeVos wants to change rules for which colleges stay open, close",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Chris Quintana', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/06/21/college-closing-accreditation-betsy-devos-u-s-department-education/1505318001/,"CLOSE Trump's education secretary's plans for reforming U.S. education revolve around charter schools and vouchers.

Going to Brightwood College in the 2018 fall semester was supposed to be a safe bet. So thousands of students enrolled across the country.

For those students and others, a degree is supposed to be a lifeline. They sink in time and money that could be spent in the workforce, all for the prospect of higher earnings and a more fulfilling career.

But Brightwood students’ investment didn’t pay off. What’s more, a regulatory group had signed off on the college’s programs — only to change its mind.

Accreditation, as it’s called, is meant to prevent predatory or shoddy schools from leading students astray. And the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had given its signal to students that Brightwood was a worthwhile investment.

Yet in December 2018, the agency revoked the accreditation of Education Corp. of America, which ran the Brightwood locations and other colleges across the country. The closures of dozens of institutions followed swiftly. Students had spent the time and money, but still had no degrees, and no clear path forward.

Don't be one of them: A college closed, leaving thousands without a degree. How to keep it from happening to you

Alexis Gurrola, a dental assisting student at Brightwood College, said she was told December 5 the college was closing. She said students and staff were told they would finish out the week, but that classes would not resume the following week. (Photo: Rachel Denny Clow/Caller-Times)

Many of them still struggle. In a Facebook group for students of the closed college, some commiserate over what they call worthless degrees. Others try to give advice about how to get their student loan discharged or receive their transcripts.

What’s more, the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had a checkered history itself. President Barack Obama's administration had moved to strip it of its powers to OK school programs, but following a legal battle, President Donald Trump's administration undid that move.

The Education Corp. of America colleges were just some of the institutions that suddenly closed in recent years. ITT Tech closed in 2016. Corinthian Colleges did the same in 2015. Both had been accredited by ACICS. The accrediting group said it gave multiple warnings, but the colleges weren't able to meet its standards.

What happened?: The trouble at for-profit colleges, in 5 graphs

Now, the Education Department is looking to change the arcane and bureaucratic process of accreditation.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and accreditors of universities say new rules will ultimately allow colleges to offer programs more quickly and effectively. That means students landing a job in fields that are hiring, they say.

“With these reforms, our nation’s colleges and universities can spend more time and effort on serving students and less time, energy, and money focused on bureaucratic compliance,” DeVos said in a statement.

Critics of the newly proposed rules say they would make it easier for shady colleges to operate for longer and with less federal oversight.

Many colleges are already doing a poor job of preparing students, said Clare McCann, of the think tank New America. Giving them more latitude under the guise of innovation may lead to students taking chances on junk programs, she argued.

“What these regulations really do is make it so it is much harder to hold those schools accountable,” McCann said.

If anything, the government should hold these agencies to a higher standard, she said.

The public has until July 12 to give feedback on the proposed changes. Here’s what you should know.

Did your college close? Why Brightwood College, Virginia College closed — and what students should do

What is accreditation?

To receive federal money, universities must meet the quality standards of an accrediting organization. According to the Education Department, these agencies ensure schools have “qualified instructors, an adequate curriculum, and necessary support services” for students. Translated, they’re meant to prevent students from ending up with worthless degrees.

Accreditation can essentially be seen as a seal of quality for students, the government and even future employers. And students atunaccredited colleges can’t access federal money in the form of student loans.

The government doesn’t directly accredit schools, but the Department of Education does decide who is and isn’t fit to be an accreditor. The new rules were agreed upon by department officials, accreditors, college leaders and students during several negotiation sessions.

What’s the Education Department trying to do?

Among the changes, the proposed rules would allow colleges to offer new programs with less scrutiny from accreditors. The idea is that colleges could see a hole in the workforce and quickly come up with a new degree or credential to fill it. Accrediting agencies and for-profit colleges like this proposed change.

Under the current rules, it may take months to make changes to a program’s curriculum, said Judith Eaton, president of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The group is made up of 3,000 colleges, and it focuses on accreditation issues. The new rules, she argued, would mean a less onerous process for accreditors when dealing with the federal government. And, she said, the new rules may make it so that universities feel free to experiment with, for example, new credentialing programs or increased online courses.

If a college or accrediting group abused the new rules, the Education Department should crack down quickly, she said.

What about colleges that fail?

Theproposed ruleswould also allow schools that have failed to meet accreditation standards up to four years to fix their issues — double the previous amount of two years. The rationale? These changes sometimes take a long time, and allowing the university to fix a problem may lead to more students graduating.

Closing an underperforming college right away, in contrast, may leave those students without an education and nowhere to go to finish their degree.

This is a change welcomed by Nicholas Kent, a vice president at Career Education Colleges and Universities, a group of for-profit colleges.

Critics have said this measure may allow bad colleges to do more damage, but Kent called that description “disingenuous,” saying different programs will have different needs. A nine-month certificate program, he said, will need less time to fix a problem compared with a 6-year-doctoral program.

And he said accreditors are not required to give four years to everyone. Instead, they have the discretion to do so, and they can set up other check-ins.

But allowing a bad institution to operate longer may mean more students attend the failing institution, wasting time and money. And it could cost taxpayers more money because the school could continue to get federal grants and loans, Antoinette Flores, an associate director at the liberal Center for American Progress, has argued.

Plus, she said, the proposed rules could make it easier for outside entities to buy failing colleges. The Department of Education wants to limit a new owner's liability.

“In practice, that means we’re never going to see any of these institutions going away,” Flores said. “That increases the likelihood we’re recycling failed, toxic assets in the system, and we’re never really getting rid of the lowest performances.”

House Republicans demand hearing after State Dept. cites 'multiple security incidents' under Clinton leadership,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-demand-hearing-after-state-dept-cites-multiple-security-incidents-under-clinton-leadership,"House Oversight Committee Republicans on Tuesday formally called for an immediate hearing on security breaches at the State Department during Hillary Clinton's leadership, after the department said Monday it had uncovered ""multiple security incidents"" involving more than a dozen employees.

In a letter to Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking committee Republicans Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows and Jody Hice said State Department officials conducting the ongoing security review into the matter should testify.

""We request a hearing to examine widespread security protocol breaches at the State Department concerning former Secretary Hillary Clinton’s private email server,"" the Republicans wrote. ""The unorthodox and unsecure arrangement she maintained exposed classified, national security and diplomatic-sensitive information to a myriad of risks and related issues.

'OMG': TOP HILLARY AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT EMAIL HACK ATTEMPT IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, FBI DOCS SHOW

""The wide-ranging fallout from these mishandling instances should not be minimized and obscured,"" they added.

On Monday, the State Department disclosed that it had identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's assistant secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and seven infractions. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said Tuesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should personally handle the probe into departmental misconduct.

""I love Mike Pompeo as the secretary of state,"" Chaffetz said. ""I have the greatest respect for him, he's got his very full plate, but he has to personally get involved with this. Some people should be fired, they should lose their security clearances and they should be in jail.""

The State Department, dubbing the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude its investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending, and that internal referrals have been made to State Department Human Resources and security officials, even where employees involved no longer work with the department.

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

Last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And this past March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said at the time, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""
Justice Dept review of intel in Russia probe fuels fears of politicization,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-review-of-intelligence-in-russia-probe-fuels-fears-of-politicization/,"A mix of concern, confusion and defiance has spread through elements of the intelligence community as a murky picture emerges of Attorney General William Barr's review of its investigative and analytical work on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In particular, current and former intelligence officials are questioning the purpose and propriety of the attorney general's intention, first reported by The New York Times, to enlist John Durham, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut, in scrutinizing the analytical judgments that led a group of agencies to conclude that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign to boost then-candidate Trump's electability.

That judgment, put forth in a declassified Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) commissioned by former president Barack Obama and released in January 2017, pooled the findings of the CIA, FBI and NSA. The CIA and FBI expressed ""high confidence"" in that conclusion, while the NSA had ""moderate confidence.""

""I see no problem with a DOJ review of whether the CIA and other intelligence community agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities related to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons – U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals,"" said Michael Morell, a former CIA deputy director who is a CBS News senior national security contributor. ""Having said that, I see a DOJ review of whether or not the intelligence analysts made the right call as wholly inappropriate. I cannot ever remember a DOJ review of analysis.""

""[Durham] and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis,"" Morell said. ""He and his team could well impose a law enforcement standard in coming to a conclusion — a much higher bar than exists in the intelligence community for analytic judgments.""

Both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have already examined the process by which the ICA was assembled and offered their declassified assessments.

In their March 2018 final report on Russia's active measures, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee — without describing what kind of evidence was examined — said ""most"" of the ICA's analysis ""held up to scrutiny."" But they criticized its judgment on Putin's strategic objectives for having ""failed to meet most of the analytic standards set forth in the primary guiding document for IC analysis."" (The committee's Democrats dissented from that view.)

That document – Intelligence Community Directive 203 – stipulates, among other things, that analytic products should be ""objective,"" ""timely,"" and ""independent of political consideration.""

But in July, the Senate Intelligence Committee — whose leadership has maintained a vastly more united and bipartisan front than the fractious panel in the House — issued a declassified summary of a months-long assessment that found the ICA to be a ""sound intelligence product."" The committee said it had reviewed ""thousands of pages of source documents and conducted interviews with all the relevant parties — including agency heads, managers, and line analysts — who were involved in developing the analysis and drafting the assessment.""

""In all the interviews of those who drafted and prepared the ICA, the Committee heard consistently that analysts were under no politically motivated pressure to reach any conclusions,"" the summary said. ""All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content, and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process.""

Analytical disagreement, the committee said, was ""reasonable, transparent, and openly debated.""

The Senate panel is expected to release a declassified version of a far more extensive report on the ICA in the coming months, though the bulk of their assessment is likely to remain classified.

Asked whether the Justice Department's review was duplicative of the panel's work, a spokeswoman for the Senate Intelligence Committee declined to comment.

Morell said a DOJ probe into analysts' conclusions could have a ""chilling effect"" on the analytic process.

""Any analyst asked to submit to an interview with Durham's investigators will want to have their own personal attorney at their side,"" he said. ""Imagine that — needing an attorney to explain an analytic judgment.""

""This will all be watched closely inside the IC and the prospect that DOJ prosecutors may ask questions about how an analyst came to a conclusion could well lead analysts to demur,"" Morell said.

A Democratic House Intelligence Committee official who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing, sensitive matters said the panel had engaged at multiple levels with multiple intelligence agencies and had ""heard a sense of anxiety"" and ""palpable unease.""

The official expressed concern that ""purposeful overreach"" by DOJ could undermine what have been shown to be sound conclusions, and that normal differences of opinion raised in the course of discussion that would go into crafting an analytical judgment could be exploited for political purposes.

In this case, the official said, in what could be a politically motivated effort to score-settle with former CIA Director John Brennan — has been sharply critical of President Trump — routine, healthy discussion could be cast as Brennan putting his thumb on the scale.

""There is no evidence that was the case. These assessments have withstood continued scrutiny for more than two years, and have only been buttressed by continued analysis and collection,"" the official said.

A spokesman for Mr. Brennan declined to comment. The CIA and NSA declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The House Intelligence Committee's Democratic chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said at the National Press Club this week that he had met personally with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, but the committee has otherwise had ""very little visibility"" into the scope and progress of the review. A Senate Intelligence Committee official also said that panel was in close communication with the intelligence community and similarly had not been offered details about the review beyond the contents of a letter the Department of Justice sent earlier this month.

In its letter, sent in response to an earlier inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee, DOJ indicated the review was ""broad in scope and multifaceted, and is intended to illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals."" It did not explicitly mention a review of analytic processes or the ICA itself."
"PolyMet, the EPA, and the accusations against the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, explained",https://www.minnpost.com,"['Walker Orenstein', 'About The Author']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.minnpost.com/environment/2019/06/polymet-the-epa-and-the-accusations-against-the-minnesota-pollution-control-agency-explained/,"In the last year, the company PolyMet has made large strides toward building Minnesota’s first copper-nickel mine by securing the state and federal permits needed to move ahead on the $1 billion project.

But as PolyMet marches toward construction, a critical state water permit issued is facing new questions — and a federal investigation. A swirl of leaked emails and newly released documents have drawn accusations that the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency hid serious concerns from the public and that career staff at the Environmental Protection Agency were pressured by political leaders to go easy on PolyMet.

The MPCA has denied the allegations in a series of sworn statements from current and former staff. Yet environmental advocacy organizations are using the developments to bolster a legal challenge to the permit, which argues that PolyMet could dangerously pollute the St. Louis River watershed, which drains into Lake Superior.

If built, PolyMet would tap into reserves of copper, nickel and other precious metals like cobalt in an open-pit mine near Hoyt Lakes. The company, which is owned in part by Switzerland’s Glencore, says the mine would create 360 direct jobs and another 1,000 indirect ones. PolyMet contends that new technology, water treatment and tough regulations can prevent environmental disasters that have occurred at copper mines around the globe.

Here’s what you need to know about the allegations against the MPCA and what they could mean for the project going forward:

What are the accusations?

Last week, the EPA released a set of written comments that outlined major concerns with a draft of the MPCA permit, known as a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit (NPDES), that was issued to PolyMet in December 2018.

In part, federal regulators worried it would allow pollution, violate the Clean Water Act and hinder lawsuits against the mining company if problems do happen. While the permit requires PolyMet to treat water and has a form of water quality limits, the EPA wrote those regulations weren’t enforceable by the federal government, the public and potentially by the MPCA.

On top of that, opponents of PolyMet argue that MPCA staff worked to ensure EPA comments were hidden from the public and court records. Paula Maccabee, counsel for WaterLegacy, an advocacy group suing to challenge PolyMet’s permit, says she learned the comments existed only after she requested records from the MPCA and through confidential sources in the federal government.

On April 5, the EPA read its comments over the phone to the MPCA staff, some of whom destroyed hand-written notes of the meeting. WaterLegacy obtained earlier notes from the MPCA that suggested EPA had concerns. Maccabee said she later learned through the EPA and sources about the official written comments.

Then, earlier this week, the union representing EPA employees in Minnesota released an email they say was obtained through an “anonymous leak.” The union contends the email shows former MPCA Assistant Commissioner Shannon Lotthammer pressuring EPA staff to suppress concerns by submitting them outside a public comment process.

In a May court statement, the MPCA said it “did not receive written comments from EPA, did not take efforts to keep EPA’s written comments out of the administrative record, or fail to disclose the existence of EPA comments.” The union argued this was a lie.

The EPA’s Office of the Inspector General launched an “audit” of the situation on June 12, says an announcement.

The MPCA maintains there is no scandal to the EPA’s comments and no cover up to suppress them. In filings to the Court of Appeals, the state agency says WaterLegacy is attacking “one aspect” of a lengthy collaborative process between the MPCA and the EPA.

The MPCA says virtually all of the EPA concerns were raised by others during the public-comment period for the permits, and that it has responded to all those concerns.

Richard Clark, supervisor of the MPCA’s metallic mining sector unit, said in a court declaration that the EPA had raised identical questions “throughout the permit-development process.” Those worries were recorded in other notes and submitted as part of the administrative record of the approval process, Clark said.

In other words, state regulators contend the April phone call with the EPA had no new information. As for the missing notes, Clark said the EPA “read their comments very quickly, and the concerns were all ones that we had heard before.” One staffer stopped taking notes throughout the call and said they weren’t helpful. Another said notes he took were discarded after he incorporated them into legal work exempt from disclosure.

Darin Broton, an MPCA spokesman, said his agency adjusted the permit in many cases but said there were other instances in which they disagreed with EPA concerns.

In the end, the EPA did not object or veto the final permit, Broton said. In a statement to the court, Jeffry Fowley, a former longtime EPA staffer who specialized in Clean Water Act regulations and worked part time for the Environmental Integrity Project in 2018, has argued many problems EPA had were not resolved. That includes the discharge limits.

Maccabee and Aaron Klemz, a spokesman for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, said the Trump administration’s business-friendly approach might be to blame. The MCEA is also suing over the water permit.

But Broton said he could assure the public PolyMet did not get let off easy.

“There are really high stringent water quality standards incorporated into PolyMet’s permit at the end of the day,” Broton said. “That’s part of the back and forth we had with the EPA is to make sure that there was tough enforceable language in the permit to make sure that the company is doing what it says it’s going to do. And if not we have a way to actually hold them accountable.”

So why did the MPCA ask the feds to wait until after the public comment process?

In a court filing, Lotthammer, the former MPCA assistant commissioner, said her agency was already planning to make changes to its draft permit after the public-comment period.

“Rather than have EPA send us written comments on the version of the permit that we knew we were going to change, we believed that it would be more efficient — both for us and for EPA — if EPA waited to give us any written comments based on the next draft, in which we had the opportunity to address concerns shared by the public,” Lotthammer said in her statement. Lotthammer is now at the DNR.

MPCA staff said the EPA decides itself whether to submit written comments at any point in the permitting process.

Why is this important?

The MPCA has not promised to reevaluate its PolyMet permit in any way. But the developments could help bolster the legal argument of WaterLegacy and MCEA that the water quality permit is inadequate.

Copper-nickel mining comes with risks that iron ore mining does not, which has made PolyMet controversial. The extraction process can create an acidic runoff and leach heavy metals into water. On its website, PolyMet says they will be “monitoring, collecting, controlling, recycling and eventually treating on-site water to meet water quality standards before it is discharged back into the environment.”

Environmental groups have had some success challenging controversial projects in court.

Recently, the Court of Appeals ruled an environmental review of a proposed oil pipeline known as Line 3 didn’t consider an oil spill in Lake Superior’s watershed. The MPCA and Department of Natural Resources said they wouldn’t take final action on pending permits for the Enbridge pipeline until the Public Utilities Commission addressed the court’s concern with the Environmental Impact Statement.

Klemz noted EPA comments have forced revisions from state regulators in the past and should be widely known.

Maccabee said the recent PolyMet revelations undermine the credibility of the MPCA and its permit, which could affect the court case. “Minnesotans tend to believe that we can trust our regulators, that they’re operating openly and fairly — and if they say a permit is good, we should trust them,” she said. “The way the permit was handled in this case benefits one party: And that’s PolyMet.”

So what happens now?

Water Legacy has asked the appeals court to send its lawsuit back to district court for more fact-finding about the EPA’s comments. If granted, that process could be lengthy, said Klemz, who compared it to a trial. He speculated it could bring testimony from former MPCA chief John Linc Stine and others.

The court has not asked PolyMet to suspend its work toward building the mine, however. PolyMet says it is preparing the construction site, which includes renovations on a former LTV Steel taconite plant.

The MPCA has also promised to work on being more transparent in the future.

In a written statement, commissioner Laura Bishop said she was starting “an agency-wide assessment” to “improve accessibility” for those following major permits.

“This will include an openness for oral written comments from any person or organization during our permitting and rule-making processes as well as other times that stakeholders wish to engage with our agency,” Bishop said. “The MPCA will also improve documentation of, and public access to, communications that form the record of agency actions.”"

Officially, she’s only supposed to stay on the line with you for two minutes, taking notes that will be passed on to her supervisor and maybe even the Oval Office. Most of the callers these days are phoning in to compliment President Trump.

“Well, most of them love him, so when they call they’re telling you that they really enjoy him,” she says. But sometimes, if a caller is mad about an issue or just annoyed about sitting on hold, Griffin will allow them to go on for more than the allotted time. “If I see that they need help with something, I’ll let them talk longer. And sometimes you can calm people down by helping. I have had them tell me, ‘You have helped me so much, and I am so happy that I got you.’ It’s a huge compliment.”

In a city bitterly divided along partisan lines, Griffin is absolutely nonpolitical and insistently optimistic. She’s worked for four presidents and thinks it’s a privilege to be part of history, whoever is in office.

“You meet different people from all over the world,” she says. “And it was so nice to know and hear what they had to say and how wonderful they thought it was. You know, there’s nothing like being in the White House. Really.”

Griffin was born on Dec. 18, 1919, and has spent her entire life in Washington. The fifth of six children, she grew up in Southwest and decided she was going to be a teacher when she was in fourth grade.

“I loved my elementary school teachers,” she says. “We had penmanship teachers when I was coming along and my teacher would allow me to do her roll book. And I said, ‘Oh, that’s nice of you.’ Ever since I wanted to be a teacher.”

There was a stint working for the Department of the Army during World War II, a few years at Howard University studying for her master’s in education, then a career as a teacher and an assistant principal in D.C. public schools, plus marriage and three kids.

It was, she says, a good life. Retirement, however, was not what she expected. Griffin was — well, let’s just say it — a little bored.

She ran a small catering business, took a calligraphy class at Catholic University, did a lot of puzzles. In 1993, when the Washington Calligraphers Guild announced that the White House needed more volunteers, Griffin raised her hand.

Apart from the West Wing political operatives who get so much media attention and then move on, the White House relies on lifelong employees and unpaid volunteers who do the behind-the-scenes work that ensures the executive mansion remains an American landmark. It’s a calling, more patriotic than partisan, and Griffin was thrilled to be part of it.

She showed up three or four days a week; she was so good that her supervisors vied to keep her in their offices.

Her first assignment was reading mail, not using her gorgeous handwriting. She worked on inaugurations, the annual Christmas tours, Easter Egg Rolls. She addressed greeting cards and other correspondence. The only thing she didn’t enjoy much was taking RSVPs for state dinners, where she discovered a little something about ambitious people.

“Sometimes they will do anything to get what they want,” she explains with just the slightest wrinkle of her nose. “And they’ll argue with you to get what they want.”

Along the way, she met Bill Clinton and George W. Bush but not Barack Obama or — so far — Trump. Because much of the volunteer work involves the East Wing, she has photos with Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump.

Does she have a favorite president? “I can’t say that I did. I really can’t because I like them all.” Bill Clinton (spoiler alert) was chatty. Loved to talk to everyone. Loved to talk to the volunteers. And especially loved to talk to Griffin.

Eventually, she landed in the call center taking comments and discovered that all those years as a teacher were great preparation for that job.

What happens in the call center stays in the call center. The public comment line (202-456-1111) is staffed by volunteers who are sworn to keep the specific comments private. But most are reacting to current events: “Anything that they hear on the television or things that are happening,” Griffin says. “Mainly, that’s what they’re interested in.”

Before social media made it as easy to tweet at the president, calling was the preferred way for the public to share messages with the commander in chief. But even now, the lines never stop ringing, and people sometimes wait up to 30 minutes to make their feelings known.

Griffin believes it’s important that someone answers those calls: “Those people would not be able to express themselves if the volunteers weren’t answering those telephones.”

On Sept. 11, 2001, Griffin was in the call center at 9 that morning when a woman called.

“She was screaming and crying. I said, ‘I can’t understand what you’re saying.’ And she got herself together. She said, ‘A plane just hit the World Trade building.’ ”

The Secret Service ordered everyone to evacuate; the streets were filled with people trying to get a cell signal. There were rumors a plane was headed for the White House. It is the only sad memory she has of working there.

But Griffin returned the following Monday, a moment captured by a Reuters photographer as President Bush welcomed her and other volunteers back to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.

“He was so happy that we came,” she says. Not every volunteer returned, but Griffin says she wasn’t afraid to go back. She figured it would not happen a second time.

The years have flown by; Griffin gave up some of her duties because they required so much standing. She’s now the oldest volunteer, a title that her colleagues don’t let her forget, and spends every Monday working the phones.

But at home she is surrounded by the White House every day. Official Easter eggs line her mantel and four presidential talking dolls sit in front of the fireplace. The living room desk holds photos of Griffin and the historic figures she has served, and her scrapbooks are filled with White House Christmas cards, programs from state visits and letters from presidents wishing her a “Happy Birthday” — the latest from Trump with his distinctive signature slashed across the bottom.

“I am inspired by the strength and selflessness you have exhibited throughout your life, and I am grateful for your more than 25 years of volunteer service at the White House. Thank you for your tireless dedication to helping ensure that the voices of the American people are heard.”

A lovely sentiment. He may even drop by the call center one of these Mondays."
"10-year Treasury yield drops as low as 1.97%, first time below 2% since November 2016",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"A chart showing the U.S. 10-year treasury yield below 2% as of 11:49 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate , that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016 on Wednesday — breaching a key psychological level — after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

At around 11:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, declined below 2% to 1.9821% — around its lowest levels since November 2016. The yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.7209%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.175%, as of 7:30 p.m. ET.

While stock investors and home buyers may initially cheer the drop in the benchmark for corporate bond and mortgage rates, the return to levels not seen in more than two years raises serious questions about the state of the economy.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report — which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions — and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities — bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices — show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Trump also said Tuesday he will be having an ""extended meeting"" next week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy in the coming months if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

Ginnie Mae removes loanDepot's VA loan restrictions,https://www.housingwire.com,"['Ben Lane Is The Editor For Housingwire. In This Role', 'He Helps Set A Leading Pace For News Coverage Spanning The Issues Driving The U.S. Housing Economy', ""Helps Guide Housingwire'S Overall Direction. Previously"", 'He Worked For Townsquarebuzz', 'A Hyper-Local News Service. He Is A Graduate Of University Of North Texas.']",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49393-ginnie-mae-removes-loandepots-va-loan-restrictions,"After nearly six months of being restricted from participating in some of Ginnie Mae’s mortgage bond programs as part of the agency’s crackdown on lenders for Department of Veterans Affairs loan churning, loanDepot is back in the game.

Ginnie Mae announced Friday that it has removed the mortgage bond restrictions it placed on loanDepot earlier this year.

Back in January, Ginnie Mae limited loanDepot to Ginnie Mae II custom pools for VA single-family guaranteed loans after the agency found that loanDepot’s prepayment speeds on VA loans may have been out of sync with the rest of the industry.

The government’s investigation into VA loan churning began nearly two years ago when the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Ginnie Mae, and the VA began looking into whether certain lenders are aggressively targeting service members and military veterans for quick and potentially risky refinances of their mortgages.

The investigation led to some lenders being booted from Ginnie Mae’s primary mortgage securities platforms, and other lenders, like loanDepot, being restricted for questionable conduct.

Ginnie Mae, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is a mortgage bond issuer, but focuses specifically on securitizing pools of government-backed mortgages insured by the VA, the Federal Housing Administration, and other agencies, so issues related to refinancing VA loans would affect Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities.

But now, loanDepot has apparently addressed its practices and Ginnie Mae is satisfied that the lender has things under control.

Therefore, loanDepot is now allowed to participate in the Ginnie Mae I and Ginnie Mae II multi-issuer securities programs.

“The removal of such a restriction is based on the Issuer having demonstrated to Ginnie Mae’s satisfaction that (a) its prepayment speeds are substantially in-line with those of equivalent multi-Issuer cohorts, and (b) such improved performance is sustainable,” the agency said in a statement.

According to the agency, loanDepot is eligible to participate in all bond programs for loans effective for July 1, 2019, issuance.

""While we were disappointed with Ginnie’s original decision, we have partnered with Ginnie Mae in an open and transparent fashion to be able to return to full participation in multiple issuer pools,"" loanDepot Chief Capital Markets Officer Jeff DerGurahian said in a statement. ""However, most importantly, despite the restrictions, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to serve the Veteran community and have never wavered in proudly serving United States Veterans fairly and responsibly.""

U.S. has no plans to cap H-1B work visa program: State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-india-visas/us-has-no-plans-to-cap-h-1b-work-visa-program-state-department-idUSKCN1TL2VL,"FILE PHOTO: A man holds flags of India and the U.S. while people take part in the 35th India Day Parade in New York, U.S. August 16, 2015. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has no plans to cap H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally, the State Department said on Thursday.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the United States had told India it was considering restricting the H-1B visa programs for countries with the data storage requirement. The H-1B program issues U.S. visas to skilled foreign workers.

“The Trump Administration has no plans to place caps on H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally,” a State Department spokeswoman said in a statement in response to the Reuters article.

While an administration’s “Buy American Hire American” executive order calls for a broad review of U.S. worker visa programs, including the H-1B program, it was not targeted at a specific country, the spokeswoman said.

It is “completely separate from our ongoing discussions with India about the importance of ensuring the free flow of data across borders,” the spokeswoman added.

Earlier on Thursday, India said it was in talks with the United States on H-1B visas, but foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar told a news conference: “We have not heard anything officially from the U.S. government” on capping such permits for Indians.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to visit New Delhi next week for talks that will include areas of disagreement between the two countries over trade.

Two senior Indian officials told Reuters on Wednesday they had been briefed last week on a U.S. plan to cap the number of H-1B visas given annually to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the total number issued.

There is no country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas the United States issues every year, and an estimated 70% of them go to Indians."
Chaos within the EPA exposes Americans to toxins like asbestos,https://thehill.com,[],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/449756-chaos-within-the-epa-exposes-americans-to-toxins-like-asbestos,"Three years ago, there was bipartisan euphoria when President Obama signed the Frank L. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (LCSA) into law. The updated Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) finally gave the EPA regulatory authority to protect Americans from dangerous toxic substances like asbestos, a known human carcinogen. During the pen signing ceremony, Obama said the much-needed legislation was a crucial step forward, remarking, ""The [old] system was so complex, it was so burdensome that our country hasn't even been able to uphold a ban on asbestos.""

The ongoing battle for chemical safety reform continues.

Met with confrontation, Pruitt’s regulatory rollbacks and ethics violations forced him to resign 12 months after his Senate confirmation. Pruitt wasn’t alone. Many who formerly worked at American Chemistry Council (ACC) now hold high-level EPA positions. Most notably, Nancy Beck, was selected to head the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP). Overseeing the toxic chemical unit, Beck carried out Trump’s seeming pro-industry agenda. The revolving doors continue as Beck now heads to the White House's National Economic Council.

The EPA attempted to ban asbestos in 1989, but was sued by Corrosion Proof Fittings, a company that used asbestos in their products. In 1991, an appeals court overturned the ban, resulting in a failure to ban the deadly chemical through TSCA.

Nearly 70 countries have already banned asbestos, but sadly, three years after Obama signed LCSA into law, U.S. asbestos imports, use, and deaths continue. Each year, nearly 40,000 Americans die from preventable asbestos-caused diseases such as lung cancer, mesothelioma, cancer of the larynx and ovary and asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs). For each life lost, a shattered family is left behind.

For more than a century, asbestos has been confirmed to cause suffering and deaths. The EPA has failed to protect public health and the environment by banning asbestos. Without a ban, asbestos remains lethal and legal today and can be found in consumer products, cosmetics, automotive products, and building materials.

The chlor-alkali industry is the primary asbestos importer and user of raw asbestos for the manufacturing of industrial chlorine and caustic soda. Knowing that there is no safe or controlled use, it’s incredulous that asbestos imports actually surged last year. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the chlor-alkali industry imported 750 metric tons of raw asbestos from Brazil and Russia.

The late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) fought hard for meaningful chemical reform, and TSCA is on track to fail, again. The EPA’s present asbestos evaluation excludes the risk of asbestos in millions of homes, schools, and offices. Furthermore, industry-friendly rules like the “significant new use” rule (SNUR) is just another attempt to negate asbestos risk.

Trump has long been fascinated with asbestos, and said once on Twitter, “If we didn't remove incredibly powerful fire retardant asbestos & replace it with junk that doesn't work, the World Trade Center would never have burned down.”

Last summer, ADAO discovered that Uralasbest, a Russian asbestos company, placed a seal with Trump’s face on their product with the note ""Approved by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.""

"Shanahan’s departure leaves Pentagon adrift, with a growing power vacuum and Pompeo as de facto defense secretary",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/shanahans-departure-leaves-pentagon-adrift-with-a-growing-power-vacuum-and-pompeo-as-de-facto-defense-secretary,"SHANAHAN SHOCKER: The question of why Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and not acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan was meeting with top commanders at the headquarters of U.S. Central Command yesterday became clear as the day wore on and news broke that Shanahan would be stepping down amid questions about his handling of domestic violence incidents in his family.

The episodes from 2010 and 2011 came under scrutiny during a routine FBI background check and prompted Shanahan to withdraw his nomination to head the Pentagon and announce his intention to resign as deputy defense secretary, effective Sunday.

“After having been confirmed for Deputy Secretary less than two years ago, it is unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way in the course of this process,” Shanahan said in a statement . “I believe my continuing in the confirmation process would force my three children to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life and reopen wounds we have worked years to heal. Ultimately, their safety and well-being is my highest priority. I would welcome the opportunity to be Secretary of Defense, but not at the expense of being a good father.”

THE SAD SAGA: Shanahan described his painful divorce in 2010, in which his wife was accused of assaulting him, and an even more serious assault in 2011 by his then-17-year-old son William, who hit Shanahan’s ex-wife with a baseball bat, in a detailed account he gave the Washington Post.

Shanahan’s efforts to defend his son, and initially portray his assault on his mother as self-defense, were particularly problematic, and Shanahan expressed regret in his interview with the Post. “I have never believed Will’s attack on his mother was an act of self-defense or justified,” he said. “I don’t believe violence is appropriate ever, and certainly never any justification for attacking someone with a baseball bat.”

“Bad things can happen to good families ... and this is a tragedy, really,” Shanahan said. Dredging up the episode publicly, he told the Post, “will ruin my son’s life.”

A GROWING VACUUM: “Shanahan rose to acclaim as the defense industry's ‘Mr. Fix-It,’ but a Pentagon facing the threat of war with Iran, missile testing in North Korea, and aggressive behavior from Russia won't benefit from his problem-solving skills,” writes Russ Read in the Washington Examiner.

Army Secretary Mark Esper, who has been drafted to take over for Shanahan, is now getting a crash course on all the problems that will be his come Monday. As Army secretary, Esper was the civilian in charge of training and equipping the Army but not involved in issues such as Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan, ISIS, and nuclear weapons policy.

Esper, a combat veteran of the 1991 Persian Gulf War and West Point classmate of Pompeo, will be thrust into the job at a time U.S. allies are unsure who speaks for America on important policies, such as isolating Iran.

The Pentagon is reeling from a leadership vacuum, with many top jobs, including defense secretary, deputy defense secretary, Air Force secretary, and Army secretary, all filled by deputies in an acting capacity.

CONGRESS FRUSTRATED: The consistent message from congressional leaders is that the Pentagon can’t be allowed to languish without a solid leader.

“However well-qualified Secretary Esper may be, it is critical that the president nominate, and that the Senate confirm, a permanent secretary of defense as quickly as possible,” said Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. “The uncertainty surrounding this vacant office encourages our enemies and unsettles our allies.”

“As I’ve said before, for the sake of our national security, we need a confirmed secretary of defense — not just an acting — and I hope we can get to that point as quickly as possible,” said James Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

JUMPED, NOT PUSHED: In an exchange with reporters yesterday, President Trump insisted it was Shanahan who decided it was time to step aside. “I didn't ask him to withdraw, but he walked in this morning, he said it's going to be a rough time for him because of obviously what happened,” Trump said. “He presented me with a letter this morning. That was his decision.”

But in an interview with the Washington Examiner, Inhofe seemed to indicate Shanahan was given little choice but to submit his resignation.

HAPPENING TODAY: Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford, who retires at the end of the summer, will discuss “military strategy and leadership” with David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-executive chairman of the Carlyle Group, at a Council on Foreign Relations event at 6:30 tonight.

Dunford put out a statement this morning saying it has been an honor to serve with Shanahan. “On behalf of the Joint Staff, we thank him for the steadfast leadership he provided to our men and women in uniform and to our great nation,” Dunford said. “My staff and I will continue to support him and his successor through the pending transition as we continue to confront the national security challenges facing our country.""

THE DE FACTO DEFENSE SECRETARY: Mike Pompeo, who as secretary of state is not in the military chain of command, is clearly performing the primary functions that would normally be handled by the Pentagon, including providing guidance to military commanders.

Pompeo was at the headquarters of U.S. Central Command to confer with Gen. Frank McKenzie and Special Operations Command head Gen. Richard Clarke about plans for deterring Iran and responding with military force if necessary.

“The responsibility for diplomacy achieving the strategic outcomes that President Trump has sent forth falls on all of us, but the State Department has the first oar in the water on that,” Pompeo told reporters after his meetings. “President Trump does not want war, and we will continue to communicate that message while doing the things that are necessary to protect American interests in the region.”

A STUDY IN CONTRASTS: The contrast between the departments of defense and state couldn’t be more stark. The State Department appears to be a fully functional agency, with a leader who travels the globe and appears regularly in public and on network television to forcefully support President Trump’s policies.

Pompeo does radio interviews, briefs reporters from the podium at the State Department, and is backed by a spokesperson who conducts regular media briefings.

The Pentagon has no briefings, no representative to the media, and even when it had a confirmed defense secretary in Jim Mattis, the department kept a low profile, taking a back seat in major policy debates. Under Trump, it would appear the Pentagon’s role is to carry out the president’s prerogatives, not to try too hard to shape how he exercises them.

CREDIBILITY GAP: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., says while the evidence is strong that Tehran was behind the recent attack on two oil tankers, the Trump administration is facing a credibility problem of its own trying to persuade reluctant allies to join the U.S. “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.

“Now when you have Iran engaged in these provocative and belligerent acts attacking shipping, we can't find our allies anywhere. They're worried about this administration rushing to war. They don't have trust in the administration. The administration has ignored their warnings,” Schiff told CNN yesterday.

“And so here you have dangerous and bad actions by Iran, which is a uniquely malevolent actor. We ought to be working in concert with our allies. And yet Secretary Pompeo is still struggling to even persuade them about Iranian actions,” he said. “And this is the problem when you attack your allies and you criticize them, when you don't even consult with them on important actions.”

Both Germany and the U.K. have now said publicly they believe Iran was behind the attacks on commercial shipping. “We'll continue to provide additional information about those attacks,” Pompeo said. “But we shouldn't focus on just those two attacks. Since the beginning of May, there are now over a half-dozen different instances of Iranian attacks in the region.”

A CRIMINAL COVER-UP?: Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked the question that sprang to a lot of minds when the revelations about Patrick Shanahan’s family problems came to light, namely: How did the violent incidents not come up during Shanahan’s confirmation as deputy defense secretary?

""I feel that there was possibly a deliberate concealment here,"" Blumenthal said after Shanahan announced his resignation. ""I think there ought to be an investigation by the IG and the Department of Defense. There is absolutely no reason for the failure to disclose to the Armed Services Committee as a part of our process that there was something in this nominee’s past, Patrick Shanahan's past, that was deliberately concealed or mistakenly covered up.""

""The nominee was under an obligation to reveal it himself, and this is potentially a violation of criminal law because lying to the Armed Services Committee, not to mention the president if he failed to mention it there, is a violation of criminal law.""

VA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides,https://thehill.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/449444-va-chief-pressed-on-efforts-to-prevent-veteran-suicides,"Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie Robert Leon WilkieOvernight Health Care: Court allows Trump abortion referral ban to take effect | GOP group launches M blitz against 'Medicare for All' | Star GOP lawyer raises constitutional concerns with surprise billing legislation VA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides VA bans smoking, vaping at its hospitals MORE told lawmakers his agency is stepping up efforts to prevent veteran suicides during testimony before a Senate panel Wednesday.

Wilkie testified before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing, where he was pressed on efforts the Trump administration is taking to address what many have called a growing epidemic of suicide among former military servicemembers.

Wilkie said the issue called for a collaborative approach across government.

""Suicide is a national public health issue that affects communities everywhere. Just as there is no single cause of suicide, no single organization can end veteran suicide,"" Wilkie said in his remarks provided to the panel.

""We must work side-by-side with our partners at all levels of government and in the private sector to provide our veterans with the mental health and suicide prevention services they need.""

Wilkie highlighted the problem of firearm-related suicides, which he said accounted for 70 percent of veteran suicides. And he said officials would do more to prevent such deaths.

“The goal is to build time and space between the impulse to harm oneself and the act,” the secretary said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed Wilkie on that promise.

“The time and space between someone who overdoses on prescription drugs, you have hours,"" Blumenthal said. ""For someone who uses a gun, you have no time.”

Wilkie told the senator he was open to look at legislation that would take guns away from people if a judge deems those individuals a threat.

Wilkie said education was an important aspect as well, noting that more must be done to talk to servicemembers about mental health issues and to train those in the military from the start of basic training to recognize warning signs of mental illness and depression.

“Educating family members is absolutely key in things as simple as gun storage,” he added.

Lawmakers from both parties said officials must do more on suicide prevention.

Testifying alongside Wilkie was Dr. Keita Franklin, the executive director of the Suicide Prevention Program at the Veterans Health Administration.

Isakson asked Franklin about veteran suicide prevention hotlines. Franklin said the help offered over the hotlines had improved and veterans are now able to receive same-day support.

Wilkie added that the average wait time for callers is 8 seconds and there are no voicemail boxes."

The State Department headquarters in Washington in March 2009. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)

Columnist

The State Department official in charge of U.S. arms control negotiations with Moscow and her husband had a years-long friendship with GOP operative Paul Erickson, the former boyfriend of convicted unregistered Russian agent Maria Butina — ties this official did not disclose to her superiors or to Congress during her confirmation process in the spring of 2018.

Erickson officiated the June 2017 wedding of Andrea Thompson, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, and David Gillian, a former senior Australian army officer, three administration officials and Erickson’s lawyer have confirmed. At the time, Thompson was serving as national security adviser to Vice President Pence. Four months before the wedding, Gillian had transferred Erickson $100,000, which federal officials allege Erickson stole from Gillian, FBI and court documents show. Thompson never disclosed these ties to her superiors until approached this week by this columnist, the three administration officials said.

The wedding took place about six months before Erickson and Butina were publicly identified as being connected to Russian influence operations inside the United States. But by the time of Thompson’s confirmation, allegations of the couple’s influence activities had been widely reported.

Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told me that his panel will investigate Thompson’s lack of disclosure to both Congress and the FBI.

“These reports about Under Secretary Thompson raise questions about how forthcoming she was with all relevant information during her confirmation process,” Menendez said. “I hope that any relevant connections implicating financial interests, or to someone who our government has charged with being an agent of a foreign power, would have been fully reviewed and vetted by the FBI during the security clearance process, and disclosed to the Foreign Relations Committee. It is not clear that happened.”

Thompson’s failure to disclose her contacts and her husband’s business dealings with Erickson is viewed inside the administration as a serious lack of judgment — considering that her former boss, then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, was fired for lying about his contacts with Russian officials.

Several administration officials told me Thompson should have disclosed these connections voluntarily, since she holds top security clearances and has worked for decades as a U.S. intelligence officer. Her failure to report this information, these officials suggested, represented an intelligence vulnerability that could have been used against her.

“When the person who marries you gets into trouble with the Russians and your job is to negotiate with the Russians, you have to disclose that,” a senior administration official told me. “Everybody with an intelligence clearance knows that.”

Butina attended the Thompson-Gillian wedding in South Dakota as Erickson’s guest, according to Erickson’s lawyer, William Hurd. Butina did not have significant interactions with either Thompson or Gillian at the wedding, beyond greetings and congratulations, Hurd told me.

“Paul Erickson had known Andrea Thompson and David Gillian for years. He considered them both friends and agreed to officiate at their wedding in 2017,” Hurd told me. “Maria Butina came to the wedding because Paul Erickson was dating her. If Paul had been dating a different woman, then that woman would have come to the wedding.”

The State Department declined to comment on the record. Thompson, through a State Department spokesperson, also declined to comment. Butina’s lawyer declined to comment. Gillian and the McChrystal Group, the consulting firm where he now works, did not respond to requests for comment.

As a career intelligence officer, Thompson would have been required under updated executive branch regulations to self-report any significant unofficial contacts with a foreign national or any attempt by a foreign national to gain influence.

There is no evidence to suggest Thompson or Gillian had significant interactions with Butina outside the wedding, either. Sources close to Thompson told me that Erickson had known the Thompson family for many years in South Dakota.

Thompson is not alleged to have been involved in her husband’s business dealings with Erickson. Additionally, there is no evidence Thompson was deliberately untruthful to her bosses, federal investigators or congressional officials during her vetting or confirmation process, which took place from late 2017 until her confirmation on April 26, 2018.

In December 2017, after Thompson had left the vice president’s office and was working at the State Department before being nominated for her current role, the New York Times revealed that Erickson had emailed top Trump campaign officials in May 2016 offering to set up a high-level back channel with the Russian government led by President Vladimir Putin.

Under the subject line “Kremlin Connection,” Erickson proposed that Trump could “make first contact” with “President Putin’s emissary” at an upcoming event hosted by the National Rifle Association, of which Erickson was a long-time member. The planned meeting did not take place, according to the Times.

But according to federal prosecutors, this was just one of a series of actions Erickson took in cooperation with Butina to make connections in Republican political circles and set up meetings for Alexander Torshin, who was then a deputy governor of the Russian central bank.

In July 2018, the Justice Department unveiled a criminal complaint against Butina, charging her with “conspiracy to act as an agent of the Russian Federation within the United States without prior notification to the Attorney General.” In an accompanying affidavit, the FBI claimed that ""U.S. Person 1,"" whom several reports have identified as Erickson, worked closely with Butina to build her influence inside the United States and “advance the interests of the Russian Federation.”

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has opened an investigation into Butina, Torshin and their activities inside the United States. The FBI is also reportedly investigating whether Torshin helped funnel Russian money through the NRA to help the Trump campaign.

Erickson has never been charged with any crime related to Butina, Torshin or the NRA. In February, he was indicted in a seemingly unrelated matter, accused by federal prosecutors of defrauding dozens of investors related to a plan to build retirement facilities and housing for oil workers in North Dakota. According to an April 2018 FBI affidavit in that case, one of Erickson’s last investors was Gillian.

“Erickson told David Gillian he would receive a return of between 25 percent and 75 percent within approximately one year,” the affidavit alleges.

“In reality, the bank records indicated that Gillian’s $100,000 was not invested in real estate or anything else,” the affidavit continues. “In fact, that money was used to pay routine expenses and to pay off a previous investor, Congressman Marshall Sanford. Some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina.”

The criminal complaint against Erickson alleges he wired more than $20,000 to American University, where Butina was studying, three months after taking Gillian’s money. Gillian is now suing Erickson in civil court in South Dakota regarding the investment. Hurd, Erickson’s lawyer, has previously called the fraud charges against Erickson “unfounded.”

To be clear, Thompson’s connections with Erickson are not a crime and Erickson is innocent until proven guilty. Gillian is not accused of wrongdoing and is allegedly a victim of Erickson.

Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Thompson’s situation was symptomatic of larger staffing issues plaguing the Trump administration.

“From clumsy vetting to chronic failure to fill vacant positions, it’s no wonder there’s such dysfunction in the executive branch,” Engel said. “The White House needs to get its act together to make sure the officials in charge of protecting our national security meet the highest standards and comply fully with all laws and regulations on disclosure.”

US Treasury yields fall for the week after Fed signals possible cut ahead,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/us-treasury-yields-higher-amid-tensions-with-iran.html,"U.S. government debt yields posted weekly losses Friday after many investors took the Federal Reserve policy announcement earlier in the week as a sign the central bank could cut rates in the coming months.

Though yields rose on the week's final day of trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note posted a 4-basis-point decline for the week as it hovered around 2.06%. The 10-year yield fell below 2% for the first time since 2016 on Thursday.

The 2-year Treasury note yield rose slightly on Friday to about 1.76%.

Bond yields, which move inversely to price, have been under pressure since Fed struck a dovish tone in its June policy statement on Wednesday. At the time, Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for looser policy had improved.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" he said.

While Fed officials voted to maintained its target overnight lending rate, eight members showed that they'd be in favor of cutting rates this year, while the same number voted in favor of the status quo.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped ""patient"" from its statement and acknowledged that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective."
E.P.A. Finalizes Its Plan to Replace Obama-Era Climate Rules,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html,"The new rule, which is expected to come into effect within 30 days, assumes that the forces of the market will guide the country to a future of cleaner energy by naturally phasing out coal over time. It imposes only modest requirements on coal plants.

While it instructs states to reduce emissions, the new measure sets no targets. Instead, it lets states decide how much carbon reduction they consider reasonable and suggests ways to improve efficiency at individual power plants.

Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell, said he thought the current Supreme Court would be skeptical of any presidential effort to regulate carbon emissions under existing law.

“I t will establish what the E.P.A. can and can’t do,” Mr. Holmstead said of the new Trump rule. “I think it really will tie the hands of future administrations.”

Environmental groups say the Trump rule will slow the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at a time when scientists warn that countries must rapidly decarbonize to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, including heat waves, extreme storms, droughts and floods.

Mr. Wheeler has said the Trump administration’s plan is legally sound, will not damage the economy and will still go a long way toward reducing carbon .

He maintained that, when the new measure is fully implemented, it will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by 34 percent below 2005 levels, roughly equal to the goals of the Clean Power Plan."
EXCLUSIVE: Justice Department concerned about conditions at South Fulton jail,https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/local/justice-department-concerned-about-conditions-south-fulton-jail/vv0W2rbvsgamQUX0rNxCSK/,"The U.S. Justice Department has weighed in on a lawsuit alleging deplorable conditions for mentally ill female inmates at a south Fulton County jail.

In a court filing on Thursday, U.S. Attorney BJay Pak and lawyers from the civil rights division in Washington alerted a federal judge in Atlanta to recent Justice Department positions concerning the constitutional requirements for housing prisoners with serious mental illness.

The motion — called a “statement of interest” — was filed in a case that demands improved conditions at the South Fulton Municipal Regional Jail in Union City. The suit, filed in April, said mentally ill women are being held in isolation under horrific conditions that increase their risk of serious psychological harm.

It was filed on behalf of two women, identified as M.J. and K.H., and the Georgia Advocacy Office, which protects the rights of people with disabilities.

The Justice Department’s filing alerted U.S. District Court Judge Billy Ray to the civil rights division’s lengthy investigation of the Hampton Roads Regional Jail in Portsmouth, Va. That probe, concluded in December, found the jail failed to provide adequate medical and mental health care to inmates and that prisoners were unconstitutionally held in restrictive conditions for prolonged periods of time.

Atlanta lawyer Joe Whitley, a former U.S. attorney here, called the Justice Department’s entry into the Atlanta case a potentially significant development.

“This is not something they ordinarily would do,” Whitley said. “Apparently they’ve seen things that caused them concern. The role of the civil rights division and the Department of Justice is often necessary to assure that people who are confined are treated in a manner consistent with the Constitution.”

Sarah Geraghty, a lawyer for the Southern Center for Human Rights, welcomed the Justice Department’s interest in the case.

The lawsuit includes graphic photos from a recent visit to the jail — among them this one — and details unimaginable conditions for the women detainees. Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution

“The fact that it chose to weigh in shows the gravity of the human rights violations at issue,” said Geraghty, who represents the female inmates. “The conditions being challenged in this case are strikingly similar to those found to violate federal law at the Hampton Roads jail.”

Some of the mentally ill women at the Union City jail have been found incompetent to stand trial for their alleged offenses. M.J., for example, was arrested in October for criminal trespass while proselytizing at The Mall West End. The 20-year-old woman has been unable to post $500 bond.

The lawsuit against the Union City jail included graphic photos of unsanitary jail cells and detailed grim conditions for the women detainees. The conditions “can result in dramatic worsening of symptoms, decompensation, psychosis, self-mutilation and suicide,” the suit said.

Some inmates at the South Fulton Municipal Regional Jail use their issued bedding to soak up water that floods the cell floors, according to a federal lawsuit filed in April by the Georgia Advocacy Office and two women being held there. Inmates who use their bedding to clean up flooding are left with no sheets or blankets to sleep on, the lawsuit says. This image is included in the federal lawsuit. Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution

In recent court filings, Fulton County attorneys say plaintiffs M.J. and K.H. and other inmates “present unique security concerns as a result of their psychiatric disabilities.”

“(Their) disruptive, if not violent, behavior and their significant hygiene concerns dictate that their time outside their cells must be limited,” the county said. “The penological interests of safety and security for M.J. and K.H. and their fellow inmates, the staff and the general public who visit the jail dictate the amount of time inmates spend in their cells.”

The county has asked Ray to dismiss the lawsuit and to deny an injunction sought by the plaintiffs’ lawyers that says the women inmates should be allowed to spend four hours a day outside their cells, including one hour of outdoor time.

In a recent court filing, the plaintiffs’ lawyers included a sworn statement by their forensic psychiatry expert, Jeffrey Metzner, a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

The south Fulton Jail’s so-called mental health pods are essentially solitary confinement units that warehouse the female detainees, he said. “Such warehousing, in conditions of confinement that include very little out-of-cell time, results in many of these detainees’ mental illnesses either deteriorating or not improving despite such illnesses being very treatable in an appropriate setting.”

The VA is improving because it's using more private healthcare,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-va-is-improving-because-its-using-more-private-healthcare,"Recently, the battle over the future of veterans healthcare increased in intensity because arguably the two most prominent politicians in the country weighed in on the issue, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and President Trump.

At a town hall in April, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Trump administration’s efforts to expand healthcare choice for veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs and said in regards to the VA that “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It isn’t surprising that Ocasio-Cortez would vigorously defend the VA while attacking reforms meant to give veterans more private healthcare options. Many of her ideological partners, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., consider the VA a model government-run healthcare system and a positive example of “socialism in action.”

A week later, Trump responded to Ocasio-Cortez with a tweet that seemingly agreed with her assertion that the VA is performing well. Underlying his tweet was the implication that the uptick in performance is due to legislation he signed into law that increased choice for veterans and accountability for VA employees — bills Ocasio-Cortez and her allies have criticized.

This exchange between the president and AOC predictably set off a debate about who was right and who was wrong about the VA. Unfortunately, in a world of 280-character tweets and cable news segments that are clipped and shared without context, it is difficult to convey a nuanced position about any public policy issue, including the future of the VA. The reality is the VA is neither completely fixed nor completely broken but is instead an institution at a crossroads with an opportunity to break the cycle of reform and failure that has plagued it since its inception. This is especially true with the recent launch of the Veterans Community Care Program which, if properly implemented, will substantially increase healthcare freedom for veterans through the VA and improve access to medical services.

Even as someone who has been highly critical of the agency for years, I have to admit the VA has made some improvement since the deadly 2014 waitlist scandal.

Between 2014 and 2017, according to a study by the JAMA network, wait times across the VA have generally gone down. However, this decrease occurred while the VA increased the number of private sector appointments by over 50%, demonstrating better use of non-VA providers and the introduction of the albeit imperfect Veterans Choice Program helped improve wait times for veterans.

Despite this good news, the VA still faces many systemic issues that need to be dealt with. Too many VA hospitals are delivering sub-standard care and hundreds of thousands of veterans are still waiting long periods of time for appointments. Additionally, most of the VA’s healthcare facilities are over 50 years old, meaning not only are the buildings increasingly aged but they are not in locations best suited to serve the more dispersed veterans population of the future.

The VA MISSION Act, signed into law last year by Trump, was designed to address these issues. Over the next few years the VA will continue implementing the law, and it faces its first major test with the rollout of the Veterans Community Care Program.

It is critical for the future of veterans healthcare that the VA properly implement all the major components of the VA MISSION Act. Failure to do so will undermine the Trump administration’s VA reform agenda and compromise healthcare for millions of veterans. In addition, any attempts to roll back the VA MISSION Act by members of Congress who oppose giving veterans more healthcare choice — like Ocasio-Cortez — should be strongly resisted.

Finally, as more veterans get care from outside of the VA, elected officials at the state and federal levels must explore ways to eliminate barriers standing in the way of veterans making full use of their new private sector healthcare options. Critical reforms include expanded use of telehealth (as Virginia did) and repealing certificate-of-need laws (as Florida did this year). These and other patient-centered reforms, expand access to health care for both veterans and non-veterans while encouraging innovation.

The VA has improved since 2014, but challenges remain. We all want veterans to get the care they need and deserve. To achieve that, everyone needs to acknowledge that VA healthcare still needs some major improvements and to commit ourselves to ensuring the necessary reforms are made.

Homeland Security: We've tested Windows BlueKeep attack and it works so patch now,https://www.zdnet.com,['Liam Tung'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-weve-tested-windows-bluekeep-attack-and-it-works-so-patch-now/,"A single actor is scanning Windows systems vulnerable to the BlueKeep flaw A threat actor hidden behind Tor nodes is scanning for Windows systems vulnerable to BlueKeep flaw. Read more: https://zd.net/2JWjK73

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybercrime emergency response team is warning Windows admins to patch the wormable BlueKeep flaw, after confirming it can be used to remotely execute code on vulnerable PCs.

The US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has raised the official alert over a potentially devastating flaw that affects the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service in multiple versions of Windows, from Windows 2000 to Windows 2008.

Microsoft considered CVE-2019-0708, now known as BlueKeep, so severe that it even released a patch for unsupported Windows XP – a measure it hadn't taken since WannaCry wreaked havoc across the globe in mid-2017.

SEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)

The bug was reported to Microsoft ahead of its May Patch Tuesday update by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, the organization under UK spy agency GCHQ tasked with improving the nation's cybersecurity defenses in the public and private sector.

Microsoft released patches for XP because it believed BlueKeep's worm capabilities – the ability to automatically spread from one vulnerable machine to another – could be exploited in an attack on the same global scale as WannaCry, whose worm capabilities were enabled by EternalBlue, the leaked NSA exploit for the SMBv1 file-sharing protocol.

The NSA is also worried about BlueKeep. Earlier this month it urged admins to patch the flaw and change configurations to prevent potential attacks. Its warning followed research that found that at least one million Windows computers were still vulnerable to BlueKeep. The NSA said it was ""likely only a matter of time"" before attacks emerged.

Currently there's no publicly available exploit code for BlueKeep. However, several organizations claim to have developed exploits for it, including Zerodium, McAfee, Kaspersky, Check Point, MalwareTech, and Valthek.

CISA on Monday confirmed it has successfully exploited BlueKeep on a Windows 2000 PC. The agency has not tested other affected versions of Windows.

""CISA tested BlueKeep against a Windows 2000 machine and achieved remote code execution. Windows OS versions prior to Windows 8 that are not mentioned in this Activity Alert may also be affected; however, CISA has not tested these systems,"" it said.

However, CISA has since stepped back from that claim and replaced its original statement with: ""CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.""

Nonetheless, its advice, like the NSA's and Microsoft's, remains the same: apply Microsoft's May fixes for the RDP BlueKeep bug. Similarly, it recommends enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), which would shield organizations from any forthcoming BlueKeep attacks. And it suggests blocking TCP port 3389, which is used to start an RDP session.

Should a public BlueKeep exploit emerge or nation-state hackers develop one privately and decide to use it, the potential impact could be very different to WannaCry.

That malware heavily damaged organizations in Europe, most notably the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which faced a $125m WannaCry bill, was forced to cancel 19,000 appointments, and then spent £500,000 on contractors to restore data in the wake of the attack.

Additionally, thanks to suspected Russian state-backed hacking group, ShadowBrokers, public exploit code was available just a month after Microsoft's patch.

Security firm BitSight ran an internet scan in mid-June for systems vulnerable to BlueKeep. It too found about a million vulnerable machines, but the exposure to BlueKeep is greatest in China, where less than 50 percent of machines have been patched.

China by far has the most machines in the world that are vulnerable to BlueKeep, amounting to about a third of the million vulnerable machines. It is followed by the US, but more than 75 percent of US machines have been patched.

It seems Europe has learned its lessons from WannaCry and the subsequent EternalBlue-powered NotPetya outbreak. The UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, have all patched over 75 percent of systems with exposed RDP hosts.

Pete Buttigieg, a breakout 2020 Democratic candidate, said that it's ""statistically almost certain"" the US has had a gay president in the past.

Speaking to ""Axios on HBO"" on Sunday, Buttigieg defended himself against critics who say he would be too young, liberal, or gay to be elected commander-in-chief.

""People will elect the person who will make the best president,"" he said. ""And we have had excellent presidents who have been young. We have had excellent presidents who have been liberal. I would imagine we've probably had excellent presidents who were gay — we just didn't know which ones.""

""Statistically, it's almost certain,"" he added.

According to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, 9.8% of Washington D.C. identifies as LGBT, the highest of any US state. Gallup estimated that 4.5% of the US population identifies as LGBT in 2017.

When asked whether he could point to historically which president may have been gay, Buttigieg said his ""gaydar"" was not well tuned.

""My gaydar even doesn't work that well in the present, let alone retroactively."" he said. ""But one can only assume that's the case.""

Pete Buttigieg is a rising star in the leadup to the 2020 elections, with recent polls indicating that most voters find him more ""electable"" than many other more established Democratic candidates.

Buttigieg would be the first openly gay nominee for either party. The 37-year-old said he and husband Chasten, who celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary on Sunday, would be open to raising kids in the White House.

""I don't see why not,"" Buttigieg said. ""I think it wouldn't be the first time children have arrived to a first couple.""

"State Department cuts new funds to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, pending immigration fixes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-funds-state-department-immigration-fixes,"The State Department announced Monday it will cut new foreign aid to the ""Northern Triangle"" countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- unless their governments take ""concrete action"" to stem the flow of migrants towards the United States.

The aggressive move came less than two weeks after the Trump administration reached a last-minute deal with Mexico, which called for the country's deployment of more troops to its own southern border and tighter asylum protocols. The U.S. and Mexico reached the accord shortly before the White House was set to impose a series of escalating tariffs on its southern neighbor.

President Trump previously pushed in March to cut $615 million in aid to the Northern Triangle, noting that the nations have been home to some of the migrant caravans that have marched through Mexico to the U.S. border to claim asylum, in some cases fraudulently.

On further review, the State Department said the administration has decided to continue to provide $432 million for anti-gang, education, and health initiatives. U.S. officials said the review looked at roughly 700 projects funded with fiscal 2017 money by the United States in the three countries and concluded that a significant number were too far advanced to end them.

MEXICO VOWS TO HELP CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS AMID CRACKDOWN

However, the latest plans showed roughly $370 million from the fiscal year 2018 budget will no longer be spent on the Northern Triangle and approximately $185 million in funding from the 2017 budget will be withheld, at least for now.

A State Department official told Fox News a re-evaluation would be concluded no later than April 2020.

""We will not provide new funds for programs in those countries until we are satisfied that the Northern Triangle governments are taking concrete actions to reduce the number of migrants coming to the U.S. border,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. ""This is consistent with the president’s direction and with the recognition that it is critical that there be sufficient political will in these countries to address the problem at its source.""

She added, ""Working with Congress, we will reprogram those funds to other priorities as appropriate.""

Ortagus noted that ""previously awarded grants and contracts will continue with current funding.""

Many Democrats called the decision callous and unproductive.

""As feared, a presidential tantrum will limit our nation’s ability to actually help address the challenges forcing people to flee to the U.S.,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., tweeted.

The Northern Triangle's immigration policies have long rankled the Trump administration. Last December, the U.S. pledged more than $10 billion in aid to Central America and Mexico to help keep migrants put. Later that month, Trump tweeted: ""...Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" Trump added. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

The State Department in March then notified Congress that it would look to suspend 2017 and 2018 payments to the trio of nations.

Meanwhile, Mexico has offered refuge to migrants with credible fears as thousands remain in the country while they await court dates for asylum petitions in the U.S. The understaffed and underfunded Mexican refugee commission has faced a backlog of cases.

But, in recent months, police and immigration have stepped up enforcement in southern Mexico, setting up highway checkpoints, raiding a caravan of mostly Central American migrants and trying to keep people off the northbound train known as ""the beast.""

At the same time, Mexicans have grown increasingly intolerant of the large numbers of migrants passing through their country in an attempt to reach the United States.

A June poll in Mexican newspaper El Universal showed that Mexicans are less receptive to allowing undocumented migrants to come in, or to stay on permanently as refugees, than they were in October, when caravans with thousands of Central American migrants were winding their way north.
