GOP Sen. Ron Johnson barred from entering Russia,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jennifer Hansler', 'Nathan Hodge', 'Veronica Stracqualursi']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/27/politics/ron-johnson-russia-visa-denied/index.html,"Washington (CNN) US Sen. Ron Johnson has been denied entry into Russia.

The Wisconsin Republican says his visa was rejected, a charge the Russians denied, saying he did not apply for a visa ""but presented everything as if he had been refused after applying.""

Johnson's denied entry to Russia comes amid heightened tensions between the two countries over issues including Russia's annexation of Crimea, its 2016 election interference and the attempted poisoning of an alleged Russian spy in the United Kingdom.

There has also been military escalation after the US withdrew from a nuclear treaty with Russia earlier this month and tested a new non-nuclear missile, leading Russia to test fire nuclear-capable missiles near NATO's borders.

""Working with Ambassador (Jon) Huntsman, I had hoped direct dialogue with Russian parliamentarians could help set the stage for better future relations between our two nations. Unfortunately, Russian officials continue to play diplomatic games with this sincere effort and have denied me entrance to Russia,"" the Wisconsin Republican said in a statement Monday.

Johnson called it a ""petty affront"" but vowed to ""continue to advocate a strong and resolute response to Russian aggression — and frank dialogue when possible.""

The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms Johnson is on an official list barring entry to the country, saying Tuesday he did not apply for a visa ""but presented everything as if he had been refused after applying.""

RIA-Novosti quoted the Russian MFA's Information and Press Department as calling Johnson's claim of visa rejection ""information manipulation.""

The MFA told RIA-Novosti that Johnson was on a ""stop list"" in response to measures by Washington. RIA-Novosti described Johnson as supporting ""anti-Russian"" legislation.

The Russian Embassy in Washington also said in a tweet Monday that Johnson ""did not apply for a visa at our Embassy and did not inform about his plans to visit.""

""Johnson's groundless accusations against Russia leave no doubts -- he is not ready for a dialogue, but a confrontation,"" the embassy's statement on Twitter continued.

The US State Department spokesperson told CNN in a statement they are aware of Johnson's statement.

""As Senator Johnson said, he had hoped to work with Ambassador Huntsman and Russian parliamentarians to set the stage for better future relations between our countries. These people-to-people relationships are the key to building cooperation and discovering common ground,"" the spokesperson said.

In efforts to restore more normal relations with Moscow, President Donald Trump has suggested reinstating Russia into the G7 and inviting the country to the summit next year.

Johnson, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, visited Russia last year along with a group of Republican senators.

In 2014, Russia sanctioned a list of US officials and lawmakers, in response to the US imposing sanctions for Russia's annexation moves."
China insists it is unaware of calls to Trump and says tariffs are 'extreme pressure' and 'not constructive at all',https://www.cnbc.com,['Yun Li'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/xinhua-china-insists-it-is-unaware-of-calls-to-trump.html,"Chinese President Xi Jinping meets Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China June 25, 2019.

One day later, China is still insisting no phone calls took place over the weekend that President Donald Trump claimed showed its willingness to talk again.

""I have not heard of this situation regarding the two calls that the U.S. mentioned in the weekend,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at press conference on Tuesday. He had denied on Monday that the calls had taken place.

""Regretfully, the U.S. has further increased the tax rate on China's exports to the U.S. This extreme pressure is purely harmful to both sides and not constructive at all,"" Geng said, according to a CNBC translation.

On Monday, Trump said at the G-7 summit in France that China in recent phone conversations expressed its desire for a deal. His comment renewed hopes for a resolution between the world's two largest economies, pushing the market higher as the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 250 points Monday.

Trump abruptly ended the tariff cease-fire earlier this month by slapping more tariffs on Chinese goods, and China retaliated with imposing duties on $75 billion more of U.S. goods and resumed auto tariffs. Trump also said he's ordering U.S. companies to immediately start looking for an alternative to China.

""We hope that the U.S. can maintain calm, return to rationality, stop wrong practices, and create conditions for the two sides to conduct consultations on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit,"" Geng said Tuesday.

Chinese state-run media Xinhua is also sticking to its tough stance on the trade war.

""China did not and will not surrender,"" Xinhua said in a commentary on Tuesday. ""Playing the old tricks of bullying and maximum pressure, the U.S. administration has escalated the trade tensions repeatedly and tried to coerce China into accepting its irrational demands.""

Xinhua had called Trump's move to order companies to leave China ""ridiculous at best."""

Why some lesbians don’t want Pete Buttigieg to be president,https://www.politico.com,['Maggie Severns'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/27/lesbians-pete-buttigieg-2020-president-1475900,"Several lesbian activists say that while they are glad South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is running for the Democratic nomination, they most want a woman to be president in 2020, after Hillary Clinton’s stinging loss in 2016. | Mary Schwalm/AP Photo 2020 Elections Why some lesbians don’t want Pete Buttigieg to be president Lesbian political activists are divided over which glass ceiling to aim for in the 2020 presidential race.

Campbell Spencer, a lesbian and political consultant, moved to Washington in the 1990s to work in LGBTQ advocacy. She wooed gay and lesbian voters for Al Gore, worked a stint in the Obama White House and now serves on the board of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which this year issued its first-ever endorsement of a presidential candidate: Pete Buttigieg.

But Spencer herself will not be voting for Buttigieg.

Story Continued Below

“Mayor Pete, he’s a trailblazer,” Spencer said in an interview. “But I’m one of these women who thinks we are way overdue for having a woman in the White House. That’s a lens through which I’m going to filter my decision.”

Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Ind., has drawn notable support from gay voters and donors for his presidential bid. But interviews with a dozen prominent Democrats in the LGBTQ community spotlight a remarkable collision of goals and ideals in the community of lesbian political activists this year. As the 2020 field slowly winnows, people are divided over which glass ceiling to break first.

The majority of the women POLITICO interviewed for this story did not want to speak on the record, citing a desire not to damage Buttigieg’s campaign. But especially when compared with the laborious ascent of Hillary Clinton, Buttigieg’s swift rise in national politics hints of male favoritism, some said. Others applauded his run — but feel more strongly about the need to elect a female president.

“It feels like a slap in the face to just go directly to the white gay guy, when for decades you’ve been trying to elect a woman and it didn’t happen last time,” said one lesbian Democrat who works in national politics. “If Pete Buttigieg is elected it won’t feel like a vindication of Hillary Clinton. If a woman is elected, it will.”

LGBTQ voters made up a relatively small 6 percent of the electorate in the 2018 midterm elections but voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates, according to exit polls. And gay donors are a formidable source of campaign funds in the Democratic Party: One in six of Barack Obama’s top campaign bundlers in 2012 were openly gay, according to a Washington Post analysis at the time.

The LGBTQ community has been an important launch pad for Buttigieg’s presidential bid. He has fundraised at the homes of several prominent gay donors — such as television producers Ryan Murphy and Richie Jackson, each of whom have hosted Buttigieg for events in their homes this year — and received campaign checks from power players including Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and lesbian megadonor Laura Ricketts.

But the broad 2020 Democratic field includes historic diversity and choice for LGBTQ voters looking for new representation in the White House, or at least on the Democratic debate stage.

“There are black gay men and Latina lesbians — we have all these identities,” said Annise Parker, the former Houston mayor who is now president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund. “I talk to donors who are really glad that Pete’s running, but want Julián Castro to be on the debate stage. Or who say, ‘I want Cory Booker or Kamala Harris to be on stage.’ I say that’s a great thing.”

Parker, who became the first lesbian elected to lead a major American city only a decade ago, said she plans to vote for Buttigieg. But she also feels the pull of electing the first female president.

“As a woman, as a lesbian, as someone who was all in for Hillary Clinton and as someone who was a historic first myself, I would love to see a woman at the top of the ticket,” Parker said.

“And talking with other women inside the community and not, we understand the importance of Pete’s candidacy — but dammit, we’re half the population. It’s time” for a woman president, Parker continued.

Several lesbian donors and activists interviewed by POLITICO said they see in this election a continuation of the gender politics of 2016, when Clinton’s nomination was a vindicating moment for many Democratic women — and Trump’s position as the GOP nominee heightened the stakes of the race, as well as the burn of Clinton’s loss.

“To have a woman candidate finally running for president was extraordinarily galvanizing to substantial portions of the women’s community and the lesbian community,” said Elyse Cherry, a Massachusetts-based lesbian community activist and former member of Clinton’s New England finance committee. “When she lost, people were even more galvanized.”

Cherry pushed to build a movement for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, starting in the early 1990s when the idea was a political outlier. She chaired the board for MassEquality, which advocated for the state’s gay marriage law and worked to guard it from challenges in the years after it was enacted.

Cherry plans to vote for her senior senator, Elizabeth Warren.

“Having a woman, finally, as our president is important to me,” Cherry said. “The mistake is to suggest that we all stay in one lane — for example that if you’re gay you should be supporting gay candidates, or if you’re a woman you should be supporting women candidates.”

LPAC, an organization that focuses on building power among LGBTQ women, has not endorsed a candidate, but its endorsement discussions will begin at an upcoming board meeting, the group’s president Stephanie Sandberg said, adding that there is a ""strong possibility"" that LPAC will endorse a candidate.

Nabeela Rasheed, a Chicago-based lawyer and activist backing Buttigieg, said “there is absolutely a conversation that’s happening” among lesbian donors in her area about the value of supporting a female candidate over Buttigieg.

“I don’t think the county is ready for a West Coast Democrat, and a female at that. And I don’t think this country can take an East Coast female either. They need someone who understands Main Street,” Rasheed said. So Rasheed — who is of Pakistani descent — has been raising money for Buttigieg and trying to introduce as many women of color to his campaign as possible.

Buttigieg surprised observers by surging to national prominence this spring and raising $24 million between early April and the end of June, the most money of any candidate in the field.

One foundation for his success was a bloc of openly gay male donors and fundraisers who threw their support behind his campaign early in the race. Among the people who have already raised more than $25,000 for Buttigieg’s campaign were Terrence Meck, co-founder of the nonprofit The Palette Fund; and Alex Slater, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Clyde Group.

Other high-profile gay donors, such as software entrepreneur Tim Gill and philanthropist David Bohnett, have donated to former Vice President Joe Biden, who was an early proponent of same-sex marriage in Washington.

Kelly Dermody, a former Hillary Clinton bundler and employment lawyer who has represented women in sexual harassment cases, said that while Buttigieg’s candidacy is “exciting,” federal lawmakers who are running have more experience.

Dermody is backing Kamala Harris, who she believes is the strongest candidate, in part because of her experience as a woman and person of color. She said that one highlight of the 2020 campaign for her has been Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, a frequent presence at campaign stops and an unbridled booster of his wife on social media.

“It’s just been really nice seeing him at various events and see what it looks like to have a female leader have the support of a strong male partner,” Dermondy said. “He has his own job and he’s a real star lawyer in his own world, but he also has embraced this [campaign].”"

Opinion | My Final Break With the Trump State Department,https://www.nytimes.com,['Bethany Milton'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/opinion/trump-state-department.html,"When President Trump allowed a crowd to chant “Send her back!” about a sitting member of Congress — espousing an ideology in which naturalized American citizens, at least those who don’t fit a certain profile, are held to different and dangerous standards — he wasn’t thinking about me. He’s rarely thinking about me, the white American-born daughter of two American-born citizens.

But he is often thinking and talking about at least some of the tens of thousands of people I’ve helped immigrate to the United States — legally and permissibly — over my 11 years as a consular officer in the Foreign Service. From 2014 to 2016, I oversaw immigrant visa processing at the U.S. Consulate General in Mumbai, India. Every day, my team and I saw dozens of families destined to move to the United States as green card holders: older parents going to spend their final years surrounded by grandchildren, spouses matched up through online matrimonial sites, parents with kids in tow who had been waiting patiently since the early 1990s for their chance to join a sibling.

I also oversaw immigrant visa operations in Kigali, Rwanda, from 2018 to 2019, helping Rwandans and Congolese reunite with family members in the United States. Their stories often had a darker tone: marriages brokered in refugee camps, siblings separated by war, children born of rape. But the one thing that united almost every visa applicant I ever saw was the belief that life was going to be better in America. What a rude surprise, then, for them to face elected national leadership that targets them in such gruesome ways.

When a diplomat joins the State Department, she sits through two presentations toward the end of her weekslong orientation class. One is an afternoon session about the State Department’s storied dissent channel, which lets employees speak out internally about foreign policy decisions free from the fear of retaliation. How to use it, when to use it, what it means. The other is a much shorter presentation, one that lasts all of 15 seconds: “The day you can no longer publicly support your administration’s policies is the day you need to resign.”"
Justice Dept. could be nearing decision on whether to charge Andrew McCabe,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department', 'August At Pm', ""Matt Zapotosky Covers The Justice Department For The Washington Post'S National Security Team. He Has Previously Worked Covering The Federal Courthouse In Alexandria"", ""Local Law Enforcement In Prince George'S County"", 'Southern Maryland.']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-dept-could-be-nearing-decision-on-whether-to-charge-andrew-mccabe/2019/08/26/0e1a636c-c840-11e9-a1fe-ca46e8d573c0_story.html,"The legal team for Andrew McCabe met last week with the No. 2 official at the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, a person familiar with the matter said, suggesting that a decision could be close on whether the FBI’s former acting director will face criminal charges on allegations that he lied to investigators.

McCabe’s team met for more than an hourwith U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu and, separately, with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, the person said. Meetings with such high-level law enforcement officials typically come near the end of criminal investigations, affording defense attorneys a chance to make their last pitch on why their client should not be charged.

Spokesmen for McCabe and the Justice Department declined to comment. The person familiar with the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. The development was first reported Monday by the New York Times.

Federal prosecutors have been weighing for well over a year whether to charge McCabe, after the Justice Department’s inspector general alleged that McCabe had misled investigators several times about a media disclosure regarding the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s family foundation.

[Inspector general report faults McCabe for unauthorized disclosure of information, misleading investigators]

By the inspector general’s telling, McCabe approved the disclosure and later — when asked about the matter by investigators with the FBI’s inspection division and inspector general’s office — denied having done so. McCabe’s attorney has said previously that his statements “are more properly understood as the result of misunderstanding, miscommunication, and honest failures of recollection based on the swirl of events around him.” Lying to investigators is a federal crime.

McCabe, the FBI’s No. 2 official who was elevated to lead the bureau after President Trump fired James B. Comey as director in May 2017, has become a lightning rod for the political battles surrounding the bureau’s recent work. He authorized the FBI to begin investigating Trump after Comey’s firing, and he became a frequent target of the president’s criticism.

In March 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired Mc­Cabe, citing the inspector general’s findings. But McCabe alleged that the move — which came just hours before he could retire and collect full benefits — was politically motivated. He later wrote a book airing unflattering details of his interactions with Trump and Sessions, and earlier this month, he sued over his removal. CNN, another frequent Trump target, recently announced it had hired McCabe as a contributor.

[Andrew McCabe, Trump’s foil at the FBI, is fired hours before he could retire]

All the while, the U.S. attorney’s office for the District has continued to examine McCabe, its work evolving from a referral by the Justice Department inspector general’s office into a full-fledged grand jury investigation .

It remains unclear whether McCabe will be charged — although the recent meeting shows that the case is alive. Trump supporters probably would be dismayed to see the Justice Department pass on the case, particularly because there were Trump allies who pleaded guilty to lying as part of then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s probe. Charges against McCabe, on the other hand, could spark allegations from the left that he is being retaliated against for authorizing the investigation into Trump."

""No matter what you read and hear from the media, this G-7 was all about Trump re-aligning the world -- reshaping the world economy with America's interests first and foremost,"" said Varney on Fox Nation's ""My Take.""

CHINA ANNOUNCES IT SEEKS 'CALM' END TO TRADE WAR, AS MARKETS TANK AND CURRENCY HITS 11-YEAR FLATLINE

After President Trump's news conference, at the conclusion of the summit on Monday, CNN's Jim Acosta said, ""I think perhaps one of the biggest headlines coming out of this press conference that we just witnessed here in France is that the President would not be pinned down on this question of climate change.""

Varney said that analysis misses the point. ""Trade was the headline issue ... A deal with Japan -- they will import a lot more of our agricultural product. Britain gets a major trade deal after Brexit, and there's dialogue with Germany on car tariffs as well, but the most important -- China,"" stressed Varney.

At the press conference Monday, President Trump said, “China wants to make a deal. And I tell this to President Xi [Jinping] who I really respect ... I told him very strongly, I said 'Look, you’re making $500 billion a year and stealing our intellectual property…We can’t make a 50-50 deal ... If it’s not better, I don’t want to do business.”

WHITE HOUSE: TRUMP'S 'SECOND THOUGHTS' ON CHINA TRADE WAR 'GREATLY MISINTERPRETED'

Varney believes that it is time for America's European allies to get on board with the President's agenda. ""Europeans are frankly scared of America. Their economies are sinking. They've entered the fantasy land of negative interest rates. Their money is pouring over here, and they just don't know what to do. My advice -- jump on the Trump train and quit whining about Iran and climate change,"" advised Varney.

Former Trump aide subpoenaed to testify before House Judiciary Committee,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Alexander Nazaryan', 'Yahoo News']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/08/26/former-trump-aide-subpoenaed-to-testify-before-house-judiciary-committee/23801522/,"WASHINGTON — Robert R. Porter, the influential former aide to President Trump, has been ordered to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, in the latest sign that congressional Democrats will continue to press the Trump administration on questions related to electoral fraud and obstruction of justice.

Porter’s subpoena announced Monday by the Judiciary Committee’s chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., demands Porter testify at a Sept. 17 hearing.

As Trump’s staff secretary from from January 2017 until February 2018, Porter had daily access to the president and served as an Oval Office go-between to other high-ranking officials in the executive branch. Porter is also routinely mentioned in the second volume of Robert Mueller’s 448-page report, a redacted version of which was made public in April, in connection with Trump’s possible obstruction of justice.

Neither Porter nor his attorney was available for immediate comment. Members of the Democratic staff of the House Judiciary Committee would also not comment for the record.

His subpoena is the latest of several issued by the influential committee, which has engaged in zealous oversight of the Trump administration. Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Corey Lewandowski, who served as Trump’s first campaign manager during the 2016 presidential campaign, and Rick Dearborn, who was a White House deputy chief of staff in the early days of the administration.

Subpoenas have also recently been issued to Hope Hicks, one of Trump’s most trusted advisers, former White House counsel Don McGahn and McGahn aide Annie Donaldson.

Nadler has also moved to subpoena the unredacted version of Mueller’s report on the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia and, subsequently, the efforts of the Trump administration to hide evidence of that collusion.

Supporters of Trump have echoed his complaints that Nadler and his Democratic colleagues are engaged in a protracted “witch hunt” animated by a lingering disappointment that Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.

Porter has largely remained out of public view since leaving the White House in early 2018 amid allegations by two ex-wives that he had been abusive toward them. Porter has denied those allegations but has not discussed them at any significant length. He did, however, publish a Wall Street Journal op-ed on trade policy in March. In response, one of his ex-wives wrote in the Washington Post that “Rob’s sudden return to the public eye” was “deeply troubling.”

The committee’s interest in Porter is likely limited to potential obstruction of justice charges against Trump. The former Trump aide is absent from the first volume of the Mueller report, which focuses on electoral interference, because he was not affiliated with the Trump campaign. At the time of the 2016 election, he was a senior aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who has since retired.

Porter joined the Trump presidential transition and later became Trump’s staff secretary, meaning that he controlled the flow of information in and out of the Oval Office.

According to White House sources who spoke to this reporter for “The Best People,” a book about the Trump administration, Porter’s stock rose as McGahn’s fell. Trump was impressed by Porter, who has degrees from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, and who was a Rhodes Scholar. He was also a favorite of John Kelly, who succeeded Reince Priebus as the White House chief of staff. By mid-2017, Porter had considerable access to — and influence in — the Oval Office.

If he complies with the subpoena and testifies before the House Judiciary Committee, Porter will almost certainly be asked about several potentially obstructive incidents described in the Mueller report.

In one such incident, Trump asked Porter to “sound out” Rachel Brand, an associate attorney general, for her views on the Mueller investigation. The Mueller report says that Trump wanted to see if Brand was “on the team.”

“Porter did not reach out to her because he was uncomfortable with the task,” the report says. “Porter did not contact Brand,” it continues a little later, “because he was sensitive to the implications of that action and did not want to be involved in a chain of events associated with an effort to end the investigation or fire the Special Counsel.”

Porter was also present for a Dec. 6, 2017, meeting between Trump and Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general. Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation because of his own contacts with Russian officials during the presidential campaign. That recusal was a source of great irritation for Trump.

The Mueller report cites notes Porter took at that meeting. “I don’t know if you could un-recuse yourself. You’d be a hero,” Trump told Sessions according to those notes.

The House Judiciary Committee will likely seize on Porter’s recollections of the Dec. 6 encounter as further evidence that Trump attempted to hamper the Mueller investigation.

Also of interest to congressional investigators will be Porter’s recollection of an exchange with the president in his residence on Jan. 27, 2018, just days before Porter left the White House. According to the narrative in the Mueller report — which is based on Porter’s notes — Trump “said that one of his biggest failings as President was that he had not surrounded himself with good attorneys, citing Sessions as an example. The President raised Sessions’s recusal and brought up and criticized the Special Counsel’s investigation.”

An institutionalist who has worked in all three branches of government (before becoming a Hatch staffer, he was a clerk on the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit), it’s difficult to imagine Porter either defying the subpoena or turning his testimony before Congress into a pro-Trump diatribe.

But it is just as difficult to imagine Porter turning on Trump. The president expressed sympathy for Porter as the allegations of domestic abuse became public, and the two continued to communicate after Porter left the administration, and there have been occasional rumors that Trump would like him to return in some capacity.

Nor is Porter likely to be the last current or former Trump official to be summoned to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. In July, the committee voted to authorize potential subpoenas for Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, former top adviser Stephen K. Bannon and 10 others, Porter among them. Some of those subpoenas have been issued, while others could be on the way.

Lisa Page could save Andrew McCabe from DOJ criminal charges,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lisa-page-could-save-andrew-mccabe-from-doj-criminal-charges,"Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page could hinder a criminal case against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe if the Justice Department decides to bring charges against him.

Federal prosecutors are close to making a final decision on whether to indict McCabe, who is accused of lying to federal agents, the New York Times reported Monday.

McCabe’s lawyers met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who will help make the call on whether to prosecute, and U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu in two separate meetings last week. This signals McCabe’s lawyers could be making a last-ditch effort to convince the top law enforcement officials not to prosecute the case.

If they were to bring charges against McCabe, prosecutors would have to prove he knowingly and intentionally lied to investigators when he told them on two occasions that he did not remember authorizing Page to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter. McCabe corrected himself at a later time.

Page, who worked as a special counsel to McCabe, told a grand jury in Washington, D.C., that McCabe was authorized in his position as deputy director to give information to the media and had no motive to lie. Page resigned from the bureau last year after it was discovered she had exchanged anti-Trump text messages with former FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she had an affair.

Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018, less than two days before he was set to retire. This followed Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s inspector general, releasing a report in February 2018 detailing instances where McCabe “lacked candor” with then-FBI Director James Comey and investigators and concluded McCabe greenlit disclosures to the media of sensitive information on an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation “to make himself look good.”

McCabe's lawyers called the inspector general's report ""deeply flawed.""

Comey has said he did not give McCabe permission to leak, and when Sessions fired McCabe he stated the deputy director “made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions.”

McCabe, who was hired by CNN last week, sued in August, accusing Trump of forcing his subordinates at the Justice Department to participate in an “unconstitutional plan and scheme” to have him fired, and is demanding back pay, his full pension, and for his record to be expunged. Trump has accused McCabe, who authorized the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, of being involved in an ""illegal and treasonous"" plot against him.

Neither DOJ nor McCabe’s attorney immediately responded to the Washington Examiner’s requests for comment.

The investigation into McCabe has been lengthy — so long, in fact, the Times reported the term expired for grand jury hearing evidence. It began last year after Horowitz referred his findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges. Frustrated with the prolonged process, DOJ prosecutor Kamil Shields left the case and joined a private practice. Another assistant U.S. attorney, David Kent, is also no longer on the case.

McCabe is also likely still being scrutinized in Horowitz’s inquiry into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The surveillance warrant applications targeting Trump associate Carter Page required the approval of top members of the FBI and DOJ, and McCabe was involved in the FISA approval process.

Horowitz’s report is expected to be released to the public in late September or early October."
"For Trump, keeping up the act must be exhausting",https://www.cnn.com,"[""Michael D'Antonio""]",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/opinions/trump-g7-dantonio/index.html,"(CNN) The odd man out at the G7 gathering of the world's richest democracies, President Donald Trump cut a weary figure at a farewell press conference Monday, where he boosted the pariah Russian President Vladimir Putin, railed against Barack Obama, and once again bragged about the great relationship he and his wife, Melania, have with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

In contrast, Emmanuel Macron emerged from the conference as an energetic leader who bypassed America to make a diplomatic outreach to Iran. The French President's deft conduct at the G7, which featured climate change as a main topic, was all the more notable because of Trump's clumsiness. As is his habit, Trump offered conflicting messages on the trade war he started with China, blamed his predecessors for the nation's troubles -- and failed to note that Melania Trump has never met Kim Jong Un.

Macron -- and the world -- are well aware of Trump's inability to work well with others. Indeed, at the last G7 Trump reneged on a commitment to affirm a pro-trade joint communique all the others had approved, and attacked the summit's host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, personally, calling him ""very dishonest and weak.""

And so as Macron planned to host this year's meeting, he decided there would be no communique at all to organize the proceedings, depriving Trump of the chance to repeat his skunk-in-the garden-party trick.

The French leader matched this defensive decision -- which freed him to set a more unpredictable agenda -- with an offense move of his own. To the surprise of many, he welcomed Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif to Biarritz on Sunday, opening the door for him to discuss trade security with his counterparts.

France was one of the six countries that signed a deal that froze Iran's nuclear weapons program in 2015. (The others were the United Kingdom, Russia, France, China, Germany and the US). Under intense monitoring, Iran complied with its part of the bargain and received, in turn, more favorable trading arrangements with the rest of the world. However, Trump regards Iran as an enemy -- and the agreement was devised by Obama (also a Trump enemy). He alienated the other signatories by abandoning the agreement last year.

Trump did not meet with Zarif in Biarritz, but Macron's move appeared to coax him into a more conciliatory posture toward Iran.

While Macron was deftly circumventing him on Iran, Trump was also outplayed by his erstwhile buddy Boris Johnson on the issue of climate change. Regarded by some as Britain's version of Trump, Prime Minister Johnson glad-handed his American counterpart, but reminded the world that he disagrees with the President on climate change. Johnson expressed concern about threats to biodiversity and he actually attended the G7 session on climate change, which Trump skipped.

The insult evident in Trump's absence from that meeting was amplified by the deceptive explanation offered for his failure to attend. According to the White House press secretary, ""The President had scheduled meetings and bilaterals with Germany and India, so a senior member of the Administration attended in his stead."" In fact, the two leaders who supposedly kept Trump away were in their assigned chairs at the climate session. All anyone had to do to determine the truthfulness of the Trump claim was check a photo of the meeting, which circulated widely in the press.

A telling photo also seemed to reveal Justin Trudeau practicing a little gamesmanship with First Lady Melania Trump. Thanks to the angle of Trudeau's approach as he greeted the First Lady, cameras appear to have caught Mrs. Trump about to plant a big kiss on the movie-star-handsome Trudeau. In fact, it was only an air kiss, but the internet was ablaze with commentary about the apparently smitten look on Melania Trump's face.

Petty as it may seem -- and much of what is being said on social media about Trudeau and the First Lady is petty -- it's no surprise to see so much attention focused on the possible signals in photos. Much of the world is exhausted by President Trump's behavior and his attention seeking.

During the G7, China's foreign ministry joined the pushback against Trump, pouring cold water on the President's claim that recent contacts between Beijing and the administration suggested progress in the trade war Trump started. ""We've gotten two calls,"" over the weekend, Trump said on Monday. ""They want to be able to make a deal."" But a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry told a news briefing: ""Regarding the phone call in the weekend, I am not aware of that.""

Like the Chinese, the G7 leaders seem to have figured out Trump's methods, and have devised ways to quietly cope with them. Trump likes to present himself as a unique, even heroic figure who can do things others cannot. In Biarritz he even suggested that if he -- and not Barack Obama -- had been president when Russia invaded Crimea, it would have been stopped. He also vehemently urged leaders to bring Vladimir Putin, who was exiled from what was once the G8 because of his aggression, back into the great nations' club.

No other members of the group have proposed bringing Russia back into the fold, and as he suggested it -- and they resisted -- Trump underlined his isolated status.

Indeed, weak as the President seemed in contrast with Macron, his cravenly self-interested comments at the Monday press conference highlighted his scant relevance to the proceedings.

He added a parting shot of venality as he prepared to leave Biarritz: Asked about next year's G7, he launched into a marketing pitch for the session to be held at his Doral resort in Florida where, he said, the acreage would provide lots of parking. He followed with an odd reference to the money he thinks he's lost while serving as President of the United States and not the chief executive of the Trump Organization.

""Probably it will cost me anywhere from $3 to $5 billion to be President,"" said Trump, citing the example of lost income from public speaking. ""I used to get a lot of money to make speeches, now I give speeches all the time. You know what I get? Zippo.""

Trump softened the complaint -- which he brought up himself -- by suggesting that he doesn't care about the lost money.

His bragging about Doral, along with his disrespectful absence from the climate change session, served only to draw attention to how much he deviates from accepted norms. Trump may still think he's a leader of mythic proportions, but every day it seems more clear that he's only a hero in his own mind."
Iranian president says he'll only meet Trump after U.S. drops sanctions,https://www.politico.com,['Quint Forgey'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/27/iranian-president-meet-trump-sanctions-1475905,"“Without the U.S.’s withdrawal from sanctions, we will not witness any positive development,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images foreign policy Iranian president says he'll only meet Trump after U.S. drops sanctions

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday said he would be willing to meet with President Donald Trump only if the United States lifts its crushing economic sanctions on Tehran.

“Without the U.S.’s withdrawal from sanctions, we will not witness any positive development,” Rouhani said in a televised speech, warning: “If someone intends to make it as just a photo op with Rouhani, that is not possible.”

Story Continued Below

Rouhani’s remarks, reported by The Associated Press, contrast with comments he made Monday, when he expressed a greater willingness to sit for talks with Trump and asserted that Tehran and Washington “should not miss opportunities” for engagement.

“If I knew that going to a meeting and visiting a person would help my country’s development and resolve the problems of the people, I would not miss it,” Rouhani said, according to the AP. “Even if the odds of success are not 90 percent but are 20 percent or 10 percent, we must move ahead with it.”

Trump on Monday signaled fresh optimism that he and Rouhani could get together within weeks to address the escalating tensions between the two countries, which have ramped up steadily since the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 multinational nuclear deal with Iran last year.

""The sanctions are absolutely hurting them horribly,"" Trump told reporters during a news conference at the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France. ""I don't want to see that. But we can't let them have a nuclear weapon. So, I think there is a really good chance we would meet.""

French President Emmanuel Macron has sought to salvage the nuclear agreement amid a diplomatic breakdown between the U.S. and Iran, inviting Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to the annual gathering of leaders of major industrial nations over the weekend.

""I want this meeting to happen, and I want there to be an agreement between the United States and Iran,"" Macron said on Monday of a potential gathering between Trump and Rouhani."
Justice Department asks Supreme Court to allow border asylum ban,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Camilo Montoya-Galvez'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-asks-supreme-court-to-allow-border-asylum-ban/,"Washington — The Justice Department on Monday asked the Supreme Court to allow the Trump administration to implement its most sweeping effort yet to overhaul the asylum system along the border while a legal challenge plays out in court.

U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who represents the federal government before the court, urged the justices to issue an administrative stay on a ruling by a judge in San Francisco, who earlier in the summer blocked a regulation that would make most migrants from Central America and other countries ineligible for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The administration had already asked the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to do so. Earlier this month, the appellate court did not grant the government's request, but it said the injunction blocking the near-total asylum ban only applies within the court's jurisdiction. The decision meant that administration could proceed with the policy in New Mexico and Texas, but not in California and Arizona, which fall within the purview of the 9th Circuit.

Through its filing on Monday, the administration is asking the high court to allow the government to implement the rule along the entire border. Francisco said the policy ""serves important public purposes"" and ""alleviates a crushing burden on the U.S. asylum system by prioritizing asylum seekers who most need asylum in the United States.""

The rule, a joint effort by the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, restricts access to the U.S. asylum system for non-Mexican migrants who traveled through Mexico and other countries to reach the southwestern border, but did not seek protection in those nations.

Although designed to stem the flow of Central American migrants journeying north, the regulation also would affect people from other parts of the world trying to reach the U.S. through Mexico, including Cubans, Venezuelans, Brazilians and central Africans, who have traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border in higher numbers this year.

Administration officials have maintained that the rule would help curb what they call ""forum shopping"" by migrants. They have repeatedly accused migrants of preferring to seek asylum in the U.S., rather than in the countries along their journey that might be able to offer them safe haven.

""The rule also screens out asylum claims that are less likely to be meritorious by denying asylum to aliens who refused to seek protection in third countries en route to the southern border,"" Francisco wrote Monday. ""In turn, the rule deters aliens without a genuine need for asylum from making the arduous and potentially dangerous journey from Central America to the United States.""

But immigrant advocates have said the policy ignores U.S. and international refugee law and would force countless migrants and asylum seekers to return to places where they may face persecution.

When he approved a injunction against the ban in late July, Judge Jon Tigar of U.S. District Court in San Francisco seemed to agree with the concerns raised by the plaintiffs in one of two lawsuits. ""An injunction would vindicate the public's interest — which our existing immigration laws clearly articulate — in ensuring that we do not deliver aliens into the hands of their persecutors,"" he wrote in his ruling.

Late last year, Tigar halted a similar effort by the administration to prohibit migrants who cross the border illegally from being able to seek asylum. The Supreme Court, by a vote of 5 to 4, later rejected the administration's request to stay Tigar's ruling."
Biden campaign dismisses poll showing 13-point drop in support,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-campaign-dismisses-poll-showing-13-point-drop-in-support,"Joe Biden's campaign is pushing back against a new Monmouth University poll, released on Monday, which shows the former vice president's support to be rapidly declining.

""This poll is an outlier that is contradicted by every measure of the national average,"" an individual from the former vice president's campaign told the Washington Examiner. ""Poll after poll also confirms that, because of the high stakes of this election, Democratic primary voters are the most energized about a nominee who can take-on and defeat Donald Trump and the atrocious values he represents, and win the battle we’re in for the soul of this nation. Joe Biden is by all accounts the candidate best positioned to make that happen.""

The rapid response from the Biden campaign reflects its sensitivity to perceptions that the former vice president and Delaware senator is the undisputed front-runner in the 2020 Democratic race. The RealClearPolitics average on Monday, including the Monmouth poll, has Biden leading the pack at 27.2%, followed by Sanders at 16.7% and Elizabeth Warren at 16.2%.

The Monmouth survey found Biden in a statistical three-way tie with Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. According to that poll, which has a margin of error of 5.7%, both Sanders and Warren are currently receiving 20 points of support from Democratic primary voters, while Biden is at 19.

A month earlier, Monmouth found Biden leading the pack at 32%. The poll also found Biden's favorability ratings drop eight points, to 66%."
Brighton water treatment plant out of compliance with EPA standards for 3 consecutive years,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/brighton-in-violation-of-epa-drinking-water-standards-for-3-consecutive-years-according-to-report,"BRIGHTON, Colo. -- We knew the water in Brighton was expensive, now - it turns out - it could be dangerous, too.

The same city that could see its mayor recalled over sky-high water bills now admits it was out of compliance with EPA water treatment standards for 3 years.

The water scandal continues to mystify even some who sit on the current council.

""The residents don't trust the city,"" said councilman Matt Johnston. ""I, as a city council representative, do not trust our city.""

The latest issue to surface is an EPA summary which concludes Brighton had ""Significant/Category 1"" violations for 12 consecutive quarters.

A city spokeswoman said late Monday those violations are for treated discharge that goes back into the river, not the drinking water.

But, Brighton's former city manager said late Monday that the reverse osmosis treatment facility also supplies Brighton with drinking water, so any violation at the plant should be concerning.

""Someone's at serious risk if the plant is that out of compliance,"" said former city manager Philip Rodriguez, who was fired in the midst of this scandal back in July. ""Either Brighton or its neighbors downstream.""

The city told Denver7 on Tuesday those issues were resolved and the treatment facility is now in compliance.

""We cannot say that 100% for sure all of our water is safe,"" Johnston said. ""We can't say that.""

And, in fact, just last week the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment required Brighton to send a letter to residents warning them about a dangerous back flow issue that could impact the drinking water supply.

For homeowner's like Jeremy Torgerson, it's mind-boggling.

""You don't want to cook with it, give it to your kids, your dog or anything,"" Torgerson said. ""I don't know how many more punches the residents have to take from their own city before we finally decide that we've had enough.""

The ongoing scandal has resulted in a flood of problems at city hall including the discovery of a $70 million fund from possible water billing overcharges and the subsequent firing of the city manager.

And now – there will be a recall election of the current mayor who insists the water is safe.

""The water here in Brighton is safe,"" said Mayor Ken Kreutzer. ""I drink it. My children drink it. My grandson drinks it. This is another gross exaggeration.""

But Johnston and others, like Torgerson, are no longer going with the flow. They insist city hall is corrupt.

""I'm tired of the backroom,"" Johnston said. ""It's time for the public to know everything about our water system - if it's safe, if it's clean, where the money's at and what it's being spent for.""

And while the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment hasn't issued a boil order, Johnston believes it's only a matter of time.

""This is a pre-boil warning type of scenario,"" Johnston said.

""The city government no longer functions,"" Torgerson said. ""This a basic function of a utility department to make sure the water that goes out is safe. They overcharge, and now we have to drink bottled water.""

Johnston says those who are sick should be particularly cautious.

""They're going through chemotherapy, and they do not know if they should be boiling their water at this point,"" Johnston said."
Trump's North Korea point man gets a look for No. 2 State Dept. job,https://www.politico.com,"['Daniel Lippman', 'Eliana Johnson']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/26/biegun-north-korea-state-dept-1475896,"Special Envoy for North Korea Steve Biegun is being seriously considered to replace deputy secretary of state John Sullivan. | Jeon Heon-Kyun/Getty Images foreign policy Trump's North Korea point man gets a look for No. 2 State Dept. job Taking the deputy secretary position would leave the president without a dedicated envoy to Kim Jong Un.

Steve Biegun, President Trump’s special representative for North Korea, is being seriously considered for the No. 2 job at the State Department, according to two senior administration officials with knowledge of the matter.

The post looks like it’s going to open up soon because the current deputy secretary of state John Sullivan, who met with Trump in the Oval Office last week, is likely to get nominated in the coming weeks to be the U.S. ambassador to Russia, replacing Jon Huntsman, who leaves his post in early October.

Story Continued Below

While it’s early in the selection process for the job, multiple officials said that Biegun, a former auto executive who has been the point man on working-level negotiations with the North Korean regime, is a strong candidate.

Biegun, whose background before the North Korean job was in Russia policy, had also been considered to replace Huntsman and has talked to Trump about being an ambassador. He also reportedly turned down the Russia job.

“It’s good to have someone who is already in the system,” said a senior administration official. “They understand how the process goes. They already have a security clearance.” The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

“The whole building is vying for the job,” according to another senior administration official. One of the contenders could include Brian Bulatao, the undersecretary of state for management, who was chief operating officer of the CIA when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was CIA director, according to a former senior State Department official. Bulatao didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

It could take a while for Sullivan to get confirmed if and when he’s officially selected, since confirming judicial nominees is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s priority, which leads to occasional delays for executive branch nominees. Russia also is likely to take at least two months to approve the U.S. picking Sullivan, a diplomatic protocol known as “agrément.”

Trump has resisted acknowledging that his talks with Kim Jong Un have made little headway, and has sought a third summit with the North Korean leader.

He told reporters at the G7 in France on Monday that Kim “is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.” He had said that he was “not happy” about North Korea’s recent missile tests, which his own national security adviser has said violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.

There has also been some rather public daylight between Biegun and Trump on the progress the U.S. has made in negotiating with North Korea. While Trump bragged last year that there wasn’t a nuclear threat from North Korea anymore, Biegun said earlier this year at Stanford that “it is fair to say we have more work ahead of us than behind us.”

With few signs of any coming breakthroughs with North Korea, Biegun has recently shown signs of wanting to leave his current job. He’s been telling associates he was eager to move on from the envoy post and felt it was a thankless job, according to three people familiar with his comments.

In his job as Trump’s North Korea envoy, Biegun has had difficulty getting meetings with top North Korean officials to advance U.S. goals of denuclearization.

“Not having the North Koreans meet with you and the North Koreans only want to meet with the president is pretty frustrating,” said one Republican foreign policy hand who knows Biegun. “And negotiating with the North Koreans is hopeless. They just want to meet at the presidential level so there’s no real meetings at his level.”

It’s not clear whether Biegun would actually take the deputy job if Trump offers it. He has also told people that he is tired of serving in government and is eager to return to the private sector.

The State Department, meanwhile, is fending off twin challenges: a president whose sudden pronouncements can rewrite policy in mere seconds; and a budget that is constantly under the threat of severe cuts under Trump.

“How are you supposed to come to work and to be a serious professional when you don’t know what’s coming tomorrow?” said another Republican involved in foreign policy in Washington. “Even Pompeo doesn’t know the crazy thing Trump is going to say the next day and it’s really hard to engage with people in the White House” who don’t know what Trump is going to do either.

Weighing against this chaos factor: If Biegun is picked for the deputy job, there’s a possibility he could eventually become the acting secretary of state should Pompeo leave to run for a Senate seat in his home state of Kansas.

Biegun served as executive secretary of the National Security Council in the Bush administration and also had a brief stint as foreign policy adviser to Sarah Palin when she was John McCain’s vice presidential nominee.

Before joining the Trump administration, he worked as the vice president of international governmental affairs at Ford. After H.R. McMaster left as Trump’s national security adviser, Biegun was considered for that job before John Bolton was picked.

Traditionally, the deputy secretary of state position is tasked with managing the State Department’s 69,000 employees, but also usually carves out select foreign policy portfolios of his or her own.

Sullivan, for instance, has focused on a few key issues, including implementing the sanctions against Russia, leading the administration’s diplomatic response to the gas attacks and barrel bombings in Syria, and guiding the Trump team’s efforts to stabilize South Sudan.

Trump told reporters last week that Sullivan “could very well be” picked as the ambassador to Russia and that Pompeo “likes him very much.”

As for Biegun’s suitability for the job, “It’s a really tough and challenging role but I think Steve would be really excellent at it, just because of his work ethic, his style, his intelligence,” another former senior State Department official said. “I’ve always found Steve to be fair.”

Biegun didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

His departure would leave the North Korea envoy role empty -- but Trump has shown few signs of leaning on Biegun in any event.

On Monday, the president said that his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, has also gotten to know Kim Jong Un. That left Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, to quickly clarify Trump’s comments.

“President Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim,” she said in a statement. “And while the first lady hasn’t met him, the president feels like she’s gotten to know him too.”

Justice Department to seek death penalty against Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect,https://www.cnn.com,['Amir Vera'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-death-sentence/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department is planning to seek the death penalty against the suspected shooter in the Pittsburgh Tree of Life Synagogue massacre.

Robert Bowers

Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty on charges that include obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, use and discharge of a firearm to commit murder and possession of a firearm during a violent crime.

Prosecutors say their intent to seek the death penalty is justified because Bowers' anti-Semitic views played a role in the shooting, the shooting was intentional and he showed no remorse, according to a federal notice to seek the death penalty.

Bowers has been indicted on 63 federal charges, including hate crime charges, according to a superseding indictment issued in January 2019. Of the 63 charges, 22 counts carry the death penalty, a Justice Department news release in January said."
XRP Or Ethereum?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk,[],,,,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2019/08/xrp-or-ethereum,"In terms of market capitalisation, XRP and Ethereum are very close rivals. Over the past year, the two have frequently battled it out for the second spot in the markets, becoming the second ‘biggest’ cryptocurrency on the planet in the process. Whilst this sort of market cap battle is mostly meaningless, it does bring some positive attention to XRP and Ethereum as cryptocurrencies. So, in the battle between the second and third best, which will come out on top? In order to hazard a guess at this, we need to understand the advantages and drawbacks to each cryptocurrency.

Firstly, XRP is the token native to the Ripple project. Ripple, is a blockchain company that promises to change the way remittance payments and international money transfers are made. By using blockchain technology, XRP, along with a number of technological revolutions, want to make international payments quicker and cheaper. Moreover, XRP exists as a token that can be bought, in order to buy into Ripple. XRP is unique to Ethereum in that it cannot be mined, this however does cause some issues, with many believing XRP is not a true cryptocurrency and that, because it’s owned in a majority stake by Ripple as a company, the token is a security token - something more like a traditional share in a company than a crypto.

Ethereum on the other hand, is very different, which is why it’s very interesting that this pair seem to have a direct rivalry. Ethereum is often seen as the second cryptocurrency and the first cryptocurrency that attempted to right the wrongs of Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is fully decentralised and requires mining from the blockchain. Like XRP, Ethereum is a part of a wider blockchain project, though in Ethereum’s case, it’s got nothing to do with international payments. Ethereum wants to make the blockchain open source, and allows for the development of blockchain based applications, or decentralised applications that allows anyone to create and launch a cryptocurrency. Many of the world’s leading tokens where created in this way, including EOS and TRON.

So, once you understand these differences, it’s hard to know exactly which crypto will rule, frankly though, it doesn’t matter. Ethereum and XRP each have their own market and their own interests and we expect them both to excel in their own areas. Ethereum is likely to keep hold of the majority of the market cap because it has more use value, even if it doesn’t though, it’s not necessarily a bad thing, XRP is equally deserving of that second place spot too."
Weill Family Foundation announces public-private partnership with Energy Department on artificial intelligence,https://www.cnbc.com,['Riya Bhattacharjee'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/weill-foundation-announces-public-private-partnership-with-dept-of-energy-on-artificial-intelligence.html,"The Department of Energy and the Weill Family Foundation on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding for a new public-private partnership which will use the agency's artificial intelligence capabilities for biomedical research.

Former Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill and Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC's ""Closing Bell "" in an exclusive interview that the partnership aims to improve the diagnosis of brain diseases and neurological disorders, which would result in more effective treatment.

""As one looks at science and the development of new science, especially AI and computing, you really need to have partners to make things work."" Weill said. ""It's too expensive for anybody to try to do it by themselves.""

The partnership between the federal government and the Weill Family Foundation, involves Lawrence Livermore, Lawrence Berkeley and Argonne National laboratories, and was announced during a roundtable on DOE-fueled artificial intelligence at Lawrence Livermore Lab in Livermore, California.

The Department of Energy is currently home to the fastest supercomputers in the world.

The partnership aims to have new computers ready by 2022 that would run 15 times faster than current speeds.

""It will really break the logjam, especially as it related to neurodegenerative diseases,"" Weill said. ""And with everybody doing better, with the cancer research and with cardiovascular research, people are going to live longer. And we are all going to get these neurodegenerative diseases over time. And what we are working on is to prevent that because it would just be too costly.""

Perry said in the next 18 to 24 months, the department will have computers coming on board that will be between 50 to 100 times faster than today's computers. ""The improvement in health care, particularly in brain science, is going to be monumental, it's going to be world changing,"" Perry said.

Weill added it was important for the U.S. to beat China in this field.

When asked about current U.S.-China trade relations, Weill said it was important for the United States and China to figure out a way to get along with each other. ""With the two countries partnering for the future, I think we will end up with a better world, a safer world."""

The State Department on Monday announced the political scientist Peter Berkowitz as the head of policy planning, a post that puts him in charge of long-term strategic thinking for the department.

Berkowitz, who was already working in the Office of Policy Planning, will replace his former boss, Kiron Skinner, who was dismissed earlier this month over concerns about her management style.

Story Continued Below

The announcement came in an internal email to select State Department officials on Monday morning, according to one of those officials.

Berkowitz, who has taught both constitutional law and political philosophy, came to the State Department from Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is the author of four books on subjects ranging from conservatism and progressivism to the ethics of Nietzsche.

Under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Department of Policy Planning — which has historically operated as the State Department’s internal think tank — played a key role in the day-to-day management of the department.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who works closely with a team of special envoys, has returned it to its traditional role of churning out papers and proposals on long-range strategic issues.

The President Spent the G-7 Summit Retweeting Conspiracy Theories,https://slate.com,['Ben Mathis-Lilley'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/trump-g7-china-twitter.html,"Donald Trump at the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, on Sunday. Jeff J. Mitchell—Pool/Getty Images

Over the weekend and on Monday, President Donald Trump was in France for the G-7 summit, at which he was supposed to be doing things such as keeping the world economy from crashing and going to meetings about subjects like climate change.

Mostly, though, the president appeared to be self-soothing online. In one four-hour stretch on Sunday, Trump did nine consecutive reposts of tweets from the right-wing group Judicial Watch, in reverse chronological order, as if he were working his way through the feed to make himself feel better. The topics he shared included a conspiracy theory about Rep. Ilhan Omar’s personal life and various paranoid claims about the deep state, one of which featured a video involving, yes, Hillary Clinton’s emails.

What about summit business? On the economic front, Trump told reporters that his aides had been in touch with representatives of the Chinese government about working out a trade deal after the market-assaulting Friday tweet meltdown in which he’d spontaneously announced new tariffs and demanded that U.S. companies stop doing business in the country. According to the Associated Press, the president specifically said that his trade negotiation team had conducted two “very good calls” with the Chinese on Sunday. China, however, had a different take:

JUST IN: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang says has no info on phone calls to U.S. cited by Trump, adding later “I can tell you clearly that I haven’t heard of such a thing”

* Says China will protect itself on trade if U.S. persists with current approach — Melissa Cheok (@mkcheok) August 26, 2019

So that’s going well. As for climate change, Trump not only missed the meeting but didn’t even know he had missed it. The Guardian:

Trump was later asked by reporters covering a meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, whether he had attended the climate session. He replied: “We’re having it in a little while.” He did not appear to hear when a reporter told him it had just taken place.

On the ball. Good.

Meanwhile, his Twitter feed testifies to what the president has been paying attention to in France. The Judicial Watch fixation was part of a Sunday/Monday spree—again, while he was supposed to be at a series of huge meetings—during which he posted or retweeted others’ posts 46 times. Some of these were pro forma PR messages that were probably put up by his staff, but others were vintage The President Is Mad at the Television material, like this zombie complaint about how well the press treated Clinton in 2016, this denial of the very plausible Axios report that he wants to drop a nuclear bomb on a hurricane, and this Obviously Fabricated Anecdote:

The question I was asked most today by fellow World Leaders, who think the USA is doing so well and is stronger than ever before, happens to be, “Mr. President, why does the American media hate your Country so much? Why are they rooting for it to fail?” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2019

Yeah, that sounds like something Shinzo Abe would say."
Justice Department takes controversial stand on transgender case at Supreme Court,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo J. Scott Applewhite'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/justice-department-takes-controversial-stand-on-transgender-case-at-supreme-court,"In one of the most important cases the Supreme Court will hear this fall, the Department of Justice has taken a stand, along with a number of influential people and organizations. All of them take specific, strong stances on the definition of sex and gender identity, which center around the questions both the LGBT activists, conservatives, and legal experts have been asking for some time: What is sex, who defines it, and what legal protections does it have?

In a brief filed with the Supreme Court, the Department of Justice said they believe transgender discrimination is not prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in October to address the issue. The ACLU will argue on behalf of the transgender woman and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s position, claiming the employee was fired because of her gender identity. R.G & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes maintains that the employee was fired after he transitioned from male to female because he did not wear sex-specific clothing, which is a company policy.

This particular brief is significant because the DOJ represents the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but their brief shows they will depart from the commission’s position that gender identity should be a protected category until Title VII’s sex discrimination clause. In the brief, the DOJ argues that Congress didn’t include transgender people and gender identity when Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was originally passed, and Congress has not passed any efforts to add gender identity to the statute. “Under this Court’s precedent, proving discrimination because of sex under Title VII requires showing that an employer treated members of one sex less favorably than similarly situated members of the other sex,” the Justice Department said in its brief.

The DOJ’s brief isn’t the only noteworthy opinion on the case. Paul McHugh is the University Distinguished Service professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and he filed an amicus brief “not to discuss statutory construction but to critically evaluate, on the basis of his clinical and scientific expertise” in support of the concept that gender identity and sex are not the same thing, which basically supports the funeral home's case. The brief reads that he “seeks to discuss the frequently heard claims about gender identity, which sometimes masquerade as science but are really ideological pronouncements not supported by scientific evidence.”

Just last week a brief was filed by a group of people who appear to have all undergone gender reassignment surgeries or transitioned to some degree, and warn others about the dangers of transitioning through hormone replacement or surgeries. In their brief, they too tackle the subject of gender identity, sex, and transitioning, rather than law. Both amicus briefs provide an insightful look into the world of those who treat or who have identified as a different gender from a cultural, rather than a legal, perspective.

This case will be to gender identity what Obergefell v. Hodges was to same-sex marriage. It will be interesting to see who else steps in to add a perspective to this controversial legal case.

There's no need to focus on anonymously-sourced stories about Trump when he says bonkers stuff out in the open,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/theres-no-need-to-focus-on-anonymously-sourced-stories-about-trump-when-he-says-bonkers-stuff-out-in-the-open,"This past weekend followed a familiar pattern of stories about President Trump based on anonymous sources that get joked about and debated, then eventually denied.

In the most recent case, Axios, citing a number of officials anonymously, reported that Trump repeatedly inquired about the possibility of blasting hurricanes with nuclear weapons to stop them before they hit the shore. The story also quoted unnamed White House officials as defending Trump for having the right objective, downplaying any reason for panic. The reported idea has obviously not come into fruition.

On Monday morning, Trump tweeted, ""The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous. I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!""

Let me say at the outset, I don't question that Axios reporters Jonathan Swan and Margaret Talev were told Trump said such things. Also, there is some room between Trump's denial and the story — i.e., he could have asked about the possibility without actually affirmatively wanting to do it.

The problem with assessing stories such as this is that at this point, we know there are many people within the administration who do not agree with Trump — indeed, who see it as their duty to protect the country from him by reining him in. At the same time, people in position to be cited as high-ranking officials know that based on his statements and behavior in public, people will believe just about any story about Trump, and that there is an insatiable appetite for such stories. So the threshold for selling an outlandish story is much lower than the typical president.

But here's the thing. To me, there's no reason to get so worked about anonymously sourced stories at this point when there's so much that Trump says and does in full public view that's lamentable or absolutely bonkers.

Just last week, Trump vented about the disloyalty of Democratic voting American Jews, canceled a meeting with the leader of Denmark over the sale of Greenland, escalated his trade war with China on Twitter, called his own appointment to lead the Fed an ""enemy"" on par with the ruler of communist China, and then joked about the resulting stock market crash.

So critics and defenders have plenty of stuff to argue about without even debating the validity of the anonymously-sourced stuff."
State Department says removal of 'Palestinian Territories' from website isn't policy change,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jennifer Hansler', 'Andrew Carey']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/politics/state-department-website-palestinian-territories/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department on Monday denied that the removal of a listing for the Palestinian Territories from its website constituted a change in policy.

""Website is being updated. There has been no change to our policy,"" a State Department official said in a statement. Asked whether the listing would be added back to the website, the official reiterated that the site is being updated.

It is unclear when exactly the listing for the territories, which was once included as one of the ""countries and other areas"" under the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, was removed. It was active until at least February 2019, according to an archived version of the page. The State Department unveiled its modernized website in June 2019, and the link for the Palestinian Territories now redirects to a message about that modernization.

""Welcome to state.gov. We recently modernized our website. Part of this modernization was to reduce the number of pages on the current state.gov website by not moving items that are in existence on our archive sites. This keeps the content on the current state.gov current while older content remains intact and fully accessible on our archive sites,"" the message says.

The omission of the Palestinian Territories drew outrage from Palestinian officials.

Georgia governor on trade war with China: ‘Trust the president’,https://www.ajc.com,['Greg Bluestein'],,,,https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/georgia-governor-trade-war-with-china-trust-the-president/ifYrsLAJixIdkYlPtNB5LN/,"Gov. Brian Kemp had just begun a question-and-answer session with eight Asian-American business owners in Gwinnett County when Tim Le, a real estate investor, asked a question on many of their minds: With threats of a trade war looming, how does the U.S. economy keep growing?

Le and the other executives had spent the first 30 minutes lavishing praise on President Donald Trump and Kemp’s administration, praising the $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts that Congress adopted in 2017 and the governor’s promise to slash regulations.

But with Trump’s ongoing tit-for-tat trade war with China and the constant threat of new tariffs, Le and others wanted to know whether Kemp believed the American economy can withstand new threats of trade turbulation.

The governor said the tariffs have had a scattershot impact on Georgia businesses – some are hurting, other owners told him they are “exhausted” by all the new business. His message: He said he’s hopeful “that a lot of what’s gone on recently is posturing” and that the trade war is easing.

“We have to continue to trust the president, Sen. Perdue, Secretary Perdue – the whole team he’s got working on that,” said Kemp, of Sen. David Perdue and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, two Georgians who supported his campaign.

“China has taken advantage of us for a long time – really, the rest of the world. I’m no expert on trade, but I think we’ve probably waited too long to fight this battle. And people who are getting hurt from it even understand that.”

The event at a Peachtree Corners office park was part of a national series of Republican roundtables to highlight Trump’s economic agenda. But in Georgia it also had a different goal: To boost Asian-American support for Republicans in the 7th District, a competitive territory that stretches across parts of Gwinnett. .

Each of the eight business owners pledged to support Trump’s business agenda and work to encourage voters in the Asian-American community to vote next year.

“Thanks to President Trump’s tax cuts and less regulations, we have more money in our pockets and we’re able to hire more employees. We’re doing great,” Lonnie Vo, the owner of an auto repair shop, said to Kemp.

The sunny economic messaging contrasts with signs of fiscal turmoil ahead. Kemp has ordered 4% budget cuts this year and 6% next year, saying the slash is needed so he can pay for some of his top priorities, including another teacher pay raise.

Democrats have blasted his decision, sharpening their critiques after the Department of Community Health said it might have to lay off workers to meet the edict.

“I look forward to hearing why these cuts are necessary in a growing state with a lean budget and $2.55 billion in rainy day funds,” said Democratic state Rep. Sam Park.

Pressed on that question, Kemp criticized “political posturing” surrounding his orders to cut spending.

“They would be complaining if I took money out of the rainy day fund and kept the budget where it is,” he said. “We’re asking people to make government smaller and more efficient, and I believe you can do that without hurting services and programs.”

DOJ Increases Power Of Agency Running Immigration Court System,https://www.npr.org,['Richard Gonzales'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/23/753912351/doj-increases-power-of-agency-running-immigration-court-system,"DOJ Increases Power Of Agency Running Immigration Court System

Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP

The Trump administration is making changes to the agency that operates the nation's immigration court system, a move immediately denounced by the immigration judges' union as a power grab.

The agency is called the Executive Office for Immigration Review and it is an arm of the Justice Department. Under the interim rule announced Friday, the agency's director will have the power to issue appellate decisions in immigration cases that have not been decided within an allotted timeframe. It also creates a new office of policy within EOIR to implement the administration's immigration policies.

The head of the immigration judges' union accused the administration of trying to strip power away from judges and turn the immigration court system into a law enforcement agency.

""In an unprecedented attempt at agency overreach to dismantle the Immigration Court, the Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) today published a new interim rule, effective next Monday, which takes steps to dismantle the Immigration Court system,"" Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said in a statement. ""DOJ's action ends any transparency and assurance of independent decision making over individual cases.""

The new rule, first reported by The Associated Press, comes after the administration announced an effort to decertify the immigration judges' union. The judges, 440 in total, are employees of the Justice Department and not part of the independent judiciary. The Trump administration has also imposed quotas on judges in an effort to speed up deportations and reduce the backlog of more than 900,000 cases pending in immigration courts.

Tabaddor said the administration is trying to concentrate its power over immigration proceedings.

""The new rule is a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" Tabaddor said. ""While couched in bureaucratic language, the impact of this regulation is to substitute the policy directives of a single political appointee over the legal analysis of non-political, independent adjudicators.""

The EOIR did not respond to a call for comment.

Earlier this week, the EOIR sent the immigration judges a newsletter containing a blog post from VDare, an anti-immigration website, which included an anti-Semitic reference, according to Tabaddor. After she protested, Justice Department officials said some information included with the newsletter had been compiled by a third-party contractor and should not have been distributed.

""The Department of Justice condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest terms,"" Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for EOIR told BuzzFeed."

US Department of Interior meets with tribes in Bethel to hear public safety concerns,https://www.adn.com,[],08-25-2019,2019,8,https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2019/08/25/us-department-of-interior-meets-with-tribes-in-bethel-to-hear-public-safety-concerns/,"Representatives from the U.S. Department of the Interior visited Bethel on Wednesday to hear from tribal representatives about the public safety issues unique to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. The visit comes in the wake of Attorney General William Barr’s tour of the region for similar reasons.

For DOI Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Tara Sweeney, the visit to Bethel was a bit of a homecoming.

“At Kilbuck, Mrs. Han was my fifth grade teacher,” Sweeney said.

Sweeney is the first Alaska Native to be confirmed to her position. Growing up in Bethel and Utqiagvik, she says that she saw the problems with public safety in rural Alaskan communities firsthand.

“The issues that we are discussing today are prevalent in every Alaska Native village. Every family has been impacted by domestic violence, sexual assault, violent crimes,” Sweeney said. “So yes, this is personal.”

Sweeney says that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has heard about these issues for years. Now, DOI Chief of Staff Kate MacGregor says that the bureau has the support it needs to take action.

“The president earlier this year declared May 5 as national missing and murdered Native American Awareness Day,” MacGregor said. “So this is something that has been raised in profile.”

MacGregor said that it was important to note that several members of the White House were in attendance at the listening session. Charles Addington, Director of the BIA’s Office of Justice Services, thinks that funding will be available. The next step is figuring out where the BIA can get the biggest bang for its buck.

“Trying to figure out where do we already have things in place that we can just start enhancing,” Addington said. “Low-hanging fruit that we can start making a difference right away.”

The Association of Village Council Presidents had called for the listening session. Forty-seven of the 56 federally recognized tribes in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta sent representatives. AVCP Director of Communications Azara Mohammadi described some of their suggestions.

“There was a lot about restorative justice, there was a lot about resources for victims, and infrastructure came up again and again. Public safety infrastructure,"" she said.

She said that people in the Lower 48 take holding cells and office space for granted, but in many villages that infrastructure is either falling apart or doesn’t exist.

“I mean, if you just don’t have the physical space for it, it’s very difficult,” Mohammadi said.

Tribal representatives asked for more funding for VPSOs and tribal courts. Another request was for changing the funding process itself. AVCP Director of Tribal Justice Rick Garcia says that there are problems when villages have to apply for competitive grants every year.

“What competitive funding does, it puts neighbors against neighbors, it puts families against families,” Garcia said.

Garcia is hopeful. The listening session came just a few months after U.S. Attorney General William Barr visited Bethel to talk about public safety. Garcia said that this meeting struck a different tone.

Terror-sponsor Iran threatens Washington think tank with actions by 'security apparatuses',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-24-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/terror-sponsor-iran-threatens-washington-think-tank-with-actions-by-security-apparatuses,"Iran, an international sponsor of terrorism, has announced sanctions against a hawkish Washington think tank, threatening that any actions taken against it by ""security apparatuses"" will be ""considered legitimate"" by Tehran.

The ominous warning to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and its chief executive officer Mark Dubowitz was carried in state-controlled media, which cited a law titled ""Countering America’s Human Rights Violation and Adventurous and Terrorist Actions” that was passed by the Iranian Parliament in 2017.

Iran's foreign ministry said the move had been made because of ""economic terrorism"" by the FDD, which has been sharply critical of the Iran nuclear deal and has advocated harsh American sanctions against the theocratic regime.

""Accordingly, taking any actions by the judicial and security apparatuses against the FDD and their Iranian and non-Iranian accomplices will be considered legitimate as their actions are against the Iran’s national security and the interests of Iranian people and government,"" the state-run Mehr news agency wrote.

The think tank addressed the news in a statement, and its leader Mark Dubowitz told the Washington Examiner, ""The regime has a history of targeted assassinations on European soil, places in the Gulf, Latin America, Asia ... We're treating it as a targets list, not a sanctions list.""

""I do think we have a sufficient profile with the U.S. administration, with Congress, and other allies that if the Iranians went after us, this would be a significant escalatory step,"" he continued. ""But, I also don't want to say that that necessarily will deter their behavior. They tried to assassinate a Saudi ambassador in Cafe Milano right in the heart of Washington, D.C.""

Dubowitz said the group would not be backing down, however.

""It just incentivizes us to redouble our efforts in researching and investigating the malign and destructive activities of Iran,"" he said.

A spokesperson for the State Department indicated that the U.S. is taking ""the regime's threats seriously"" and vowed to ""hold Iran responsible"" for compromising the safety of Americans.

The outlaw regime in Iran issued a threat today against @FDD, an American think tank, and its CEO. The U.S. takes the regime’s threats seriously. We intend to hold Iran responsible for directly or indirectly compromising the safety of any American. — Morgan Ortagus (@statedeptspox) August 25, 2019

Since its theocratic regime was established in 1979, Iran has been behind numerous terrorist activities throughout the world, often through its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. In 2011, its plan to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the U.S. at the Cafe Milano restaurant in Washington's Georgetown district was thwarted and one of the plotters sentenced to 25 years."
"Pence cheered during SC fundraiser amid 2024 rumors, while Sanford told to 'take a hike'",https://www.postandcourier.com,"['Jamie Lovegrove Jlovegrove Postandcourier.Com', 'Jamie Lovegrove', 'Andy Shain Ashain Postandcourier.Com', 'Caitlin Byrd Cbyrd Postandcourier.Com', 'Book', 'Meg Kinnard']",,,,https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/pence-cheered-during-sc-fundraiser-amid-rumors-while-sanford-told/article_425d86ae-c813-11e9-a355-1b23c66833d4.html,"ANDERSON — Vice President Mike Pence told an enthusiastic crowd of 3,000 conservatives Monday night that he was in South Carolina's Upstate for only one reason: to ensure President Donald Trump wins reelection next year.

""It's time for round two, everybody,"" Pence said at U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan's 9th annual Faith and Freedom BBQ fundraiser. ""It's on.""

Pence listed a litany of what he views as the strongest accomplishments of the Trump administration, including low unemployment, increased military spending and a raft of new conservative judges.

But Pence's stated reason for making the trip could not entirely tamp down speculation that 2020 may not be the only election on his mind.

The event marked Pence's third visit this year alone to South Carolina — a state that is unlikely to be particularly competitive in next year's general election but will play a critical early-voting role in the 2024 GOP presidential primaries.

""Any political observer would understand that an incumbent vice president is in good standing for the next open election,"" Greenville GOP chairman Nate Leupp said. ""These are the political players of the Upstate. Five years from now, they're not going to forget that Pence came here.""

Pence previously came down to visit an ""Opportunity Zone"" in Columbia, applauding U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., for getting the development tax credits for economically distressed areas included in the 2017 tax bill. And he helped U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., kick-off his reelection campaign with rallies in Myrtle Beach and Greenville.

The possibility of Pence running for president himself could potentially set him on a collision course with South Carolina's own former Gov. Nikki Haley, who remains popular in her home state and has her own ties to Trump as his former ambassador to the United Nations.

""It would be a hard choice,"" said David Cantrell, 53, a realtor from Anderson, on the possibility of a Pence-Haley primary contest. ""I'd have to do some soul-searching on that one.""

Some in the crowd Monday night said they would hope to see Pence and Haley on the same ticket. Others said they are skeptical that either of them have planned that far ahead — but they acknowledged it would make sense.

""If Pence is planning to run, it's smart of him to do this,"" said Pickens County GOP chairman Rick Tate of the vice president's appearance at Duncan's popular fundraiser. ""But he's playing in Nikki Haley's sandbox, so to speak.""

Touting new trade deal

Another impetus for Pence's S.C. trip was to promote the new trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada that is awaiting congressional approval.

The proposed deal, known as the USMCA, would update but not drastically overhaul the original North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which took effect in 1994 and reduced trade barriers between the three nations.

The Trump administration has made the new trade agreement a top priority and is pushing Congress to approve it when they return from August recess next month, hence Pence's tour of various states to rally public support for it.

Before Pence spoke at Anderson's Sargent Metal Fabricators, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer moderated a panel on the USMCA with three Republican members of Congress from South Carolina: U.S. Reps. William Timmons of Greenville, Ralph Norman of Rock Hill and Tom Rice of Myrtle Beach.

""This is long overdue,"" Timmons said of the deal, complaining that ""politics is the only thing getting in the way"" of ratification. All three said they expect the deal to pass overwhelmingly if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., brings it up for a vote.

Some Democrats have raised concerns about the deal's provisions — or lack thereof — regarding climate, labor, enforcement and pharmaceutical companies. But negotiators on both sides have expressed increasing optimism in recent months that those issues can be addressed.

Pence urged the crowd to tell South Carolina's two Democratic congressmen, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of Columbia and U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham of Charleston, to vote for the deal.

In a statement to The Post and Courier, Clyburn said he is continuing to work with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to improve provisions in the agreement.

""I am hopeful that the ongoing discussions will address the remaining concerns that I share with many of my colleagues and make it possible for Congress to approve the deal,"" Clyburn said.

Cunningham joined several other freshman Democrats in writing a letter to Pelosi last month that praised ""frank and productive"" talks with the Trump administration and called for a vote on the renegotiated trade deal by the end of the year.

""We are optimistic that the remaining gaps can be bridged if all parties engage with good faith and pragmatism,"" the letter said.

Not everyone received such a welcoming reception at Duncan's BBQ.

Mark Sanford faced some hostile crowds as the former South Carolina congressman and governor continues to consider challenging Trump in a GOP primary.

Several attendees waved Trump campaign signs in front of Sanford's face, and others yelled, ""take a hike"" and ""go back to Argentina"" — a reference to Sanford's 2009 extramarital affair in South America while he was governor.

""He's an idiot,"" said Jim Wheeler, 71, a retired veteran from Greenwood. ""Doesn't he understand that we love Trump? Why would he run?""

Sanford appeared largely unfazed by the reaction, expecting not to be greeted particularly warmly by such a pro-Trump crowd.

An overwhelming majority of Republicans in Sanford's home state say they don't want him to run, according to a recent Post and Courier-Change Research poll.

“He’s a failed congressman, failed governor, and he’s more than welcome to fail at this too,” said Joe Jackson, the Republican National Committee's South Carolina spokesman.

Still, Sanford said he's continuing to consider the idea and wanted to ""kick around some ideas"" with Upstate conservatives.

""I've been in a lot of different political contests and battles over the years,"" he said. ""Put it his way, I've seen a lot worse and been through a lot worse.""

Several other Trump critics held counter events in Anderson during the fundraiser: his leading Democratic opponents.

Representatives from the campaigns of former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker all came together to speak at Welfare Baptist Church in a ""show of unity"" against Trump, according to Biden's campaign."

The Environmental Protection Agency has failed to set proper regulations on smog and must improve its air quality standards ruled a federal appeals court last week.

In a case fought between Murray Energy Corporation, a massive coal company, and Earthjustice, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reviewed massive amounts of scientific evidence to determine if the EPA’s current air quality standards were sufficient.

The court ruled that current air quality standards for the ozone are too weak to protect the environment and do not meet basic federal requirements for protecting human health.

Although the case is a great win, unfortunately the court only fully recognized the scientific evidence of air pollution on forests and other natural landscapes.

“We are disappointed that the court failed to recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence showing ozone’s potential to cause premature death, difficulty breathing, wheezing and coughing, and asthma attacks at levels previously considered safe,” Harold P. Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. “Such evidence demands that EPA adopt stronger, more protective standards, not backslide on the progress being made toward cleaning up the air we breathe.”

The case was important in highlighting how effective strong scientific evidence can be when arguing during a trial.

“As President Trump’s EPA considers weakening science-based protections, that fact should give the agency pause as it goes out of its way to either dismantle science advisory boards, or fire independent scientists and replace them with fossil fuel lobbyists,” said Senator Tom Carper, a member of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, in a statement.

Murray Energy also attempted to argue that the EPA should consider costs incurred by industry groups and corporations when they are forced to comply with new and updated regulations. The court rejected this argument, stating “The plain text of the [Clean Air] Act unambiguously bars cost considerations.”

Seth Johnson, the attorney who worked the case on behalf of Earthjustice was positive about its outcome. The EPA “must go back and fix its mistakes so cherished natural spaces like national parks can thrive,” he said after the ruling."
"Department of Energy Releases Annual Wind Market Reports, Finding Robust Wind Power Installations and Falling Prices",https://www.energy.gov,[],,,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-releases-annual-wind-market-reports-finding-robust-wind-power,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released annual market reports documenting data and trends in wind installations, technologies, costs, prices, and performance through the end of 2018 for three sectors: utility-scale land-based, offshore, and distributed wind.

“Onshore wind energy installation continues to grow across the country, and this Administration has proven that we can pursue renewable energy advancements and deployment, particularly wind energy resources, which are predicted to surpass other sources of renewable power generation this year,” said Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes. “And with over 25 gigawatts in the development pipeline, U.S. offshore wind is poised to be a significant part of our comprehensive energy portfolio in the coming years.”

The utility-scale land-based wind sector had another strong year with 7,588 megawatts (MW) installed during 2018, accompanied by record low costs and prices. The U.S. distributed wind sector now stands at 1,127 MW from over 83,000 wind turbines across all 50 states. And the U.S. offshore wind industry has a pipeline of 25,824 MW in various stages of development.

The 2018 Wind Technologies Market Report, prepared by DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, found the following:

The U.S. wind industry installed 7,588 MW of capacity last year, bringing total utility-scale wind capacity to over 96 gigawatts (GW).

Wind industry employment is at an all-time high, supporting 114,000 jobs.

In total, 41 states operated utility-scale wind projects. Texas leads the nation with nearly 25 GW of wind capacity, while California, Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma have more than 5 GW.

Wind energy provides 6.5% of the nation’s electricity, more than 10% of total generation in 14 states, and more than 30% in Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma.

The trend of installing wind turbines that are larger and more powerful continued in 2018. Read more about these size and performance trends.

The price of wind energy being sold in long-term contracts is at an all-time low. Wind power purchase agreement (PPA) prices are below 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, driven by a combination of higher capacity factors, declining turbine prices and operating costs, low interest rates, and the production tax credit.

The 2018 Distributed Wind Market Report, prepared by DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, highlights the following:

Distributed wind power is used at or near where it is generated, as opposed to wind power from wholesale generation, where power is sent to consumers via transmission lines and substations.

Employed by households, schools, farms, industrial facilities, and municipalities, distributed wind doesn’t only refer to small-scale turbines; it includes any size turbine or array of turbines that generates power for local or on-site use.

U.S. wind turbines in distributed applications reached a cumulative installed capacity of 1,127 MW in 2018. This capacity comes from over 83,000 turbines installed across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam.

The trend of using larger wind turbines in distributed applications continued in 2018. The average capacity of large-scale turbines installed in distributed applications in 2018 was 2.1 MW—almost double the capacity of turbines used in 2003.

Commercial and industrial distributed wind projects increased in 2018, representing 29% of total project capacity. Distributed wind for utility customers remained the most prevalent use, representing 47% of capacity in 2018. Read more about the customers of U.S. distributed wind.

Of small wind turbines (nameplate capacity up to 100 kilowatts) deployed in the United States, very small turbines—less than 1 kW— are contributing an increasingly larger percentage of both the total number of turbines (99%) and capacity (47%) of small wind projects. These systems are often used for battery charging and are sometimes integrated with solar PV panels to power remote infrastructure.

The 2018 Offshore Wind Technologies Market Report, prepared by DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, found the following:

The U.S. offshore wind project development pipeline grew to a potential generating capacity of 25,824 MW across 13 states, including the Block Island Wind Farm commissioned in 2016.

Projects totaling 21,225 MW have exclusive site control, meaning the developer has a lease or other contract to develop the site. Most of these projects are on the Eastern seaboard, with one in the Great Lakes.

California and Hawaii have several early-stage floating offshore wind projects in the planning phase.

The Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) auctions for three lease areas off the coast of Massachusetts brought in winning bids of $135 million—more than three times the value of previous BOEM auctions—indicating strong interest and confidence in the U.S. offshore wind market.

Offtake prices for the first commercial-scale U.S. offshore wind project—Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts—came in lower than expected at $65–$75 per megawatt-hour.

Technology trends toward larger turbines continued, with offshore turbines installed globally in 2018 averaging 5.5 MW, and turbines with capacities of 10­–12 MW coming to market in the next couple years. Read more about offshore trends.

DOJ moves to add more marijuana growers for research,https://fox59.com,['Associated Press'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://fox59.com/2019/08/26/doj-moves-to-add-more-marijuana-growers-for-research/,"× DOJ moves to add more marijuana growers for research

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said Monday it would move forward to expand the number of marijuana growers for federally authorized cannabis research.

The long-awaited move comes after researchers filed court papers asking a judge to compel the Drug Enforcement Administration to process the applications to grow research pot. The DEA began accepting applications to grow marijuana for federally approved research about three years ago, but the agency hasn’t acted on the applications.

Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Congress have questioned why the Justice Department has taken so long to act. Attorney General William Barr had promised to look into the status of the applications in April.

Facing a deadline to respond to a court filing, the DEA signaled Monday it will process 33 applications with the goal of helping scientists develop “safe and effective drug products.”

In June, applicant Scottsdale Research Institute in Arizona asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to order the DEA to process the applications. The court told the DEA to respond by Wednesday. Dr. Sue Sisley of the research institute said she considers this a victory.

For years, the University of Mississippi has been the only entity federally licensed to produce marijuana for research . Researchers have complained in recent years that the cannabis produced there is not like the cannabis sold in states where medical and so-called recreational marijuana is legal.

“This is why we filed this lawsuit: to get this program moving after three years of stagnancy,” said Matthew Zorn, an attorney who represents the Scottsdale Research Institute.

The move announced Monday would give researchers a wider variety of cannabis to study, Uttam Dhillon, the DEA’s acting administrator, said in a statement.

“DEA is making progress in the program to register additional marijuana growers for federally authorized research, and will work with other relevant federal agencies to expedite the necessary next steps,” Dhillon said.

The agency is also planning to propose new regulations that would govern the program and help the agency evaluate the applications.

“I am pleased that DEA is moving forward with its review of applications for those who seek to grow marijuana legally to support research,” Barr said."
Fact check of Trump and G-7,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Glenn Kessler', 'The Fact Checker', 'August At Am']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/27/fact-checking-president-trumps-g-news-conference/,"In a lengthy news conference at the conclusion of the Group of Seven summit of industrialized democracies, President Trump made numerous false, misleading or inaccurate statements on a variety of issues. Here’s a tour through some of the more noteworthy ones, in the order in which he made them.

“The tariffs have hit them [China] very hard. In a fairly short period of time, the United States will have collected over $100 billion in tariffs.”

As we have repeatedly noted, U.S. tariffs are a tax on the American people, not China. The tariffs are generally paid by importers, such as U.S. companies, who in turn pass on most or all of the costs to consumers or producers who may use Chinese materials in their products. (Technically, we should note that as a matter of demand and supply elasticities, Chinese producers will pay part of the tax if there are fewer goods sold to the United States.)

Numerous economic studies have found that the tariffs are costing American households hundreds of dollars a year. Moreover, China has retaliated by hiking duties on U.S. exports, costing the U.S. the equivalent of about $40 billion a year in lost exports. That’s why Trump has already spent $28 billion to bail out farmers who have lost access to Chinese markets.

Trump never appears to factor in those costs when he claims the United States will soon have collected $100 billion in tariffs. We’re not sure where that figure comes from. Comparing the customs revenue in the monthly Treasury statement before and after Trump started imposing tariffs on China in March 2018, we estimate that thus far, an additional $37 billion has been raised through the end of July. Not all of that is on Chinese goods — Trump has imposed other tariffs — so he’s barely breaking even.

“The United States, which has never collected 10 cents from China.”

This is false. Tariffs have been collected on Chinese goods since the early days of the Republic. President George Washington signed the Tariff Act of 1789, when trade between China and the United States was already established. Tariffs on Chinese imports have generated at least $8 billion every year since 2009.

“Iran is a country that is not the same country that it was 2½ years ago when I came into office.”

This is a favorite line for Trump, and it’s wrong. He claims the administration’s “maximum pressure” policy has left Iran unable to continue its regional activities. Although the administration’s sanctions have had a significant impact on Iran’s economy, there are also clear signs of Iran’s continued support for proxies and an aggressive stance against sanctions. We detailed the problems with this claim in this video:

“We made a ridiculous deal. We gave them $150 billion, we gave them $1.8 billion, and we got nothing. We got nothing.”

This is yet another Bottomless Pinocchio claim. Trump often makes it sound like the United States cut a check to Iran as part of the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). He also always uses too high an estimate, $150 billion, for the assets involved.

But this was always Iran’s money. Iran had billions of dollars frozen in foreign banks around the globe because of international sanctions over its nuclear program. The Treasury Department estimated that once Iran fulfilled other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. The Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion.

As for the $1.8 billion (actually, $1.7 billion), this was related to the settlement of a decades-old claim between the two countries, not the Iran nuclear agreement. An initial payment of $400 million was handed over on Jan. 17, 2016, the day after Iran released four American detainees, including The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian. The timing — which U.S. officials insisted was a coincidence — suggested the cash could be viewed as a ransom payment.

But the initial cash payment was Iran’s money. In the 1970s, the then pro-Western Iranian government under the shah paid $400 million for U.S. military equipment. The equipment was never delivered because the two countries broke off relations after the seizure of American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Iran. Two other payments totaling $1.3 billion — a negotiated agreement on the interest owed on the $400 million — came some weeks later.

“That [Iran nuclear] agreement was so short-term that it expires in a very short period of time. With a country, you don’t make a deal that short. Countries last for long times, and you don’t do short-term deals, especially when you’re paying that kind of money.”

The JCPOA was adopted in October 2015 and formally implemented on Jan. 16, 2016, by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council — China, France, Russia, Britain and the United States — and Germany and Iran.

We have previously examined Trump’s claim that the deal would expire in seven years and Iran was then free to build nuclear weapons. It’s not clear what he meant, but he may have been referring to “Termination Day” in October 2025, when provisions of a U.N. resolution endorsing the deal expire, or he may have been referring to the fact that some provisions of the JCPOA itself expire 10 years into the deal, in 2026.

But as a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran has pledged not to develop nuclear weapons — ever. In agreeing to the JCPOA, Iran recommitted itself to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iran also agreed to abide by the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Additional Protocol. It has committed to ratify this agreement in 2023.

Other parts of the JCPOA would remain in force for years after 2026, including international monitoring of Iran’s production of uranium ore and centrifuge parts and restrictions on uranium enrichment and reprocessing of spent fuel.

“They’re allowed to test ballistic missiles. You’re not allowed to go to various sites to check. And some of those sites are the most obvious sites for the creation or the making of nuclear weapons.”

Trump is generally wrong about inspections. Under the JCPOA, Iran’s declared nuclear sites, such as the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, will be under continuous monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency — and the IAEA would have immediate access. Under the deal, for 10 years, Iran will have limits on the enrichment permitted at Natanz; the IAEA will be able to keep close tabs on the production. The JCPOA even allows IAEA monitoring of Iran’s centrifuge production and storage facilities, the procurement chain, and mining and milling of uranium — verification measures that many experts say exceed previous negotiated nuclear deals.

The issue involves the question of what to do if the IAEA learns of suspicious activity at an undeclared site. The IAEA can demand instant access — but Iran could refuse. So the JCPOA sets up a process to resolve the standoff, described in a 29-page document known as Annex 1, that could take up to 24 days to resolve.

This provision was added to remove a loophole in the Additional Protocol, which requires IAEA access to suspect sites in 24 hours but does not have immediate consequences for a nation that refuses to permit access. Some critics have said the 24-day time frame is too long, but that’s not the same as having no access as Trump claimed.

As for missiles, it’s worth recalling that the JCPOA was the product of lengthy negotiations. Iran insisted the deal was limited to the nuclear program, not its missile program. Limits on Iran’s ballistic missiles thus have been handled under U.N. Security Council resolutions, including the one that implemented the deal, which helped slow down Iran’s missile development. In theory, if Iran cannot develop nuclear weapons, it makes the missile program less fearsome.

“China has been taking out of this country $500-plus billion a year for many, many years — many, many years.”

Trump consistently inflates the U.S. trade deficit with China. It was $380 billion in 2018, $337 billion in 2017 and $309 billion in 2016, according to the Commerce Department. Notice that it has continued to grow under Trump.

As we often note, countries do not make or lose money on trade deficits.

A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. No matter what, people are receiving goods in exchange for their money.

“I’ve spent — and I think I will, in a combination of loss and opportunity, probably it’ll cost me anywhere from $3 billion to $5 billion to be president.”

Trump offers no evidence for this claim. It’s highly dubious, especially when he may not even be worth much more than $3 billion. (Yes, Trump claims he’s worth $10 billion, but Forbes has run the numbers and estimated $3.1 billion.) Note that Trump refers to a “loss and opportunity,” which suggests he’s counting deals that were only a figment of his imagination.

“I ran one election, and I won. Happened to be for president.”

Trump often rewrites his biography to gloss over the fact that he unsuccessfully sought the Reform Party nomination in the 2000 cycle. He announced the creation of a presidential exploratory committee on Oct. 7, 1999, but officially ended his campaign on Feb. 14, 2000.

“Having to do with a certain section of Ukraine, that you know very well, where it was, sort of, taken away from President Obama; not taken away from President Trump, taken away from President Obama. President Obama was not happy that this happened because it was embarrassing to him, right? It was very embarrassing to him. And he wanted Russia to be out of the — what was called the G-8. And that was his determination.”

There are so many things wrong in this passage, made as Trump defended his effort to invite Russia to the next G-7 meeting. Russia, under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, in 2014 seized the Crimea section of Ukraine, in violation of international law. Crimea was not taken from Obama, as Trump oddly claimed, but from Ukraine.

The decision to expel Russia from the Group of Eight — and to refuse to participate in a planned summit at Sochi, Russia — was unanimously approved by the other seven members in an effort to punish Russia for its actions. The action was also accompanied by sanctions on Russia by the assembled group.

“International law prohibits the acquisition of part or all of another state’s territory through coercion or force,” the G-7 communique said. “To do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built. We condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea in violation of Ukraine’s constitution. We also strongly condemn Russia’s illegal attempt to annex Crimea in contravention of international law and specific international obligations. We do not recognize either.”

Putin has remained unrepentant about the seizure of Crimea and has not met the demands set by the G-7 to allow Russia to return to the annual gathering.

“If it was annexed during my term, I’d say, ‘Sorry, folks. I made a mistake.’ Or, ‘Sorry folks.’ ”

Hmmm. How often has Trump said he was sorry — or that he made a mistake?

"Pro Farmer National Corn, Soybean Yield Estimate Below USDA Forecast",https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/pro-farmer-national-corn-soybean-yield-estimate-below-usda-forecast,"Corn: 13.358 billion bu.; Average yield of 163.3 bu. per acre

Corn +/- 1% = 13.492 billion bu. to 13.224 billion bu.; 164.9 bu. to 161.7 bu. per acre

Soybeans: 3.497 billion bu.; Average yield of 46.1 bu. per acre

Soybeans +/- 2% = 3.567 billion bu. to 3.427 billion bu.; 47.0 bu. to 45.2 bu. per acre

The national estimates above reflect Pro Farmer’s view on production and yields. They take into account data gathered during Crop Tour and other factors, such as crop maturity, acreage adjustments we’ve made, historical differences in Tour data versus USDA’s final yields, areas outside those sampled on Crop Tour, etc. That’s why the state yield numbers below differ from the Crop Tour figures.

Thousands of farmers, agribusiness executives and national and local media attended a series of meetings across the Midwest this week as part of the annual Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour. The Crop Tour focused on crop conditions going into the final stretch of the 2019 growing season.

Pro Farmer, a division of Farm Journal, shared its much-anticipated production estimates for the 2019 U.S. corn and soybean crops after analyzing information from the 27th annual tour and other sources.

The Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour unveiled the stresses the corn and soybean crops faced following an excessively wet spring and record-slow planting pace this year. Scouts on Crop Tour sampled around 3,000 fields across the Corn Belt in seven of the nation’s most important corn and soybean states.

Pro Farmer estimates the 2019 U.S. corn crop at 13.358 billion bushels, based on an average yield of 163.3 bu. per acre. That compares to USDA’s Aug. 1 estimate of 169.5 bu. per acre. For soybeans, the Pro Farmer production estimate is 3.497 billion bushels, with a national average yield of 46.1 bu. per acre, down from the 48.5 bu. per acre USDA estimated in August.

“Ear counts were lower than last year in all of the Crop Tour states as a result of the rough spring conditions,” said Brian Grete, Pro Farmer editor. “We also found a corn crop that was, in many cases, multiple weeks behind in maturity due to the record-slow planting.”

Jeff Wilson, Pro Farmer’s senior market analyst, said, “Soybean pod counts in a 3-foot by 3-foot square were down sharply across the

EPA ordered to set stronger smog standards,https://thehill.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458608-epa-ordered-to-set-stronger-smog-standards,"A federal appeals court has ruled in a case battling Obama-era pollution regulations that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must set stronger regulations on smog in order to protect the environment.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that while the EPA's current air quality standards for ozone are too weak to protect the environment, the standards do meet federal requirements when it comes to protecting human health.

Seth Johnson, an attorney who argued the case on behalf of Earthjustice, said the case gets to the heart of the Clean Air Act’s requirement that the EPA protect forests and natural landscapes from the ozone damage that can inhibit their growth.

The EPA “must go back and fix its mistakes so cherished natural spaces like national parks can thrive,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT

But advocates warned that a win for park was not necessarily a win for people.

“We are disappointed that the court failed to recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence showing ozone’s potential to cause premature death, difficulty breathing, wheezing and coughing, and asthma attacks at levels previously considered safe,” Harold P. Wimmer, national president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. “Such evidence demands that EPA adopt stronger, more protective standards, not backslide on the progress being made toward cleaning up the air we breathe.”

While ozone helps create a protective layer in the stratosphere to protect the earth from the sun’s ultraviolet light, when at ground-level, the gas can contribute to asthma attacks and other respiratory issues.

The suit was initially brought by Murray Energy Corporation, one of the largest coal companies in the U.S.

Environmentalists and Democrats alike said the suit showed the importance of scientific evidence at trial.

Johnson said data from the EPA helped it make its case in portions of the suit, while a lack of scientific data hindered it in other areas of the case.

A spokesperson for the EPA said it was reviewing the decision.

The court also rejected the argument from industry groups that the EPA should consider costs incurred by industry groups as they try to comply with regulations.

“The plain text of the [Clean Air] Act unambiguously bars cost considerations,” the opinion said.

Johnson said he expects the EPA will have to consider human health as it reevaluates the standards through 2020."
Senior DHS official exits amid department leadership changes,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/dhs-andrew-meehan-leaving/index.html,"(CNN) A senior official in the Department of Homeland Security will leave the agency next month, marking the latest top DHS official to leave the administration in recent months.

Acting DHS public affairs Assistant Secretary Andrew Meehan decided to resign two weeks ago and his last day will be Sept. 20, according to a DHS official. Meehan has been a close confidant of acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, joining him at DHS headquarters to run the public affairs office.

Meehan, who also oversaw public affairs at Customs and Border Protection, is the latest public affairs official expected to leave the department. Earlier this week, Customs and Border Protection press secretary Katharine Gorka told CNN she was leaving her post at the end of the week. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Assistant Director of Public Affairs Carol Danko recently left the agency amid pressure from DHS, according to a source familiar with the decision.

Meehan's departure comes amid speculation that McAleenan won't last in the secretary role. Earlier this summer, McAleenan went to the White House prepared to resign, CNN reported. He was concerned about an immigration enforcement operation and felt he was being undermined by subordinate immigration hardliners who had a direct line to the President.

Meehan is in Panama this week with McAleenan for a ministerial meeting focused on enhancing regional cooperation and combating irregular migration. This, after a tense week between the White House and DHS over the rollout of a new rule on migrant children in government custody , according to a source familiar with the matter. The source said the White House had asked McAleenan to delay his departure for Panama to hold a news conference about the rule.

Meehan's resignation was not connected to the rollout, according to a source.

A separate source familiar with the situation told CNN that ""micromanagement by White House officials have made it close to impossible for the department to carry out its mission.""

Senior policy adviser Stephen ""Miller and others will bypass leadership and communicate directly with lower level staff whom they view as controllable and direct actions. No organization can operate that way and we should expect more senior officials to leave,"" the source said.

CORRECTION: This story has been updated to add ""acting"" to Meehan's job title as DHS public affairs assistant secretary."
