"Trump's agenda hampered by troubling number of lower court injunctions, Barr says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Edmund Demarche', 'Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-agenda-hampered-by-troubling-number-of-lower-court-injuctions-barr-says,"Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday said he has noticed a troubling trend of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts that have taken their toll on President Trump’s agenda and threaten the political process for future administrations.

Barr, who has been accused by Democrats of protecting Trump after the release of the Mueller report, told the American Law Institute that there is a new trend of judicial ""willingness"" to review executive action, which injects courts into the political process.

He pointed to the district court in California that in January 2018 issued a temporary injunction to block the Trump administration from ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.

DACA has protected about 800,000 people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children or came with families who overstayed visas. The Obama-era program includes hundreds of thousands of college-age students.

U.S. District Judge William Alsup said at the time that lawyers in favor of DACA demonstrated that the immigrants “were likely to suffer serious, irreparable harm” without court action. The judge also said the lawyers have a strong chance of succeeding at trial.

The White House was swift to criticize these lower court injunctions and called this particular decision “outrageous.” Vice President Mike Pence recently said the administration will ask the Supreme Court to bar them.

""So what have these nationwide injunction wrought? Dreamers remain in limbo, the political process has been pre-empted, and we have had over a year of bitter political division that included a government shutdown of unprecedented length,"" Barr said.

ROGER FISK: BARR CAN'T SAVE TRUMP FROM HIMSELF

Barr said nationwide injunctions violate the separation of powers. He said that since Trump took office, there have been 37 nationwide injunctions — more than one a month -- against his office and he said there is likely no end in sight. He said, by comparison, there were two instances where district courts issued an injunction in President Obama’s first two years.

The Associated Press wrote that this is “the latest example of Barr moving to embrace Trump’s political talking points.” Its report pointed out the Trump criticized these rulings at a rally earlier this month, saying, “activist judges who issue nationwide injunctions based on their personal beliefs, which undermine democracy and threaten the rule of law.”

Barr has brushed aside criticism from Democrats that he is in the president’s pocket. He told the Wall Street Journal in a recent interview that he is defending the presidency, not Trump.

"Trump Administration Could Blacklist China’s Hikvision, a Surveillance Firm",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Ana Swanson', 'Edward Wong']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/us/politics/hikvision-trump.html,"“Taking this step would be a tangible signal to both U.S. and foreign companies that the U.S. government is looking carefully at what is happening in Xinjiang and is willing to take action in response,” said Jessica Batke, a former State Department official who has done research in Xinjiang and testified before Congress on the issue. “At the same time, however, the ongoing trade war perhaps undercuts the perception that this is coming from a place of purely human rights concerns.”

The Commerce Department and the White House declined to comment.

On Wednesday, the China’s foreign ministry urged countries to treat Chinese companies fairly.

“We have repeatedly stated that China opposes the United States’s practice of abusing state power and arbitrarily discrediting and suppressing foreign enterprises, including Chinese enterprises,” Lu Kang, a ministry spokesman, said at a regular briefing in Beijing in a response to a question about the possibility of blacklisting Hikvision.

Hikvision is little known in the United States, but the company supplies large parts of China’s extensive surveillance system. The company’s products include traffic cameras, thermal cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles, and they now allow Chinese security agencies to monitor railway stations, roads and other sites.

It is not immediately clear what effect a United States ban would have on Hikvision’s business. The company appears to source just a small portion of its components from the United States, and any such ban could speed its efforts to switch to Chinese suppliers.

But Hikvision does have a growing international presence, and its executives have warned in the past about the potential for rising anti-China sentiment in the United States to affect its operations. The company says it has more than 34,000 global employees and dozens of divisions worldwide, and it has supplied products to the Beijing Olympics, the Brazilian World Cup and the Linate Airport in Milan. It has tried to expand into North America in recent years, employing hundreds of workers in the United States and Canada, setting up offices in California and building a North American research and development team headquartered in Montreal.

In a letter published in English in April, Hikvision’s chief compliance officer said that the company was taking reports that video surveillance products had been involved in human rights violations seriously and had commissioned an internal review of its operations to enhance screening standards to better protect human rights. “We are taking a hard look at our products and business,” the officer, Huang Fanghong, wrote."
"Angry Dem says Trump ‘raping the country,’ as impeachment push nears critical mass",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/angry-dem-says-trump-raping-the-country-as-impeachment-push-nears-critical-mass,"A rapid-fire string of developments has congressional Democrats putting increased pressure on party brass to launch impeachment proceedings against President Trump, with one rank-and-file lawmaker reportedly saying the president is “raping the country” and others indicating it's only a matter of time before leadership changes course on the politically fraught issue.

Amid the internal tensions, Speaker Nancy Pelosi called a special meeting of House Democrats for Wednesday morning, where the impeachment issue and other battles are expected to be discussed.

Prior meetings involving Pelosi and top Democrats held Monday evening escalated into heated exchanges, with the party torn over how to address Trump controversies -- most recently, the decision to block the former White House counsel from testifying. Democratic leaders, who for the most part have not been publicly in favor of impeachment, are now finding it difficult to maintain their position as calls grow from the ranks to flip that switch.

HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN NADLER: TRUMP IS MAKING IT 'MORE DIFFICULT' NOT TO CONSIDER IMPEACHMENT

A senior House Democrat told Fox News late Monday that Pelosi “isn’t going to be able to hold off on impeachment much longer,” and that the speaker may have to change her position “within the next two weeks.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., while saying Pelosi is working to bring the party together, suggested Tuesday that politics are the main element preventing members from pressing ahead at this stage.

“Just as impeaching without cause could be construed, and is, politically motivated, choosing to not impeach when there is an abundance of cause could also be construed similarly,” she told reporters.

Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., reportedly confronted Pelosi during a Democratic Steering and Policy Committee meeting as he demanded the president's impeachment. According to Politico, Cohen said that while former President Bill Clinton was impeached “over sex,” Trump was “raping the country.”

Cohen reportedly suggested Pelosi is worried about politics in her reluctance to proceed, but Pelosi countered, “This isn’t about politics at all. It’s about patriotism.”

Cohen is among the most outspoken Trump critics in Congress. He drew attention by eating fried chicken during a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing as a commentary on Attorney General Bill Barr’s refusal to testify. Cohen referred to the attorney general as “Chicken Barr,” despite Barr having testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee the previous day. Cohen has also called for the House to use its inherent contempt power to throw Barr in the Capitol jail.

But as House Democrats weigh contempt proceedings for Barr, another fight broke out Monday after former White House Counsel Don McGahn was instructed by the president's team to defy a subpoena from the same committee. Democrats wanted him to testify regarding information he provided to the Special Counsel's Office, but the White House directed him not to appear, with the Justice Department asserting he has immunity from testimony about his official duties.

""The Democrats do not like the conclusion of the Mueller investigation – no collusion, no conspiracy, and no obstruction – and want a wasteful and unnecessary do-over,"" Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said after a closed-door meeting with Pelosi that Trump is “making it very difficult to avoid” considering impeachment.

Pelosi insisted that her party remains united, saying Tuesday that she's not feeling pressure from colleagues.

“There’s no divide,” she said a day earlier. “We’re fine. We’re good.”

Nadler, meanwhile, told CNN’s Chris Cuomo that he intends to hold McGahn in contempt of Congress for not complying with the subpoena. Nadler said the White House’s effort to keep McGahn from testifying was part of a pattern of “lawless behavior,” and Trump is “willing to go to any lengths to prevent testimony that might implicate him.”

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., head of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said Monday that McGahn’s failure to testify on Tuesday would be grounds for opening an impeachment inquiry.

In addition to fighting off Democratic efforts to have McGahn testify, the president is currently in the midst of legal battles over Democratic subpoenas for his personal records. He sued Deutsche Bank and Capitol One to block a subpoena for his banking records, and was also trying to keep documents from accounting firm Mazars USA away from Congress.

A judge ruled against Trump in the Mazars case on Monday, stating that the House Oversight Committee was entitled to view the documents. The main argument from the Trump administration has been that Democrats lack a legitimate legislative purpose for their inquiries, but Judge Amit Mehta ruled that the possibility of finding conflicts of interest in the administration or violations of the Constitution’s Foreign Emoluments Clause sufficed.

FEDERAL JUDGE SIDES WITH HOUSE DEMOCRATS OVER SUBPOENA FOR TRUMP'S FINANCIAL RECORDS

Pelosi touted Mehta’s ruling as a win, as well as a reason why impeachment is not necessary at this point.

“Today, we won our first case,” Pelosi reportedly said at the Steering and Policy Committee meeting. “We’ve been in this thing for almost five months and now we’re getting some results.”

Rex Tillerson Secretly Meets With House Foreign Affairs Committee to Talk Trump,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Erin Banco'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/rex-tillerson-secretly-meets-with-house-foreign-affairs-committee-to-talk-trump,"Former secretary of state Rex Tillerson spoke with the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs committee on Tuesday in a lengthy session that, an aide said, touched on his time working in the Trump administration, the frictions he had with the president’s son-in-law, and efforts to tackle issues like Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Tillerson’s appearance, first reported by The Daily Beast, took place as virtually every other Trumpworld luminary has been stonewalling congressional oversight efforts. At the same time the former secretary of state was speaking before lawmakers, former White House counsel Don McGahn was ignoring a subpoena to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee.

Tillerson’s arrival at the Capitol was handled with extreme secrecy. No media advisories or press releases were sent out announcing his appearance. And he took a little-noticed route into the building in order to avoid being seen by members of the media.

Tillerson reached out to the committee and expressed a willingness to meet, a committee aide said. In a more than six-hour meeting, he told members and staffers that the Trump administration actively avoided confronting Russia about allegations of interference in the election in an effort to develop a solid relationship with the Kremlin, a committee aide told The Daily Beast.

Tillerson also told members and aides that he had tried to establish a formal and disciplined interagency process at the State Department whereby the president could receive informed briefings on sensitive foreign policy matters, the aide said. That effort never manifested, Tillerson told the committee, in part because of the president’s management style, but also because of interference from other aides.

Tillerson told the committee that the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at times impeded his ability to communicate effectively and introduce to President Trump policy proposals developed by State Department experts on major foreign affairs matters across the globe, not just in the Middle East. Kushner, a White House adviser, has publicly focused much of his international efforts on the Middle East and is set to unveil a Middle East peace plan in the coming weeks.

Tillerson had a notoriously prickly relationship with the president, reportedly calling him a “moron” in private. But he was present during critical moments of the administration, including Trump’s private 2017 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg, Germany.

Since leaving his post, Tillerson has rarely made public appearances, save for speaking at a panel in Houston in December. During that appearance, he said there was “no question” Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.

“So often, the president would say, ‘Here’s what I want to do and here’s how I want to do it,’ and I would have to say to him, ‘Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can’t do it that way. It violates the law,’” Tillerson said.

Tillerson’s interview by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) and ranking member Michael McCaul (R-TX) comes a month after special counsel Robert Mueller published his report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Since then, top Democrats on the Hill have demanded that Attorney General Bill Barr and Mueller answer questions related to the report and its publication. Barr has declined to testify before the House, citing the insistence of the committee that staff lawyers be allowed to conduct some of the questioning. Mueller is reportedly in negotiations to testify, though the Department of Justice had previously not agreed on a date for him to do so.

On Tuesday, CNN reported that Mueller’s team had expressed reluctance about the possibility of a testimony taking place in public for fear that it would appear political.

Opinion | China Deserves Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Thomas L. Friedman'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/opinion/china-trump-trade.html,"China kept insisting it was still “a poor developing country” that needed extra protection long after it had become the world’s largest manufacturer by far. Nevertheless, the relationship worked for enough U.S. companies enough of the time that the world’s biggest incumbent superpower, America, accommodated and effectively facilitated the rise of the world’s next largest superpower, China. And together they made globalization more pervasive and the world more prosperous.

And then some changes too big to ignore set in. First, China under Xi announced a “Made in China 2025” modernization plan, promising subsidies to make China’s private and state-owned companies the world leaders in supercomputing, A.I., new materials, 3-D printing, facial-recognition software, robotics, electric cars, autonomous vehicles, 5G wireless and advanced microchips.

This was a natural move for a China aiming to leap out of the middle-income ranks and to reduce its dependency on the West for high-tech. But all these new industries compete directly with America’s best companies.

As a result, all China’s subsidies, protectionism, cheating on trade rules, forced technology transfers and stealing of intellectual property since the 1970s became a much greater threat. If the U.S. and Europe allowed China to continue operating by the same formula that it had used to grow from poverty to compete for all the industries of the future, we’d be crazy. Trump is right about that.

Where he is wrong is that trade is not like war. Unlike war, it can be a win-win proposition. Alibaba, UnionPay, Baidu and Tencent and Google, Amazon, Facebook and Visa can all win at the same time — and they have been. I’m not sure Trump understands that.

But I’m not sure Xi does, either. We have to let China win fair and square where its companies are better, but it has to be ready to lose fair and square, too. Who can say how much more prosperous Google and Amazon would be today if they had been able to operate as freely in China as Alibaba and Tencent can operate in America?

And how much money did China save — to subsidize its own companies — when its military stole the plans for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 stealth fighter and then made its own carbon copy, avoiding all the R & D costs?"

Senate Democrats on Tuesday hammered a top Treasury Department official over a bombshell report that Deutsche Bank resisted reporting suspicious financial activity tied to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose companies were clients of the German lender.

One after another, Democrats at a Senate Banking Committee hearing that focused on anonymous shell company abuse urged the director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Kenneth Blanco, to take action on the New York Times story.

Story Continued Below

Blanco's agency, known as FinCEN, is responsible for policing illegal money laundering and would have received any so-called suspicious activity reports filed by Deutsche Bank. According to the Times, bank employees prepared the reports but were blocked by executives.

""The alleged facts are in plain sight,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said. ""It's essential it seems to me to the public trust and the integrity of FinCEN that these be actively pursued.""

Despite the pummeling by Democrats — not a single Republican at the hearing brought up Deutsche Bank — Blanco said he was unable to comment on allegations made in the story, which he said he had been briefed on but had not read.

""You're a very smart man,"" Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), responded. ""It wouldn't take very long to read it, but it might be very informative to you.""

""Just because it's in the newspaper doesn't mean it’s true,"" Blanco said. ""I'm not saying it's false, either.""

Blanco suggested that the bank might have been comfortable with the risks it was taking with Trump.

""Everything is fact-specific,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, it could be quite appropriate.""

Before Tuesday's hearing, Van Hollen and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking him to confirm the accuracy of the Times story and to divulge how many suspicious activity reports were quashed.

Deutsche Bank has said there were ""numerous inaccuracies and misleading statements"" in the Times story but that legal restrictions prevented it from refuting them in detail."
"DOJ, citing Barr contempt vote, threatens to cut off negotiations with Congress over Mueller report",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/doj-citing-barr-contempt-vote-threatens-to-cut-off-negotiations-with-congress-over-mueller-report,"The Justice Department warned House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff if the panel moves forward with a contempt vote or other punishment against Attorney General William Barr, it will no longer work together on a deal that would allow members to view a less-redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Schiff, D-Calif., from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, the Justice Department proposed a meeting this week with the House Intelligence panel’s senior staff to continue to search for a compromise in response to 12 requests made by the committee.

But that meeting won’t happen if the panel decides to punish Barr for failing to turn over the unredacted report, Boyd warned.

“Should the committee take the precipitous and unnecessary action of recommending a contempt finding or other enforcement action against the Attorney General, then the Department will not likely to be able to continue to work with the Committee to accommodate its interest in these materials.”

Boyd said the panel “is willing to work with the panel on a reasonable and realistic process,” to provide members with “information pertaining to counterintelligence and foreign-intelligence activities,” outlined, but redacted, in the Mueller report, which probed Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The House Judiciary Committee cited Barr with contempt earlier this month for failing to turn over the unredacted version, even though the redactions are required by law.

The Justice Department has offered a “minimally redacted” version for all members of the House Intelligence Committee to view but Democrats have declined.

Officials Dispute Mike Pompeo's Claim That Iran Is Collaborating With Al Qaeda,http://time.com,['John Walcott'],,,,http://time.com/5592889/mike-pompeo-iran-al-qaeda/,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s claim that Iran and Al Qaeda are collaborating is at best an exaggeration that is not supported by any available information, U.S. intelligence officers and officials with the State and Defense Department tell TIME.

Pompeo made the claim about the terrorist organization during testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month, at a time when tensions between the U.S. and Iran have risen.

“There is no doubt there is a connection between the Islamic Republic of Iran and al-Qaeda. Period. Full stop,” he said. “The factual question with respect to Iran’s connections to al Qaeda is very real. They have hosted al Qaeda. They have permitted al-Qaeda to transit their country.”

But U.S. officials say that he dramatically overstated the case.

“The Secretary has blown the level of collusion between Iran and a few of the remnants of al Qaeda way out of proportion,” says a senior U.S. official who follows developments in Iran closely. “There have been occasional marriages of convenience, but there is nothing in the intelligence to suggest that any of them has been consummated in any grand anti-American alliance.”

Two intelligence officials say that while it’s true that a handful of al Qaeda members, including one of Osama bin Laden’s sons, have been in Iran since shortly after the U.S. attacked their safe haven in Afghanistan in 2001, there is no evidence that Shiite Muslim Iran and the Sunni extremist group have carried out any joint operations against the U.S.

To the contrary, three officials noted, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, al Qaeda’s direct descendant in Syria and Iraq, took credit for a 2017 attack on Iran’s parliament building and the tomb of the Islamic Republic’s founder, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which according to Iran’s state media killed at least 12 people.

That attack may have been prompted by the fact that Lebanon’s Hezbollah and other Shiite militias backed by Iran’s Quds Force, the overseas arms of Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, have battled al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria and Iraq, said another U.S. official, who like the others requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.

“There have been al Qaeda people in Iran since shortly after 9/11, occasionally under house arrest,” says Daniel Benjamin, who was the State Department’s top counterterrorism official during the Obama Administration and now director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.

However, Benjamin tells TIME, Iran has not had an operational alliance with al Qaeda.

“The Iranians want to know what AQ is up to and they keep close tabs on them, but Iran’s current approach and one it’s maintained for many years has been to avoid anything that would provoke an American strike,” he says.

The most recent State Department Country Report on Iran’s support for terrorism, published last September, doesn’t pull any punches, saying: “Iran continued to provide weapons, training, and funding to Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups, including Palestine Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. These Palestinian terrorist groups have been behind a number of deadly attacks originating in Gaza and the West Bank, including attacks against Israeli civilians and Egyptian security forces in the Sinai Peninsula.”

But on connections between Tehran and al Qaeda, the report says only that: “Iran remained unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qa’ida (AQ) members residing in Iran and has refused to publicly identify the members in its custody.” In addition, the clerical regime in Tehran has allowed the group to move money and fighters through Iran from Pakistan to South Asia and Syria “since at least 2009”.

However, the U.S. officials tell TIME, last summer or fall, after Pompeo became Secretary of State, language suddenly appeared referring to the few al Qaeda members as “AQ in Iran”, suggesting there was an operational cell, which the officials say was at least an exaggeration, if not an outright falsehood.

That assertion predictably has evoked memories of the George W. Bush Administration’s false claims that al Qaeda had links to Iraq, and even that bin Laden and Saddam Hussein — both Sunnis — might have cooperated in planning the Sept. 11, 2001, World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks. In that case, Bush Administration officials and Iraqi exiles distorted intelligence about a supposed Iraqi terrorist training facility and an Iraqi offer to bin Laden of safe haven in Iraq, which officials neglected to mention that bin Laden had rejected, saying Iraq’s objectives were not al Qaeda’s.

There is, the U.S. officials said, slightly more substance to Pompeo’s assertion than there was to the Bush Administration’s claims about al Qaeda and Iraq, despite the centuries-old hostility between Shiite Iran and its Sunni neighbors. The small number of senior members of bin Laden’s now scattered group who remain in Iran are there with the government’s permission, although some of them have been under virtual house arrest, says one of the officials.

The arrangement, say two of the officials, is a pragmatic one: It prevents al Qaeda or any group under its wing from attacking Iran and it provides Tehran some potential leverage in any new negotiations with the U.S., although Iranian President Hassan Rouhani this week said he’s not ready to talk.

“I can envision a moment when, as part of some negotiation, Iran might offer to hand over the al Qaeda types it’s been harboring in exchange for some concession on sanctions,” one U.S. diplomat tells TIME. “If you think about it, that’s kind of the opposite of what the Secretary has said.”

Now, these officials worry that the situation could spin out of control, especially after Iran this week announced that it is quadrupling it production of low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons, and on Sunday someone fired a Katyusha rocket that landed about a mile from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

Even before Iran announced the increase in uranium enrichment, Trump reversed his comment that he hoped there would not be a war with Iran and echoed National Security Advisor John Bolton’s vague threats of military action against Iran, tweeting: “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran.”

Saudi Arabia, too, has been escalating its verbal attacks on its Shiite enemy, particularly in connection with the Islamic Republic’s support for Houthi rebels in Yemen, and the Kingdom is preparing to host a meeting of Sunni allies against Iran on May 30 in Mecca.

Pompeo and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan sought on Tuesday to reassure lawmakers that the Administration is not trying to start a war with Iran. But reactions to their classified briefings remained divided along party lines, with Democrats saying they are unsure of the Administration’s intentions and Republicans saying its efforts to deter Iranian aggression are succeeding.

“I don’t think anyone wants another war in the Middle East,” one of the U.S officials said on Tuesday, “but then again, nobody wanted World War I either.”

Biden would beat Trump in Pennsylvania despite president's 2016 win: Donna Brazile,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Julia Musto', ""Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S"", ""America'S Newsroom.""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-biden-would-beat-trump-in-pennsylvania-despite-presidents-2016-triumph-in-the-state-over-hillary-clinton-donna-brazile,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has what it takes to win back a key battleground state for the Democratic Party that President Trump took in 2016, according to ex-DNC Interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile.

Brazile, speaking during an interview on ""America's Newsroom"" Tuesday, said Biden would be able to make up the less than one percentage point Trump won by in Pennsylvania over Hillary Clinton in 2016.

“Look, I think it’s going to be a close election across the country. But, Donald Trump won the state of Pennsylvania by less than 50,000 votes,"" she said.

""Joe Biden will be able to make that up. But, not just Joe Biden—any one of the Democrats I think can be very competitive in the Keystone State.”

TRUMP, AT RAUCOUS PENNSYLVANIA RALLY, SLAMS SCRANTON-BORN BIDEN: 'HE DESERTED YOU'

Brazile’s comments follow a fiery rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, Monday night where the president hit hard at Biden.

As he was ending his speech, Trump told a packed crowd, “Don’t forget: Biden deserted you. He’s not from Pennsylvania. I guess he was born here, but he left you, folks. He left you for another state. Remember that, please.”

Biden served as a Senator from Delaware for over 30 years but was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

""This guy talks about 'I know Scranton,'"" Trump said. ""Well, I know the places better. He left you for another state and he didn't take care of you.""

JOE BIDEN TELLS YOUNG ACTIVISTS HE STARTED PUSH TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE IN 1987

Brazile countered, “He’s well known in Pennsylvania and he’s not the forgotten son. He is the forgotten hero.”

A Quinnipiac University poll released last week shows Biden beating Trump in a head-to-head matchup in Pennsylvania 53 to 42. Additionally, according to a report from Politico using what it said was the Trump campaign’s internal polling, Biden is also ahead in two more highly contested states: Wisconsin and Michigan.

However, both Biden and the president will face a packed field in 2020 with 22 other Democratic candidates now in the running and a long road still ahead.

“The one thing you can give Joe Biden credit [for] is he understands the electorate and he wants to win,” said Brazile. “But, again, he has to get through the Democratic primary...Joe Biden has got to not only maintain his lead, but he has to expand his appeal to voters who might not be familiar with his record as well as voters who might want to see a different face in the White House in 2020.”

E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Pollution Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama-era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted.

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Tillerson quietly meets with House lawmakers to discuss Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Zachary Cohen'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/politics/tillerson-meeting-house-foreign-affairs/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson quietly met with the top Democrat and Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tuesday for an interview that focused primarily on his time in the Trump administration, a congressional aide with direct knowledge of the discussion confirmed to CNN.

Tillerson traveled to Capitol Hill where he sat down with the committee's Democratic chairman Rep. Eliot Engel and ranking Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, the aide said, adding that major topics of interest included the administration's dealings with Russia and uncertainty surrounding the role of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in deciding foreign policy.

The interview lasted roughly seven hours, including breaks, the same source said.

While specific details related to the meeting remain murky, it is clear that Tillerson's trip to Capitol Hill came as a surprise to many in Washington, including to some members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Several members of the House panel did not know about the interview until after it was first reported by The Daily Beast , according to a Republican lawmaker and an aide to a Democrat on the committee.

That loose change left at airports may be used to help fund border operations,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tsa-could-use-3-million-in-loose-change-to-pay-for-dhs-backup-border-funding-plan,"The Transportation Security Administration plans to use loose change left in trays at airports to partly fund the $232 million that its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, has requested to help pay for border operations if Congress doesn’t agree to its $1.1 billion funding request.

The TSA is just one of almost two dozen agencies under the DHS umbrella, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that could be forced to dole out millions of dollars from their budgets to pay for the ramped-up operations along the United States’ southern border.

“The Department is considering all options to address the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News. “We will continue to work with our workforce to find dynamic solutions and funding to address this very serious problem.”

The spokesperson added: “As part of this effort, it is our responsibility to explore fiscal mechanisms that will ensure the safety and welfare of both our workforce and the migrant population, which is also reflected in the supplemental request submitted to Congress.”

TSA CAN NOW FORCE TRAVELERS TO TAKE FULL-BODY SCANS

According to internal TSA emails and a PowerPoint presentation from last week, which were obtained by NBC News, the agency has outlined a plan on how to handle the “tax” the DHS could levy upon it. Along with using the $3 million in loose change found in airport trays across the country, the TSA would use $50 million set aside to purchase advanced airport screening equipment and $64 million from a worker’s compensation fund set up in 2010 for injured TSA employees.

The TSA is also considering using funding for Transportation Security Officers – who run security screenings at airports – to pay the DHS in a move that could add to the already lengthy wait times for travelers at the nation’s airports during the busy summer travel season.

President Trump has asked Congress for $4.5 billion dollars to deal with the influx of migrants from Central America crossing over the U.S.’s southern border with Mexico – with $1.1 billion set aside specifically for “border operations.” The White House argues that this money will be used for “personnel expenses, additional detention beds, and operations combating human smuggling and trafficking.”

Trump’s border wall plan has been met with fierce resistance from Democrats and has become ensnared in a number of legal battles.

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

A federal judge in Oakland last week heard arguments in two lawsuits seeking to block the White House from spending money from the Defense and Treasury departments for the project. California and 19 other states brought one lawsuit; the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed the other.

The plaintiffs asked U.S. District Judge Haywood S. Gilliam Jr. to block the shifting of funds and construction on the wall. They want a quick decision, arguing that some of the Pentagon-funded projects could begin in eight days.

In another case, a federal judge in Washington on Thursday will consider a bid by the House to prevent Trump from spending any Defense Department money for a border wall. At stake is billions of dollars that would allow Trump to make major progress on his signature campaign promise heading into his campaign for a second term.

The president's adversaries say the emergency declaration was an illegal attempt to ignore Congress, which authorized far less wall spending than Trump wanted. Trump grudgingly accepted congressional approval of $1.375 billion to end a 35-day government shutdown on Feb. 15 and declared the emergency in almost the same breath.

The White House says it has identified up to $8.1 billion that it could spend on the project.

Trump's actions ""amount to a usurpation of Congress' legislative powers in violation of bedrock separation of powers principles embedded in the Constitution,"" the state attorneys general wrote in their lawsuit. The administration argues that Trump is protecting national security as unprecedented numbers of Central American asylum-seeking families arrive at the U.S. border.

The Defense Department has already transferred $1 billion to border wall coffers in March and another $1.5 billion last week. Patrick Shanahan, acting defense secretary, may decide as soon as Wednesday whether to transfer an additional $3.6 billion.

The DHS last week also waived environmental impact and other reviews to replace sections of wall in California and Arizona under a law that gives the secretary sweeping powers to plan construction.

NYT White House correspondent: Trump feels 'betrayed' by media because they're not 'nicer' to him,https://thehill.com,[],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/444788-white-house-correspondent-trump-feels-betrayed-by-media-because-theyre-not-nicer-to-him,"New York Times correspondent Peter Baker says in a new interview that President Trump Donald John TrumpThe Hill's Morning Report - White House, Congress: Urgency of now around budget GOP presses Trump to make a deal on spending Democrats wary of handing Trump a win on infrastructure MORE feels “betrayed” by the media because they’re not “nicer” to him.

“He feels like we have betrayed him because we’re not nicer to him in his view,” Baker, who is the newspaper’s chief White House correspondent, told Hill.TV during an interview that aired Tuesday.

“And we have to explain that’s not our job, we don’t do nice stories or bad stories, we just do truth and accurate if we can,” he continued, adding that covering Trump is “so personal.”

Baker said that despite Trump's repeated attacks calling the press the “enemy of the people,” the president often tries to ""charm"" members of the media to get them “on his side.”

“There is this thing when he sits down with an individual or a reporter to try to charm them, to try to get them on his side,” he told Hill.TV.

Trump has long held a contentious relationship with the mainstream media, repeatedly lashing out at various news outlets. The New York Times is a frequent focus of his ire—he refers to the paper as the ""failing"" New York Times.

In a series of tweets on Monday, Trump renewed attacks against the Times over a report concerning some of his financial transactions.

According to the Times report, Deutsche Bank employees flagged several possible suspicious transactions by entities controlled by Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner Jared Corey KushnerOn The Money: Judge upholds House subpoena for Trump financial records | Trump vows to appeal ruling by 'Obama-appointed judge' | Canada, Mexico lift retaliatory tariffs on US | IRS audit rate falls The Hill's 12:30 Report: Amash under fire after impeachment tweets Ann Coulter: Four myths the media and politicians tell you about our border crisis MORE.

Trump slammed the report and refuted its findings.

“The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years), and others of the Fake News Media, keep writing phony stories about how I didn’t use many banks because they didn’t want to do business with me. WRONG! It is because I didn’t need money,” he tweeted.

The Times’ financial editor later disputed Trump’s claim that he could have done business with any bank, saying Deutsche Bank was the only one willing to lend to him.

""I have spent a long time looking into this, and @DeutscheBank was the only bank willing to lend to @realDonaldTrump for 20 years because of his pattern of defaults and the bank’s hunger for growth in the US,"" he tweeted.

Trump's Pennsylvania rally: The 40 most eye-popping lines,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/politics/donald-trump-pennsylvania-rally-2020/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump continued his tour of 2020 swing states on Monday night, stopping in Mountoursville, Pennsylvania , to rally his faithful in advance of his fight for a second term next November.

Trump spoke for just over an hour, with his usual mix of occasionally reading from the teleprompter punctuated by long, now-familiar riffs about his pet subjects -- the news media, the Democrats, his place in history -- that have only a casual relationship with established facts.

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

I went through the transcript of Trump's Pennsylvania speech and picked out some of the most, er, noteworthy lines. They're below.

1. ""Somebody's going to come and run and they're going to say, they're going to do -- in the history of this country, you just hit an all-time low. That's pretty tough to beat.""

Trump's talking here about the fact that Pennsylvania's unemployment rate dropped to 3.9% last month , the lowest since they've been measuring these things. And, he's right! If he would stay on this economic message, he'd be giving himself his best chance to get re-elected. But.......

Also: Away we go!

2. ""Man, this is a lot of people.""

No one loves a crowd like Donald Trump. And no one loves pointing out the size of a crowd like Donald Trump. The crowd size was estimated by local media only as ""thousands."" (Worth noting: Montoursville is a town of just 4,000 people.)

3. ""I think next time we'll just have to get a bigger hanger. That's a big hanger. We're going to have to get a bigger hanger.""

4. ""You know I thought that was the sun in my eyes. It's these stupid lights -- these people. I mean, what are we -- what are they doing? Is there any way they can turn those lights down, folks?""

5. ""Crazy. You've got a thing called the sun. We like the sun better than the artificial not sun.""

So.......

6. ""Oh, we have the most beautiful fighter jets in the world being delivered now every day.""

Trump is a big fan of the word ""beautiful."" A VERY big fan

7. ""We've got the hottest economy anywhere in the world.""

8. ""Wow. That's a lot of people. That's a lot of people. Looks like the Academy Awards used to look before they decided to go political against us.""

Two things here. First, Trump is always aware of the media covering him -- and makes sure his supporters, who ostensibly hate the media, know just how many are covering him. Second, he is always fighting the culture war -- the idea that the Academy Awards were once good but have now gone ""political"" against ""us"" is one that will have lots of Trump supporters nodding in agreement.

9. ""And more than 5 million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps.""

Well, that's sort of complicated ...

10. ""When you have the best unemployment numbers in history, when you have the best economy probably that we've ever had, I don't know. Now the hell do you lose this election? Right?""

[raised hand] By talking about lots of things other than the state of the economy -- like, say, repealing the Affordable Care Act.

11. ""Remember the polls, the fake polls that they put out. Suppression. They call them suppression polls. 'Pennsylvania will go to Hillary Clinton.' Unfortunately for them, it didn't work out that way.""

What Trump is referring to as ""suppression polls"" are more commonly known as ""polls."" His insinuation is that pollsters purposely released misleading data that showed Clinton ahead to keep Trump voters from turning out. He provides no evidence -- likely because none exists -- for this claim.

12. ""So, do you remember that night? They wouldn't announce Pennsylvania. There was 1% left. If I lost every single vote, I would win.""

Again, Trump is suggesting something nefarious -- that the TV networks refused to call Pennsylvania for him despite the fact he had clearly won it -- without a shred of proof that such a thing happened. ( Pennsylvania was called for Trump at 1:35 a.m. the night of the election .)

13. ""I did it, and now it's beautiful. People not coming in, it's beautiful.""

Told you Trump liked the word ""beautiful."" And, he's talking about the wall in San Diego here.

14.""Because we always win. Somehow we always find a way to win.""

Yeah, yeah, this all checks out. I did the math.

15. ""You know, normally I could do other things tonight. I like you. I love this state. I figured, hey, it's a Monday. We have an election tomorrow. Who the hell wants to sit around doing nothing on Monday night? Right?""

Monday is the new Thursday. Everybody knows this.

16. ""And you know what, if we aren't smart it will end for you with the Second Amendment.""

There is scant evidence that any Democrat running for president would abolish the Second Amendment. Plus, there's this -- from the National Constitution Center: ""In simple odds, the chance of any constitutional amendment being repealed would be roughly the same as a person living to 80 years old being struck by lightning during their lifetime, according to National Weather Service data.""

17. ""I don't know if there are other races or not. Who the hell cares?""

Same.

18. ""I never want to be called loser.""

The truest -- and most self-aware -- thing Donald Trump has said in a very long time.

19. ""And maybe if we like it a lot, and if things keep going like they're going, we'll go and we'll do what we have to do. We'll do it three and a four and a five.""

Oh nothing -- just the President ""joking"" about extending beyond his constitutionally-mandated two-term limit. Ah ha ha ha....wait.

20. ""And you know, one of the things we're talking about the greatest probably, I think, political slogan of all time is what you have on your hats. Make America Great Again.""

Humility has never been one of Trump's strong suits.

21. ""Do we keep our logo? Do we keep our slogan? Make America Great Again or it's very risky. Changing the most successful slogan has to be.""

[scratches head, looks off in the distance] So, uh, well, yeah.

22. ""Our military's strong, our Second Amendment is good.""

Quick update on the Second Amendment: It's ""good.""

23. ""They want to knock down all buildings in Manhattan and rebuild them without windows.""

No, ""they"" don't . What New York City has proposed is retrofitting buildings of 25,000 square feet or more to make them more energy-efficient.

24. ""This is a cheap poll but it's better than any poll you could get. You ever see the yard and they interview like 103 people. I've got thousands here tonight.""

What's he talking about? Oh, an applause ""poll"" on whether he should keep his slogan as ""make America Great Again"" or ""Keep America Great."" Natch.

25. ""Even with that powerful man's voice, I love that guy. I think I'm in love.""

A real quote from the real President of the United States.

26. ""Look at the thousands and thousands of people we have, now he said he had 600 people.""

If Trump loves anything more than his crowd sizes, it's comparing those crowd sizes to other allegedly smaller crowds for his political opponents. In this case, the ""he"" refers to former Vice President Joe Biden -- and his formal campaign kickoff in Philadelphia over the weekend. ( The Biden crowd was estimated at 6,000 .)

27. ""We've lost 60,000, not jobs, listen to this. Sixty thousand factories, here's the good news. We're building them all back. They're coming back. All coming back.""

All 60,000 factories Trump claims were lost by NAFTA are coming back? This seems like a big story!

28. ""Our country is full. We don't want people coming up here. Our country is full. We want Mexico to stop. We want all of them to stop. Our country is packed to the gills. We don't want them coming up""

This probably goes without saying but: Our country is not ""full"" (and it's not even clear what that would look like). Also: There's a very big difference between saying that we don't want any more immigrants to this country and saying we can't fit any more immigrants in this country.

29. ""What's going on with Fox by the way? What's going on there? They're putting more Democrats on than you have Republicans. There's strange is going on at Fox. Something every strange.""

By ""strange"" Trump means ""Fox isn't kowtowing to me and my policies at all times."" (For more on the Trump-Fox News tension, read this .)

30. ""And [South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg] was knocking the hell out of Fox and Fox put him -- somebody's going to have to explain the whole Fox deal to me.""

This comment reveals how little Trump understands about how media organizations are supposed to work. Putting on a variety of voices is a good thing, not a bad thing.

31. ""I tell you right -- even tonight I see their way -- the way they're working and I hope the cameras get to see this crowd.""

He likes his crowd size. I did warn you.

32. ""They don't like to show the crowd. Explain that to me.""

The ""they"" is the media. This is a standard Trump line. And it's never been true. No matter how many times he repeats it.

33. ""We passed a largest package of tax cuts in the history of our country.""

34. ""These crazy lights. And they look like they cost a fortune too, I don't know. I don't know who -- I don't know who got those lights but they're very bright. A real genius got those lights.""

Light-gate, continued.

35. ""These are the values that unite people all across this magnificent state of Pennsylvania, where, by the way, I went to school. I went to school in Pennsylvania.""

I hadn't heard that before.

36. ""They were spying on our campaign. I'll tell you what, if that ever happened to the other side this thing would have been over two years ago and you know it would have been treason. They would have called it treason and that's what it is.""

Trump is referring to the surveillance of a former aide -- Carter Page -- as part of the FBI's counterintelligence probe into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election. And this ""spying"" was totally lawful -- approved by a FISA court and re-approved three times. Just saying.

37. ""I had such an easy life. People say, I had such an easy life. Who the hell knew it was going to be this difficult, but I love it.""

Wait, being president is hard? I had never thought of that!

38. ""I come to the great state of Pennsylvania, and I say 'Oh, I need some help let me call, let's see Russia. Let's call Russia.' It's the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on this country.""

To be clear: We know from the Mueller report that Russia sought to interfere in the election to help Trump and hurt Clinton. They did so using a sophisticated social media campaign targeted at swing states that reached tens of millions of people via Facebook alone.

39. ""We are going to make our stand and it's a tough stand and it's a beautiful stand.""

A truly beautiful stand.

40. ""And don't forget Biden deserted you. He's not from Pennsylvania. I guess he was born here, but he left you folks. He left you for another state."""

DHS has 'strong concerns' Chinese-made drones stealing data,https://www.channel3000.com,['David Shortell'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.channel3000.com/news/national-news/dhs-has-strong-concerns-chinesemade-drones-stealing-data/1079687408,"Copyright 2019 CNN Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert.

Copyright 2019 CNN Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert issued Monday obtained by CNN.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" the alert says.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities,"" the alert adds.

The warning from DHS follows an executive order signed by President Donald Trump last week that effectively banned US firms from using telecommunications equipment made by the Chinese company Huawei, which has drawn similar national security concerns of government spying.

The US and China are currently locked in a trade war that has frayed the two countries' relationship as it deteriorated in recent weeks.

US officials have raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones in the past. In 2017, the US Army issued a ban the use of DJI drones, alleging in a memo that the company shared critical infrastructure and law enforcement data with the Chinese government.

Also that year, an internal report from an intelligence division of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency in Los Angeles assessed that DJI was ""selectively targeting government and privately owned entities within (the US. critical infrastructure and law enforcement sectors) to expand its ability to collect and exploit sensitive US data.""

Users are warned to ""be cautious when purchasing"" drones from China, and to take precautionary steps like turning off the device's internet connection and removing secure digital cards.

The alert also warns users to ""understand how to properly operate and limit your device's access to networks"" to avoid ""theft of information.""

""Organizations that conduct operations impacting national security or the Nation's critical functions must remain especially vigilant as they may be at greater risk of espionage and theft of proprietary information,"" the alert states.

In a statement, DJI said that it gives customers ""full and complete control over how their data is collected, stored, and transmitted,"" adding that ""customers can enable all the precautions DHS recommends.""

""At DJI, safety is at the core of everything we do, and the security of our technology has been independently verified by the U.S. government and leading U.S. businesses,"" DJI said.

""For government and critical infrastructure customers that require additional assurances, we provide drones that do not transfer data to DJI or via the internet, and our customers can enable all the precautions DHS recommends. Every day, American businesses, first responders, and U.S. government agencies trust DJI drones to help save lives, promote worker safety, and support vital operations, and we take that responsibility very seriously,"" DJI said.

DJI, which reported $2.7 billion in revenue in 2017, is best known for its popular Phantom drone. Introduced in 2013, the drone is the top-selling commercial drone on the market.

Seventy-nine percent of drones operating in the US and Canada and 74% globally are made by DJI, according to a 2018 market sector report from Skylogic Research, an industry analyst.

Industry experts say the drone's easy-to-use software combined with sophisticated cameras and advanced technology allowed DJI to take over sales in the US for hobbyists, as well as professional organizations.

""A lot of companies found out that using a drone to inspect a roof or to inspect industrial facilities is a really good way -- you save a lot of people climbing ladders,"" said Kay Wackwitz, the CEO of Drone Industry Insight, a market research and consultancy company focused on the commercial drone market.

Agencies from local police departments to the Interior Department have used drones for sensitive work. According to the 2017 ICE memo, contractors in Kansas building a DHS bio-defense facility used a DJI drone ""to assist with construction layout and provide security during construction."""

In modern times, presidents have rarely been church mice afraid of a little salty language. But President Donald Trump has grown increasingly willing in recent months to say in public what most of his predecessors tried to keep behind closed doors.

His is the profanity presidency, full of four-letter denunciations of his enemies and earthy dismissals of allegations lodged against him. At rallies and in interviews, on Twitter and in formal speeches, he relishes the bad-boy language of a shock jock, just one more way of gleefully provoking the political establishment bothered by his norm-shattering ways.

In a single speech on Friday alone, he managed to throw out a “hell,” an “ass” and a couple of “bullshits” for good measure. In the course of just one rally in Panama City Beach, Florida, earlier this month, he tossed out 10 “hells,” three “damns” and a “crap.” The audiences did not seem to mind. They cheered and whooped and applauded.

“I’d say swearing is part of his appeal,” said Melissa Mohr, the author of “Holy Sh*t: A Brief History of Swearing,” published in 2013. “It helps create the impression that he is saying what he thinks, ‘telling it like it is.’ We tend to believe people when they swear, because we interpret these words as a sign of strong emotions. In his case, the emotion is often powerful anger, which his supporters seem to love.”

While traditionalists may deem it unpresidential and a poor example for children, Martha Joynt Kumar, a longtime scholar of presidential communication, said gritty language was part of the show put on by Trump, the onetime reality television entertainer, for his fans.

“He knows they like him to use words that lie over the edge of the traditional boundary of presidential decorum,” she said. “His controversial word choices are an aspect of his role as the disrupter he promised his constituents he would be.”

But critics say the vulgarity comes at a cost. “No one has debased the civil discourse in this country more than President Trump, and the president really does set the tone in the country,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. “We see it reflected in our offices by the hateful, belligerent, obscene and violent calls that we get now that we didn’t used to get.”

Schiff has experienced it personally when Trump turned his name into a profanity last fall by nicknaming him “little Adam Schitt.” Schiff said, “The last time that happened, the person who did that had their mouth washed out with soap by his mother.”

An unscientific survey seems to suggest that if anything, Trump is growing more comfortable with crudeness. He used the word “bullshit” in public just once in his first two years in office, according to the Factba.se database that tracks his speeches, but on four occasions in the last three months.

He has either coarsened the public discourse or reflected it, or perhaps both, depending on your view of him, but he is not alone. Society in recent years has embraced what used to be considered profanity. Even The New York Times, the so-called Gray Lady with all the news that’s fit to print, found it fit to print the BS word just 14 times in the many years before Trump’s inauguration, according to a Nexis search, but has used it 26 times since — not all in stories covering the president.

Other presidents, of course, have engaged in common language and found a connection to everyday people. Harry S. Truman was told to “give ’em hell, Harry,” to which he famously replied: “I don’t give them hell. I just tell the truth about them and they think it’s hell.” But in general, it used to be something of a mini-scandal when a president was caught cursing in public.

During a campaign event in 2000, George W. Bush was heard over a live microphone talking with his running mate, Dick Cheney, calling a Times reporter he did not particularly like a “major-league asshole.” In 2004, as vice president, Cheney told a senator on the Senate floor to “go fuck yourself.” His successor, Joe Biden, was overheard in 2010 using a variation of that profanity to tell Barack Obama what a big deal passage of health care legislation was.

Never has any president pushed the boundaries of language as far as Trump. He had a foul mouth long before politics, of course, but he seemed to try, however fitfully, to clean it up for a while when he set his sights on the White House. Still, he could not resist at times. At one rally during his 2016 campaign, he quoted a supporter calling a Republican rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a “pussy.”

Once taking office, he tried, at least, to keep it private, but he was uninhibited when the cameras were not on. After the special counsel, Robert Mueller, was appointed, he told aides, “I’m fucked.” Speaking with lawmakers, he called African nations “shithole countries.”

Yet Trump feigned shock in January when the newly elected Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan said she and her fellow House Democrats were “going to impeach the motherfucker.” The president told reporters that “she dishonored herself” by “using language like that in front of her son and whoever else was there.”

Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, acknowledged a certain raw quality in Trump’s discourse but dismissed its significance. “The president does use coarse language in private a lot with us,” he told Jake Tapper on CNN after Tlaib’s comment. “Many people do.” But, he added, “I think there’s more important things as to who’s coarsening the language.”

Any restraint Trump may have sought to exhibit early in his term seems to have eroded in recent months. In a January interview with The Times, he boasted that he had “beat the shit out of” Republican rivals in 2016. A month later, he told the Conservative Political Action Conference that his enemies were trying to take him out “with bullshit.”

A few weeks later, he told a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, that Democrats were peddling “ridiculous bullshit” about him. In April, he said some statements in the special counsel report were “total bullshit.” Last week, he retweeted a post by his son Eric Trump saying that under Bill de Blasio, the New York mayor now running for president, “our great city has gone to shit.”

By the time the president took the stage before the National Association of Realtors in Washington on Friday, he was in a feisty mood.

He recalled that a consultant tried to make work for himself by identifying environmental concerns on a property Trump wanted to develop. “I fired his ass so fast,” the president recalled.

He told the Realtors that he used to refuse to pay brokers their traditional 6 percent commission and instead gave them just 1 percent. “I was famous for that,” he said. When they booed, he quickly retreated. “Don’t worry. Nobody accepted it. But I tried like hell.”

Then he went after one of his favorite targets — journalists — claiming that recent reports of infighting within his national security team were made up. “There is no source,” he said. “The person doesn’t exist. The person’s not alive. It’s bullshit, OK? It’s bullshit.”

Ken Cuccinelli expected to be named to DHS for top immigration role,https://www.cnn.com,"['Kaitlan Collins', 'Jeremy Diamond']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/politics/ken-cuccinelli-white-house-immigration/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli is expected to take a top job at the Department of Homeland Security to help steer the administration's immigration policies, a senior administration official said.

Cuccinelli is not expected to take on the role of ""immigration czar,"" a position President Donald Trump had considered establishing to improve coordination between the agencies involved in handling the steep uptick in migrants crossing the US's southern border in recent months.

But Trump and White House officials hope Cuccinelli, a politically savvy immigration hardliner, will ensure the White House's immigration priorities are being carried out at the Department of Homeland Security.

There are few Senate-confirmed appointees in the top roles at the DHS, which some White House officials argue has slowed them down in advancing their policies.

Since he became acting secretary, Kevin McAleenan brought in several officials from Customs and Border Protection whom the White House did not view as immigration hardliners. Cuccinelli's appointment will help even that out, officials say.

I.R.S. Memo Undercuts Mnuchin on Withholding Trump’s Tax Returns,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/us/politics/irs-memo-trump-taxes.html,"At a Senate hearing last week, Mr. Mnuchin said that he has had multiple conversations with Mr. Rettig and with the lawyers at the I.R.S. about the legal issues surrounding the request for Mr. Trump’s tax returns. The Treasury secretary said that Mr. Rettig agreed with the decision not to release them to Congress.

Mr. Mnuchin is expected to testify on Wednesday morning before the House Financial Services Committee and is likely to be grilled by Democrats about the decision not to hand over the returns.

Mr. Trump broke decades of precedent by not releasing his tax returns while running for president, claiming that he could not do so because he was under audit by the I.R.S. There are no laws preventing taxpayers from releasing their returns while under audit.

Last month, Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, used an obscure provision of the tax code to try to obtain the financial papers. Mr. Neal said the information was needed so that the committee could review how the I.R.S. conducts presidential audits.

The Treasury Department declined that request, prompting Mr. Neal to issue a subpoena to try to force Mr. Mnuchin to furnish the returns. Mr. Mnuchin again refused last week, saying that the matter would be settled by the courts.

Although the I.R.S. memo was never finalized, it highlights the administration’s attempt to deal with an unusual request, one that has placed Mr. Mnuchin, a staunch Trump ally, in the middle of a legal war over the president’s personal financial information.

John Koskinen, the former I.R.S. commissioner, said that it was conceivable that career staff in the agency’s legal department drafted the memo and that it was buried because it was clear that the conclusion would be unacceptable to the White House. He said that he would be surprised if the leadership of the I.R.S. and Treasury was not aware of such a document because the issue is so politically sensitive.

“It would be stunning to me if either Rettig or Mnuchin said, ‘Gee, I didn’t know about that,’” Mr. Koskinen said."
Commerce Dept. grants Huawei a 90-day license to help existing users,https://www.engadget.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/20/huawei-temp-license/,"Last week the US Commerce Department added Huawei and 68 subsidiaries to its ""Entity List"" that bans it from doing business with US companies without a special license. Today, as anticipated, the Commerce Department loosened that restriction a bit with a temporary 90-day license. According to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, it ""will allow operations to continue for existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks.""

Because many operators, or owners of various handsets might not have any other way to get software updates or look into backups for necessary equipment, Huawei can continue to service those existing customers -- for now at least. For the long term, however, it's still looking at the loss of access to technology like Google's Android OS, not to mention any business deals in the US.

Update: Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei made a rare public statement, telling media in China that his company had already made preparations for a ban, and said that its 5G would not be affected by the restrictions. He also said the temporary license ""bears little meaning."""
"GM's over-the-air updates, EPA's new math, hydrogen from seawater: Today's Car News",https://www.greencarreports.com,[],,,,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1123198_gms-over-the-air-updates-epas-new-math-hydrogen-from-seawater-todays-car-news,"



EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler

The EPA plans to stop counting potential lives saved from new pollution rules. GM reveals a platform that's connected to the future. Stanford scientists devise a way to use seawater to make hydrogen. And our latest Twitter poll asks what types of incentives work best to sell EVs. All this and more on Green Car Reports.

In its latest effort to unwind the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, the EPA is considering a new analytical model that will quit counting thousands of lives potentially saved by cleaning up the air, according to a new report in The New York Times.

GM introduced a new electrical architecture expected to go into most of its cars by 2023, which can provide faster communications for electric drive systems, self-driving, and infotainment, with future expandability and Tesla-style over-the-air updates.

How to make enough hydrogen is one of the main challenges with fuel-cell cars. Getting it from water, in addition to requiring a lot of energy, could stress water supplies. Now scientists at Stanford have figured out how to make lots of it from seawater. That leaves several other challenges unsolved, however.

After checking out how Norway managed to find success with electric cars, our latest Twitter poll asks, ""What kinds of EV incentives are most effective?""

Spy photographers from our partners at Motor Authority have caught images of the new Chevy Bolt–based electric SUV from GM out testing on public roads. The new model, which could be called the Bolt EUV, is expected to be built alongside the Bolt EV in 2021.

Finally, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles recalled almost 200,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans—but not the Pacifica Hybrid this time—for an electrical problem that could lead to a stall or a lack of power-steering assistance.

DOJ reveals name of ex-US attorney accused of sexual misconduct after BuzzFeed lawsuit,https://thehill.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/444620-doj-reveals-name-of-ex-us-attorney-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-after,"The Justice Department has revealed the name of a former U.S. attorney accused of misconduct after BuzzFeed News successfully sued for disclosure of his identity.

The Justice Department announced in May 2017 that the since-retired attorney had an affair with a subordinate, created a hostile work environment and possibly violated department policy on sexual harassment. A federal judge ruled in March that public interest superseded government officials’ right to privacy, forcing the Justice Department to disclose last week the attorney in question was Stephen Wigginton, who served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois from 2010 to 2015. Wigginton was also charged with driving under the influence and causing a car crash in 2017.

In the March ruling, U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick ruled the Justice Department omitted key details in arguing Wigginton’s case only involved an “improper consensual relationship.”

“Instead, the improper relationship was so open and obvious that it caused employees within the Office to feel powerless, embarrassed, and distracted, and resulted in a work environment that some described as unbearable and hostile,” Broderick wrote. “In addition to work environment issues, the conduct had an impact on the operations of the Office since it resulted in disparate treatment regarding bonuses and disciplinary actions, and led some to avoid the U.S. Attorney and Supervisory AUSA at all costs.”

“Following the OIG’s investigation into this matter, the Department took appropriate steps to assess and address the issues outlined in the OIG’s report,” a Justice Department spokesperson told BuzzFeed. “The department has complete confidence in the new leadership and overall professionalism of the [US attorney’s office] in the Southern District of Illinois.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill."

The millions would reportedly include $50 million set aside by the TSA to buy advanced airport screening equipment and $64 million from a worker’s compensation fund set aside for injured employees. Bizarrely, it would also include $3 million of loose change left in trays at airports. Money for Transportation Security Officers, who run security screening lines in airports, is also “in play,” according to leaked internal docs, which could cause significant disruption over the summer if reallocated.

On Monday, he said the two companies need to build up adequate capital before they can be privatized, which means that the sweeps of extra profits from Fannie and Freddie into the U.S. Treasury would have to end. He gave no time horizon for when that would happen.

He said that common shareholders are part of the discussions. Existing shareholders could see their stakes shrink if the GSEs issue and sell new shares to build up the capital needed.

U.S. eases curbs on Huawei; founder says clampdown underestimates Chinese firm,https://www.reuters.com,"['Brenda Goh', 'Min Read']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-usa-license-idUSKCN1SQ27T,"SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States has temporarily eased trade restrictions on China’s Huawei to minimize disruption for its customers, a move the founder of the world’s largest telecoms equipment maker said meant little because it was already prepared for U.S. action.

The U.S. Commerce Department blocked Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from buying U.S. goods last week, a major escalation in the trade war between the world’s two top economies, saying the firm was involved in activities contrary to national security.

The two countries increased import tariffs on each other’s goods over the past two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump said China had reneged on earlier commitments made during months of negotiations.

On Monday, the Commerce Department granted Huawei a license to buy U.S. goods until Aug. 19 to maintain existing telecoms networks and provide software updates to Huawei smartphones, a move intended to give telecom operators that rely on Huawei time to make other arrangements.

Shares of U.S. suppliers to Huawei including Qualcomm Inc, Intel Corp and Lumentum Holdings Inc rose, with the Philadelphia Chip Index up 2.1%.

Radio frequency chipmaker Qorvo was the latest U.S. supplier after mobile parts maker Lumentum to halt shipments to Huawei.

It is unclear what the U.S. government extension permits, but if it allows Huawei to keep purchasing components, the company will likely order more to build inventory, said Mark Kelleher, an analyst at D.A. Davidson.

Huawei is still prohibited from buying American-made hardware and software to make new products without further, hard-to-obtain licenses.

Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei on Tuesday told Chinese state media that the reprieve bore little meaning for the company as it had been making preparations for such a scenario.

“The U.S. government’s actions at the moment underestimate our capabilities,” Ren said in an interview with CCTV, according to a transcript published by the Chinese state broadcaster.

The temporary license suggests changes to Huawei’s supply chain may have immediate, far-reaching and unintended consequences for its customers.

The Commerce Department said it will evaluate whether to extend the license period beyond 90 days.

CURRENCY FIRMS

China’s yuan firmed versus the dollar on Tuesday as news of the reprieve eased some worries that trade tensions would be further inflamed and inflict deeper losses on the currency.

Beijing has struck an increasingly defiant tone as the trade war has escalated, saying it will take measures to safeguard the interests of its companies, but has not said whether or how it may retaliate over the U.S. action against Huawei.

President Xi Jinping’s Monday visit to a rare-earth company in southern China sparked speculation that the sector could be the next front in the trade war, driving up shares in Chinese rare-earth related firms on Tuesday.

China produced 80% of rare-earths, a group of 17 chemical elements used in electronics, imported by the United States in 2017.

“Given the Huawei decision, I feel they (China) have no choice but to retaliate, for face sake,” Cliff Tan, head of East Asian research at MUFG Bank in Hong Kong, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Tuesday.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, at a media briefing, rebuffed Trump’s claim that his tariffs were causing companies to move production away from China, saying foreign investors remain enthusiastic about the country.

GOOGLE SUSPENSION

Huawei is on the receiving end of a U.S. government accusation that it engaged in bank fraud to obtain embargoed U.S. goods and services in Iran and move money via the international banking system. Huawei has pleaded not guilty.

The trade blacklist has added to its woes, following which Alphabet Inc’s Google suspended some business with Huawei, Reuters reported on Sunday citing a person familiar with the matter, raising worries about the Chinese firm’s smartphones that run on Google’s Android operating system.

Monday’s temporary license is likely to allow companies such as Google to continue providing service and support, including software updates or patches, to Huawei smartphones that were available to the public on or before May 16.

“Keeping phones up to date and secure is in everyone’s best interests and this temporary license allows us to continue to provide software updates and security patches to existing models for the next 90 days,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email on Tuesday.

The license also allows Huawei to engage in the development of standards for fifth-generation (5G) telecom networks.

APPLE PRAISE

Ren put up a brave front on Tuesday, reiterating claims that the restrictions will not hurt Huawei’s prospects and that no other company will be able to catch up with Huawei in 5G technology in the next two to three years.

China was nevertheless still “far behind” the United States in technology, he said.

Chip experts have called out Huawei on its claims that it could ensure a steady supply chain without U.S. help, saying the technology it buys from American companies would be “hard to replace.”

Nearly 16% of Huawei’s spending on components in 2018 went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm, Intel and Micron Technology, analysts said.

Ren said Huawei was at odds with the U.S. government, not U.S. firms, and in a comment that trended on Chinese social media, he praised Apple Inc’s iPhones, saying he gifted the American firm’s devices to family members.

“Apple has a good business ecosystem. ... We cannot think narrow-mindedly that loving Huawei equals loving its phones.”

U.S. firms could lose up to $56.3 billion in export sales over five years from stringent export controls on technologies involving Huawei or otherwise, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation said in a report. Missed opportunities threatened as many as 74,000 jobs, the foundation said."
Judge rules against Trump in fight over president’s financial records,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Devlin Barrett', 'Reporter Focusing On National Security', 'Law Enforcement', 'Spencer S.

Trump called the 41-page ruling from U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta of the District of Columbia “crazy” and said he would appeal, adding: “We think it’s totally the wrong decision by, obviously, an Obama-appointed judge.”

[Read the judge’s opinion here ]

Lawyers for the president are fighting document and witness subpoenas on multiple fronts, and Mehta’s ruling came hours after former White House counsel Donald McGahn was directed not to appear before a congressional committee seeking testimony about his conversations with Trump.

Congressional Democrats have vowed to fight for evidence of potential misconduct by Trump and those close to him, and the president’s legal team is broadly resisting those efforts. How those fights play out in court in the months ahead could impact the 2020 presidential race.

In his decision, Mehta flatly rejected arguments from the president’s lawyers that the House Oversight Committee’s demands for the records from Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, were overly broad and served no legitimate legislative function.

“It is simply not fathomable,” the judge wrote, “that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct — past or present — even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.”

Trump has argued those congressional inquiries are politically motivated attacks on the authority of the presidency, while Democrats insist the subpoenas are essential to ensuring no president is above the law.

When the lawsuit was filed, Trump’s private attorney Jay Sekulow said the president’s team “will not allow Congressional Presidential harassment to go unanswered.”

The company said in a statement that it will “respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations.”

[Cohen told lawmakers Trump attorney Jay Sekulow instructed him to falsely claim Moscow project ended in January 2016]

While Democrats scored the first court victory in the fight over the president’s financial records, it is unclear how many of these disputes will reach higher courts, or how those courts might rule.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said the ruling “lets America know that we have ground to stand on and that we have a legitimate argument and the courts support them. . . . I’m glad it was a strong decision; that bodes well, hopefully, in the future for an appeals process.”

Mehta’s ruling drew comparisons between Trump and President James Buchanan, whom historians have blamed for failing to prevent the Civil War and who is generally considered one of the country’s worst leaders. Buchanan, too, complained bitterly about “harassing” congressional inquiries.

Mehta noted that Congress also launched an investigation into the conduct of Bill Clinton before he entered the White House.

“Congress plainly views itself as having sweeping authority to investigate illegal conduct of a President, before and after taking office,” he wrote. “This court is not prepared to roll back the tide of history.”

The judge gave the White House a week to formally appeal the decision, adding that “the President is subject to the same legal standard as any other litigant that does not prevail.”

An appeal could test decades of legal precedent that has upheld Congress’s right to investigate — a legal battle that is just one part of a broader effort by House Democrats to examine Trump’s finances, his campaign and allegations that he sought to obstruct justice in special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia investigation.

In the Mazars case, Mehta cut down Trump’s lawyers’ complaint that Congress was usurping the Justice Department’s powers to investigate “dubious and partisan” allegations of private conduct by inquiring into whether Trump misled his lenders by inflating his net worth.

Rather, Mehta said, a congressional investigation into illegal conduct before and during a president’s time in office fits “comfortably” with Congress’s broad investigative powers, which include an “informing function,” or the power to expose corruption.

[Trump’s lawyers ask for a preliminary injunction to block subpoenas of Deutsche Bank, Capital One]

Trump, his three eldest children and his company also are attempting to block a subpoena, issued by the House Financial Services Committee, seeking Trump’s bank records from Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One. A federal judge in Manhattan is set to hear that case Wednesday.

The pace of the president’s legal fights with Congress is intensifying.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Monday that his panel will vote Wednesday to enforce its subpoena seeking the release of still-redacted portions of Mueller’s report, along with certain underlying materials.

Schiff accused the Justice Department of granting Republican lawmakers’ document requests and denying demands from Democrats.

“The refusal by the department, if it persists, will be a graphic illustration of bad faith and a unwillingness to cooperate with lawful process,” Schiff said.

[White House blocks former counsel McGahn from testifying to Congress]

On Monday, the Justice Department issued a formal legal opinion saying that McGahn, the former top White House lawyer, could not be required to appear before lawmakers in response to a congressional subpoena.

Democrats subpoenaed McGahn to testify Tuesday morning, hoping he would become a star witness in their investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice. As detailed in Mueller’s report, McGahn provided critical testimony about several instances of potential obstruction by Trump.

“The Department of Justice has provided a legal opinion stating that, based on long-standing, bipartisan, and constitutional precedent, the former counsel to the president cannot be forced to give such testimony, and Mr. McGahn has been directed to act accordingly,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. “This action has been taken in order to ensure that future presidents can effectively execute the responsibilities of the office of the presidency.”

The 15-page legal opinion written by Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel argues McGahn cannot be compelled to testify before the committee, based on past Justice Department legal memos regarding the president’s close advisers.

The memo says McGahn’s immunity from congressional testimony is separate and broader than a claim of executive privilege.

The immunity “extends beyond answers to particular questions, precluding Congress from compelling even the appearance of a senior presidential adviser — as a function of the independence and autonomy of the president himself,” Engel wrote.

Trump told reporters the action was taken “for the office of the presidency, for future presidents. I think it’s a very important precedent. And the attorneys say that they’re not doing that for me; they’re doing it for the office of the president.”

Those comments underscore the high stakes of Trump’s current standoff with Congress — if either side loses a legal ruling by an appeals court or the Supreme Court, the reverberations could be felt far beyond the Trump administration, changing the balance of power between the executive and the legislative branches of government for years to come.

In the fight over McGahn’s testimony, the Justice Department insists that immunity from testimony does not evaporate once a presidential adviser leaves the government because the topics of interest to Congress are discussions that occurred when the person worked for the president.

As a private citizen, McGahn is not necessarily bound by the White House directive, or the Justice Department memo, to refuse to comply with the subpoena. McGahn’s lawyer notified the committee that he would not appear.

The move to bar McGahn from answering lawmakers’ questions angered House Democrats eager to hit back at what they view as White House stonewalling. The defiance raises the possibility that the House will hold McGahn in contempt of Congress, as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) has threatened — a threat he reiterated Monday night.

“It is absurd for President Trump to claim privilege as to this witness’s testimony when that testimony was already described publicly in the Mueller report,” Nadler said in a statement. “Even more ridiculous is the extension of the privilege to cover events before and after Mr. McGahn’s service in the White House.”

An increasing number of Democrats also want to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) last week privately played down the possibility and encouraged her members to focus on their policy agenda.

Some Democrats argue that opening an impeachment inquiry will strengthen their hand in trying to force the White House to comply with document requests and witness testimony, including McGahn’s.

House Democrats were hoping to make McGahn their key witness as they seek to unpack the findings of the Mueller report — particularly regarding questions of whether Trump obstructed justice.

Contributing columnist

The Office of Legal Counsel offered more cause for concern last week that politics is playing an undue role at the Justice Department. The office, which is charged with providing the executive branch neutral legal advice, issued an opinion that the Food and Drug Administration has no authority to regulate drugs used in lethal injection.

The OLC opinion was clearly designed to break through the legal logjam that has prevented states from using lethal injection drugs in executions — and it uses Evel Kneivel-style logical leaps to get there.

Lethal injections, such as the three-drug cocktail sodium thiopental, have become the primary method of execution in the United States. Of the 292 executions in the last 10 years, 289 have employed such chemicals.

U.S. drug manufacturers, not wanting their products to be associated with executions, stopped making thiopental 10 years ago, forcing states to acquire the killing drugs overseas. This move has generated legal trouble, however, as the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) prohibits misbranded drugs from entering interstate commerce, including any drug not manufactured in an establishment registered with the FDA. The statute also prohibits the use of an unapproved new drug that the FDA has not blessed as safe and effective for its proposed use.

Based on these legal provisions, a group of convicts on death row sued the FDA in 2011 and gained an injunction requiring the administration to prevent the entry of foreign-manufactured thiopental on the grounds that it was unapproved and misbranded. It also had to tell state correctional departments that the use of the drug was prohibited by law under threat of civil and criminal penalties.

That injunction remains in effect today. Among other things, it has put the FDA and death-penalty states such as Texas at loggerheads.

The Office of Legal Counsel’s opinion, authored by its well-respected head lawyer, Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel, attempts to take the FDA’s foot off the throat of death-penalty states. Engel points to FDA v. Brown & Williamson, a 2000 case in which the Supreme Court found that the FDA lacks regulatory authority over tobacco products as “drugs” or “devices” (Congress later granted the agency power to regulate them directly), to argue that the FDA similarly cannot regulate sodium thiopental’s use in executions. The supposition is that when used for executions, the substance is intended to kill the prisoner, so by definition the drug is not “safe” or “effective.”

But this reasoning is tendentious. Nowhere in Brown & Williamson did the court suggest that the law inherently did not cover tobacco products; rather, the court held that, lacking any safer effective use, the FDA could only regulate the products by banning them, which Congress expressly forbade. Congress has not, however, forbidden the FDA from banning the use of sodium thiopental in executions.

The OLC opinion tries to get around this problem by lumping sodium thiopental in with other means of executions — electric chairs, gallows or firing squads — that “are intended to affect the function or structure of the body,” which is one of the definitions of a “drug.” Thus, Engel argues, the FDA would have to ban all means of execution, whereas “the Constitution and laws of the United States presuppose the continued availability of capital punishment.”

This is a massive logical leap. Among other problems, it assumes that there cannot be a “safe and effective” drug in executions, but the whole point of lethal injection is to provide a safe and effective form of execution — not, of course, to extend life but to promote a humane and predictable death rather than the ghoulish lottery of untested, potentially painful drugs.

Moreover, all the opinions in the litigation that resulted in the 2011 injunction, as well as previous opinions in the Supreme Court, concluded that the FDA’s jurisdiction over drugs extends to sodium thiopental. Even Texas expressly conceded it in the injunction litigation. The OLC opinion also sidesteps the immense implications of its reasoning for the FDA’s regulation of drugs for physician-assisted suicide, animal euthanasia or recreation.

So why would OLC issue such a strained opinion? First clue: The heading of the opinion makes clear that it was ordered up by the attorney general, which is relatively rare. And a footnote states that OLC “considered” the views of the FDA. Reading between the lines, it’s a decent bet that OLC rejected the FDA’s arguments.

Apart from disarming the FDA, the opinion removes the threat of civil and even criminal liability under the FDCA for state officials who buy and use the foreign-manufactured drugs.

Finally, the OLC opinion could potentially serve as the basis for a motion to dissolve or amend the 2011 injunction. Death penalty states could argue to the court that the FDA’s jurisdiction is a threshold issue not previously considered, and the opinion here, being an official statement of the executive branch, would carry more weight than a simple argument in a brief.

None of this would be so worrisome if the opinion represented the sort of nonpartisan legal interpretation that the OLC is charged with providing. But the opinion, not least because of its dubious legal analysis, bears the distinct scent of a preferred political solution. Given the concern that the Justice Department has become a political tool for the administration, it’s yet another worrisome indication that the norms of our institutions are eroding.

"Venezuela opposition's envoy to U.S. meets Pentagon, State Department officials",https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-usa/venezuela-oppositions-envoy-to-us-meets-pentagon-state-department-officials-idUSKCN1SQ26G,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Venezuelan opposition’s envoy to the United States said he met Pentagon and State Department officials in Washington on Monday to discuss “all aspects of the Venezuelan crisis.”

Carlos Vecchio, opposition leader Juan Guaido’s ambassador to Washington, said in a message on Twitter that the talks held at the State Department had been “very positive” but offered no further details. “We continue to advance,” he said.

The talks were arranged at the request of Guaido, leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly who invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing that socialist President Nicolas Maduro’s 2018 re-election was illegitimate.

The United States and many European and Latin American countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader. But Maduro retains control of state functions and the support of the military’s top brass, as well as allies such as Russia, Cuba and China.

The purpose of Monday’s meeting was to discuss the U.S. Defense Department’s “past and future role related to humanitarian assistance and regional support,” a State Department official said ahead of the talks.

President Donald Trump and senior aides have not ruled out military action in the crisis-stricken South American country, repeatedly saying that “all options are on the table.”

But Washington has made clear it prefers to exert continued economic and diplomatic pressure to push Maduro out, and many experts have said the U.S. use of military force is unlikely."
USDA: Don’t add foodborne illness to summer menu,https://www.masslive.com,"['Anne-Gerard Flynn', 'Special To The Republican']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/05/usda-dont-add-foodborne-illness-to-summer-menu.html,"Rates of foodborne illnesses increase during the summer.

According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the season’s hot and humid weather causes environmental bacteria to grow faster and, of course, food is more exposed to possible contamination with summer’s many outdoor activities.

“We receive thousands of different questions from consumers regarding food safety during the summer,"" said Adam Ghering of FSIS’ Office of Public Affairs and Consumer Education.

“Many of those questions are linked to the weather. Severe storms and power outages routinely impact food safety during the summer.”

He added, “In general, perishable foods will stay safe in a refrigerator for four hours when the door remains closed.”

“If the power is out for longer, you can transfer foods to a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs. Foods in the freezer will be safe for approximately 48 hours, 24 hours if the fridge is half full,” said Ghering, adding further information on what food is still considered save to consume after a power outage is available online or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-674-6854.

Ghering said that the “other topic that we receive many questions about is cooking outdoors.”

“Cooking away from the kitchen can be fun but it also requires a good deal of preparation to ensure everything goes smoothly,” he said.

“Bringing water for washing hands, utensils and other equipment is something that can be easily overlooked. Moist towelettes can be a good ‘touch-up’ when your hands get dirty but the most effective method is soap and water.”

He also recommended a cooler will “to keep your food cold, just remember to keep replenishing ice as it melts” and “any type of food thermometer will provide you with the internal temperature of your meat and thereby help you prevent foodborne illness.”

“Any type of improper handling of your food can cause illness but not properly cooking and cooling meat and poultry is vital during summer months,” Ghering said.

“Meat and poultry can quickly brown when grilled but that doesn’t mean they are safe to eat.”

He called probe food thermometers “which you can keep in meat and poultry while cooking” a “great addition to your grilling equipment” in particular.

USDA tips to avoid food poisoning that is estimated to cause some 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths in the United States annually include:

Perishable food should not sit out for more than two hours at room temperature and no more than an hour when the temperature is above 90 degrees.

Pack beverages in one cooler and perishable food in another cooler and place cooler in shade when possible, even in car.

If grilling away from home, bring your own water for preparation and cleaning if unsure of availability of clean water supply.

Use a meat thermometer to ensure harmful bacteria are destroyed. Cook beef, pork, lamb and veal to internal minimum safe temperatures of 145 degrees; ground meats, 160 degrees; whole poultry, poultry breasts and ground poultry, 165 degrees.

Keep cooked meats at 140 degrees or warmer by setting them to the side of the grill rack, not directly over the coals where they could overcook. They may also be kept hot in an oven set at approximately 200 degrees in a chafing dish, slow cooker or warming tray.

Leftovers should be stored within two hours of cooking. Divide them into smaller portions and refrigerate or freeze in covered shallow containers for quicker cooling."
Deadline ends for Alabama to meet DOJ demands on prisons,https://www.al.com,"['Mike Cason', 'Mcason Al.Com']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/doj-notification-period-on-alabama-prisons-coming-to-end.html,"It’s been seven weeks since the U.S. Department of Justice notified Gov. Kay Ivey of allegations that conditions in Alabama’s men’s prisons violate the Constitution because of the level of violence, sexual abuse and other problems.

The notification said the DOJ could file a lawsuit at the end of a 49-day period if the state’s response to the allegations is inadequate.

The 49-day notification is required under the federal law called the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, CRIPA.

Jay Town, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, issued a statement today in response to a question about the notification period ending. The three U.S. attorneys in Alabama were involved in the two-year investigation of prisons that led to the allegations and Town is working with state officials on the response and remedies.

“We are encouraged with the current progress of our negotiations with the State,” Town said in the statement. ""It is too early in this process, however, to determine whether there will be a need for CRIPA litigation. The Department remains hopeful that such a step will be unnecessary.”

Sen. Cam Ward, R-Alabaster, who has been involved in the state’s response, had said earlier today he was not expecting a lawsuit, at least not immediately.

“We’ve had some very good conversations with DOJ and they know that we’re committed to working our way through this and trying to comply with some of their concerns,” Ward said. “I do not expect a lawsuit, at all. And they’ve been very reassuring on that. Now that’s not a guarantee.”

The DOJ could file a lawsuit later. The 49-day period was a minimum notification period before doing so.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers held a press conference last week about the prison issues.

They say the problems would be best addressed in a special session. Ivey has not said whether she will call a special session.

The governor issued a statement last week on the state’s longstanding problem with overcrowded, understaffed and dangerous prisons, saying, “This problem has been kicked down the road for the last time.”

“I am encouraged to know that the Legislature will continue to work on solutions during the remainder of this session, we will remain in constant communication with one another during the coming weeks and months to keep this issue on the front burner,"" Ivey said in the statement.

Legislators have nine meeting days left in the regular session, counting today. The session must end by June 17.

Bob Horton, spokesman for the Alabama Department of Corrections, issued a statement about the notification period coming to an end.

“There is no 49-day deadline for enacting changes, nor is there a requirement that DOJ file a lawsuit,” Horton said. ""Since issuance of the findings letter, the State and the DOJ have engaged in collaborative communications seeking to jointly address the issues outlined in the DOJ’s findings letter.

“Even before the DOJ released its report, ADOC recognized the magnitude and scope of the challenges facing our Department. We have been working to identify and implement solutions to these issues and address long-established challenges that impact our prisons and inmate population. With Governor Ivey’s leadership and the partnership of our state legislature, we will continue to forge ahead to reform and reshape corrections in Alabama.”

EPA to reconsider cost benefit analysis of air pollution on human life,https://thehill.com,[],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/regulation/energy-environment/444878-epa-to-reconsider-cost-benefit-analysis-of-air-pollution-on,"The Trump administration will soon rewrite the factors it uses to determine the health risks of air pollution, a move critics warn will make it harder to place limits on emissions.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: EPA to reconsider cost benefit analysis of air pollution rules | Interior gets new rules on free concert tickets | Dem challenges EPA for skipping hearing EPA to reconsider cost benefit analysis of air pollution on human life Trump mulling visit to ethanol refinery later this month: report MORE defended the change in a memorandum to staff dated May 13 and made public Tuesday as a way to rectify inconsistencies in the current cost-benefit analyses used by the agency across all sectors.

“Benefits and costs have historically been treated differently depending on the media office and the underlying authority. This has resulted in various concepts of benefits, costs and other factors that may be considered,” Wheeler wrote. “This memorandum will initiate an effort to rectify these inconsistencies through statute-specific actions.”

The memo, labeled, “Increasing Consistency and Transparency in Considering Benefits and Costs in the Rulemaking Process,” is a direct result of President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump rips Dems' demands, impeachment talk: 'Witch Hunt continues!' Nevada Senate passes bill that would give Electoral College votes to winner of national popular vote The Hill's Morning Report - Pelosi remains firm despite new impeachment push MORE’s regulatory reform agenda, according to Wheeler. That executive order asked agencies to identify rules that “impose costs that exceed benefits.”

Wheeler said EPA found stakeholders regularly said the costs stemming from environmental regulations outweighed the benefits.

“I have determined that the agency should proceed with benefit-cost reforms using a media-specific approach, taking into account the variety of statutory programs,” Wheeler wrote.

The reforms will span EPA’s offices of Air and Radiation, Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, Land and Emergency Management and Water. The Office of Air and Radiation will be the first to submit their proposal “later this year.”

The memo didn’t identify specific changes to be made but told agency heads to use “sound economic and scientific principles.”

The Trump administration has long argued that Obama administration over-estimated the health risks for various environmental regulations, often to the detriment of industry.

“With these improvements to our regulatory decision-making, the EPA is taking another step to provide the public with a more open federal government and more effective environmental and public health protection,” Wheeler wrote.

Critics warn the shift will make it easier for the Trump administration to take the heat off rollbacks to key Obama administration pollution rules like the Clean Power Plan (CPP).

For example, EPA had initially calculated that repealing and replacing the climate policy for its proposed Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, would result in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year.

However, under the new analytical model, the numbers would be significantly reduced, critics warn.

EPA, however, said the new methodology would not be included in the cost-benefit analysis accompanying the ACE rule, expected to be finalized in June.

“We are considering changes to how such benefits are calculated. No change to this scientific method will be made unless and until the new approach has been peer reviewed. EPA is constantly evaluating approaches to improve transparency and communicate uncertainty regarding costs and benefits of its regulatory actions,"" an EPA spokesperson told The Hill.

Industry representatives hailed EPA’s planned rule change.

“We applaud EPA for taking the historic step to advance common-sense regulatory policy that ensures its regulations will do more good than harm,” said American Forest & Paper Association President Donna Harman in a statement.

The National Association of Manufacturers President Jay Timmons also praised the decision as necessary reform.

“This announcement isn’t deregulation; it’s better regulation. Through this new initiative, the EPA will get regulations done right the first time, delivering clarity and transparency for manufacturers,” he said."
China unlikely to sell off its US debt holdings: TD,https://www.afr.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.afr.com/markets/debt-markets/china-unlikely-to-sell-off-its-us-debt-holdings-td-20190522-p51pus,"Historically, the strategists said, China has sold Treasuries to check a sharp depreciation in the yuan as well as check capital outflows and that remains the most likely reason why China would be a seller again.

As for the potential that China would initiate a sell-off to retaliate against the US, the strategists are sceptical.

""We view retaliatory Treasury selling by China as the 'nuclear' response to trade tensions and view it as the least likely of those presented here.""

Another radical approach by China, in terms of selling Treasuries, could be to diversify its foreign exchange reserves out of US dollars into other currencies, the strategists said.

""This would be akin to the move taken by Russia in response to US sanctions, with Russian Treasury holdings declining from $US96 billion in March 2018 to just $US15 billion in May 2018.""

""However, China's $US1.1 trillion portfolio and trade surplus with the US make this degree of selling much less likely,"" the strategists said.

Still, China has been a heavy seller in the past, and it has had a market impact.

""From January 2015 to December 2016, we estimate that China (plus Belgium) sold $US430 billion of Treasuries. Note that these figures also include selling by Belgium because we believe China may have sold Treasuries through this custodian to disguise the magnitude of their selling flows.

""The selling was triggered by a change in PBOC's exchange rate regime, which then further exacerbated capital outflows and led to additional Treasury selling as the currency weakened.

""China was forced to sell Treasuries and buy RMB [yuan] in order to stabilise the currency, but not before creating significant market dislocations.""

Among the reasons TD sees as offsetting the need to sell in volume are there are fewer capital outflows now than in 2015, selling would lower the value of the nation's remaining Treasuries, selling of US dollar assets would boost the yuan, selling could tighten financial conditions, and there are few substantial alternative investments.

Still, TD isn't ruling out some selling.

""The situation remains fluid and if capital inflows do pick up, it is possible that China will be forced to intervene and sell some Treasuries.

""We will keep an eye for the following signs that China may be selling: an acceleration of capital outflows, an increase in dealer inventories of off-the-runs, or a cheapening of off-the-run to on-the-run Treasuries."""

Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers,https://www.npr.org,['Frank Morris'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/18/724433714/critics-say-usda-plan-to-move-federal-agencies-could-hurt-research-vital-for-far,"Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP

A couple of federal agencies you probably haven't heard of keep track of what farmers grow, what Americans eat and how the country's entire food system operates. And the Trump administration wants them out of Washington, D.C.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would relocate somewhere that's closer to farmers and public universities doing agricultural research. But critics, including many scientists, balked, saying the agencies won't be as effective.

ERS collects and crunches numbers on everything from how much corn syrup Americans consume to how tariffs affect farmers, while NIFA funds research that does things like closely track climate change.

USDA has yet to announce a new home for the agencies, but recently narrowed the list to three: the greater Kansas City metro area, the Research Triangle Park area near Raleigh, N.C., and various sites in Indiana — Vice President Mike Pence's home state.

Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran recalled when he heard of Perdue's proposal.

""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" said the Republican, who, along with other Missouri and Kansas members of Congress, supports the move.

""Not every job in government needs to be in Washington D.C."" Moran said, noting that about 9 out of 10 USDA employees already work outside of Washington.

He added that ERS and NIFA would boost budding research clusters like the Kansas City area's animal health corridor and give bright kids from the region a chance to stay put and still pursue a research career. The move would also fall in line with the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Moran said office rent and the cost of living is cheaper away from the coasts.

Skepticism about what is driving the move

But many in the research community said efficiency isn't driving the move. It's hostility toward science.

""I think that moving the agencies out of D.C. is going to significantly dilute their effectiveness as well as their relevance,"" says Ricardo Salvador, who is the Director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The agency's effectiveness already is under attack, according to a former ERS employee who was granted anonymity due to fear of losing his current position.

""Efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale,"" the ex-ERS employee said.

He said he enjoyed working at the agency until about a year and a half ago, when researchers began to fear tackling politically sensitive topics. Then, Purdue pushed to take the agency out from under nonpartisan oversight and place it under his control.

Finally, the ex-employee said, the surprise announcement to move most of ERS and NIFA out of Washington triggered a cascade of resignations, including his own.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee said.

Employees remaining at ERS and NIFA are fighting back. ERS researchers recently voted to join the American Federation of Government Employees, and NIFA employees plan to take a vote, too. The union will negotiate to give ERS and NIFA employees longer to decide if they want to move, and is backing legislation that would withhold funds USDA would need to make the move.

The Trump administration wanted staff reductions years ago. And all three Trump budgets, none of which have been accepted by Congress, have proposed deep cuts to the agencies.

Salvador argued that's because objective research often clashes with political ideology. ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.

""So the secretary is clearly dealing with inconvenient facts by going to the source and eliminating them,"" Salvador said.

Sen. Jerry Moran said he believes the research agencies can be relocated and well supported, and he's played a key role in fighting off earlier efforts to cut funding for agricultural research.

Moran said farmers, ranchers and policymakers can't make sound decisions without reliable USDA data.

But that's exactly the problem critics have with the proposal to move ERS and NIFA: They say the USDA hasn't produced data that support the move."
State Department condemns killing of American citizen in Nicaraguan prison,https://www.cnn.com,['Kevin Bohn'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/18/politics/state-department-nicaragua-prison/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department condemned the killing of an American citizen being held in Nicaragua after a prison uprising, according to Nicaraguan and US officials.

However, they disagreed whether the killing of Eddy Antonio Montes Praslín was a justified homicide as the US ambassador and a lawyer representing Nicaraguan political prisoners maintain, or if it was justified because he was attacking guards as the Nicaraguans maintain.

Montes was killed during an incident at La Modelo prison on Thursday, according to Nicaraguan officials.

""We vehemently condemn the killing of Mr. Montes. His death, the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians at the hands of (Nicaraguan President Daniel) Ortega's security and parapolice forces, and the continued detention of hundreds more political prisoners demonstrate the regime's utter disregard for human life and democratic freedoms,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""We call for an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation of Montes's death. We reiterate our call for the unconditional release of all political prisoners. The United States will hold accountable the Ortega regime and Nicaraguan security forces involved in human rights abuses and violations,"" she continued.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Companies owned by the family of Gov. Jim Justice have filed a lawsuit against the federal Office of Surface Mining, apparently preempting another impending lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The lawsuit by Justice companies contends the agency acted in bad faith by reversing course on a settlement deal. Lawyers for the Justice companies also insinuate the federal government may be acting out a political vendetta.

This is the second legal showdown this month between Justice companies and an agency of the federal government over defaulting penalties.

A separate lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Mine Safety and Health Administration was filed on May 7. That one contended Justice companies owe $4.7 million for 2,297 citations over five years.

That action is an aspect of why Justice companies contend they are being treated unfairly.

Office of the Governor Gov. Jim Justice

Governor Justice described unnamed political forces on May 8 when reporters asked for his reaction to the MSHA lawsuit.

“You know, we’re getting ready to go into an election year. You don’t really know where stuff comes from,” the governor said. “But at the end of the day, we’ll take care of our obligations. We always have and we always will.”

The lawsuit filed May 17 by Justice companies against the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement also makes reference to possible political motives.

The lawsuit contends the two parties had agreed to settle fines, reclamation fees and penalties when that agency suddenly started playing hardball.

“The abrupt turnaround by the government in its attitude toward this matter is inexplicable and raises the question whether untoward political or other pressure from sources presently unknown has been brought to bear on OSMRE, perhaps from other federal agencies or political adversaries of the Justice family,” the lawsuit states.

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Senior Judge Glen Conrad was assigned.

Documents within the filing allude to a possible impending lawsuit against Justice companies by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of OSM. If so, that would mirror the earlier lawsuit on behalf of MSHA.

An attached May 13 letter by Mike Carey, a lawyer for Justice and his companies, is addressed to the U.S. Department of Interior.

“I understand from discussions with your office last week that the filing of one or more complaints is imminent,” Carey wrote. “This is of grave concern and bewilderment to my clients. We believe it is unecessary, as we have now met every term your requested to settle this matter.

“If a file has been forwarded to the Department of Justice, I request that this correspondence be immediately provided to the individuals working on this matter and that they be notified we have agreed to all of the OSM’s settlement demands.”

Carey also represents the Justice companies on the MSHA lawsuit. And he represents the Governor’s Office on the lawsuit over whether Justice violates the state Constitution’s requirement to reside at the seat of government. Plus the Governor’s Office used Carey’s firm last year to investigate its own Department of Commerce.

A response to Carey by the Department of the Interior on May 15 also alludes to an impending federal lawsuit.

“Yesterday afternoon, a letter authorizing DOJ to file suit against the Justice Companies on behalf of the Department of Interior was signed and sent (the end of a process that has taken months to accomplish — the MSHA lawsuit plays no part in DOI’s referral to DOJ),” wrote John Austin of the Interior department.

“If your clients want to settle these cases before suit is filed, please make an offer that we can discuss with DOJ.”

The lawsuit filed by Justice companies contends another federal lawsuit would further damage the companies’ reputation.

“Any suit filed by the government in contravention of the Settlement Agreement would create a false impression and arguably be defamatory in that it would cause harm to the business and personal reputations of the Plaintiffs,” lawyers for the Justice companies wrote.

This has resulted from dozens of violations by several Justice companies recorded by OSM in recent years. A spreadsheet in the filing lists 114, but does not indicate their nature or a dollar value.

Eleven of the violations name Jay Justice, the governor’s son who runs the coal operation.

“For what is believed to be the first time ever, the OSMRE also wrongfully assessed a series of individual assessments against Jay Justice personally, allegedly relating to the activities of the Justice Mining Entities,” according to the lawsuit by Justice companies.

Negotiations by Justice company representatives, including Jay, and officials with OSM picked up in early April, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says Jay Justice and Tom Lusk, chief operating officer of Justice Mining Entities, met with Michael Castle, the field office director for OSM in Knoxville and Lexington, plus Mark Snyder, also with OSM.

The lawsuit indicates they meet several times April 8, sometimes with counsel and sometimes without.

Much of the conversation focused on Justice companies completing reclamation work in lieu of financial penalties. Part of the negotiation focused on whether the companies would need to provide additional financial information or collateral.

By late that month, according to Justice companies, significant expense had been expended to move equipment and start the reclamation work.

This month, according to Justice companies, the attitude of the federal government seemed to change.

“In the week of May 6, 2019, the government’s attitude toward the Justice Mining Entities noticeably soured,” lawyers for the company stated, noting the lawsuit that was filed by MSHA and the Department of Justice.

That filing prompted Austin of the Department of Interior to question whether Justice companies would be able to perform their duties under the settlement agreement, according to the Justice lawsuit.

In the May 15 letter, Austin stated that there had not been an authorized agreement to settle the penalties with OSM.

“I need to reiterate what you and your clients have been told: Neither OSMRe nor any of its employees nor the attorneys representing the Secretary of the Interior have authority to settle a debt owed to the United States that exceeds $100,000 without the approval of the U.S. Department of Justice.”

The Justice companies contended that playing hardball will mean the loss of mining jobs.

“As the plaintiffs previously made OMSRE and its attorneys aware, preceding litigiously instead of in accordance with the Settlement Agreement harms the operations of a dozen or so mining companies and risks the jobs of hundred of workers on the pending reclamation projects,” Justice company lawyers wrote.

The Department of Interior would like proof. It wants financial statements and any other information the company can provide to demonstrate a settlement is in the best interest of citizens.

“We will also need documentation of your belief that a settlement will preserve 450 jobs.”

EPA says Tacoma’s Manke Lumber has agreed to settle,https://www.thenewstribune.com,[],,,,https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article230615519.html,"Saving salmon: Why these remarkable fish matter to the Northwest For hundreds of thousands of years, wild ocean salmon have been coming to the Pacific Northwest.

Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK For hundreds of thousands of years, wild ocean salmon have been coming to the Pacific Northwest. Now, their existence is under threat, along with the communities they support.

Manke Lumber has agreed to settle allegations it violated the Clean Water Act at its Tacoma Tideflats facility, the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday.

Manke will pay a $320,000 penalty and build a treatment system to fix water quality violations, the EPA said.

The company will also invest in a project that will designate 38 acres of undeveloped land for conservation and recreation in Mason County. That includes 1,500 feet of Goldsborough Creek, 580 feet of a tributary and a 20-acre riparian corridor.





The project will provide good salmon-spawning habitat and will keep pollution away from the creek, the EPA said.

“Wastewater from lumber yards typically contains high pH, wood debris, oils and high levels of solids,” the EPA said in a press release about the settlement. “When these solids settle, they can form sediment deposits that destroy plant life and spawning grounds of fish.”

The News Tribune left a message Monday seeking comment from Manke’s attorney.

A complaint the EPA filed about two years ago in U.S. District Court in Tacoma alleged that Manke violated the Clean Water Act by sending polluted water into the Hylebos Waterway, without a proper permit.

The stormwater and wastewater at the facility comes into contact with sawdust, chemicals and metals, the agency found.

The EPA’s complaint asked the court to fine Manke more than $50,000 a day for some violations.

The agency didn’t say what that would have added up to.

“This settlement means less stormwater pollution and more salmon habitat for Puget Sound,” EPA Regional Administrator Chris Hladick said in the news release. “By upgrading and improving their stormwater controls and restoring habitat, Manke is investing in the future. Reducing stormwater pollution furthers our work to protect and restore Puget Sound.”

The public will have 30 days to comment on the agreement at justice.gov/enrd/consent-decrees, once it’s filed in federal court.

In addition to Tacoma, Manke has offices in Sumner and Shelton. Its 400 Pierce County workers made it the county’s 52nd-largest employer in 2016, according to the Economic Development Board for Tacoma-Pierce County."
