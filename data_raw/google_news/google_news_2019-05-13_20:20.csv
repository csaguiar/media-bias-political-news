"Trump blasts Tlaib over Holocaust comments, accuses her of 'tremendous hatred'",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-tlaib-holocaust-comments,"President Trump joined the chorus of criticism Monday against freshman Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib over her recent remarks about the Holocaust.

""Democrat Rep. Tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the Holocaust. She obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people,"" Trump tweeted. ""Can you imagine what would happen if I ever said what she said, and says?""

DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN TLAIB ACCUSES ISRAEL OF OPPRESSING, TARGETING 'PALESTINIAN CHILDREN AND FAMILIES'

The president's remarks came as fellow Republicans called for Democratic leaders to ""take action"" against their colleague from Michigan.

Tlaib, who is Palestinian-American, discussed the Holocaust on the Yahoo News podcast ""Skullduggery.""

""There’s always kind of a calming feeling, I tell folks, when I think of the Holocaust, and the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the fact that it was my ancestors — Palestinians — who lost their land and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, their existence in many ways, have been wiped out, and some people's passports,"" Tlaib said on the most recent episode, which was put out Friday. ""And, just all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews, post-the Holocaust, post-the tragedy and the horrific persecution of Jews across the world at that time. And, I love the fact that it was my ancestors that provided that, right, in many ways, but they did it in a way that took their human dignity away and it was forced on them.""

The state of Israel was formed three years after the end of the Holocaust, although historians have pointed out that modern migration to the region had started decades earlier. The area was named Palestine at the time, although it was under British control.

Tlaib's use of the phrase ""calming feeling"" in reference to the aftermath of the Holocaust is what has drawn backlash.

""There is no justification for the twisted and disgusting comments made by Rashida Tlaib just days after the annual Day of Holocaust Remembrance,"" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement. ""More than six million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust; there is nothing 'calming' about that fact.""

On Monday, Tlaib accused Trump and other Republicans of having ""twisted and misconstrued my words to spread falsehoods rooted in hate.

""Trump has doubled down on his party’s use of the Holocaust to score political points. Instead of recognizing that the accusations against me are false and that my words have been blatantly misconstrued, Trump has once again used his platform to incite hate and violence based on lies,"" she said in a statement. ""This is yet another attempt by the administration and the GOP to try to distract from their horrible policies, lawless acts, and actual anti-Semitic rhetoric.""

PITZER COLLEGE VOTES TO END STUDY-ABROAD PROGRAM WITH ISRAEL, CHEERED ON BY REP. RASHIDA TLAIB

Tlaib and Rep. Ilhan Omar. D-Minn., have both come under fire for alleged anti-Semitism since joining Congress earlier this year. In past remarks, Omar has said that Israel has ""hypnotized"" the world to be blind to Israel's ""evil doings,"" and has alleged that American support for the Jewish state is based on money. She has since apologized for those comments.

Donald Trump said he won in 2016 because he didn't release his taxes. Nope!,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/13/politics/donald-trump-taxes/index.html,"(CNN) On Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted this:

""I won the 2016 Election partially based on no Tax Returns while I am under audit (which I still am), and the voters didn't care. Now the Radical Left Democrats want to again relitigate this matter. Make it a part of the 2020 Election!""

It's a completely outlandish contention -- more on that in a minute -- that also doubles as the platonic ideal of Trump's fact-twisting: Not only does he have a casual disregard for the truth but he also seems to taunt the truth (and those who adhere to it) but pushing his ridiculous claims to eye-popping extremes.

So it's not enough for Trump to claim that his unwillingness to release any past tax returns -- the first post-Watergate president not to do so -- was a non-factor in the 2016 election. Instead, he has to go to the extreme of saying that not releasing his taxes was, in fact, a reason that people voted for him.

To be clear: There is ZERO evidence for that claim. None.

Lindsey Graham says the rule of law need not apply to Don Jr.,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/judiciary-chairman-lindsey-graham-urges-don-trump-jr-to-ignore-a-legal-subpoena-978515783885/,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) made his name as a staunch defender of the rule of law in America. But on Sunday, he urged President Donald Trump’s eldest son to simply ignore the law instead.

Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the suggestion in an interview on Fox News.

Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, adviser, and business partner, is a key figure in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s investigation into Russia inference in the 2016 elections. After the release of Robert Mueller’s report last month, Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC), who chairs that committee, subpoenaed Trump Jr. to come and answer additional questions — a move that became public last week.

Burr’s decision has drawn criticism from some of his fellow Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump himself, who have repeatedly claimed — contrary to all available evidence — that the Mueller report completely exonerated Trump and resolved all outstanding questions about Russian meddling.

Rather than comply with the legally valid subpoena however, Graham urged Trump Jr. to simply break the law.

“If I were Donald Trump Jr.’s lawyer, I would tell him, you don’t need to go back into this environment anymore. You’ve been there for hours and hours and nothing being alleged here changes the outcome of the Mueller investigation. I would call it a day,” Graham said.

Graham made his name as a House impeachment manager in the 1999 trial of President Bill Clinton, urging his removal from office. To be a person of character, he told the Senate at the time, “Don’t put your legal and political interests ahead of the rule of law and common decency.”"

President Donald Trump tried to take credit on Monday for a sudden turnaround in the Boston Red Sox’ season, pointing out that the reigning World Series champions have gone undefeated since their fraught visit to the White House last week.

“Has anyone noticed that all the Boston @RedSox have done is WIN since coming to the White House!” Trump wrote in a tweet. “Others also have done very well. The White House visit is becoming the opposite of being on the cover of Sports Illustrated! By the way, the Boston players were GREAT guys!”

Story Continued Below

The Red Sox, who visited the White House last Thursday, swept all three of their home games over the weekend against the Seattle Mariners, scoring 34 runs across the three games. Boston has won eight of its last 10 games, a stretch that predates the team's reception with the president.

Championship-winning sports team visits to the White House have become particularly politicized during the Trump administration, and the president has yanked invitations for at least two teams after prominent athletes said they would not attend the traditionally unremarkable events.

The same was true with the Red Sox team, which was represented by only a portion of last year’s team. Nearly every racial minority member of the team skipped the event, as did manager Alex Cora, a Puerto Rico native, who cited the administration’s handling of hurricane relief efforts there in declining the invitation. The team attempted to downplay the divide and last week reportedly barred a reporter from asking about the upcoming White House visit during a series in Baltimore.

Has anyone noticed that all the Boston @RedSox have done is WIN since coming to the White House! Others also have done very well. The White House visit is becoming the opposite of being on the cover of Sports Illustrated! By the way, the Boston players were GREAT guys! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2019

But while neither Trump nor the team addressed the elephant in the room during Thursday’s celebration on the South Lawn, Trump became defensive about his record on Puerto Rico earlier in the day when asked by reporters about the Red Sox visit. The awkwardness was compounded by the White House initially posting on its website that Trump would be celebrating the Boston “Red Socks” and later blasting out his remarks to the “World Cup Series Champions” via email.

Trump was correct Monday in noting that the Red Sox have won the three games since their White House visit, though their turnaround after an extended early season skid began several weeks before their trip to Washington. After falling to 6-17 in mid-April, the team has since won 16 of its last 22 games and was on a two-game winning streak before the team visited Trump."
"Hungary’s leader is waging war on democracy. Today, he’s at the White House.",https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/13/18564378/donald-trump-viktor-orban-white-house-visit-2019,"President Donald Trump will welcome Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to the White House on Monday, in what sounds like a routine reception for a foreign head of state. In reality, it’s something else: a meeting between two like-minded illiberal leaders, men at the forefront of the campaign to undermine Western democracy from within.

Hungary today looks like a democracy — there are still elections, and dissidents aren’t jailed. But since winning the country’s 2010 election, Orbán has subtly consolidated power and rendered elections almost impossibly unfair. He and allies of his political party, Fidesz, control nearly all of Hungary’s media; he manipulates the state’s economic powers to weaken potential rivals and empower his cronies. Widespread anti-immigrant sentiment, kicked off by the 2015 refugee crisis, has become a key propaganda tool Orbán uses to legitimize his power grabs.

Hungary is now the premier example of an emergent political model I’ve called “soft fascism”: a system that aims to stamp out dissent and seize control of every major aspect of a country’s political and social life without needing to resort to “hard” measures like banning elections and building up a police state.

Orbán has also been explicit that his goal is the defeat of liberal democracy. Trump hasn’t gone that far, but he has flashed some authoritarian instincts, and his party has shown it’s willing to go along. David Cornstein, a longtime Trump associate currently serving as US ambassador to Hungary, told the Atlantic that the president “would love to have the [political] situation that Viktor Orbán has.”

It’s hard to imagine a military coup or outright abolition of elections in the United States. It’s much easier to imagine a gradual hollowing-out of democracy akin to what’s happened in Hungary, a rise of soft fascism cheered on by Fox News and Breitbart. (Steve Bannon has called Orbán “the most significant guy on the scene right now.”)

Orbán is one of the leading faces of the far-right backlash to democracy in the Western world today. In normal times, he would be condemned by the occupant of the White House, not treated as an honored guest. The fact that he isn’t shows just how serious the threat to democracy in the West is — and how worried Americans should be about the health of their own institutions.

Viktor Orbán’s soft fascism

For roughly the first two decades of Hungary’s post-communist history, from 1990 to 2010, Hungary was a young but stable democracy. International observers touted it as a model of a successful transition from authoritarianism to democracy. When Orbán was elected prime minister the first time, in 1998, he governed as a relatively conventional European conservative; when Fidesz lost the 2002 elections, a new prime minister from the rival Socialist Party took over.

But though Orbán stepped aside, he and his followers never really accepted the 2002 defeat as legitimate. Immediately after the results were announced, Fidesz party officials accused their opponents of election fraud. In interviews, Orbán blamed the defeat on the lack of Fidesz-friendly media outlets that were parroting his party’s message.

The 2002 defeat seemed to spark a dramatic change in the Fidesz leader. In opposition, he launched a nationalist movement to support Fidesz called “Forward, Hungary.” A second electoral loss for the party in 2006 only accelerated the shift. In a now-famous 2009 speech, delivered at a closed-door party meeting, Orbán touted the need for political stability in Hungary, calling for the creation of a “central political forcefield” that would govern the country for up to 20 years.

In 2010, he got a chance to turn this vision into reality. That year, Fidesz won a “constitutional majority” — winning 263 seats, just over the two-thirds margin necessary to rewrite the constitution by parliamentary vote. The Fidesz constitutional majority swiftly went to work, rewriting parts of the constitution within months of taking power. Parliamentary districts were redrawn and gerrymandered to give Fidesz a leg up.

The new constitution also expanded the size of the country’s constitutional court, which decides whether laws passed by parliament are constitutional. Orbán filled the new seats with Fidesz loyalists. All judges over the age of 62 were also forced to retire, so their seats could be filled with even more Fidesz-friendly jurists.

Private media was a principal target of the Fidesz power grab. After the 2010 victory, the Fidesz government used the power of the state to pressure private media corporations to sell to the state or to oligarchs aligned with Fidesz. By 2017, 90 percent of all media (including every regional newspaper) in Hungary was owned by either the state or a Fidesz ally, according to a count by Budapest-based scholar Marius Dragomir.

Some anti-democratic tactics have been particularly shady. In the past two elections, Fidesz helped create several fake parties — including one that was being run by someone who turned out to be homeless — that got on the ballot using signatures of Fidesz supporters and dead people. These parties split the anti-Fidesz vote in competitive districts, making it much easier for the Fidesz candidate to win a plurality.

Economic policy, too, is cleverly designed both to enrich Orbán’s allies and to neutralize potential threats to their hold on power. Fidesz watches Hungary’s business community closely because they’re the people who could finance an anti-government uprising, and punishes those it sees as potentially serious threats.

Lajos Simicska, Orbán’s college roommate and a founding member of Fidesz, amassed a media and construction empire based largely on government ad revenue and contracts. He played an essential part in the prime minister’s rise to power, helping him build up the media infrastructure that allows Fidesz to so profoundly control public opinion.

But the two men eventually had a very public falling-out, and the government money that had kept Simicska’s business empire afloat suddenly stopped flowing in. He fell from No. 6 on the richest Hungarians list in 2015 to No. 21 in 2017. By July 2018, he was so thoroughly defeated that he announced plans to sell off the remains of his business interests to one of his partners.

If there’s one policy issue on which Orbán has built his success, it’s the migrant crisis. The state media outlets he controls routinely pump out anti-migrant propaganda. Hungary no longer faces 2015 levels of migration, and in fact has a minuscule percentage of foreign-born residents by EU standards. But many Hungarians are still convinced it is a dire threat to their country, in large part due to government propaganda.

Orbán has personally made an enemy of Hungarian American financier George Soros, a Holocaust survivor who he alleges is responsible for a plot to undermine Hungary demographically. In the runup to the 2018 parliamentary elections, Fidesz blanketed the country in huge posters featuring Soros’s grinning face, with captions like “99 percent reject illegal immigration” and “Don’t let Soros have the last laugh.”

In one campaign speech, Orbán described migration as an existential threat and blamed it on Soros. The language he used to describe the conspiracy supposedly led by his former benefactor barely concealed its anti-Semitism:

We are fighting an enemy that is different from us. Not open, but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; not national but international; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the whole world.

Soros’s pro-democracy charity, the Open Society Foundation, was forced to close its Budapest operations in 2018. This year, Central European University — one of Hungary’s top universities, founded by Soros — will move to Vienna under immense pressure from the Orbán government.

No single one of these moves destroyed democracy in Hungary. Cumulatively, though, they created a system in which it was very difficult for the opposition to compete on a fair playing field.

There’s a famous line from an Orbán speech from more than a decade ago, back when Fidesz was out of government: “We have only to win once, but then properly.” Since 2010, he’s followed this maxim to a tee.

Why Orbán’s White House visit is so chilling

In a remarkable 2017 speech, Orbán defined his project as not merely remaking Hungary but developing a new governing ideology that could challenge liberal democracy across the West.

He has labeled his vision both “Christian democracy” and, more ominously, “illiberal democracy.” Here’s how he defined the difference between this and more conventional notions of democracy in his July speech:

Christian democracy is, by definition, not liberal: it is, if you like, illiberal. And we can specifically say this in connection with a few important issues — say, three great issues. Liberal democracy is in favor of multiculturalism, while Christian democracy gives priority to Christian culture; this is an illiberal concept. Liberal democracy is pro-immigration, while Christian democracy is anti-immigration; this is again a genuinely illiberal concept. And liberal democracy sides with adaptable family models, while Christian democracy rests on the foundations of the Christian family model; once more, this is an illiberal concept.

The “democracy” part of Orbán’s illiberal democracy is, of course, a sham. But it’s not hard to see echoes of Trump and the modern GOP in Orbán’s ideological justification for soft fascism.

The personal similarities between the American and Hungarian leaders are hard to miss. Trump, like Orbán, is personally disdainful of constraints on his power and the free press. Trump, like Orbán, has built his political career around anti-immigrant populism. Trump, like Orbán, has bent the powers of state toward personal enrichment — and allowed his top officials to do the same.

But the most worrying part of all of this most isn’t the obvious Trump-Orbán similarity. It’s the parallels between the Republican Party and Fidesz.

Trump is, on his own, neither competent enough nor institutionally powerful enough to fatally undermine American democracy. Unlike Orbán in 2010, he didn’t come into office with a set of concrete plans for transforming the political system. Orbán had rewritten the Hungarian constitution within two years of taking office; Trump’s only major legislative accomplishment in two years is a tax cut.

In order for a Hungarian-style system to come to America, the GOP — not just Trump, but the party as a whole — would need to play a significant role. And Republican legislators, at both the state and national level, have shown a willingness to deploy Fidesz-like tactics that undermine the fairness of the democratic system.

Republicans have, for years now, engaged in a systematic and nationally coordinated effort to rewrite the rules of the political game in their favor. The spread of extreme partisan gerrymandering and voter ID laws, tools used by Republicans to marginalize minorities and other Democratic-leaning constituencies, are some of the most obvious examples.

The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) wrote draft legislation that Republican state legislatures around the country quickly and easily adapted into their own voter ID laws. Another effort, Project REDMAP, an initiative of the Republican State Leadership Committee, was a national coordinating committee helping Republicans at the state level put together extreme partisan gerrymanders in the wake of their sweeping 2010 victories.

In both cases, Republican or GOP-aligned organizations at the national level spearheaded a campaign to systematically undermine the fairness of the electoral system. They’re trying to change the system so Democrats can’t win in the first place — and at times, they’re even honest about it.

“I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats. So I drew this map in a way to help foster what I think is better for the country,” North Carolina state Rep. David Lewis, chair of the legislature’s redistricting effort, once said in defense of his gerrymander.

There are other examples of Fidesz-like electoral manipulation tactics at the state level. Ohio Republicans developed a system, upheld by the Supreme Court’s conservative majority last year, for purging thousands of voters from the rolls. When North Carolina voters elected a Democratic governor in 2016, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a bill stripping him of key powers. Wisconsin and Michigan Republicans tried similar moves after Democrats won the gubernatorial elections in their states in 2018.

Also like Fidesz, the GOP has built up a state-aligned media infrastructure while simultaneously working to discredit neutral outlets. A 2017 study from Emory University political scientist Gregory Martin and Stanford economist Ali Yurukoglu found, as my colleague Dylan Matthews explains, that Fox News’s reach and partisan tilt is large enough to swing whole elections (CNN and MSNBC had no comparable impact). Sinclair Media, a pro-Trump local news conglomerate, currently reaches 40 percent of American households through its various stations.

And Republican voters are profoundly hostile toward the mainstream media. Ninety-two percent of Republican voters believe “news sources report news they know to be fake, false or purposely misleading,” an Axios/SurveyMonkey poll from June found. An August 2018 Ipsos poll found that a plurality of Republicans — 43 percent — believe “the president should have the authority to close news outlets engaged in bad behavior.”

Finally, Republican elites have shown no willingness to stand up to Trump’s corruption or denounce his anti-immigrant populism. The party’s congressional delegation has covered for the former, refusing to investigate his numerous conflicts of interest, and embraced the latter, with then-House Speaker Paul Ryan and the bulk of the GOP congressional caucus backing an immigration reform bill that mirrored Trump’s hardline positions. Vice President Mike Pence went from calling Trump’s Muslim ban “offensive and unconstitutional” before the election to defending the travel ban once in office.

There remain vital distinctions between Fidesz and the GOP, though. While Orbán seems to actively want to destroy Hungarian democracy, there is no evidence that Republicans have any kind of similar desire — let alone a plan for turning it into action. The concern in the United States is more that Republicans are indifferent to the consequences of their actions: that they want to secure their hold on power and are willing to undermine democracy in the process of doing so.

While it’s not inevitable that Republicans will go further in this direction, it’s easy to imagine them doing so as the American electorate becomes more diverse and more liberal: with more extreme gerrymandering, harsher voter restrictions, and more right-wing media consolidation and harassment of independent outlets. No single law or anti-immigrant speech would inaugurate a soft fascist regime. But a version of Hungary’s system could plausibly take root without many Americans realizing it.

This is the lesson the Hungarian experience offers for the United States. A political party that was once dedicated to democracy can, over time, become so preoccupied with holding power that it no longer cares enough about the substance of democracy to play by the rules.

We are not on the immediate precipice of this happening. But Trump’s welcoming of Orbán is an opportunity to remind ourselves that we’re further along that path than any of us would’ve dreamed a few years ago."
"Trump administration breaks campaign promise, purges 200,000 VA healthcare applications",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/trump-administration-breaks-campaign-promise-purges-200-000-va-healthcare-applications,"""The current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs is absolutely unacceptable,” presidential candidate Donald Trump said when speaking at a rally on Oct. 31, 2015, in front of the retired battleship USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Va.

""Over 300,000 — and this is hard to believe, and it’s actually much more than that now — over 300,000 veterans died waiting for care,"" said Trump.

Trump’s strong condemnation of the Obama administration’s handling of the backlog of hundreds of thousands of veteran benefits claims made him the overwhelming choice for many veteran voters in 2016.

But after two years in the White House, the Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.

In purging this massive backlog of applications, the VA is declaring the applications to be incomplete due to errors by the applicants, despite the OIG findings and in violation of the promise Trump made to fix the system. This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits.

Under the supervision of Dr. Richard Stone, the executive in charge of the Veterans Health Administration, VHA managers last November instructed the agency’s IT staff members to purge over 200,000 pending healthcare applications.

Such a profound decision to deny veterans benefits should have to come from someone higher up — the president or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs — not from a career bureaucrat who has not been elected or confirmed by the Senate.

This purge flies in the face of previous guidance provided by lawmakers. On March 3, 2017, Senate and House Veterans Affairs committee members sent a joint letter to the VA, instructing the agency to delay its plans to purge these records. The committees wanted the VA to send new letters to veterans, informing them of their application status and potential equitable relief or financial reimbursement for service-connected health expenses caused by enrollment system errors, as prescribed by law.

Currently, VA is skirting this provision of the law by blaming veteran applicants for the agency’s own mistakes processing health and disability claims. As a result, to win benefits wrongfully denied due to VA’s administrative errors, veterans are forced to go to court and pay legal fees out of whatever benefits they ultimately win.

The Trump administration’s decision opens the door to the agency purging any future backlog of veteran claims for benefits by falsely declaring the applications incomplete due to veteran error.

This is the second time the VA has been caught using its IT department to adjudicate benefits for veterans. In January 2017, the IT department auto-enrolled over 70,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans whose applications had erroneously been held up until they could meet a “means test” — that is, prove their income level. This mass-approval of applications was done in preparation for then-Under Secretary David Shulkin’s confirmation hearing.

They did this without bothering to fix the systemic error that required proof of income from combat veterans, who aren’t required to provide it. As a result, there are still more than 20,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans being denied healthcare benefits due to an erroneous means-test requirement.

Moreover, the means test error in the enrollment system not only affects veteran access to healthcare benefits, but it also causes billing errors for thousands of veterans each year.

The Veterans Health Administration’s Member Services office, which manages the enrollment system, had to reexamine over 6,000 veteran income verification cases, because veterans were overbilled for medical copays ranging from $200 to $3,000. About 1,000 veterans are believed to receive fraudulent bills from the VA every month due to this known system error.

Despite being aware of these systemic issues for years, VA has not initiated an outreach campaign to educate the veteran community about what to do if their application is in a pending status or if they get a fraudulent bill due to missing means-test information.

Instead, the agency has chosen a policy of sending a single notification letter for pending applications, despite knowing that 25% of the letters mailed to veterans are returned or placed on hold due to bad address information in the enrollment system.

Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans routinely have incorrect address information in the enrollment system because they do not have permanent non-military addresses at the time of enrollment during the demobilization process.

The VA could resolve this problem through its data-sharing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration, to get current addresses for veterans in the pending backlog. But unfortunately for veterans, it is the VA’s practice to use information from the IRS and SSA only for the purposes of billing and verifying veterans’ dates of death.

All of these issues could be easily fixed. This is why President Trump’s reversal on this issue is so disappointing to the veteran community. Many veterans are asking why the enrollment system was not included in the President’s VA information technology modernization plan.

As a result, 200,000 applications have been purged, violating Trump’s promise. Currently, over 300,000 additional veteran healthcare applications remain in a pending status and will most likely be purged in the near future.

In the absence of executive leadership from the White House, veterans will continue to be denied access to their healthcare benefits at a rate of nearly 5,000 new pending healthcare applications per month.

"Trump welcomes Viktor Orban, Hungary's far-right nationalist prime minister, after past presidents shunned him",https://www.cnn.com,['Kevin Liptak'],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/13/politics/trump-hungary-viktor-orban/index.html,"Washington (CNN) He's rolled back democratic checks on his power, mused about creating a European ethnostate and erected a razor-wire fence to keep migrants out , angering the rest of the European Union.

So why was Hungary's far-right prime minister Viktor Orbán meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Monday?

""I know he's a tough man but he's a respected man,"" Trump said during a friendly photo-op at the start of the talks on Monday. ""Probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that's OK. That's OK.""

Administration officials say the invitation to the White House for talks — the first for a Hungarian prime minister in years — is part of a concerted strategy to re-engage Central European nations as Russia and China seek to exert influence in the region.

But the visit is raising questions about which leaders Trump is looking to cultivate — including a long list of global strongmen — at the expense of more traditional US allies.

Orbán was largely iced out during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both concerned about the steps he took to consolidate power and block independent media. He last visited the White House for one-on-one meetings in 2001, during his first stint as prime minister, but was refused a meeting with the President, instead resigned to meeting only with then-Vice President Dick Cheney.

Since then, he's adopted a more stridently nationalist tone — including calls to create in Hungary a homogenous society that blocks asylum seekers or other refugees.

""We must state that we do not want to be diverse,"" he said in a 2018 speech. ""We do not want our own color, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others.""

Trump has closely monitored Orbán during his time in office — and particularly his anti-migration stance, which mirrors Trump's own. Other European leaders shunned Orbán's decision to block migrants from entering his country with a fence, but Trump has advocated his own border wall. Steve Bannon, once Trump's senior adviser, once deemed Orbán ""Trump before Trump.""

""We are proud to stand together with the United States on fighting against illegal immigration, on terrorism and to protect and help the Christian communities around the world,"" Orban said in short remarks from the Oval Office.

Orbán isn't exactly being welcomed back to Washington with open arms. He was the first foreign leader to endorse Trump in his presidential bid, and has lobbied intensely for a meeting, but it took more than two years to secure a White House invite — the last of the major Central European nations to come for talks.

The delay reflected American officials' desire to discourage Hungary from further eroding democratic values. It's an issue they've raised at lower-level meetings, including when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Budapest in February.

A bipartisan group of senators wrote Trump on Friday to ""express concern about Hungary's downward democratic trajectory and the implications for US interests in Central Europe,"" imploring him to raise the issues during his meeting.

Yet when they sit for talks in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon, officials said the President was expected to focus on arms sales and energy independence — and not the concerning practices that have earned Orbán his strongman reputation.

""I can assure you that all of these issues have been well covered with all of our Hungarian counterparts,"" said one senior administration official. ""The point of this meeting is simply to reinforce the strategic relationship between NATO allies, the US and Hungary, not necessarily to thrash out every issue on the bilateral agenda, which we have been doing constantly for the last two years.""

Several advisers have cautioned Trump about appearing overly chummy with his counterpart, believing a warm embrace could hamper the administration's efforts to keep Orbán at arms-length.

Already, however, Trump's ambassador to Hungary has created waves by suggesting the limits Orbán has placed on challenges to his power are something Trump himself would embrace.

""I can tell you, knowing the President for a good 25 or 30 years, that he would love to have the situation that Viktor Orbán has, but he doesn't,"" David Cornstein told The Atlantic last week

The comment caught the attention of officials at the White House, who later claimed it was taken out of context. But it nevertheless illustrated the potential pitfalls of inviting a problematic pro-Trump leader the US is wary of elevating.

Trump announced during his meeting with Orbán that he would use next month's Group of 20 summit in Japan for meetings with both Putin and Xi.

The migration issue, along with Orbán's moves to consolidate control of the country's judiciary and threaten the independence of the media, has caused deep rifts with the European Union. Orbán's party was suspended in March from the EU's largest political coalition.

Trump has generated his own tiffs with the EU, namely over trade. He faces a mid-May deadline on imposing new tariffs on European autos.

VA Sec. Wilkie: A breakthrough in health care for veterans is coming in June -- Here's what to expect,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Robert Wilkie', 'Robert Wilkie Is The Secretary Of The U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sec-robert-wilkie-bringing-bipartisan-reform-to-veterans,"Imagine if Republicans and Democrats worked together to pass reforms that improve the lives of millions of people.

And imagine if those reforms put America’s veterans at the center of their health care decisions, leading to better customer service for our nation’s heroes.

This isn’t hypothetical. It happened last year when Congress passed the MISSION Act.

TRUMP REPORTEDLY TAKING BROAD LOOK AT VETERANS CONVICTED OF BATTLEFIELD CRIMES

The law gives the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the ability to provide veterans with the best health care possible, whether at VA health care facilities or with community providers.

The legislation sailed through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and the strong backing of veterans service organizations.

President Donald J. Trump’s signature put us on a path to implementing these reforms. On June 6, the MISSION Act will enable VA to consolidate the department’s community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that will empower veterans with the ability to choose the health care providers they trust.

So what can veterans expect on June 6?

Less red tape, more satisfaction and predictability for patients, more efficiency for our clinicians, and better value for taxpayers.

Veterans will be eligible to get community care for a variety of reasons, including when VA can’t provide the treatment they need or when care outside our system is in the best medical interest of the patient.

We listened to veterans and heard they preferred standards based on drive times rather than driving mileage because those standards better reflect veteran experiences, especially in large urban areas with lots of traffic.

To ensure our veterans are spending their time getting care instead of driving to it, patients facing an average drive time of 30-minutes or more for VA primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider closer to home. For specialty care, the drive-time standard will be an average of 60 minutes.

And to get veterans the care they need when they need it, VA patients facing a 20-day or more wait time for primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider who can deliver that care faster. For specialty care, the wait-time standard will be 28 days.

For additional convenience and timely treatment, eligible veterans will also have access to urgent, walk-in care that gives them the choice to receive certain services at participating community clinics in their communities. (To access this new benefit, veterans will select a provider in VA’s community care network and may be charged a copayment.)

Veterans will be encouraged to ask VA about these new options, and well-trained staff will be available to help them quickly understand their choices.

These exciting and important changes speak to my top priority – delivering the best medical customer service and offering veterans more health care choices.

With the MISSION Act, the future of the VA health care system will lie in the hands of veterans – precisely where it should be.

While we still have more work to do, the VA is making progress.

We are seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than ever before and studies show VA now compares favorably to the private sector for access and quality of care – and in many cases exceeds it.

And veterans have noticed.

Patients’ trust in VA care has skyrocketed to 87.7 percent, and in the last fiscal year, VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments – a record high and 623,000 more than the year before.

VA employees are noticing improvements as well. VA ranked sixth out of 17 Federal Government agencies in the Partnership for Public Service’s most recent “Best Places to Work” survey, up from 17th the year prior.

To maintain the trust of our veterans, we must continue to deliver. And we will constantly innovate, upgrade, and pursue ways to better serve our Nation’s heroes.

The MISSION Act is a vital part of this effort, giving VA the ability to implement the best practices we’ve learned in our nearly 75 years of experience offering community care.

The core of the doctor-patient relationship is trust. President Trump promised veterans that this core value would shape the VA.

"DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-found-carter-page-fisa-extensions-were-illegally-obtained-joe-digenova-says,"The Justice Department inspector general has determined the three Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained, attorney Joe diGenova said on Thursday.

In an investigation that began last year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into Trump's campaign.

The inspector general inquiry is expected to be completed in either late May or June, and diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Democrats on Capitol Hill are working overtime to investigate and discredit President Trump.

""They are doing that as a diversionary tactic away from the inevitable conclusions of the DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who, by the way, we have learned has concluded that the final three FISA extensions were illegally obtained,"" diGenova said on Fox Business. ""The only question now is whether or not the first FISA was illegally obtained.""

He pointed to memos, obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation, that suggest the FBI might have misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the first warrant application about an unverified dossier.

Horowitz ""apparently, as a result of those disclosures ... which he was unaware of — the bureau hid those memos from Horowitz — as a result of that they're doing additional work on the first FISA. It may be that all four FISAs will have been obtained illegally,"" diGenova said.

The dossier, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

The memos obtained by Citizens United, and shared with the Washington Examiner, show Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11 and admitted he was encouraged by a client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

Senate and House investigators told The Hill they too were unaware of the documents, which were given to and redacted by the FBI, and one member of Congress referred the memos to the Justice Department inspector general. ""They tried to hide a lot of documents from us during our investigation, and it usually turns out there’s a reason for it,"" House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

A memo from the House Intelligence Committee in February 2018 alleged Steele was paid over $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS to ""obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia."" The memo also said the FBI never informed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of the dossier's Democratic benefactors or Steele's anti-Trump bias when it applied to spy on Page, who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller over his interactions with Russians but was never charged.

In a rebuttal to the House Intelligence GOP memo, Democrats argued the Justice Department and FBI ""met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement.""

In recent days top former officials at the FBI have defended their handling of the warrant applications. Former FBI Director James Comey said during a CNN town hall on Thursday that “the most important part” of the dossier was on “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.” Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who acknowledged he ""wanted the burden on me to a significant degree"" in preparing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application paperwork, said it would have been ""gratuitous"" to name the U.S. persons — the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC — in the documents.

Both Comey and Baker said they are confident the bureau did nothing wrong in obtaining the warrants, although Baker admitted the inspector general makes him ""nervous.""

DiGenova appeared on Fox Business with his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing. She accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""hiding"" Comey's ""sins.""

DiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days.

He had been highly critical of Mueller's Russia investigation, claiming that Trump had been ""framed"" by the Justice Department and the FBI."
DHS asks Pentagon for help amid influx of migrants,https://thehill.com,[],05-12-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/443305-dhs-asks-pentagon-for-help-amid-influx-of-migrants-report,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has asked the Department of Defense (DOD) for more assistance, including providing tents, to handle a surge of migrants coming across the border with Mexico, a Pentagon spokesman confirmed.

CNN first reported that the DHS request was sent to the Pentagon Friday night, with one official saying that it was for single-occupancy units.

Col. Joe Buccino, told The Hill.

Shanahan’s trip came after Customs and Border Protection said last week that it expects more than 500,000 migrants crossing the border this fiscal year.

Shanahan said troops would remain at the border until it is secure.

“We’re not going to leave until the border is secure,” he said. “This isn’t about identifying a problem. It’s about fixing a problem more quickly.”

Additional ways to support the border mission were discussed between Shanahan and McAleenan on Saturday during the trip, a U.S. official told CNN.

Shanahan told Congress last week that 4,364 troops are currently stationed at the border and are expected to remain there until September, but he said Saturday that their stay “will not be indefinite.”

The administration has already queried the Pentagon about finding housing for migrants on military installations, and DOD in April approved a March request from the Department of Health and Human Services to find housing for as many as 5,000 unaccompanied migrant children.

President Trump’s penchant for secrecy is about to be tested in court,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Editorial Board', 'May At Pm']",05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-penchant-for-secrecy-is-about-to-be-tested-in-court/2019/05/12/bf604b4e-71c6-11e9-8be0-ca575670e91c_story.html,"AMONG THE mysteries surrounding President Trump’s conduct, one of the strangest is his penchant for meeting President Vladimir Putin of Russia without aides or interpreters, contrary to the practice of past presidents. The Post’s Greg Miller has quoted U.S. officials as saying there is no detailed record, even in classified files, of Mr. Trump’s face-to-face interactions with the Russian leader at five locations over the past two years, and in one case, Mr. Trump seized the notes made by an interpreter who was present.

This peculiar behavior is about to be tested in court. Three groups have brought a lawsuit seeking to force Mr. Trump and his advisers to follow the laws that govern presidential and federal agency records. So far, they allege, the president has failed to do so.

At issue are the Presidential Records Act, which covers Mr. Trump’s activities, and the Federal Records Act, which covers agencies such as the State Department. In normal procedure, State provides interpreters for such meetings. The presidential records law was passed by Congress in 1978, after Richard M. Nixon’s resignation, to prevent Nixon from destroying or otherwise disposing of his records and secretly recorded White House conversations. The law established that records of the presidency relating to duties of the office are the property of the American people, and it ended the previous tradition of presidential records belonging to former presidents. Importantly, the law also demands that the president take care to ensure his activities are documented and preserved for eventual access by the public — a vital form of accountability. Likewise, the Federal Records Act requires government officials to document their activities and preserve their history.

The three organizations questioning Mr. Trump’s adherence to the law are Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit government accountability group; the National Security Archive, a leading nonprofit research group at George Washington University that uses the Freedom of Information Act extensively; and the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, which represents scholars seeking to document U.S. diplomacy. In addition to Mr. Trump’s meetings with Mr. Putin, the groups question in their lawsuit whether an adequate record exists of the president’s conversations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, or of senior White House aide Jared Kushner’s meetings with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The failure to document these meetings is not only about compliance with the law. Mr. Trump’s secrecy deprives his own advisers of knowledge about what is going on and thus harms their ability to give him good advice. It will blast a huge crater in the work of historians who attempt to piece together what transpired in Mr. Trump’s presidency. It also deprives the American people of a basic method of holding Mr. Trump accountable for his performance. No doubt he likes it that way. But the courts must insist that no president is above the law, including the law for keeping honest and full records of the presidency."
House Democrats Subpoena Trump Tax Returns,https://www.npr.org,['Kelsey Snell'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/721876476/house-democrats-subpoena-trump-tax-returns,"House Democrats Subpoena Trump Tax Returns

Updated at 7:56 p.m. ET

House Democrats issued subpoenas on Friday to force Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to release six years of President Trump's tax returns.

Democrats say the returns include information about Trump and his business dealings that is critical to their constitutional oversight duties. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., issued the subpoena after Mnuchin failed to comply with a request from House Democrats that he voluntarily turn over the returns.

""While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material. I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work,"" Neal said in a written statement.

Administration officials, including Mnuchin, insist the request is unreasonable and illegal. Democrats argue that Neal, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is legally allowed to request the tax returns of any private citizen — citing a section of the tax code that states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" that information.

But Mnuchin rejected the request this week, telling Neal that he was relying on Department of Justice advice that the request ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.""

Trump has refused to comply with requests for his taxes since before he was elected, arguing that he is under audit and he does not believe he is legally required to disclose the information. ""There is no law,"" Trump said in April. ""While I'm under audit I won't do it.""

The IRS's Rettig told the House Appropriations Committee in April that there is no rule barring the release of tax returns if an individual is under audit.

Democrats say they are prepared for a lengthy court battle over the returns.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats have the legal authority to request Trump's taxes and must do so as part of their ongoing investigations.

This week, Pelosi cited a recent New York Times report that Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses between 1984 and 1993 as further reason to request his returns.

""It would be useful to see his tax returns,"" Pelosi said at an event sponsored by The Washington Post. ""The law says the administration 'shall' give the — 'shall.' It doesn't say 'may, should, could, under certain circumstances.' It says 'shall' give those tax returns to the Ways and Means chairman."""
EPA demolishes ‘dangerous’ building containing asbestos in Otsego,https://www.mlive.com,"['Brad Devereaux', 'Bdevereaux Mlive.Com', 'Bdeverea Mlive.Com']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2019/05/epa-demolishes-dangerous-building-containing-asbestos-in-otsego.html,"OTSEGO, MI — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s demolition of a building containing asbestos in Otsego is under way.

The EPA is on site this week, executing a plan to spend an estimated nearly $1 million to demolish Rock Tenn Paper Mill, 431 Helen Avenue, which is contaminated with asbestos, Paul Ruesch of the EPA said.

“That building was trashed. It was really dangerous,” Ruesch said on Friday, May 10, as demolition was progressing and much of the building had come down.

“I’m happy the EPA is able to take away the environmental hazard and the safety hazard,"" he said.

EPA to spend nearly $1M to demolish building containing asbestos in Otsego The building will be demolished in 2019.

Workers used heavy machinery equipped with shears, grapples and other tools to begin ripping down parts of the building this week, and a process is in place to control the dust during the project, Ruesch said. Contractors licensed to work with asbestos materials will remove the debris from the site and it will be disposed of in a special way, he said.

Beginning in the next week, residents will see an increase of slow-moving traffic on West River Street (also known as 106th Avenue) as trucks haul materials off the site, Ruesch said. People will be there using flags to alert motorists.

Some metal pieces will remain on the site once crews leave the area, Ruesch said on Friday.

The work began in April and is expected to be complete by the end of May, he said, and the project is expected to come in significantly under budget.

A previous environmental assessment identified asbestos contamination at the building that was part of the former RockTenn paper mill at 431 Helen Avenue in Otsego, Allegan County Executive Director of Services Dan Wedge has said. Allegan County took ownership of the 48-acre property that includes the building where asbestos was found through a tax foreclosure, Wedge said.

The project announcement comes after a joint request from the Allegan County Treasurer’s Office and the City of Otsego submitted June 28. The funds have been made available under the EPA Time-Critical Removal Action, Allegan County said.

The funding allows for the entire power house building to be demolished and removed by EPA contractors, the county said.

The money comes from U.S. EPA funds for Superfund sites, and the EPA will attempt to recover the cost from responsible parties, Ruesch said.

The paper mill closed in 2004. Anthony M. Davis of Canton bought the former Rock-Tenn site in 2006 and the property entered foreclosure in April 2011 after Davis’ company, Cogswell Property LLF, failed to pay overdue property taxes.

Davis was sentenced to a year in prison in 2013 after he pleaded guilty to one count of violating the Clean Air Act by failing to obtain a thorough asbestos inspection for the mill’s powerhouse building before stripping out pipes that he knew were wrapped in insulation containing asbestos. He was sentenced to pay $168,029.59 in restitution to the the EPA.

In 2012, the EPA arranged to remove about 200 drums and bins of toxic waste from the former RockTenn site.

The land is for sale now and will be available for purchase for a minimal investment, Wedge said previously. The demolition is meant to help bring more redevelopment opportunities, he said."
Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker admits he is 'nervous' about DOJ inspector general,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-admits-he-is-nervous-about-doj-inspector-general,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker admitted on Friday that he is “nervous” about DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation into the conduct of the DOJ and the FBI during the Trump-Russia probe.

Sitting down with with Lawfare’s Benjamin Wittes in a crowded room at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., Baker said he is “assuming that they will dig and find stuff” and that “we’ll try to sort it out and see what mistakes were made.” But Baker defended the FBI's actions, including its use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Horowitz’s investigation is particularly focused on alleged FISA abuse and the reliance on British ex-spy Christopher Steele in FISA applications targeting Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Steele’s dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and the opposition research group Fusion GPS. The investigation is expected to finish in May or June.

Wittes said that Baker “had expressed great confidence in the way you guys conducted yourselves, in the integrity of these fundamental judgments, in the opening with respect to two separate investigations and with the respect to the handling of this FISA application.” Wittes then asked Baker: “So, how nervous are you about the IG?”

Baker said he is “always nervous about the IG,"" adding that “they’re coming in after the fact to look at what we did."" At the time, he said, the FBI was “trying to do it in real time and having the pressure to deal with these threats as they were coming.”

Baker contended that he was “confident in the judgments that I made at the time based on the information that I had available to me.” But he left open the possibility that others may have engaged in wrongdoing, saying, “I’m sure they will find things that I didn’t know at the time and maybe that others didn’t know at the time.”

“There were facts that existed in the Bureau that were known by certain people that weren’t known by others including me, that’s certainly possible and that happens frequently,” Baker said. “And so, I’m assuming that they will dig and find stuff like that. So, we’ll try to sort it out and see what mistakes were made.”

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].”

Horowitz said he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

During the event Friday, Baker defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier and stressed that he examined the FISA warrant applications on Page before they got signed and sent to the court. He said he was “comfortable” with their contents and was confident that the process remained “lawful.” Regarding the FISA court, Baker said: “These are federal judges for goodness' sake. They know how to evaluate wiretap applications. ... These are serious, serious judges.”

On the bureau’s handling of Steele, Baker said, “We’re not stupid. The FBI. We’re not stupid.”

And Baker said the FBI was careful in the way it used Steele’s reporting. “We have an obligation to take that information seriously and to be highly skeptical … You go to work … You try to validate it … We don’t just swallow it hook, line, and sinker. ... We spent a lot of time trying to vet that information line by line,"" he said.

“We are the Federal Bureau of Investigations, not the Federal Bureau of Conclusions,” Baker said defensively.

Steele has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks. The Wall Street Journal reported that Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele. And the New York Times reported that the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources and as early as January 2017 agents had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

Baker mentioned that he’s faced investigations before. “I’ve been investigated — or matters that I’ve worked on have been investigated — many times by the Inspector General. It’s not a pleasant process. It’s just not. The people are pleasant but the process is not the most enjoyable,"" he said.

Baker may have been referring to an alleged criminal leaks investigation that had been opened on him, which had been reported on as early as December 2017. He confirmed the existence of an investigation but declined to provide many specifics, saying, “Yes there is an investigation with respect to matters in which I was involved that is still open that I have cooperated fully with. I met with the investigative team for many hours over many days. That took place about a year and a half ago.”

“I haven’t heard anything since then … other than to hear from the Department that the matter is still open.” Baker said. “I am confident that I did nothing wrong and nothing illegal.”

Baker was appointed as the FBI general counsel in January 2014 and was later reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, Baker resigned from the FBI and has since written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

As the event ended, Baker summed up his thoughts on all of these investigations. “Hindsight is 20/20,” he remarked."
What is US impeachment? Six things to know,https://www.aljazeera.com,[],,,,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/impeachment-6-190510153644885.html,"As the confrontation between US President Donald Trump and Democrats over Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report intensifies, talk of impeachment has continued to swirl around Congress.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, has so far resisted calls to begin impeachment proceedings. Instead, House committees are aggressively investigating Trump, a Republican, through subpoenas of witnesses and documents.

In an April 22 letter to fellow Democratic politicians, Pelosi urged restraint and patience, insisting that it is ""important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings"".

She repeated that sentiment on Thursday, saying Democrats will take a step-by-step approach. ""We won't go any faster than the facts take us or any slower,"" she said.

But she did say that as Trump continues to stonewall congressional investigations, he is ""becoming self-impeachable"".

Trump and his supporters argue the Mueller investigation into the president and Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election is ""case-closed"".

Despite the top Democrats' effort to tamp down impeachment talk, several Democrats, including some 2020 presidential contenders, want the House to start impeachment proceedings.

Here's what you need to know about the US impeachment:

1. What is impeachment in the US political system?

The founders of the United States included impeachment in the US Constitution as an option for removal of presidents by Congress.

190509180227461

Impeachment, a concept in English common law, was one of the more hotly debated points during the constitutional convention of 1787 in Philadelphia. Delegates agreed that presidents could be removed if found guilty by Congress of ""treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors"".

Sole authority under the Constitution to bring articles of impeachment is vested in the House of Representatives where proceedings can begin in the Judiciary Committee. If the House approves articles of impeachment, or ""impeaches"" a president, he or she would then be subject to trial in the US Senate.

2. On what grounds can a president be impeached? How does impeachment work?

Under the Constitution, the president, vice president and ""all civil officers of the United States"" can be removed from office for ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors"".

To begin impeachment proceedings, a House member can introduce an impeachment resolution, or the entire House can vote to initiate an investigation into whether there are grounds for impeachment. The House Judiciary Committee or a special committee will then investigate. The panel votes on whether to bring a vote to the full House. Impeachment in the 435-member House must be approved with a simple majority.

190425185711995

If the House votes to impeach, the matter moves to the Senate, where a trial is held. The chief justice of the US Supreme Court presides over the trial.

A two-thirds majority vote is required in the 100-member Senate to convict and remove a president from office.

The Senate is made up of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. At least 20 Republicans would have to vote with all Democrats and the two independents to remove the president.

3. Which presidents have been impeached?

Only two US presidents have ever been successfully impeached and in neither instance was the president removed from office. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 in the tumultuous aftermath of the American Civil War; and Bill Clinton in 1998 for issues including his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Both times, the House approved formal charges and impeached the president, only to have the Senate fail to convict and remove him.

The House Judiciary Committee in 1974 voted to recommend impeachment accusing another president, Richard Nixon, of planning to obstruct an investigation in the Watergate scandal. Before the full House could vote on impeachment, Nixon became the only US president ever to resign.

4. Who would become president if Trump was impeached and removed? What would happen to Trump?

A Senate conviction that removed Trump from office would automatically elevate Vice President Mike Pence to become president, completing Trump's term, which ends on January 20, 2021.

190509180227461

Criminal charges cannot be brought against a sitting president, however, the Constitution does allow for separate criminal charges once a president is removed.

5. What do the Democrats say about impeachment? What does Trump's team say?

The Democratic leadership has so far tried to tamp down impeachment talk, instead advocating a ""methodological"" approach.

On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for his failure to hand over the full, unredacted Mueller report.

Pelosi said, however, that she isn't going to rush the full House vote on the contempt resolution.

""This is very methodical, it's very Constitution-based,"" the top Democrat told reporters on Thursday. ""We won't go any faster than the facts take us, or any slower than the facts take us.""

Democrats want to see Mueller's full Russia-Trump investigation report, as well as some of the underlying evidence.

Barr last month released a 448-page redacted version of Mueller's report on his 22-month investigation into Russian election meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

190507180015645

The redacted Mueller report details extensive contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Moscow, as well as the campaign's expectation of benefiting from Russia's actions.

It did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russian operatives.

The investigation did, however, examine ""multiple acts by the president that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations"". Mueller did not conclude that Trump committed obstruction of justice, but did not exonerate him either. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein subsequently concluded that Trump did not break the law.

The Department of Justice has accused Democrats of engaging in ""inappropriate political theatrics"" - an accusation Democrats dismissed.

Hours before the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt, Trump asserted executive privilege to block the release of the Mueller report.

The Trump administration has also blocked staffers and former aides from attending interviews or hearings, as well as having refused to disclose his subpoenaed tax returns.

Top Republicans have declared the Mueller investigation ""case closed"".

""This investigation went on for two years,"" McConnell said from the Senate floor. ""It's finally over.""

Can the Supreme Court help Trump?

On the question of impeachment, Trump's personal lawyer said in a recent New York Daily News interview that impeachment would give Trump a boost in advance of the 2020 presidential election.

Democrats ""can do it if they want to,"" Rudy Giuliani said. ""Would it politically be the best thing that could happen to the president? Absolutely.""

190418154116647

But he has somewhat backtracked on those comments, telling the New York Times, ""Nobody wants to be impeached. I think Clinton would say, even though it worked out to his favour, he would have rather not been impeached.""

Trump himself has falsely said he could turn the Supreme Court if the House moved to impeach him.

""I DID NOTHING WRONG,"" Trump tweeted last month. ""If the partisan Dems ever tried to Impeach, I would first head to the U.S. Supreme Court.""

But the Supreme Court has previously ruled that impeachment authority resides solely with Congress.

Pelosi said she recognised what the Trump administration is trying to do.

""Trump is goading us to impeach him,"" she recently said at a Cornell University event.

190418154116647

""That's what he's doing,"" she said. ""Every single day, he's just like taunting, taunting, taunting because he knows that would be very divisive in the country, but he doesn't really care. He just wants to solidify his base.""

Who's calling for impeachment?

As Democratic leadership continue to tiptoe around impeachment, a number of more progressive members of Congress have said it's time for proceedings to begin.

""I believe impeachment is the solution to a constitutional crisis,"" Representative Al Green told US media.

Similar calls have also come from Rashida Tlaib, as well as Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.

""If any other human being in this country had done what's documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail,"" Warren said during a CNN town hall.

""He serves the whole thing up to the United States Congress and says, in effect, if there's going to be any accountability, that accountability has to come from the Congress,"" Warren said. ""And the tool that we are given for that accountability is the impeachment process. This is not about politics; this is about principle.""

6. What do Americans say about impeachment?

The number of Americans who said Trump should be impeached rose five percentage points to 45 percent since mid-April, while more than half said multiple congressional probes of Trump interfered with important government business, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday.

The opinion poll, conducted on Monday, did not make clear whether investigation-fatigued Americans wanted House of Representatives Democrats to pull back on their probes or press forward aggressively and just get impeachment over with.

190426171654736

In addition to the 45 percent pro-impeachment figure, the Monday poll found that 42 percent of Americans said Trump should not be impeached. The rest said they had no opinion.

In comparison, an April 18-19 survey found that 40 percent of all Americans wanted to impeach Trump.

An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll from April 24-29 put the overall support of impeachment at 39 percent.

The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed stronger support for impeachment among Democrats and independents.

It also showed that 57 percent of adults polled agreed that continued investigations into Trump would interfere with important government business. That included about half of all Democrats and three-quarters of all Republicans.

The poll also found that 32 percent agreed that Congress treated the Mueller report fairly, while 47 percent disagreed.

Trump's popularity was unchanged from a similar poll that ran last week - 39 percent of adults said they approved of Trump, while 55 percent said they disapproved.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English, throughout the US. It gathered responses from 1,006 adults and had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about four percentage points."
"Exclusive: Documents Detail Meetings Of Russians With Treasury, Federal Reserve",https://www.npr.org,['Tim Mak'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/721763041/exclusive-documents-detail-meetings-of-russians-with-treasury-federal-reserve,"Exclusive: Documents Detail Meetings Of Russians With Treasury, Federal Reserve

Enlarge this image toggle caption Pavel Ptitsin/AP Pavel Ptitsin/AP

Newly obtained documents describe what happened when two now-infamous Russians took their outreach campaign into the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve in 2015.

Alexander Torshin, then a Russian central banker, brought his protégée, Maria Butina, for meetings with senior officials and even sought another with the then-chair of the Fed, the documents confirm.

Agency officials described what happened before and since in internal materials obtained by NPR under the Freedom of Information Act. The fact of the meetings has previously been reported, but their contents have not been fully described until now.

Torshin has since been sanctioned by the Treasury Department and cannot return to the United States.

Butina, meanwhile, has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to serve as a Russian agent and has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.

In an interview with NPR on Thursday, Butina called her meetings with government officials, politicians and the National Rifle Association ""civil diplomacy, this unofficial channel of diplomacy"" and said it was meant to build relationships between the U.S. and Russian governments — and ultimately to promote peace.

The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department declined to comment for this story.

The 'gun fanatic'

Torshin and Butina sought to build bridges between the Russian government and influential Americans via their enthusiasm for gun rights. Both had life memberships in the National Rifle Association.

At the same time, Russia was stepping up its broader campaign of influence against the United States.

So in 2015, after the chill in relations between Washington and Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Torshin sought to take advantage of his connection to Russia's central bank.

Paul Saunders, who was then the executive director of a D.C.-based think tank called the Center for the National Interest, reached out to officials with the Treasury and the Fed to help organize meetings.

""Because we were about a year into U.S. sanctions on Russia following their annexation of Crimea, we thought it would be interesting for Americans to hear from a Russian central bank official about the status of the Russian financial system,"" Saunders told NPR. ""We were certainly not at that time aware of any derogatory information about Torshin.""

Saunders helped broker a meeting for Torshin and Butina with Nathan Sheets, then the undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs.

Treasury aide Erik Woodhouse consulted with a number of officials inside its Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence and the White House's National Security Council, but no red flags were raised about the meeting, which ultimately took place on April 7, 2015.

A few years later, after Butina was arrested, a Treasury Department staffer wrote about what took place.

According to that newly revealed account, the discussion wasn't so much about banking as about denying Russia's involvement in the shoot-down of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner and amplifying Torshin's support for guns.

""The meeting was supposed to be about economics, but the guy just went on and on about how the Russians didn't shoot down MH17 for an hour or so,"" the Treasury Department official wrote, referring to the Malaysia Airlines flight.

""The guy was also a gun fanatic and said he was a 'life member of the NRA.' In fact I think he was even in town for personal business tied to the NRA.""

Saunders also reached out to request a meeting between then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Torshin in March 2015.

Yellen's office passed on the meeting and suggested that Torshin instead meet with Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer. Following the approval of an adviser, Fischer took the meeting on April 8, 2015, without further investigation into Torshin's background.

""They are in the United States to attend the NRA's annual meeting,"" the meeting's official notes read. Both Russians pointed out, as part of their introduction, that they were ""life members"" of the NRA.

This meeting did turn to economic issues, including discussions about Russian credit and inflation.

Butina, now in custody at a detention center in Alexandria, Va., said the meetings were unremarkable.

Of her meeting with Fischer, she said: ""Torshin put it straight: that he is here as an NRA member and he's just interested in meeting similar-minded people. ... I don't remember, even, the details of this conversation, because it wasn't significant at all.""

The sanctions

After months of investigations and headlines about Russia's influence campaign against the United States, Torshin was placed under sanction by the U.S. government in 2018.

In the evidentiary package that designated Torshin as a target for U.S. sanctions — also obtained by NPR — the Treasury Department established that Torshin was a Russian government official who could be targeted under existing sanctions authorities.

But the package also highlighted Torshin's alleged links with Russian organized crime.

Citing public sources such as Crime Russia, a news website focusing on Russian corruption, and El País, a Spanish newspaper, the document noted that Torshin was in ""frequent contact"" with Alexander Romanov, who heads the Taganskaya organized crime group, between August 2012 to May 2013.

""Torshin may have personally given instructions to members of the Taganskaya on money laundering methods using Spanish bank accounts and real estate,"" the evidentiary package reads.

The package cites no classified or governmental sources, but experts say the inclusion of references to Torshin's alleged organized crime links suggests the U.S. government had reason to believe the allegation was truthful.

""There's a whole process that is used for determining what is included in an evidentiary package. By including it, they view it as credible and relevant to designating him with sanctions,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, who formerly served as a senior adviser to the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

""This information is strictly ancillary to the legal authorities needed to sanction Torshin, but they want to put it out there for government officials to be aware of.""

Butina told NPR that she once asked Torshin about these alleged links, but she said she didn't believe they were true.

""I have no knowledge about this, absolutely none. ... One time I asked him about it, and he denied it ... a couple of years ago,"" she said. ""I don't believe he has this type of personality."""
"After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/05/10/after-outcry-usda-will-no-longer-require-scientists-label-research-preliminary/,"

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has dropped a requirement that peer-reviewed studies by staff scientists include a disclaimer that findings are “preliminary.” (Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images)

The Agriculture Department has dropped its demand that staff scientists label peer-reviewed research as “preliminary,” after angry protests followed a Washington Post story disclosing the policy.

But the latest guidelines, released on Wednesday, for internally reviewing science within the department raise additional questions about scientific integrity, said non-USDA researchers who inspected the guide.

Since July, the department required peer-reviewed studies to include a disclaimer, The Post reported last month. Some finalized reports came with a caveat — these findings and conclusions are “preliminary” and have “not been formally disseminated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.”

USDA employees, editors of scientific journals and science advocates worried the disclaimer might be used to undercut scientists whose research was at odds with Trump administration policies. They also were concerned the language was confusing and potentially misleading.

The scientific community, generally speaking, does not expect peer-reviewed journals to publish preliminary results. The disclaimer, though enacted only as a temporary policy, appeared in several published articles, including a report on the best practices for capturing wild pigs.

This week, acting USDA chief scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young released a memo that replaced the July policy. It requires the following language when disclaimers are necessary: “The findings and conclusions in this [publication/presentation/blog/report] are those of the author(s) and should not be construed to represent any official USDA or U.S. Government determination or policy.”

Brooks Hanson, vice president of science at the American Geophysical Union, an organization that includes soil and agricultural researchers, said the updated disclaimer is a “welcome” change.

“The previous wording that required scientists to label their research submitted for publication as ‘preliminary’ would downplay the significance and importance of their work and cause confusion among readers,” Hanson said. The new language is closer to other disclaimers required by federal departments. “It is a positive development that USDA seemed to listen to the criticism and feedback.”

Still, he added, even this language may not be needed: “Many journals have this statement on their mastheads. This expectation, that an article represents the views of the authors only, is indeed the standard.”

Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a D.C.-based organization that advocates for scientists, said that “removing ‘preliminary’ from the disclaimer is a step in the right direction, but there still may be unnecessary obstacles preventing agency researchers from publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals.”

Not every study published by a USDA scientist is required to have this disclaimer. Some research agencies at USDA, including the Agricultural Research Service, the Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service and the Forest Service have “agency-specific policies” that determine when a disclaimer is appropriate, said William Trenkle, the USDA scientific integrity officer.

Others, such as the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have been encouraged to follow the new guidelines.

Those outline when disclaimers are needed and also describe the department’s internal review process before scientists can publish results in journals. It lists several “flags” that may trigger additional scrutiny. Some flags, under the umbrella of “prominent issues,” include “significant” scientific advancements, the potential to attract media attention, and results that could influence trade or change USDA policy.

Members of other USDA agencies, including the office of the chief scientist, the communications office and the office of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, can request “corrections” and “changes,” if the scientific publication falls under the category of “prominent issues” or policy implications.

“It is the responsibility of reviewers at all management levels to identify whether the manuscript contains prominent issues,” Trenkle said.

If USDA or other federal “stakeholders” request alterations based on these issues, then study authors should return “the REVISED PUBLICATION” for “ACCEPTANCE of the CHANGES and/or RESPONSE to comments,” the guideline says [capitalization is in the original].

Trenkle said the policy conforms with the USDA’s scientific integrity rules and “helps to ensure that USDA scientists communicate their scientific findings objectively without political interference or inappropriate influence.”

But Susan Offutt, who was the administrator of the Economic Research Service under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the guide twists internal review “into a process by which policy officials get the final say on content.” Because researchers at the Economic Research Service publish statistics to aid policymakers, “just about any output” from that agency could be flagged, she said.

USDA’s “interests apparently concern consistency with prevailing policy,” Offutt said, “not the public’s access to the best, unbiased science and analysis.”

Collusion: How the State Department tried to save Voice of America from Soviet influence in WWII,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/collusion-how-the-state-department-tried-to-save-voice-of-america-from-soviet-influence-in-wwii,"Last week, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, marked World Press Freedom Day with an excellent speech. Amid powerful remarks in defense of press freedom, Cruz recounted how the U.S. State Department had tried several times to censor out President Reagan’s famous words, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,” from his 1987 address at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.

Three times, State Department staff had tried to delete this now-famous phrase, objecting that it was too belligerent. Three times, Reagan put it back in. As Cruz told the story, Reagan finally explained to them: ""You don’t understand. This is the whole point of the speech.""

I was in charge of the Voice of America Polish Service when Reagan delivered his Berlin Wall address. We reported on it, of course, but I remember that unlike refugee VOA journalists like myself, many VOA English newsroom reporters at that time were horrified by Ronald Reagan.

To many of my VOA newsroom colleagues, he was a dangerous warmonger. Fortunately, their view was not shared by most VOA journalists in the East European foreign language services. They admired Reagan’s courage, as did dissidents and most people in countries behind the Iron Curtain.

Voice of America did not report on Sen. Cruz’s speech and its fascinating details about the Cold War. This is interesting, because he gave it at the invitation of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which manages VOA. The agency streamed the speech live on Facebook, but this dysfunctional and obscure bureaucratic agency was only able to get five live viewers.

I think I know why VOA ignored Sen. Cruz’s speech. It’s not because his speech was not newsworthy. The answer lies within the ideologically-driven activism of some VOA officials and journalists, combined with their willingness to censor facts and viewpoints they don't like while promoting their own left-wing political causes on the taxpayer's dime.

Two years ago, reporters and editors in today’s VOA English newsroom had no problem playing a monologue video of American communist and Lenin Peace Prize winner Angela Davis. They presented her as a champion of human rights, failing to disclose her former support for the Soviet Union and Communist Party membership.

The State Department does not have a monopoly on poor political judgment. When one looks at the history of U.S. international broadcasting, left-wing Voice of America journalists were more eager supporters of Stalin and state socialism than most U.S. diplomats. In April 1943, the State Department intervened twice to save VOA, then in the Office of War Information, from the influence of pro-Soviet officials and VOA broadcasters. This included VOA’s first director, John Houseman, and VOA’s first chief news writer and news director, Communist author Howard Fast. After Fast was forced to resign from VOA in 1944 due to pressure from the State Department and the FBI, he was honored in 1953 with the Stalin Peace Prize, worth about $235,000 in today’s dollars.

Houseman, a Hollywood actor, was also forced to resign from his position as VOA director after Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles sent a secret memo to Franklin Roosevelt's White House warning against Soviet influence over the Office of War Information’s domestic and foreign propaganda programs. The State Department refused to give Houseman and Fast U.S. passports for government travel abroad.

But the State Department’s behind-the-scenes intervention against collusion with Soviet Russia at VOA was only partially successful. Also in 1943, Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle and other State Department diplomats tried to warn VOA not to embrace the Soviet propaganda lie about the Katyn massacre of thousands of Polish officers by the Soviet NKVD secret police. Their advice was ignored by OWI’s leadership. The FDR White House was not interested in countering this particular Soviet propaganda message, but when pro-Soviet VOA broadcasts started to threaten the lives of American soldiers by criticizing U.S. deals with Vichy France and Italy, FDR sided with the State Department and Gen. Dwight Eisenhower against the Office of War Information. Eisenhower later accused VOA’s communist sympathizers of “insubordination” against their own president.

During World War II, U.S. diplomats were not fully successful in eliminating foreign ideological influence over VOA broadcasts. The process of getting rid of pro-Soviet VOA journalists continued after the Office of War Information was abolished by President Harry Truman and VOA was moved to the State Department in 1945. Management reforms and the hires of new broadcasters who were opposed to communism were not completed at VOA until about 1952.

Contrary to conventional wisdom that journalists always seek the truth and cherish freedom, some of the best educated and experienced State Department diplomats were less fooled by Soviet propaganda during World War II than were Voice of America's officials and broadcasters. World War II VOA programs were mostly designed to counter propaganda from Nazi Germany and Japan, but U.S. government broadcasters also started to present the Soviet Union and Stalin as champions of freedom and human progress.

In later years some VOA officials and journalists participated in the cover-up of VOA’s early love affair with Stalin and Soviet communism. They misled Americans about VOA’s history of initially supporting Stalin’s takeover of Eastern Europe with Soviet-generated propaganda and disinformation. Eventually, pressure from Congress and public opinion turned VOA into a relatively successful voice in support of freedom during the later years of the Cold War, but the early history of VOA’s cheering for Stalin and socialism in Eastern Europe has been covered up and forgotten.

The danger of the Voice of America becoming a tool of foreign propaganda — be it Russian, Iranian or Chinese — and a tool of domestic partisan and ideological activism, reemerged in the last several years under the hapless Obama-era holdover management team in charge of the United States Agency for Global Media. Independent studies have shown pro-Putin, pro-Iranian regime, and pro-communist China bias in VOA programs, as well as illegal targeting of American audiences through Facebook ads.

Responding to media reports of internal scandals not only at VOA but also at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently called for getting a new CEO to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Pompeo said that the agency in charge of foreign media outreach must have “the right leadership so they can do the traditional mission — perhaps in a different information environment than we did back in the Cold War, but can perform its function in a way that is important and noble, and reflects the enormous resources that are — that American taxpayers have put towards that.”

“I’m very concerned about it,” Secretary Pompeo added.

More Americans should be concerned. Their tax money might be going to foreign propaganda, as some VOA officials and some (not all) U.S. government-hired journalists allow ideology and foreign influence to take precedence over the journalistic requirements of the VOA congressional charter: accuracy, balance, and nonpartisanship in Voice of America programs.

Industry group tied to EPA air chief dissolves,https://www.politico.com,['Zack Colman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/10/epa-air-chief-3238271,"The connections between Hunton, UARG, its member companies and UARG raised ethical concerns over whether a powerful regulator was able to steer business to former friends and colleagues. ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT Industry group tied to EPA air chief dissolves

A secretive utility industry coalition formerly represented by a top official at the Environmental Protection Agency is dissolving amid investigations into whether its members received special treatment from the Trump administration.

The Utility Air Regulatory Group has been under scrutiny from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which was seeking information on the relationship between power companies, EPA air chief Bill Wehrum and the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, which represented the group.

Story Continued Below

UARG has frequently argued against tighter air pollution and climate regulations; Wehrum is undoing many of the policies at EPA that the group targeted when he represented it at Hunton.

The group released a statement Friday saying its ""membership has decided to disband the organization following a wind down period."" The statement said a committee would be formed to handle ""the completion/fulfillment of UARG's existing obligations and support of members as they continue to cooperate with the Congressional inquiry.""

In a separate statement, Hunton said it was ""proud to have been part of"" UARG's efforts to shape federal air pollution rules through public comments and other participation in the regulatory process.

Wehrum represented UARG until 2017, when he was nominated by President Donald Trump to be EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, a position that has allowed him to oversee many of his former clients' top regulatory priorities.

Membership in UARG was first reported by POLITICO, which obtained internal organization documents showing Hunton billed power companies $8.2 million in dues for 2017. Several utilities had already fled the organization before it was terminated Friday.

The connections between Hunton, UARG, its member companies and UARG raised ethical concerns over whether a powerful regulator was able to steer business to former friends and colleagues.

Wehrum he has stayed in frequent contact with former colleagues at Hunton and other companies affiliated with the group. But he said he did not violate his ethics agreement, as he recused himself for dealing with “particular matters” related to UARG.

The House committee is investigating how power companies paid for UARG dues and whether the group's members had undue influence over EPA policy. Consumer advocates allege utility customers often foot the bill, which some power companies have confirmed; American Electric Power told Inside EPA that ratepayers financed membership.

Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), as well as Reps. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), welcomed the group's dissolution, but said it wouldn't affect their investigation.

""Important questions remain about whether EPA officials William Wehrum and David Harlow continue to advance their former coal industry clients’ agenda at EPA, and we intend to see those questions through,” the three lawmakers said in a statement Friday evening.

UARG had existed since the 1970s but became aggressively litigious during the Obama administration.

One of its major achievements was a 2014 Supreme Court ruling, UARG v. EPA, in which Justice Antonin Scalia scolded EPA for seeking an “enormous and transformative expansion” of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

UARG challenged many other major EPA regulations from the Obama era, including carbon rules for existing and future coal plants, a mercury rule for coal plants, the updated ozone standard, haze cleanup plans and safety rules for industrial chemical facilities. Most of those lawsuits hadn't been settled before the Trump administration took power. EPA is now revising or repealing most of those rules.

And UARG is helping defend EPA in at least six ongoing lawsuits, including over several changes to air permitting policies and the agency's rejection of pollution complaints from downwind states.

It is unclear how UARG’s dissolution will affect those cases.

Federal prosecutors are seeking the removal of the lead defense lawyer for a Chinese firm charged with bank fraud and sanctions violations, alleging he has a conflict of interest arising from his supervision of a “substantially related” case while he served in a prior position as the Justice Department’s second-highest-ranking official.

James Cole, who was deputy attorney general from 2010 to 2015 in the Obama administration, heads the defense team for Huawei Technologies. The major Chinese telecom equipment-maker was indicted in January on charges of bank fraud, wire fraud, violations of Iran sanctions, and conspiracy to launder money and to obstruct justice.

[Justice Dept. charges Huawei with fraud, ratcheting up U.S.-China tensions]

The high-profile case has drawn much publicity as it is taking place against the backdrop of President Trump’s efforts to seal a trade deal with China and an attempt by his administration to keep Huawei out of the global 5G wireless networks on national security grounds.

In a redacted motion filed Friday in the Eastern District of New York, prosecutors argued that while Cole is defending Huawei, his work in the related investigation, which they did not disclose, “creates the real risk that he will breach his duty of confidentiality to the [Department of Justice] by relying on information he obtained while representing the department.”

Moreover, they said, “there is a risk that Cole will breach his duty of loyalty to the department by making arguments on behalf of the defendants that contradict positions he previously took while representing the DOJ.”

Neither Cole nor his attorney responded to a request for comment.

The move to disqualify is fairly unusual, but analysts note that if the government thinks there is a conflict of interest, prosecutors have an obligation to bring this concern to the court’s attention.

Cole, a partner at the Sidley Austin law firm, informed the Justice Department in January that he was representing Huawei. Later that month, the department informed Cole that he had a conflict of interest in the case, according to the motion.

In a follow-up meeting, Cole and representatives of the Justice Department and the FBI discussed the issue, and after giving Cole a one-day clearance, the government provided him with “privileged and classified” information “in order to have a fulsome discussion,” prosecutors said.

In March, Cole declined to recuse himself, writing to the government that after carefully considering the material, he and his counsel “were unable to determine that I need to be disqualified.”

Later that month, he filed a motion to appear in court for Huawei. And at the first status conference, on April 4, the government said it would not oppose Cole’s motion for the time being. Last week, prosecutors asked the court to remove him.

“It’s a considerable decision to seek to disqualify not just any counsel in a major prosecution like this, but someone of Jim Cole’s pedigree as a former deputy attorney general who clearly has refused to recuse himself,” said David Laufman, a former senior Justice Department official who is now a partner at the law firm of Wiggin and Dana. “But the government clearly feels strongly about its motion and is prepared to litigate its merits.”

While the deputy attorney general oversees a broad range of the department’s most significant cases, he or she does not typically get involved in the day-to-day running of investigations.

“It’s difficult to determine whether the government has a valid argument because of the classified nature of the underlying matter,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan who teaches law at the University of Michigan. “The court will have to review his response and the underlying documents to make a determination.”"

Trump: It would be 'appropriate' for me to talk to DOJ about investigating Biden,https://thehill.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/443234-trump-it-would-be-appropriate-for-me-to-talk-to-doj-about-investigating,"President Trump Donald John TrumpStates fight Trump rollback of Obama lightbulb rules Authorities investigating shooting near Trump resort in Florida Trump: 'China is dreaming' Biden, other Dems get elected MORE said Friday it would be ""appropriate"" for him to discuss opening an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden Joseph (Joe) Robinette BidenTrump: 'China is dreaming' Biden, other Dems get elected A more disciplined Biden learns not to take the bait Kamala Harris says she wouldn't have voted for NAFTA MORE and his family with Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrTrump lashes out at Dem talk of 'constitutional crisis' Dems warn of 'constitutional crisis' but wary of impeachment Schiff dismisses Trump's threat to investigate Biden MORE.

Trump told Politico in an interview Friday that he hasn’t talked with Barr about investigating Biden and his family's business dealings but said ""certainly it would be an appropriate thing"" to bring up with the attorney general.

""Certainly it is a very big issue and we’ll see what happens. I have not spoken to him about it. Would I speak to him about it? I haven’t thought of that. I mean, you’re asking me a question I just haven’t thought of,"" he told the outlet.

The president noted that it could be ""a very big situation"" for Biden, who has led the Democratic presidential primary field in polling since he launched his campaign last month.

""Because he’s a Democrat it’s about 1/100 the size of the fact that if he were a Republican, it would be a lot bigger,"" Trump alleged.

Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani last week called for an investigation into Biden for his previous ties to Ukraine after The New York Times reported that while Biden was vice president in 2016, he allegedly threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country removed a top prosecutor. The prosecutor, who had been accused of ignoring corruption in his own office, was later voted out.

Biden’s son Hunter was a board member of an energy company that the prosecutor had been looking into, according to the newspaper.

Giuliani initially planned to travel to Ukraine to encourage Ukraine's president-elect to launch investigations into Biden and the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE's Russia investigation.

However, Giuliani changed course late Friday, announcing that he had canceled his trip. The reversal came after Democrats on Capitol Hill accused him of seeking aid from a foreign government.

Biden, the front-runner among a crowded field of Democrats vying for the White House in 2020, had a 32-point lead over his competitors in a Hill-HarrisX poll released earlier this week.

Biden also surpassed Trump by six points in the first poll published after the former vice president officially announced his candidacy in April."
US DoJ Charges Group of Individuals Who Stole $2.5 Mln in Crypto Via SIM Swapping,https://cointelegraph.com,['Ana Berman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-doj-charges-group-of-individuals-who-stole-25-mln-in-crypto-via-sim-swapping,"The United States Department of Justice released a fifteen-count indictment on May 9 that charges a hacking group labeled “The Community” with SIM swapping in order to steal cryptocurrencies.

U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider and his colleague from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Angie Salazar announced the charges in the Eastern District of Michigan. Per Salazar, the investigation was led by Homeland Security Investigations on two continents.

According to the indictment, five Americans and an Irishman are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Another three, who reportedly are the former employees of mobile phone providers, are charged in a criminal complaint with the wire fraud related to “The Community.”

As described in the document, the hacking group used SIM swapping — a type of identity theft attack that generally targets a weakness in two-factor authentication. The perpetrator usually gains control of a target's mobile phone by convincing or bribing the employee of the mobile provider to swap the phone number to a SIM card controlled by the hackers.

After successfully swapping the numbers of their victims, “The Community” managed to gain access to their various online accounts, including cryptocurrency exchange accounts and wallets. As a result of fraud, approximately $2.5 million worth of cryptocurrency was sent to wallets controlled by the hacking group. Attorney Schneider clarified that in this case, three mobile phone service provider employees purportedly helped swappers to steal money.

The charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison each. Meanwhile, a conviction of aggravated identity theft could add up to two years in prison for the defendants .

According to Irish news website The Journal, a 20-year-old man from Dublin was arrested in Ireland upon the request of the U.S. authorities and is currently awaiting extradition.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, in November 2018, a law enforcement group dedicated to fighting cybercrime released a report on SIM swapping, stating that it had become increasingly popular in California.

Meanwhile, in January, a 21-year old American was accused of stealing almost $24 million in crypto via SIM swapping. And in February, a New York resident was indicted in what constituted the jurisdiction’s first SIM-swapping prosecution."
"Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker: 'Rumors' Trump is quashing DOJ, FBI investigations",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-rumors-trump-is-quashing-doj-fbi-investigations,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker said on Friday there are ""rumors"" that President Trump is quashing investigations run by the Justice Department and the FBI.

During an interview on MSNBC, Baker told host Rachel Maddow he decided to speak out because of Trump's bullying tactics.

He said ""it could have a significant negative impact in the long run"" because people are worried about their careers and reputations.

""When the president of the United States starts to go at you on Twitter it's ... unnerving,"" he said. ""If you're concerned about your reputation and your long-term career, you're more likely to be hesitant to do things that will attract that type of ire.""

Maddow asked if he is aware of any investigations that have been impeded because of Trump's behavior, and Baker said he has ""heard rumors to that effect"" but none that he could confirm. He did acknowledge that this dynamic was ""currently"" at work.

""Whether it's true or not, it's something to worry about,"" he said. He noted that ""certain types of investigations, especially as they start to touch the political system or political leaders"" are the ones to worry about.

Baker's interview comes after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report, which details 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice. He declined to say either way whether Trump committed a crime, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

The FBI have come under scrutiny for the handling of the Trump-Russia investigation, with allegations of politicization, improper surveillance, spying, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse. Baker, who is under criminal investigation for alleged unauthorized leaks to the media, has been subject to criticism by Trump for his role in allowing the use of an unverified dossier to obtain the authority to spy on a member of his 2016 campaign, Carter Page.

“Former FBI top lawyer James Baker just admitted involvement in FISA Warrant and further admitted there were IRREGULARITIES in the way the Russia probe was handled,” Trump tweeted in January. “They relied heavily on the unverified Trump ‘Dossier’ paid for by the DNC & Clinton Campaign, & funded through a big Crooked Hillary law firm, represented by her lawyer Michael Sussmann (do you believe this?) who worked Baker hard & gave him Oppo Research for ‘a Russia probe.’ This meeting, now exposed, is the subject of Senate inquiries and much more. An Unconstitutional Hoax.”

Baker said Trump's intimidation tactics against the FBI are ""very dangerous,"" but believes that the career officials at the bureau are highly resilient and are going to ""resist"" Trump as much as they can."
"After reports of record falsification, Department of Justice investigating Connections prison services",https://www.delawareonline.com,"['Christina Jedra', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2019/05/13/doj-investigating-connections-prison-services/1187333001/,"CLOSE A former employee at Connections CSP says she was told to falsify dozens of female patient records at Crest South. 5/10/19 Jerry Habraken and Damian Giletto, Delaware News Journal

The Delaware Department of Justice said on Monday it is investigating Connections Community Support Programs, the private contractor that provides physical and mental health services to all inmates in state correctional facilities.

News of the probe comes after The News Journal published an investigation into reports that the contractor falsified records to conceal inadequate addiction treatment at Crest South, a taxpayer-funded substance abuse program for drug offenders in Georgetown.

Over a dozen inmates at Crest South said they received little or no individual counseling during their stay. Four former Crest counselors said the program supervisor instructed subordinates to falsify and backdate records to indicate clients had received counseling and treatment plans when in fact they did not. The supervisor denies this.

One former counselor, Shannon Lasek, admitted to falsifying at least 30 records.

""DOJ’s Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust is aware of issues regarding Connections’ contract and work with the Department of Correction, and is conducting an investigation,"" said DOJ Communications Director Mat Marshall.

Marshall would not comment further on the substance of the investigation but said that people with information about ""Connections' record-keeping practices"" should contact publictrust@delaware.gov.

Connections CEO Cathy McKay did not make herself available to The News Journal for interviews but issued a statement on Monday.

""We welcome any objective investigation into our programs and are confident any investigation will work to restore a level of trust in the community,"" she said.

The organization investigated its own records after Lasek said in her December resignation letter that she was forced to falsify documents. McKay said officials ""were satisfied that this did not occur.""

The Department of Correction, which paid Connections $15 million for its mental health and substance abuse services last year, said it did ""a quick search"" of electronic records in December that showed no evidence of falsification but it is conducting a deeper investigation now.

According to McKay, Connections' electronic record-keeping system cannot be backdated and ""clearly shows that individuals did receive services they claimed in print did not happen.""

Lasek said it's true that the electronic system automatically timestamps new inputs. She said when she falsified records, she published notes in the computer system that referred to paper charts. The electronic marker would show the current date, according to Lasek, but the paper file would have the older date the treatment plan was due.

READ THE FULL INVESTIGATION: Prison contractor falsified records to conceal inadequate addiction treatment, sources say

A spokesman for Gov. John Carney called the allegations of record falsification a ""clearly troubling"" situation that deserves the attention of prosecutors.

""We will not solve our addiction crisis without addressing addiction in our prisons, where 46 percent of inmates on any given day are facing challenges with substance use,"" said Jonathan Starkey, the governor's communications director.

""We need to make sure that inmates have real access to treatment so they have a chance of success when they leave prison and re-enter their communities. Addiction affects every corner of our state, and this is too important an issue to not get right.""

MaryBeth Cichocki, a Delaware addiction treatment advocate, has heard complaints about the quality of Connections services for years. In response to reports of falsification, she said she was ""not surprised.""

""Connections needs to be kicked out of Delaware, and we need to start a new program with people who really care about the outcomes of the people they’re treating,"" said Cichocki, who lost her son to an overdose in 2015. ""From what I’ve seen of Connections, all they care about is making money.""

The state, which paid Connections over $72 million in state contracts last year, needs to reconsider its service delivery, Cichocki said.



""Connections has taken over the state and there is no competition anymore,"" she said. ""I really think the state is at a loss for what to do so they keep funding Connections.""

Connections Board Chairman Bob Byrd and the DOC did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.

The Department of Correction recently extended Connections' mental health contract through mid-2020 and said the allegations of fraud will ""absolutely not"" get in the way of that agreement.

""That’s pretty sad if Connections is all we have and these things are happening and they’re continuing to ignore it,"" Cichocki said.

Lasek hopes the Department of Justice investigation is more thorough than the searches done by Connections and the DOC, which did not interview her.

""They need to listen to the counselors and past clients,"" she said. ""We know there is a big problem. Let's all care enough to do something about it. Let's care more about the harm being done to people than their need to look good.""

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)

The Trump administration will calculate the climate effects of its oil, gas and coal leasing decisions, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview Wednesday, but will not make those impacts the key factor in its final decisions.

Bernhardt, who took office a month ago, said he was committed to carrying out President Trump’s plans to expand fossil-

fuel production on public lands. In March, a federal judge ruled that the federal government illegally approved two gas drilling plans in western Colorado; on Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that Interior’s Bureau of Land Management failed to account for the effect of fracking in as many as 4,000 oil and gas wells in New Mexico’s Greater Chaco region.

Bernhardt, who noted that the leases in both decisions had been issued under the Obama administration, said he was confident the department could address these concerns.

“So, that says to me that we have to do a better job in articulating certain things to the courts,” he said during a wide-ranging conversation in his office. “What I hope is, as an organization, we learn from any error we make.”

Congressional Democrats have been pressing Bernhardt, who appeared before a House spending panel Tuesday and will testify before the House Natural Resources Committee this week, to factor climate change into the department’s decisions about energy development on public lands and in federal waters.

But he emphasized that Interior was not legally obligated to curb the nation’s carbon output, even if it had to assess the environmental effects of its leasing programs.

“The law requires us to analyze those things,” he said, referring to the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from a leasing decision. “It doesn’t say if there is an additional contribution, you should not go forward at all.”

The Trump administration has placed a hold on one of its most ambitious leasing proposals, a five-year plan for offshore drilling, after a federal judge ruled in March that the president’s order revoking a sweeping ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans was illegal. Bernhardt said that the White House would make the ultimate decision on whether to appeal, and that he could not predict when the offshore leasing plan would be finalized.

Bernhardt is prepared to forge ahead on other deregulation efforts. He said he expected to get a briefing on last week’s U.N. scientific report that an eighth of the world’s plants and animals are at risk of extinction but added that the Interior and Commerce departments still planned to finalize an overhaul of endangered species regulations this year.

“We didn’t start doing them to not do them,” he said.

As he pursues the administration’s agenda, Bernhardt is likely to encounter resistance on Capitol Hill. In a phone interview Wednesday, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on interior, environment and related agencies, said that any spending bill passing the House this year would impose certain requirements on the Interior Department.

“We will not be funding irreparable harm to the environment,” McCollum said. “Any bill we pass will include requirements for the Department of Interior to use real science, to use best practices, to protect the environment and to not to go to industry and ask them what they want, and what’s the bare minimum.”

In contrast to his predecessor, Ryan Zinke, who insulted one of the top Democrats overseeing Interior on Twitter, Bernhardt has made an effort to contact key lawmakers in recent weeks. He met privately Tuesday with House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and said he plans to meet with members of both parties in the months to come.

“You know, my own view is that everyone who is engaged in public service is trying to serve the public interest in the best way that they can,” he said.

Bernhardt, who started running the department in January but did not move into the secretary’s office until he was sworn in April 11, has made several changes to its decor. A stuffed polar bear stands as a sentry outside, and the skull of a moose Bernhardt shot in Alaska’s Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve sits atop the fireplace.

“I’m not somebody who would put somebody else’s stuff up,” Bernhardt said, noting that he and a friend had to carry the moose’s entire body themselves to ship it out on a small plane. “His neck meat alone was 135 pounds.”"

Josh Kaul defeated Attorney General Brad Schimel in November as part of a Democratic sweep of all statewide offices.

In his first four months in office, Kaul has fulfilled his campaign promise to withdraw Wisconsin out of a multistate lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act.

He has also switched sides in lawsuits over whether the state Department of Natural Resources can legally impose tighter regulations on factory farms and high-capacity wells, re-aligning with environmental advocacy group Clean Wisconsin.

Republicans say Kaul can't be trusted to defend GOP-passed laws. But Kaul says he's not being ideological, he just views the law differently.

"Investors clamor for Treasurys on trade war, sending yields lower",https://www.cnbc.com,"['Thomas Franck Fred Imbert Maggie Fitzgerald', 'Thomas Franck', 'Fred Imbert', 'Maggie Fitzgerald']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/13/us-bonds-us-china-trade-tensions-remain-in-focus.html,"Treasury yields fell on Monday as investors fled the equity markets for the relative safety of government debt, spooked by a soured trade relationship between the U.S. and China.

The flight to Treasurys sent long-term debt yields tumbling and inverted a portion of the yield curve, the set of interest rates of bonds having equal credit quality but differing maturity dates.

At 12:45 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dipped to 2.394%, under that of the 3-month Treasury bill at 2.418%. The 2-year yield also dipped to 2.182%. Yields move inversely to prices.

Inversions have preceded economic downturns in the past, though there is debate over which portion of the curve is the most important to monitor.

The Federal Reserve — as well as President Donald Trump's chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow — deem an inversion of the 3-month and 10-year curve as the critical metric."
Trump will nominate Patrick Shanahan as secretary of defense,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/9/18517095/patrick-shanahan-defense-secretary-nomination-pentagon-mattis-trump,"The White House says President Donald Trump will nominate Patrick Shanahan, who has spent more than four months as the acting secretary of defense, for the permanent job. It’s likely his reward for being so amenable to President Donald Trump’s policies — from China to Venezuela to the southern border — since taking over the Pentagon’s top position.

“Based upon his outstanding service to the Country and his demonstrated ability to lead, President Trump intends to nominate Patrick M. Shanahan to be the Secretary of Defense,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a Thursday statement. “Acting Secretary Shanahan has proven over the last several months that he is beyond qualified to lead the Department of Defense, and he will continue to do an excellent job.”

Shortly afterward, Shanahan, a former top Boeing executive who spent 30 years at the company, said in a statement that he looks forward to becoming the defense chief, if confirmed by the Senate. “I remain committed to modernizing the force so our remarkable Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines have everything they need to keep our military lethal and our country safe,” he said.

Shanahan has been in the acting role since January 1, when he stepped in to replace outgoing Defense Secretary James Mattis after Mattis dramatically resigned, mainly in response to Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria.

But though he’s been serving as the acting secretary for months, it was never guaranteed that he would get the position full-time. In March, the Pentagon’s inspector general looked into allegations that Shanahan boosted Boeing while acting in his official capacity. However, in late April, the watchdog cleared Shanahan of the potential ethics violation.

There were also concerns among Trump officials that Shanahan couldn’t do the job after a series of lackluster performances during congressional testimonies in which he flubbed important questions about America’s defense policy and wars abroad.

He’s overcome those obstacles, though. And assuming the Senate confirms him, he’ll be set to lead America’s armed forces — as long as he stays in Trump’s good graces.

Shanahan has to stay on Trump’s good side

Sources told me that Shanahan and Trump have a very strong relationship. They have spoken at length in the Oval Office about Pentagon issues, and about their shared view that weapons programs are unnecessarily expensive and cumbersome. It also helps that National Security Adviser John Bolton seems to like Shanahan too, sources note.

By most accounts, Shanahan did a good job as Mattis’s deputy. His main role was to run day-to-day Pentagon operations and try to reform the bureaucracy as much as possible. He also gained Mattis’s trust over time, even though he wasn’t originally the former Marine general’s first choice.

However, Shanahan didn’t spend much time on foreign policy in the Defense Department or in his three-decade career at Boeing, so taking on the top role permanently will be a big change for him.

The reason Trump likes Shanahan, though, may come down to one very simple thing: He’s deferential. During a Cabinet meeting on January 2, for example, Shanahan sat stoically next to Trump as the president slammed Mattis for keeping America’s military involved in conflicts overseas, particularly in Afghanistan.

Shanahan has also reportedly told Pentagon leaders to focus on “China, China, China” — a country the president cares about challenging — which may also keep him in Trump’s good graces.

Mattis, on the other hand, was known to challenge Trump on occasion, and their relationship eventually broke down over Trump’s desire to withdraw troops from Syria.

It’s unclear at this point if Shanahan will push back on anything Trump wants to do."
DOJ charges Chinese man over 'one of the worst data breaches in history' which took 79 million people’s personal data from Anthem health insurers,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Bill Bostock'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-hacker-stole-data-78-million-anthem-doj-say-2019-5,"A Chinese national has been charged with orchestrating the biggest data hack in US healthcare history, in which 79 million people had their personal information stolen.

Wang Fujie, 32, was charged with hacking US health insurance giant Anthem, and three other unnamed US businesses, between February 2014 and January 2015, a Department of Justice press (DOJ) release said Thursday.

In the four-count indictment cited by the DOJ, Wang, who also goes by Dennis Wang, is said to have ""used sophisticated techniques to hack into the computer networks of the victim businesses without authorization.""

He was charged alongside another man, referred to in the indictment as John Doe.

The men are then accused of installing malware and seeking out the personal information of 79 million Anthem customers, as well as their ""confidential business information.""

They were detected in January 2015, the indictment said.

The stolen data included names, health identification numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, employment information, and income data, the indictment said.

Anthem paid the US government $16 million as a result of the privacy violation in October 2018.

One of the techniques Wang is said to have used was a ""spearfishing"" email, a targeted message designed to trick the recipient into treating it as legitimate.

Emails with hyperlinks were sent to employees of the four companies, the DOJ said. If they clicked on the link it installed malware which opened a back door to the company's computer server, the indictment said.

Wang and the other man were both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer.

In a statement, DOJ assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski said: ""The allegations in the indictment unsealed today outline the activities of a brazen China-based computer hacking group that committed one of the worst data breaches in history.""

""These defendants allegedly attacked US businesses operating in four distinct industry sectors, and violated the privacy of over 78 million people by stealing their PII (personally identifiable information).""

In February 2015, Bloomberg reported that the FBI believes the hack was sponsored by the Chinese government.

An Anthem spokeswoman told Business Insider in an emailed statement:

""We are grateful for the support and partnership of the FBI and extended law enforcement team in investigating the sophisticated cyber-attack that Anthem was a victim of in February 2015, and are pleased with the action taken today.""

""There is no evidence that information obtained through the 2015 cyber-attack targeting Anthem has resulted in fraud."""
Interior secretary mum on whether Utah will be new home to BLM headquarters,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900070016/interior-secretary-mum-on-whether-utah-will-be-new-home-to-blm-headquarters.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — A decision on where in the West — possibly Utah — to relocate the Bureau of Land Management headquarters will be made this summer, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said Friday.

""I'm pretty confident it’s moving. I can’t tell you where it’s going, but it’s moving,"" the newly appointed secretary told the Deseret News.

The Interior Department is finishing up an analysis on relocating the BLM from Washington, D.C., to the West and has included money for the move in its budget proposal, Bernhardt said.

Accompanied by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, Bernhardt is in the state to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the driving of the golden spike that marked the completion of the transcontinental railroad at Promontory Summit.

Bernhardt, who replaced former Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior secretary last month, and Bishop sat down for an interview on a variety of public lands issues before taking a helicopter to Golden Spike National Historical Park for the festivities.

Last summer, Susan Combs, Interior's assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, sized up Ogden as a possible site for the BLM. Cedar City and St. George also are in the mix.

Bishop said it makes economic sense to have the office in the West instead of flying people back and forth from Washington. Almost all of the land BLM manages is west of Denver.

""I think our employees will have a wonderful quality of life. Their salaries go so much farther out here. I think they’ll be very excited,"" Bernhardt said.

Republican Utah lawmakers have long sought state control of some 31 million acres of federal land. But Bernhardt doesn't see that happening.

""That’s an area where the president has drawn a pretty clear line,"" he said. ""I'm sure we're not in the position of thinking that large-scale transfers at this time are the right thing to do.""

Federal land managers are trying to be ""wonderful"" neighbors,"" Bernhardt said.

""We can work on managing land together. We can work to be good neighbors. We can work on effectively managing on our land in a way that’s consistent and harmonious with the state lands,"" he said.

As deputy Interior secretary, Bernhardt came to Utah with President Donald Trump in December 2017 when the president significantly reduced the sizes of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Several environmental groups and Native American tribes sued Trump over the decision.

Critics say it will open areas packed with ancient cultural relics and delicate landscapes the monuments once encompassed to mining and oil and gas exploration.

""If somebody says you’re only doing it to get oil and gas, they clearly don’t know what the hell they're talking about. There is no oil and gas in either of those,"" Bishop said.

""That’s why we were willing to ban any kind of mining in the Bears Ears area because it ain’t there in the first place,"" he said. ""There’s coal at Grand Staircase but oil and gas, it doesn’t exist.""

Bernhardt, a former oil industry lobbyist, said even though the monument designation went away, wilderness and wilderness study areas remain as do other underlying laws. Much of BLM land, he said, has a conservation priority imposed on it.

""We’re going through a big planning process right now on the monuments and our planning process will decide what we can do within the boundaries of our discretion,"" Bernhardt said.

Bernhardt and Bishop say there's room on vast public lands for recreation, conservation and economic activity.

""If you don’t have the access for both recreational opportunities and economic opportunities on that land, on that public land, you know what you don’t have? You don’t have a community,"" Bernhardt said.

Utah GOP leaders have long decried President Bill Clinton's creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante in 1996 and more recently President Barack Obama's designation of Bear Ears in 2016 as an abuse of the Antiquities Act. In both instances, they have sought ways to roll back the presidents' actions.

Bishop introduced a bill in March to limit a president's power to designate and reshape national monuments under the act. Utah's two GOP senators proposed legislation to prohibit presidents from creating or expanding national monuments in Utah without the consent of Congress and the state Legislature.

Bernhardt didn't state a position on the legislation when asked about it Friday.

""I think the president I worked with has used it really, really well,"" he said. ""I think the Congress has to worry about future presidents.""

The Interior Department's approach is to ensure local input, community support and congressional support before moving ahead with any designation, Bernhardt said.

He also addressed park maintenance.

The National Park Service current has a nearly $13 billion maintenance backlog that impacts popular Zion and Arches national parks.

Bernhardt said the Interior Department has a budget proposal that would address the problem in a ""significant"" way. He said he's also about to issue an order that would allow a broader range of parks to use fee revenue to hire staff to make sure parks are safe, clean and well-managed.

""We’re trying to make that visitor experience exceptional,"" he said.

Bernhardt said the order would include parks in Utah, but he wasn't sure which ones."
"Trump declares 'invasion' at border after DHS says 1 percent of Honduras, Guatemala entered US",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-invasion-border-dhs-one-percent-honduras-guatemala,"A day after the acting Homeland Security secretary estimated that more than 1 percent of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras had entered the U.S. since September, President Trump declared an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, his administration expects record numbers of migrants to arrive from Central America in the coming months.

""When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion,” Trump said at his Wednesday evening “Make American Great Again” rally in Panama City, Fla., defending his declaration of a national emergency at the border earlier this year. “No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws. And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

“One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,” McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

“In March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants — 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,” McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt’s Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include “an aggressive and holistic strategy” to work together with Central America officials in order to identify “pushes” that drive migrants out of Central America.

“We want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region’s customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.”

"London’s mayor says Trump ‘not in same class’ as Obama and Bush, not worthy of state visit to Britain",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Adam Taylor', 'Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/10/londons-mayor-says-trump-not-same-class-obama-bush-not-worthy-uk-state-visit/,"

London Mayor Sadiq Khan. (Jack Taylor/Getty Images)

Ahead of President Trump’s state visit to Britain on June 3, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says he believes the U.S. leader is not “in the same class” as his predecessors and is not worthy of the honor.

“Of course we should have a close relationship with the president of the United States, but we shouldn’t be rolling out the red carpet; we shouldn’t have a state banquet,” Khan said Friday, during an interview with LBC, a British talk-radio station.

“History tells us only two presidents have had a state visit,” Khan said. “President Trump is not in the same class as those two.”

Trump visited Britain last July, but that trip was not considered a state visit, even though he did visit the queen at Windsor Castle.

[Trump finally gets his British state visit — but tensions that led to delay remain]

Khan’s comments reflected widespread skepticism about the Trump administration in the British capital ahead of a long-delayed state trip next month. They also raised the possibility that Trump, who has criticized and insulted the mayor of London before, may retaliate, reigniting a war of words that would likely make his visit to the city more contentious.

British Prime Minister Theresa May extended an invite for a state visit to Trump during a visit to Washington in January 2017, just days after the president had taken office. “I am delighted that the president has accepted that invitation,” she told a White House news conference.

The only two state visits to Britain by U.S. presidents in the past were in 2011, when President Barack Obama visited, and in 2003, when President George W. Bush visited. State visits are formal trips to Britain by heads of state from countries overseas, with considerable pomp and circumstance that is not afforded to less formal visits by world leaders.

However, as relations between Trump and May grew difficult, Trump’s state visit to Britain was repeatedly delayed. When Trump finally made a brief visit to London in July 2018 — a working visit, rather than a state visit — he was greeted by protests and a giant blimp that depicted Trump as a screaming baby in a diaper.

Though a state visit was finally announced last month, most indications suggest that Trump remains unpopular in Britain. Polling data from the firm YouGov suggested only 1 in 5 people had a positive view of the U.S. president, while 67 percent had a negative opinion.

A spat between Trump and Khan, London’s mayor since May 2016, may not have helped the U.S. leader’s reputation in the British capital. Even before Trump was elected, Khan, a Labour Party member, had criticized him, telling Time magazine that because he is a Muslim, he would be stopped from going to the United States under Trump’s proposed Muslim travel ban.

Trump later responded by calling Khan “rude” and “ignorant” on “Good Morning Britain.”

After Trump’s inauguration, the president criticized the London mayor’s response to a number of terrorist attacks in the British capital. In November 2017, Trump shared anti-Muslim videos on Twitter posted by a far-right British activist, prompting a rare rebuke from May.

Khan has called for Trump’s state visit invitation to be rescinded. In his interview with LBC this week, he stated that the visit was not necessary. “It’s possible to have a working relationship without the need to have a state banquet and roll out the red carpet,” Khan said.

Though Khan is not invited to the state banquet, he said he agrees with the sentiment of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has said he will refuse to attend the dinner. In a statement released in April, Labour’s Corbyn said that Trump “rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric.”

Khan also told LBC that one issue he had with Trump was the coarse language he used about women, which he felt emboldened others to target women and particularly female politicians.

“The impression is being given that you can get away from it — that you get a get-out-of-jail card. But it’s worse than that,” Khan said, referring to Trump’s comments about women who had accused him of sexual assault. “There’s a boasting and bragging, it’s almost like a green light for others to behave badly.”

Khan said that he hoped that May would raise some of these issues when Trump visits, though not necessarily in “Hugh Grant-type, public scene,” referencing a fictional faceoff between a U.S. president and prime minister during a news conference in the movie “Love Actually.”

“We’re their closest mates, we have a special relationship. That gives us a responsibility to call people out who we otherwise wouldn’t do so,” Khan said. “Your relationship with your best mate is different with your relationship with a mate or an acquaintance. Your standards that you expect from them are higher.”"
DOJ brass praise Rosenstein’s Russia probe leadership at send-off ceremony,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-brass-praise-rosensteins-russia-probe-leadership-at-send-off-ceremony,"Top current and former Justice Department leadership praised Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for his “exceptional” leadership throughout the Russia investigation at his send-off ceremony Thursday, marking the conclusion of his nearly 30-year tenure at the agency.

Rosenstein was honored at the Robert F. Kennedy Building Thursday, following submitting his resignation to President Trump last month. Rosenstein sat on stage between Attorney General Bill Barr, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and FBI Director Christopher Wray—all of whom touted Rosenstein’s record and character throughout his career, but specifically over the last two years.

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO HOLD BARR IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER MUELLER FILES

“Rod, you did your duty as it fell upon you,” Sessions, who resigned last year after the midterm elections, said on Thursday. “You didn’t ask for it—that’s for sure.”

Rosenstein, 54, previously served as deputy assistant attorney general and a U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland. But during the Trump administration, he became deputy attorney general to Sessions. Rosenstein ultimately took oversight of the Russia investigation upon Sessions’ recusal in early 2017 due to his work with the Trump campaign.

Sessions added that Rosenstein “didn’t start” the investigation, and noted that sometimes, “these things just become unstoppable.”

“Decisions had to be made, and those decisions fell to him,” Sessions continued, adding that decisions were made “all in accordance with procedures of the Justice Department.”

“Rod understood better than most that justice would be best served by appointing a special counsel.”

He added: “You have honorably overseen this process, which has affirmed the rule of law and achieved a degree of justice.”

Sessions called Rosenstein a “friend and a loyal partner,” and reminisced on their “many wonderful times"" together.

Wray also praised Rosenstein and thanked him for his “dedication and service.""

“I have been grateful for Rod’s counsel and support,” Wray said. “A friend whose service has weathered the test of time.”

Rosenstein submitted his resignation following the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. Rosenstein worked alongside Barr and Mueller, to determine which portions of the report could be released to Congress and to the public, and which needed redactions to protect sources and methods and grand jury material.

Barr himself has fallen under intense scrutiny over the handling of the report. The House Judiciary Committee this week voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for the full Mueller report and underlying documents.

But Barr praised Rosenstein on Thursday and said he has been “fortunate” to work with him.

“It’s been a real privilege and pleasure to have him with me these last several weeks,” Barr said, adding that Rosenstein has “exceptional intelligence, sound judgment crafted from experience, composure even amid scrutiny” and an “upbeat spirit” and “sense of humor.”

“He is an exceptional leader,” Barr said and presented Rosenstein with a flag that was flown above the main Justice Department.

Rosenstein fell into the political crosshairs throughout his tenure and was on the receiving end of the president’s ire over the Russia investigation.

Early on in his oversight of the probe, on May 8, 2017, at his recommendation, Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey. Just a week later, Rosenstein appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller and took oversight of that probe until November 2018, when former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker took over.

IMPRISONING BILL BARR IS LEFT'S NEW RALLYING CRY: 'HAVE HIM LOCKED UP'

Rumors of Rosenstein’s resignation, or even firing, swirled for months—especially after Trump accused him of pursuing a “treasonous” plot against him. Last year, a report revealed that during a meeting, Rosenstein suggested wearing a “wire” to record the president - some of those there said he was joking - and suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. The meeting reportedly took place in the days after Comey’s firing.

Fox News learned that the meeting included several high-profile FBI officials, including former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and former FBI counsel Lisa Page on May 16, 2017. Mueller was appointed as special counsel the following day. Rosenstein, though, repeatedly denied pursuing a recording of the president and pushed back on claims of considering invoking the amendment.

But last month, Rosenstein officially resigned, and thanked Trump for “the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because ‘a nation exists to serve its citizens.’”

On Thursday, after thanking his Justice Department colleagues, Rosenstein took the podium and said: “I leave here confident that justice is in good hands. It’s in your hands.”

"E.P.A. Leaders Disregarded Agency’s Experts in Issuing Asbestos Rule, Memos Show",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/climate/epa-asbestos-rule-scientists.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."
"Border apprehensions to surpass last 13 year totals in 122 days, DHS heightens funding plea",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/border-crossings-to-surpass-last-13-year-totals-in-122-days-dhs-heightens-funding-plea,"The Department of Homeland Security is forecasting that border apprehensions of illegal immigrants will surpass the totals of the last 13 years in just 122 days, prompting a new push for President Trump’s $4.5 billion in emergency funding to handle the crisis.

To add an exclamation point on the administration's plea for Congress to pitch in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is leading a weekend trip with acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to the Texas-Mexico border to oversee Homeland Security-Pentagon operations at the increasingly dangerous and populated border, according to law enforcement officials.

The trip by the nation’s two top border security officials comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection released shocking new April border arrest numbers. The agency said it apprehended 109,144 in April, up from 103,719 in March.

Officials said the surge will surpass the totals of the last 13 fiscal years in early September. Arrests topped the fiscal 2014 totals last weekend.

An average of 3,891 illegal immigrants are apprehended every day, according to officials.

McAleenan and Shanahan are set to arrive in McAllen, Texas, Saturday. They plan to oversee Homeland Security and Defense Department joint missions, meet with officers and first responders, and inspect the humanitarian operations, according to officials. It is McAleenan’s third trip to the border as acting secretary and Shanahan’s second.

Some of those humanitarian operations are running short of congressionally approved funding. Trump has asked for an emergency appropriation of $4.5 billion and border lawmakers, like Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, have urged Senate leaders to act on the request.

At a House hearing last month, McAleenan listed what is needed to end the surge, adding, “Given the scale of the crisis, we will exhaust our resources before the end of this fiscal year, which is why the administration will be seeking supplemental funding to support ongoing surge operations, and provide critical humanitarian assistance for migrants.”

Homeland Security would get about $1.2 billion of the $4.5 billion:



$391 million for humanitarian assistance that will fund processing centers at the border, transportation requirements, feeding and care of those in custody, and other needs

$530 million for operations support on the border, such as personnel expenses, detention beds, transportation, and investigatory resources to counter human smuggling and trafficking

$178 million for information technology system upgrades and law enforcement pay adjustments to manage the ongoing surge

“The problem we face is huge, short-term fixes will not cut it, and we need sustained investment and additional emergency support at the southwest border to overcome the humanitarian and security crisis. The president’s budget will do that,” said McAleenan, a longtime border official.

Democrats have started to express support for more spending at the border, but action has been slow on the president’s request."
WASDE Analysis: Bears Overrun the Grain Markets,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/wasde-analysis-bears-overrun-the-grain-markets/,"On the bearish-to-bullish scale (with 1 being bearish and 10 being bullish), Ted Seifried would give the today’s round of USDA reports a 2 or 3.

The May 2019 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report from USDA provided additional negative news for the corn and soybean markets, which are already being dragged lower by negative trade news and planting delays.

Corn: Huge Ending Stocks Push Prices Lower

USDA says the U.S. feed-grain outlook for 2019/20 is for larger production and domestic use, lower exports and greater ending stocks.

The corn crop is projected at 15.0 billion bu., up from last year and the second largest on record behind 2016/17.

The yield projection of 176.0 bu. per acre is based on a weather-adjusted trend assuming normal planting progress and summer growing season weather, estimated using the 1988-2018 time period.

Total corn supplies are forecast record high at 17.2 billion bushels.

The season-average farm price is projected at $3.30 per bushel, down 20 cents from 2018/19 and the lowest since 2006/07.

Soybeans: High Supplies Sink Prices

USDA says the 2019/20 outlook for U.S. soybeans is for higher supplies, crush, exports and slightly lower ending stocks compared to 2018/19.

The soybean crop is projected at 4,150 million bu., down 394 million from last year’s record crop.

With sharply higher beginning stocks, soybean supplies are projected at 5,165 million bu., up 3% from 2018/19.

The season-average soybean price is projected at $8.10 per bushel, down 45 cents from the 2018/19 forecast.

“At face value, when you look at the numbers, they are quite a bit larger than what the trade was expecting, especially for new-crop corn carryover,” says Seifried, chief market strategist and vice president with Zaner Ag Hedge Group. “That’s where the real bearishness is coming from.”

The trade was hoping to see stronger domestic demand numbers and maybe even a better export number for corn, he explains.

“Corn was supposed to be the bullish story in the grains,” he says. “This report really says ‘No,’ to that.”

Seifried says farmers need to pay attention to the asterisks USDA included in the reports. For corn, USDA points out that the acreage and yield projections are based on a weather-adjusted trend assuming normal mid-May planting progress and summer growing season weather.

“That mid-May planting progress is very much in question,” he says. “While we have a bit of sticker shock on the demand side of the corn balance sheet because of the sheer size of ending stocks, the asterisk is fairly important because we are very concerned about whether we're going to get planting done.”

The disappointing part of the report, Seifried points out, is that the starting point for production is so high.

“So even if I’m going to chop off 1.5 million acres of corn that may not get planted due to the weather and if cut the yield down just a little bit, the downside mobility in the corn carryover is fairly limited unless we find some new demand,” he says. “How do we do that? We have a big South American corn crop and strong U.S. dollar. Where do we find more corn demand? I don't know what how we could get much more bearish than where we are right now, unless ASF comes to North America.”

With the May USDA reports, Seifried encourages farmers to rethink their price targets for corn and soybeans.

“With this report, we have to lower our expectations,” he says. “We're hoping to see some price recovery to sell. If we do, we need to be fairly aggressive on selling.”

As for the monthly Crop Production report, USDA forecast winter wheat production at 1.27 billion bu., which is up 7% from 2018. As of May 1, the United States yield is forecast at 50.3 bu. per acre, up 2.4 bu. from last year's average yield of 47.9 bu. per acre.

Seifried says the wheat numbers were close to trade expectations, with no surprises."

St. Paul, Minn. — On average, about 20 veterans a day die by suicide. Since 2017, 25 veterans have taken their lives on the grounds of Veterans Affairs hospitals, including seven this year and at least four last month.

In February of last year, Justin Miller died by suicide in the parking lot of a Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis. The Marine veteran was 33. Justin, a trumpet player, made the band, but the Marines saw he could make another contribution as a marksman in Iraq manning a checkpoint with bomb-sniffing dogs.

""If the dog sat down, pull the trigger. Those were his orders. And he said he did that for weeks, day in, day out,"" said Gregory Miller, Justin's father.

When he left the Marines in 2007, his family said he changed. While he still volunteered to play his trumpet at various occasions, he was increasingly depressed and even suicidal. Eventually he sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

""We said we loved each other. I kissed him, and that was the last time I saw my son,"" Miller said.

After three days at the VA, he died.

""He went out to his car. He looked at his phone. He saw the text from my dad, saying 'I love you. Come home.' And at some point he took his own life,"" said Alissa Harrington, Justin's sister.

Experts in this field say veterans who kill themselves on VA grounds are making a statement about their treatment. A federal investigation of Miller's death said the Minneapolis VA made multiple mistakes, from not scheduling a follow-up to overlooking his access to firearms.

""They have people, but they're not trained the way they're supposed to be,"" Miller said.

Some 6,000 veterans kill themselves every year. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, whose department serves 9.5 million people, said in the last year, they have had 240 interventions where they stopped veterans from taking their lives. Since October, the VA has screened 900,000 veterans for mental health issues.

""Of that 900,000 we culled it down to 3,000. Three thousands veterans our medical professionals say might be at risk and we are monitoring them as closely as we can,"" Wilkie said. ""That means calls, that means visits — bringing them into our centers.""

In Miller's case, antidepressants came in the mail from the VA two days after he died. ""The worst part of his funeral was that they didn't have a live trumpet player. There was no one there to play for him,"" Harrington said.

The silent trumpet at his grave was a gift from his dad."

With the investigations of the investigators beginning under the watch of Attorney General William Barr at the Justice Department, we would like to highlight that it has not just been the FBI, and America’s other intelligence agencies, who were corrupted during the Obama administration.

Mr. Lu even went so far as to cancel American visas of Albanian opposition figures in his bid to curry favor with the far left and ensure socialist rule. He has since left Albania for Kyrgyzstan, where he is up to his old tricks, once again interfering in local affairs and pushing the globalist agenda, right under the nose of the leadership in Washington.

Mr. Lu’s supposed replacement for Albania, former State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary Kathleen Ann Kavalec, had her nomination withdrawn from consideration in Congress after information surfaced that she was connected to the Fusian GPS attempted coup by the Deep State.

The current U.S. Charge d’affaires Leyla Moses-Ones was caught blatantly and arrogantly tweeting against her boss, President Trump last year. More precisely, she retweeted a disloyal Twitter ramble about Mr. Trump by possibly soon to be indicted former head of the FBI, James Comey. Once exposed, Moses-Ones’ tweet was swiftly deleted.

We have also written about how the American embassy in Tirana has been actively involved in ‘judicial reform’ in Albania, which has led to complete lawlessness in the country of oligarch rule, because no constitutional court has been empaneled. That was the goal all along of course. The law was written by Soros consultants.

Former United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power, meanwhile, was caught ‘unmasking’ scores of Americans during her tenure with the Obama administration. This situation has not really been delved into by authorities, as the Trump-Russia hoax has sucked most of the oxygen from the room for the past two and a half years. Ms. Power’s actions should be investigated, however. Why in the world would the ambassador to the United Nations need to unmask American citizens via FISA surveillance? Hopefully we will know the answer to that question one day.

Just this week, the American representative to Ukraine, Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, was forced out two months early from her post. The allegation is that she played a role in State Department collusion with the Ukrainian government to ensure the election of Hillary Clinton in 2016 by releasing damaging information on Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.

Reports are that Ukraine’s prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko declared that Ms. Yovanovitch actually gave him a “list of people whom we should not prosecute” during their first meeting. Of course, these were allegedly all Obama administration officials.

The Soros’ cancer runs deep and wide throughout the State Department, where American tax dollars are a convenient piggy bank for his army of NGOs around the world which routinely are granted large amounts of money to work the open borders and open society globalist agenda.

This has to stop.

Americans are tired of big government working behind their backs for other nations and other agendas rather than Trump’s America First. To fully drain the swamp, Foggy Bottom needs to receive a visit from the Trump plumber.

Stefanik urges Homeland Security to keep up staffing at northern border,https://www.wcax.com,[],,,,https://www.wcax.com/content/news/Stefanik-urges-Homeland-Security-to-keep-agents-at-northern-border-509767961.html,"The Department of Homeland Security is facing backlash for a plan to transfer Customs and Border Protection personnel from the northern border to the southern border.

A group of bipartisan lawmakers from border states wrote the DHS a letter to try to stop the plan before it starts.

It read in part, ""The abrupt transfer of needed personnel on the northern border will have economic and security implications on the facilitation of U.S.-Canada cross border trade and travel.""

North Country Rep. Elise Stefanik, who voted to increase funding for security at the southern border, says that more personnel need to be added at the southern border but not at the expense of the northern border.

""I represent the northern border and so much of our economy depends on the trading of goods across the border, that daily commerce. And so the letter reiterates to the DHS that my priority is that we are not seeing those transfers,"" said Stefanik, R-New York.

Stefanik said decreased staffing could lead to lines and long wait times at the border, impacting not just tourists but manufacturers who work on both sides of the border.

Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire also signed the letter."
U.S. EPA proposes hike in biofuel mandate to 20.04 billion gallons in 2020: sources,https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-biofuels/epa-proposes-hike-in-biofuel-mandate-to-20-04-billion-gallons-in-2020-sources-idUSKCN1SF2J6,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed increasing the volume of biofuels refiners must blend into their fuel annually to 20.04 billion gallons in 2020, from 19.92 billion gallons in 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

The proposed mandate, now under review by other government agencies before being finalized, includes 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuels like ethanol, unchanged from 2019. It also includes 5.04 billion gallons of advanced biofuels, like those made from agricultural wastes, up from 4.92 billion in 2019, the sources said.

The EPA is charged with setting biofuel blending requirements for the refining industry as part of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a more than decade-old regulation that is aimed at helping farmers and reducing U.S. dependence on oil.

The policy has helped farmers by creating a huge market for ethanol and other biofuels, but oil refiners say compliance can cost a fortune.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud confirmed the agency submitted a proposal for review, but did not comment on its contents.

“The proposal is currently under interagency review, which places the Trump administration on track to release the Renewable Fuel Standard Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) on time for the third consecutive year,” he said.

As part of the advanced biofuel proposal, the agency set mandates for cellulosic fuel at 540 million gallons and non-cellulosic at 4.5 billion, according to the sources.

It also proposed a biodiesel mandate of 2.43 billion gallons for 2021, unchanged from 2020, they said. The EPA sets biodiesel mandates a year in advance.

Small refineries can be exempted from biofuel blending if they prove that complying would cause them financial strain, and the Trump administration made extensive use of such exemptions in the last two years.

That has saved refiners money but angered the corn lobby, which argues the practice erodes biofuel demand."
