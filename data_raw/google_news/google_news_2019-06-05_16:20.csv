"Joe Concha: Trump gets mostly glowing reviews from UK media, while US coverage focuses on Baby Blimp, protests",https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-concha-trump-media-coverage-uk-trip,"While President Trump has received largely positive local coverage of his visit to the United Kingdom, the American media has stayed focused on the negative, Joe Concha said Wednesday on ""Fox & Friends.""

Concha, of The Hill and WOR radio, said the mainstream media's coverage has been consumed by the protests of Trump's visit, even though the demonstrations ""are about a third as large"" as last summer.

""All we're seeing, basically, is this Trump Baby Blimp, which is getting more coverage than the O.J. Bronco. I see this thing constantly. ... It's typical of what we've seen with Trump. If it's negative, that's the way we're gonna go,"" he said.

Concha compared the disparity in the coverage by the British and American media with the Jussie Smollett case, where the Chicago media was presenting a different picture than the national media.

Concha said Trump has come across as a ""strong leader"" and ""competent"" in his appearances alongside Prime Minister Theresa May and Queen Elizabeth II.

""We're getting way too many opinions based solely on speculation and how people perceive things instead of what people see on their screens,"" he said, arguing that many mainstream media pundits are characterizing Trump as a ""buffoon on the world stage.""

""Fox & Friends"" contrasted the coverage by BBC and other outlets, which focused on Trump emphasizing the ""friendship"" between the U.S. and Britain, with CNN and MSNBC pundits bashing the president.

Concha highlighted that the centerpiece of the trip was to commemorate 75 years since the D-Day invasion by Allied forces in World War II.

""This is what we should be focusing on, the U.S. and U.K. coming together to defeat Nazi Germany. I'm not hearing a lot about that right now, I'm seeing Trump Baby Blimp,"" he said.

Concha said ratings are hurting at CNN and MSNBC because the coverage is ""out of whack"" and viewers ""do not trust the messenger anymore."""
World leaders including President Trump gather to commemorate 75th anniversary of D-Day landings,https://www.foxnews.com,['Greg Norman'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/world-leaders-trump-d-day-75th-anniversary,"President Trump, British Prime Minister Theresa May and other world leaders gathered Wednesday on the south coast of England to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, honoring the Allied forces who risked and gave their lives in the invasion that helped liberate Europe from Nazi Germany.

The Royal British Legion brought about 300 veterans, aged 91 to 101, to the ceremonies in Portsmouth, where many of the troops embarked for Normandy on June 5, 1944. After a flyover by the Royal Air Force and a salute from the Royal Navy, the veterans will return to the landing beaches overnight, just as they did 75 years ago.

""The Normandy landings 75 years ago were a moment of historic international cooperation,"" British Prime Minister Theresa May said. ""And it is right that at the heart of today's commemorations are the veterans who fought to secure the liberty and the peace that we now enjoy.""

The event, which kicks off two days of D-Day anniversary observances, is intended as a tribute to the troops who shaped history during the dangerous mission to reach beachheads and fight in German-occupied France.

REMEMBER THESE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO HELPED TO WIN D-DAY

D-Day saw more than 150,000 Allied troops land on the beaches of Normandy in northwest France on June 6, 1944, carried by 7,000 boats. The Battle of Normandy, codenamed Operation Overlord, was a turning point in the war, and helped bring about Nazi Germany's defeat in May 1945.

Trump, in the ceremony at Portsmouth Wednesday, read an excerpt from a prayer that President Roosevelt said during a radio address on D-Day.

“Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity,"" Trump said. ""They will need Thy blessings. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces but we shall return again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph.""

Queen Elizabeth II, in her remarks, lauded the soldiers who participated in D-Day as ""resilient.""

“The fate of the world depended on their success,"" she said. ""Many of them would never return and the heroism, courage and sacrifice of those who lost their lives will never be forgotten.”

Also among those who were in attendance Wednesday are presidents, prime ministers and other representatives of the countries that fought alongside the U.S. and Britain in Normandy: Canada, Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Denmark, France, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Poland.

The leader of the country that was the enemy in 1944, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, also attended.

Britain has promised ""unprecedented commemorations"" for today and tomorrow, involving testimony from veterans and military spectacle, including a flyby of 24 vintage and modern military aircraft.

In Portsmouth, dignitaries also plan to read from historical documents linked to D-Day. In May's case, it's a letter written by Capt. Norman Skinner of the Royal Army Service Corps to his wife, Gladys, on June 3, 1944, a few days before the invasion. It was in his pocket when he landed in Normandy.

""I can imagine you in the garden having tea with Janey and Anne getting ready to put them to bed,"" wrote Skinner, who was killed the day after D-Day. ""Although I would give anything to be back with you, I have not yet had any wish at all to back down from the job we have to do.""

D-DAY VETERAN'S GRANDSON RECALLS 'VIVID' LETTERS OF 'STRIKING IMAGES' FROM OMAHA BEACH

On Thursday the focus shifts to France, where commemorations will be held at simple military cemeteries near the Normandy beaches.

Some events were already held in France early Wednesday morning, with U.S. Army Rangers climbing the jagged cliffs of Normandy's Pointe du Hoc to honor the men who scaled them under fire 75 years ago.

Elderly veterans looked on as members of the 75th Ranger Regiment started mounting the limestone promontory at dawn, pulling themselves up on ropes one by one, seagulls swooping above.

They were recreating a journey taken by the U.S. Army's 2nd and 5th Ranger Battalions to destroy Nazi guns atop the cliffs. The operation helped prepare the way for Allied troops landing on beaches up a few miles up the coast.

Of the 235 men who took on the cliffs in 1944, only 90 were fit for battle two days later.

Elsewhere in Normandy, parachutists were jumping from C-47 transporters in World War II colors and other aircraft, aiming for fields of wild flowers on the outskirts of Carentan, one of the early objectives for Allied troops.

Among the jumpers will be American D-Day veteran Tom Rice, 97. He jumped into Normandy with thousands of other parachutists in 1944, and recalled it as ""the worst jump I ever had.""

Like many other veterans, Rice said he remains troubled by the war.

""We did a lot of destruction, damage. And we chased the Germans out and coming back here is a matter of closure,"" he said. ""You can close the issue now.""

Georgia Clark, who had worked at the Fort Worth Independent School District more than 20 years, reportedly said she thought the tweets were private.

“Mr. President, Fort Worth Independent School District is loaded with illegal students from Mexico,” Clark allegedly wrote last month from a now-deleted Twitter account. “Anything you can do to remove the illegals from Fort Worth would be greatly appreciated.”

“Texas will not protect whistle blowers. The Mexicans refuse to honor our flag,” Clark allegedly wrote in another post. One of the tweets included her phone number.

According to a Fort Worth ISD review obtained by The Post, Clark acknowledged that the tweets were hers. The review also indicated that the school district was already investigating Clark for separate allegations that she made remarks about student’s ethnicity or immigration status.

Opinion | The Articles of Impeachment Against Donald J. Trump: A Draft,https://www.nytimes.com,['Ian Prasad Philbrick'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/05/opinion/impeachment-trump-democrats-nixon-clinton.html,"ARTICLE I ARTICLE II ARTICLE III ARTICLE I ARTICLE II ARTICLE III ARTICLE I ARTICLE II ARTICLE III

Calls for President Trump’s impeachment are getting louder. Since the release of Robert Mueller’s report, White House stonewalling of congressional subpoenas and Mr. Mueller’s first public comments, almost 60 House Democrats, a quarter of the caucus, have said they support an impeachment inquiry.

If Democrats do move to impeach Mr. Trump, the articles of impeachment drafted against past presidents will probably guide them. The Constitution leaves “high crimes and misdemeanors,” the term that describes impeachable offenses, vague, notes the historian Timothy Naftali, a co-writer of a recent book on impeachment. “So if you are doing your constitutional duty as an elected member of Congress, how do you define high crimes and misdemeanors?” he asked. “One of the ways you do it is by looking at past practice.”

What might impeachment articles against Mr. Trump look like? To find out, we reviewed the articles of impeachment drawn up against Richard Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Then we edited them — by removing and adding passages — to match the president’s conduct as described in the Mueller report and elsewhere.

Impeachment is often said to be a political process. But when you assess Mr. Trump’s conduct by the bar for impeachment set by past Democratic and Republican lawmakers for past presidents of both parties, the results are striking. The pathway to a possible Trump impeachment is already mapped out in these historical documents.

Based on Nixon’s Impeachment

In July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon, who resigned before the full House could vote on them. Mr. Trump’s behavior maps neatly onto the first and third Nixon articles, which dealt with obstruction of justice. Nixon interfered with a federal investigation of the Watergate break-in by refusing to turn over documents, pressuring witnesses, lying to the public and firing the special prosecutor assigned to the case. In response to Mr. Mueller’s and Congress’s inquiries, Mr. Trump has similarly stonewalled subpoenas, tried to influence witness testimony, lied and attempted to fire Mr. Mueller.

Article I The Russian government engaged in a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election. On June 17, 1972, and prior thereto, agents of the Committee for the Re-election of the President committed unlawful entry of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, District of Columbia, for the purpose of securing political intelligence.May 17, 2017, a special counsel was appointed to investigate Russian interference, including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. The special counsel was also given “the authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the special counsel’s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.” Subsequent thereto, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede and obstruct the investigation of such illegal entryRussian contacts and potential obstruction of justice; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities.

The introduction in the first impeachment article against Nixon sets up the main argument Congress would likely use against Mr. Trump: The president attempted to impede a federal investigation into his actions and those of his associates.

The means used to implement this course of conduct or plan included one or more of the following: * making false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States; * withholding relevant and material evidence or information from lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, including congressional committees;

Like Mr. Trump, Nixon never submitted to questioning from F.B.I. investigators. But Nixon misrepresented or lied about his involvement in the Watergate cover-up to Justice Department officials and his own aides.

Mr. Mueller’s investigators deemed Mr. Trump’s written answers about Russia-related topics “inadequate,” but they did not accuse him of providing false information. Like Nixon, however, Mr. Trump did provide false information to potential witnesses, including his own aides. He has also refused to allow congressional committees access to relevant information, including the unredacted Mueller report and witnesses.

* 3 approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and counsellingencouraging witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States and false or misleading testimony in duly instituted judicial and congressional proceedings; * interfering or endeavoring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the office of Watergate Special Prosecution Forcethe office of the special counsel and congressional committees; * approving, condoning, and acquiescing in, the surreptitious payment of substantial sums of money for the purpose of obtaining the silence or influencing the testimony of witnesses, potential witnesses or individuals who participated in such unlawful entry and other illegal activities; * endeavoring to misuse the Central Intelligence AgencyDepartment of Justice, an agency of the United States; * disseminating information received from officers of the Department of Justice of the United States to subjects of investigations conducted by lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, for the purpose of aiding and assisting such subjects in their attempts to avoid criminal liability; * making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States into believing that a thorough and complete investigation had been conducted with respect to allegations of misconduct on the part of personnel of the executive branch of the United States and personnel of the Committee for the Re-election of the PresidentTrump 2016 campaign, and that there was no involvement of such personnel in such misconduct; or * endeavoring to cause prospective defendants, and individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favored treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony, or rewarding individuals for their silence or false testimony or endeavoring to intimidate individuals who offered testimony. In all of this, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.

Most of the above charges against Nixon required only modest tweaks to match Mr. Trump’s conduct. Mr. Trump asked the Department of Justice, not the Central Intelligence Agency, to go after his political rivals. Mr. Trump’s misconduct focused on covering up actions by members of his presidential campaign rather than the Committee for the Re-election of the President, a fundraising committee separate from the rest of the Nixon campaign apparatus.

An impeachment article against Mr. Trump could argue the president encouraged witnesses to give false or misleading statements to investigators and to the public, or focus on how Mr. Trump interfered with the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia.

Article II Using the powers of the office of president of the United States, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the purpose of these agencies. This conduct has included one or more of the following: * He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavored to obtain from the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, confidential information contained in income tax returns for purposed not authorized by law, and to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be initiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner. * He misused the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret ServiceDepartment of Justice, and other executive personnel in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, by directing or authorizing such agencies or personnel to conduct or continue electronic surveillance or other investigations for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; he did direct, authorize or permit the use of information obtained thereby for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws or any other lawful function of his office; and he did direct the concealment of certain records made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of electronic surveillance. * He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, authorized and permitted to be maintained a secret investigative unit within the office of the president, financed in part with money derived from campaign contributions, which unlawfully utilized the resources of the Central Intelligence Agency, engaged in covert and unlawful activities, and attempted to prejudice the constitutional right of an accused to a fair trial. * He has failed to take care that the laws were faithfully executed by failing to act when he knew or had reason to know that his close subordinates endeavored to impede and frustrate lawful inquiries by duly constituted executive, judicial and legislative entities concerning the unlawful entry into the headquarters of the Democratic National CommitteeRussian interference in the 2016 election, and the cover-up thereof, and concerning other unlawful activities including those relating to the confirmation of Richard Kleindienst as attorney general of the United States, the electronic surveillance of private citizens, the break-in into the offices of Dr. Lewis Fielding, and the campaign financing practices of the Committee to Re-elect the President. * In disregard of the rule of law, he knowingly misused the executive power by interfering with agencies of the executive branch, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Division and the Office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, of the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency, in violation of his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. In all of this, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.

Nixon’s abuses of presidential power, the subject of his second article, were manifold. They involved pressuring federal agencies to punish or surveil his perceived political enemies. While much of this second article doesn’t match what we know of Mr. Trump’s conduct, Mr. Trump has undermined the purpose of the federal government by attacking the rule of law and calling for investigations of figures like Hillary Clinton and James Comey.

“The spirit he’s cultivating is that the federal bureaucracy only exists to serve the needs of Donald J. Trump,” said Mr. Naftali, the historian.

Article III In his conduct of the office of president of the United States, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, contrary to his oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has failed without lawful cause or excuse to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on April 11, 1974, May 15, 1974, May 30, 1974, and June 24, 1974April 19, 2019, April 22, 2019, and May 21, 2019; the Committee on Oversight and Reform of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019; the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019; the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019, and May 8, 2019; and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives on May 10, 2019, and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas. The subpoenaed papers and things were deemed necessary by the committee in order to resolve by direct evidence fundamental, factual questions relating to presidential direction, knowledge or approval of actions demonstrated by other evidence to be substantial grounds for impeachment of the president. In refusing to produce these papers and things Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, substituting his judgment as to what materials were necessary for the inquiry, interposed the powers of the presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives. In all of this, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice, and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.

Based on Clinton’s Impeachment

The first article of impeachment passed by the Republican-controlled House against Bill Clinton was based on testimony he gave before a federal grand jury. Because Mr. Trump refused an in-person interview with Mr. Mueller’s investigators, did not agree to provide written answers to questions about obstruction and never testified before the grand jury, little of this first article is relevant to Mr. Trump’s conduct.

Resolved, That William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, president of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors and that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the United States Senate: Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of the United States of America in the name of itself and of the people of the United States of America, against William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, president of the United States of America, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors. Article I In his conduct while president of the United States, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has willfully corrupted and manipulated the judicial process of the United States for his personal gain and exoneration, impeding the administration of justice, in that: On Aug. 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth before a federal grand jury of the United States. Contrary to that oath, William Jefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more of the following: (1) the nature and details of his relationship with a subordinate government employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony he gave in a federal civil rights action brought against him; (3) prior false and misleading statements he allowed his attorney to make to a federal judge in that civil rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in that civil rights action.The Russian government engaged in a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election. On May 17, 2017, a special counsel was appointed to investigate Russian interference, including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Subsequent thereto, Donald J. Trump, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede and obstruct the investigation of such Russian contacts and potential obstruction of justice; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities. In doing this, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump has undermined the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the presidency, has betrayed his trust as president and has acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.

But any case for impeaching Mr. Trump would likely rest on obstruction of justice, the focus of Mr. Clinton’s third article. (Republicans also drafted a second and fourth impeachment article against Mr. Clinton, but neither passed the full House.)

We’ve re-ordered the obstruction charges arrayed against Mr. Clinton to better match the timeline of Mr. Trump’s potentially obstructive acts. The quotations describing each of Mr. Trump’s acts come from the redacted Mueller report.

Article III In his conduct while president of the United States, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed and impeded the administration of justice, and has to that end engaged personally, and through his subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or scheme designed to delay, impede, cover up and conceal the existence of evidence and testimony related to a federal civil rights action brought against him in a duly instituted judicial proceedinginvestigation. The means used to implement this course of conduct or scheme included one or more of the following acts: * On or about Dec. 17, 1997Feb. 14, 2017, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump corruptly encouraged a witness in a federal civil rights action brought against himattempted to persuade the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to execute a sworn affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, false and misleading.end the F.B.I.’s investigation into the national security adviser. * On or about Dec. 28, 1997, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump corruptly engaged in, encouraged or supported a scheme to conceal evidence that had been subpoenaed in alimit the scope of a federal civil rights action brought against himinvestigation, including by firing the F.B.I. director and attempting to get the attorney general to “unrecuse” himself from overseeing the special counsel investigation. * On or about Jan. 18 and Jan. 20-21, 1998June 17, 2017, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump related a false and misleading account of events relevant to a federal civil rights action brought against him to a potential witness in that proceeding,ordered the White House counsel to have the special counsel removed in order to corruptly influence the testimony of that witnesscourse of a federal investigation.

The obstruction case laid out against President Clinton was largely based on his behavior toward witnesses in the investigation into his conduct. As you can see from our rendering of a Trump indictment, Mr. Trump arguably took more extensive steps than Mr. Clinton did to thwart investigators. Beyond interfering with witnesses and encouraging the giving of false testimony, Mr. Trump tried to limit the scope of Mr. Mueller’s investigation and have the special counsel removed.

* 4On Jan. 17, 1998In January and February 2018, at his deposition in a federal civil rights action brought against him, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump corruptly allowedengaged in repeated efforts to get his attorneythe White House counsel to makecreate a false and misleading statements to a federal judgerecord characterizing an affidavitthe president’s efforts to remove the special counsel, in order to prevent questioning deemed relevant by the judge“deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the president’s conduct towards the investigation.”. Such a false and misleading statementsrecord were subsequently acknowledged by his attorneythe White House counsel in a communication to that judgethe office of the special counsel. * Beginning on or about Dec. 7, 1997, and continuing through and including Jan. 14, 1998in spring 2018, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump intensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job assistance todiscuss pardons with a potential witness in a federal civil rights action brought against himinvestigation in order to corruptly prevent the truthful testimony of that witness in that proceeding at a time when the truthful testimony of that witness would have been harmful to him. * On or about Jan. 21, 23 and 26, 1998In summer 2018, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump made false and misleading statements“used inducements in the form of positive messages…and then turned to attacks and intimidation” totoward a potential witnesseswitness in a federal grand jury proceedinginvestigation in order to corruptly influence the testimony of those witnessesthat witness. The false and misleading statements made by William Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the witnesses to the grand jury, causing the grand jury to receive false and misleading information. * On or about Dec. 17, 1997Aug. 22, 2018, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump corruptly encouragedpraised a witness in a federal civil rights action brought against himinvestigation to give perjurious, false and misleading testimonyfor not “flipping” if and when called to testify personally in that proceeding, which “had the potential” to corruptly prevent the truthful testimony of that witness at a time when the truthful testimony of that witness would have been harmful to him. In all of this, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump has undermined the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the presidency, has betrayed his trust as president and has acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.

Below you can see what articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump alone might look like. These rewritten articles against Mr. Trump don’t include other potentially impeachable offenses that lack a clear precedent in the Nixon and Clinton cases, such as hush-money payments to women or possible violations of the Constitution’s emoluments clause.

An impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump is far from guaranteed. And whether impeaching him would politically help or hurt Democrats remains an open question. But there is no question that by the standards for high crimes and misdemeanors applied to past presidents in living memory, Donald J. Trump has committed impeachable offenses.

Trump’s impeachment"
Trump wears Churchill-style hat during Piers Morgan interview,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/05/trump-wears-churchill-style-hat-during-piers-morgan-interview/,"President Trump playfully wore a Winston Churchill-style hat on British TV — using it to joke about his famous coif.

“I’ll try it,” Trump said after getting the gift, from Churchill’s own hatmakers and monogrammed with his initials, DJT, on “Good Morning Britain.”

“One thing I’ve proved by being a politician — it is my hair,” he joked of longstanding rumors that he wears a wig. “They would have found out a long time ago.”

Trump got the hat, a replica of the wartime prime minister’s distinctive homburg, from presenter Piers Morgan, who was a contestant on his “Celebrity Apprentice” show.

“Thank you — I never knew you had this kind of sensibility,” Trump teased him.

He said Churchill was “certainly” a hero, and claimed he had “similarities” with the legendary leader. “He was able to handle pressure very well,” Trump said.

“He was a great man who reacted so well under the gun, under pressure. There are not many people like that.”"
Trump’s U.K. Visit Ends With D-Day Ceremony: Live Updates,https://www.nytimes.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/world/europe/trump-uk-visit.html,"Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family welcomed Mr. Trump to Buckingham Palace with an honor guard and artillery salute, followed by lunch, afternoon tea, a tour of Westminster Abbey and a lavish state banquet, at which the president and the queen toasted each other.

The president’s four adult children arrived for the festivities, after more than a month of planning by White House officials to accommodate them and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser.

Before he even landed, though, Mr. Trump stoked an old feud with London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, whom he called a “stone cold loser,” and who later called him “the poster boy for the far-right movement around the world.” And on Tuesday protesters, having prepared a statue and a blimp in Mr. Trump’s image, gathered in London’s streets to demonstrate against him, though seemingly in fewer numbers than the tens of thousands who protested his visit last year.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump traded ceremony for diplomacy, meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May to discuss a possible trade agreement, the Chinese technology firm Huawei (which the United States has called a security threat) and other issues. He also spoke with Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary and leading candidate to succeed Mrs. May as prime minister, and Nigel Farage, the right-wing, pro-Brexit politician whose upstart party did well in the recent European Parliament elections.

Mr. Trump has been a critic of Britain’s approach to Brexit, suggesting that it should be more aggressive in the negotiations. He took a more reserved approach on Tuesday, saying that he did not want to take a strong position. But with opponents of a withdrawal pushing for a second referendum, and the government having failed to come up with a plan that could gain Parliament’s approval, he said of Brexit, “I think it will happen.”

Does VA have a secret wait list for health care? Key members of Congress want to know.,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'The Washington Post', 'Wei-Huan Chen', 'Staff Writer', 'Brittany Britto', 'Maddy Falivene', 'Jordan Blum', 'Chris Tomlinson']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Does-VA-have-a-secret-wait-list-for-health-care-13938065.php,"WASHINGTON - Key members of Congress want the Trump administration to address charges of a ""secret"" Veterans Affairs wait list that has a higher number of patients seeking medical care than information publicly available.

Allegations about significantly different data regarding veterans awaiting treatment on internal and public records were made by Jereme P. Whiteman, VA's national director of clinic practice management, in a Washington Post Federal Insider column published online Monday.

The article reported on a letter he sent to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie last week that said, ""In September last year I discovered a secret VA wait list. I disclosed this wait list within my VHA chain of command. Since that date I have been retaliated against by officials within my chain of command. Furthermore, the agency has taken steps to conceal this wait list from the public.""

The monthly number of veterans awaiting care on the internal list is about three times greater than the numbers on the public list.

A VA spokesman said Whiteman's allegations are false. ""VA's electronic wait list (EWL) has two components - one administrative and one clinical,"" said Curt Cashour, the department's press secretary.

The clinical number is public and shows the number of veterans waiting for medical care. ""The administrative component of the EWL has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment,"" he added, ""and tracks routine actions, such as facility and provider transfer requests.""

Top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans' affairs committees are not satisfied with that response.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Wilkie, Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., chairman of the House committee, and Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the Senate panel, said Cashour's explanation ""is, at best, confusing.""

""We, therefore, ask VA to provide - by the end of this week - a more thorough explanation for the existence of two sets of reports on wait time for veterans' health care. In fulfilling this request, VA should provide the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs with the reports described by the article and the appropriate VA officials should make themselves available for a briefing to the Committees.""

A statement from the office of Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee, the top Republican on the House panel, said, ""Dr. Roe has asked VA about these allegations and will continue looking into them.""

Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations, said the ""allegations of a secret internal wait list for veterans - that exceeds the public wait list by three-fold - are deeply disturbing. . . . Congress must get to the bottom of these claims by verifying the accuracy of these internal VA documents and ensuring transparency and accountability for our nation's veterans and the American people.""

Connolly praised whistleblowers and said they ""must be protected"" against reprisals by managers. In addition to reporting his charges about the dual wait lists with VA's Office of the Medical Inspector and the department's Office of Inspector General, Whiteman has filed retaliation complaints with the VA whistleblower protection office and the Office of Special Counsel, which protects whistleblowers across the government.

Inspector General Michael Missal said his office received Whiteman's information and is considering the next steps for his office.

In one example of retaliation, Whiteman said he led a team that implemented a text messaging system to remind patients of their appointments. It cut the number of missed sessions and saved the department millions of dollars. Although he was the team leader, he was the only member who did not get a performance award for the project.

Whiteman's allegations come five years after a national uproar over phony wait lists rocked the VA. That scandal pushed then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki from office and led to a series of agency reforms. Robert McDonald, who followed Shinseki in office, apologized to veterans in September 2014 congressional testimony and promised to rebuild trust.

He said the VA increased primary care staffing, developed an automated system for tracking new patients and contacted 266,000 veterans ""to get them off wait lists and into clinics.""

On Tuesday, Cashour said the VA now is ""seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than before."" According to Cashour:

- VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments in fiscal 2018, 623,000 more than the previous year.

- All VA health care facilities now provide same-day services in primary and mental health.

- VA is posting online wait times for every one of its medical centers across the country, and they are updated weekly.

- Regularly updated access data are available online for all VA medical centers and community-based outpatient clinics.

""Veterans are more satisfied with wait times,"" Cashour said, ""than they have been previously."""
"DOJ reveals Dems acknowledged Barr subpoena was 'overbroad'; Nadler fires back, offers to meet 'without conditions'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-fires-back-after-house-dems-announce-barr-contempt-vote-dubs-subpoena-unworkably-overbroad,"Hours after the Department of Justice (DOJ) slammed House Democrats for planning a contempt vote against Attorney General Bill Barr -- and charged that Democrats had privately admitted their subpoena requests were ""overbroad"" -- House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler announced late Tuesday that he is open to negotiating with the DOJ ""without conditions.""

The remarkable turn of events reopened the possibility that Barr's contempt vote may be postponed or canceled, if both sides return to the negotiating table. Nadler, however, pointedly refused to cancel the planned contempt vote prior to beginning any new negotiations, as the DOJ had demanded.

At the same time, Nadler criticized what he called DOJ ""brinksmanship,"" and blamed the Justice Department for purportedly cutting off negotiations on May 7.

The brouhaha began Tuesday morning with a DOJ letter, written by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, that blasted House Democrats and Nadler, D-N.Y., for announcing they would vote next week on whether to hold Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SCHOLAR: CONGRESS HEADING INTO 'WORLD OF HURT' WITH BARR CONTEMPT VOTE

In its letter to Nadler, the DOJ publicly revealed that Democrats had acknowledged in a May 24 letter they were open to ""further negotiations"" regarding concerns that their subpoena demands were ""unworkably overbroad."" Nevertheless, Democrats announced just days later their plans to hold Barr in contempt for allegedly failing to comply with those demands.

The DOJ said it was ""prepared to resume negotiations with the committee regarding accommodation of its narrowed Subpoena"" -- as long as Democrats removed the ""threat of an imminent vote by the House of Representatives to hold the attorney general in contempt.""

""The department was disappointed by the committee's abrupt termination of ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching a reasonable accommodation that respects both sides' legitimate interests regarding the materials sought,"" Boyd wrote to Nadler. ""Further, the department is disappointed by news reports indicating that Democratic leaders have scheduled a contempt vote in the House of Representatives for June 11, 2019.""

In his response late Tuesday, Nadler took issue with the DOJ's characterization of Democrats' May 24 letter, and insisted that Democrats had ""always remained open to continuing negotiations. ... We are here and ready to negotiate as early as tomorrow morning.""

""I ... take exception to your characterization of how our prior accommodation efforts ended,"" Nadler wrote back to Boyd. ""Contrary to the account in your letter, the Committee has always remained open to continuing negotiations. We had an offer on the table late on the evening of May 7 when the Department suddenly declared an end to the accommodation process. My staff was still in their offices after the close of business hours awaiting a counteroffer when the Department broke off negotiations with a letter demanding that the contempt vote—scheduled to begin the next day— be cancelled if we wished to proceed with the accommodations process.""

Nadler continued: ""At any rate, we are ready to proceed without conditions—as shown by the initiative we took with our detailed May 24 offer. I should add that, contrary to your argument that the Committee’s continuing accommodation efforts somehow suggest that our prior requests were overbroad, our offer to compromise was intended to respond to your prior objections by seeking a middle ground. We urge the Department to do the same.""

The DOJ's letter, meanwhile, had called on the House Judiciary Committee to ""moot"" its May 8 vote to hold Barr in contempt, which the DOJ called ""premature and unnecessary."" That vote came after congressional Democrats subpoenaed Mueller's full and unredacted report on his probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.

WHY DID MUELLER EDIT TRANSCRIPT OF VOICEMAIL WITH FLYNN LAWYER TO ELIMINATE KEY DISCLAIMERS?

Republicans have countered that federal law protecting secretive grand-jury information would prevent Barr from turning over the entirety of the report. The DOJ has offered Democrats the opportunity to review the report, minus those grand jury-related redactions, in a secure setting -- but those offers have been rebuffed. (In a rare public statement last week, Mueller specifically remarked, ""I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith"" in deciding to make the report ""largely public."")

""It would hardly make sense for the full House of Representatives to act upon the committee's prior recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt for not complying with a subpoena that even the committee now appears to acknowledge was overbroad in seeking immediate disclosure of the entirety of the special counsel's investigative files,” Boyd wrote.

That was a conspicuous reference to the previously unreported May 24 letter to the DOJ, in which the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wrote to privately emphasize ""the Committee's willingness to engage in further negotiations to resolve this dispute"" -- only to resort to public political posturing, the DOJ charged.

The Democrat-led committee also offered to ""identify specific materials that if produced would be deemed to satisfy the subpoena"" in an effort to make the subpoena more workable, according to the DOJ, which quoted the Committee's letter verbatim.

""In your May 24, 2019, letter, the committee appears to recognize that the subpoena is unworkably overbroad and offers -- for the first time -- to narrow the subpoena's scope to cover a much more limited set of documents,"" the DOJ wrote. ""The department believes that the committee's new offer reflects a more reasonable request and could mitigate some of the legal barriers to disclosure that we have discussed.""

ANALYSIS: BARR DETERMINED TO FIND TRUTH BEHIND ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE -- AND DEMS ARE WORRIED

The letter continued: ""The committee held its contempt vote only 19 days after issuing the subpoena. Traditionally, congressional committees have only proceeded with contempt votes after lengthy periods of negotiations have failed to reach an accommodation. For example, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee negotiated with the department over the Operation Fast and Furious subpoena for months, and only voted to cite Attorney General [Eric] Holder for contempt 252 days after issuing its subpoena.""

Since 1975, according to the DOJ, ""committees and subcommittees have averaged 103 days between issuing a subpoena to an executive branch official and holding a contempt vote. By any measure, the committee rushed its decision and bears responsibility for the termination of the accommodation process.”

But in his letter, Nadler took issues with those characterizations.

""We cannot agree that the House’s sense of urgency here is 'premature and unnecessary,'"" Nadler wrote. ""It has been over 100 days since we first initiated the accommodations process on February 22, 2019. The pace with which we are proceeding is consistent with the exceptional urgency of this matter: an attack on our elections that was welcomed by our President and benefitted his campaign, followed by acts of obstruction by the President designed to interfere with the investigation of that attack. All of this misconduct was documented by the Special Counsel in the documents we now seek.""

In a statement, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., highlighted the DOJ's revelation that Nadler apparently signaled a willingness to work with the DOJ.

“After racing to hold Attorney General Barr in contempt, Chairman Nadler finally seems ready to join the Justice Department at the negotiating table,"" Collins said. ""When Judiciary Democrats wield subpoena power like a sword instead of a plow, their investigations bear little fruit. The House Intelligence Committee has shown us that working with the Justice Department in good faith yields documents. Abusing subpoena and contempt authority, however, has left the Judiciary Committee with little to show for its obsessively unreasonable demands.""

As for McGahn, the White House has instructed its former top lawyer not to testify, saying he is legally immune from being compelled to testify about privileged discussions occurring in the course of his official duties. Democrats have responded that McGahn waived that privilege by agreeing to speak to Mueller.

Trump did not assert executive privilege to shield any aspect of the Mueller report itself, and has derided Democrats' efforts as politically motivated attempts to keep what he's called the ""Russia collusion hoax"" alive -- and to distract from or derail -- Barr's own ongoing probes into Justice Department and FBI misconduct.

News of the planned contempt vote came days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation. Last month, Barr appointed the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, John Durham, to lead the investigation, which is to focus on the use of FBI informants and the alleged improper issuance of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to monitor a variety of individuals, including former Trump aide Carter Page.

A Barr contempt vote would be historic, but not unprecedented. In 2012, the GOP-controlled House's vote to hold the attorney general at that time, Holder, in contempt for failing to comply with investigations into the Obama administration's failed gun-running sting operation, ""Fast and Furious."" Holder became the first-ever sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress in that manner.

The resolution scheduled for a June 11 floor vote would allow the Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement of its subpoenas in federal court.

Such an approach would rule out so-called ""inherent contempt,"" a process in which Congress technically can enforce contempt citations on its own -- whether by arrest or fine. In May, Barr reportedly joked about that possibility with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, asking, ""Did you bring your handcuffs?""

"Shanahan approves punishments over Niger ambush, after long delay",https://www.cnn.com,['Ryan Browne'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/politics/shanahan-niger-ambush-review/index.html,"(CNN) Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan has approved the decision to discipline at least eight military officers over their role in the October 2017 Niger ambush that left four American soldiers dead and sparked a debate about the role of US troops in Africa after a Green Beret-led team found itself under attack by some 100 ISIS-linked fighters, according to two US officials familiar.

Shanahan surprised many, including some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, when he announced in April that he had ordered a review into the investigation and its findings regarding military awards and punishments for those involved.

He decided not to recommend any further punishments. Politico first reported Shanahan's decision.

""Following an extensive investigation into the attack, the Department of Defense identified numerous areas for improvement and lessons learned to help prevent this type of incident from occurring again in the future. After a thorough review of those reports, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan concurred with all of the findings, awards and accountability,"" Pentagon spokesperson Cdr. Candice Tresch said in a statement.

Shanahan tasked Gen. Robert Brown, the commander of US Army Pacific, with conducting an independent review of the findings of the military's months-long investigation into the incident. That review recommended that no changes be made and Shanahan approved the findings on May 29, the officials tell CNN.

"DOJ doesn't need to provide transcript of key Flynn phone call after all, judge rules",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-doesnt-need-to-provide-transcript-of-key-flynn-phone-call-after-all-judge-rules,"A federal judge said Tuesday that the Department of Justice no longer has to publicly file a transcript of a fateful phone call between former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the United States, an abrupt and unexplained reversal from his previous order last month

The development comes as Republicans allege that a separate court-ordered transcript release in the case showed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report contained a conspicuously -- and allegedly deceptive -- edited version of a voicemail message from former Trump lawyer John Dowd to Flynn's lawyer, Rob Kelner.

U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan had previously directed prosecutors to release details of a December 2016 call in which Flynn discussed sanctions with Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian envoy to Washington.

EX-TRUMP LAWYER SLAMS MUELLER REPORT AS 'FRAUD,' CITES MISLEADING QUOTE

Sullivan had also given government attorneys until May 31 to produce redacted portions of Mueller's report that relate to Flynn as well as a transcript of a phone message a lawyer for Trump left for Flynn's attorney after Flynn had decided to start cooperating with prosecutors.

On Friday, prosecutors publicly filed the transcript of the call between the lawyers and said all of the information in the report that Flynn had provided had been unredacted. But they declined to produce a transcript of Flynn's call with Kislyak, saying they were not relying on that conversation to establish his guilt or to determine his sentence.

In a brief written order Tuesday, Sullivan said that ""upon consideration of the government's submissions in response to those orders, the government is not required to file any additional materials or information on the public docket."" He did not elaborate on why he had changed his mind, and apparently left open the possibility he might order the documents to be produced under seal in the future.

Flynn is awaiting sentencing before Sullivan after pleading guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contact with Kislyak. He was supposed to be sentenced in December, but midway through the hearing, took the judge up on his offer to postpone it so that he could continue cooperating with prosecutors and earn credit toward a lighter sentence.

MUELLER REPORT REVEALS FLYNN WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION FAR EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED

Meanwhile, Republicans have focused renewed attention on the transcript that was released Friday. Dowd, Trump's ex-lawyer, left the voicemail message for Kelner after Flynn exited a joint-defense agreement and agreed to cooperate with Mueller. Mueller's team analyzed the message as part of their inquiry into whether President Trump obstructed justice.

According to the Mueller report, Dowd said: ""I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms ... [I]t wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with ... the government ... [I]f ... there's information that implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue ... so, you know ... we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can ... [R]emember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.""

But the full transcript revealed Dowd made clear he was not seeking confidential information -- and raised questions as to why Mueller would have omitted apparently exculpatory information. The transcript excerpt in the Mueller report attracted substantial press attention at the time.

The full quote reads, with emphasis added: ""Hey, Rob, uhm, this is John again. Uh, maybe, I-I-I-‘m-I’m sympathetic; I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t … state it in … starker terms. If you have … and it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with, and, uh, work with the government, uh … I understand that you can’t join the joint defense; so that’s one thing. If, on the other hand, we have, there’s information that … implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security issue, or maybe a national security issue, I don’t know … some issue, we got to-we got to deal with, not only for the President, but for the country. So … uh … you know, then-then, you know, we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of … protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any … confidential information. So, uhm, and if it’s the former, then, you know, remember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains, but — Well, in any event, uhm, let me know, and, uh, I appreciate your listening and taking the time. Thanks, Pal.""

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called for the release of “all backup and source information” for the Mueller report on Friday following the revelation of the edited transcript, and Dowd told Fox News the Mueller report was a ""fraud.""

Former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, meanwhile, asserted on Fox News' ""Hannity"" Monday night that the quotation was ""distorted.""

""This is a very, very serious issue,"" he said. ""The distortion of the Dowd quote is very serious. Especially since, remember, that a report by a special counsel is always going to be one-sided. Therefore, you have to trust it.""

Talks Between Democrats and Justice Dept. in Doubt Over Barr Contempt Vote,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/us/politics/trump-hope-hicks-annie-donaldson.html,"Under subpoenas issued by the Judiciary Committee, the two witnesses had been instructed to deliver on Tuesday a range of documents related to their work in the White House, including notes and records related to some of Mr. Trump’s attempts to thwart federal investigators — attempts documented by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in the report he completed in March.

Mr. Nadler said that Ms. Hicks, who also served as a top aide on Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, did produce some documents related to her work before the election. He called it a “show of good faith,” though a copy of a letter from Ms. Hicks’s lawyer obtained by The New York Times says she handed over only four documents containing email chains.

In addition to documents, the subpoenas call for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson to testify publicly this month — and there was no indication on Tuesday whether they would comply. Mr. Nadler made clear his position that both were still expected to show up before the panel. Ms. Hicks has been subpoenaed to appear on June 19 and Ms. Donaldson on June 24.

[Read the Judiciary Committee subpoenas for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson.]

But there appears to be little chance either former aide will testify, bolstering the case made by a growing number of House Democrats that the president is actively obstructing another branch of government from doing its constitutionally sanctioned oversight function, and that impeachment proceedings are the only proportional response.

The White House issued similar instructions not to cooperate last month to Mr. McGahn, who had served as one of the most important witnesses in Mr. Mueller’s investigation into obstruction of justice. He ultimately did not produce a single document or appear for a hearing. If it does not alter course for the Justice Department, the House is poised to hold Mr. McGahn in contempt of Congress next week, as well, and take the dispute to court to try to enforce its subpoena — steps that could soon follow for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson if they do not show up to the Judiciary Committee’s hearings.

With potential star witnesses off limits and Mr. Mueller reluctant to testify, Democrats have for now been left to try to figure out other ways to bring Mr. Mueller’s 448-page report to life. On Monday, Mr. Nadler announced that his committee would hold a series of hearings on the report with former federal prosecutors, legal experts and John W. Dean, who went to jail for his role in the Watergate affair.

Republicans, who remain closely aligned with the president, have repeatedly accused Democrats of being less interested in the truth than in manufacturing a conflict with the White House that could provide a pretext for impeachment. They painted the possibility of new talks between the two sides on Tuesday as further evidence Democrats had been acting irresponsibly."

Global Opinions writer

Even after spending a year and a half in prison in Tehran, I knew that if I wanted to go on writing about Iran, I would be a target for plenty of public attacks despite the abuse I had suffered at the hands of the Islamic Republic. And so it has been.

But I never imagined the U.S. State Department would be funding my attackers.

Last week, several astute Iran watchers drew attention to a series of inflammatory tweets associated with the Iran Disinformation Project, a State Department-funded initiative that its website claims “brings to light disinformation emanating from the Islamic Republic of Iran via official rhetoric, state propaganda outlets, social media manipulation and more.”

So the @StateDept uses taxpayer money to fund online attacks on @HRW because the organization is researching the human cost of US sanctions in #Iran.



Is this even legal? https://t.co/PGVuizRq93 — Negar Mortazavi (@NegarMortazavi) May 30, 2019

What other @StateDept funded organizations claiming to promote democracy in #Iran are using taxpayer money to harass, intimidate, threaten and slander American journalists & academics?

Follow the money folks. — Farnaz Fassihi (@farnazfassihi) May 31, 2019

On Friday, in response to the complaints, the State Department suspended the initiative’s funding “until the implementer takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work,” a department official said.

One of the “steps” thus far has been to delete many of the tweets in question. But that is hardly sufficient.

Ironically, the Iran Disinformation Project was funded by the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which was begun to combat online extremism and propaganda.

The targets of the tweets included think-tank analysts, human rights activists and journalists (including me). The common thread is that we are all perceived by regime change proponents and supporters of the Trump administration’s so-called maximum pressure policy to be soft on Iran because we are critical of crushing economic sanctions and the threat of the use of military force against it.

For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran’s “mouthpieces,” “apologists,” “collaborators,” and “lobbyists” in the West.

I won’t speak for others who have been attacked, and my own views are irrelevant to this situation. From what I can see, though, we all appear to share the view that Iran should be secular and democratic. The main difference between us and those spreading these falsehoods against us is how we envision that change in Iranian politics coming about.

As a matter of principle, I try to avoid impeding anyone else’s right to free expression — even when it’s used to attack me. If a claim against me is demonstrably false, I will state it clearly and openly. Yet, I believe it’s important to allow others — even faceless ones hiding behind anonymous social media accounts — the opportunity to criticize me, my work and my credentials. It’s part of what you sign up for when you take this job.

I also openly acknowledge that others who have been abused by Iran (such as me) have the right to hold whatever political positions they choose and the right to defend and promote them passionately. Yes, even if it means they advocate war or sanctions directed at the people of that country. They have their views and I have mine.

Slander and libel are a different story, however, and @IranDisinfo may have crossed the line.

What Bahman Kalbasi, one of the #IranDisinfo mouthpieces in @BBC doesn't tell you, is that the number of Jews in #Iran before the Islamic Revolution was around 100K. After the mass executions, assassinations, and confiscation of properties, now the number is less than 10K. https://t.co/rfhb6kwFk1 — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) May 28, 2019

In the past 16 months, thousands of protestors have been arrested in #Iran, and most are anonymous. @sepehrifar of @hrw, a supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime, instead of documenting+proving these human rights violations, is working hard to prove @JZarif's claims. https://t.co/CvWzqULihT — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) April 25, 2019

So we’re faced with the irony that an initiative aimed at combating Tehran’s disinformation campaigns is resorting to disinformation campaigns of its own, using taxpayer funds to spread lies about U.S. citizens. We need programs that fight the spread of falsehoods and propaganda, but such efforts shouldn’t combat lies with other lies — and certainly not with public funding.

This is just one more small incident in the long moment of reckoning our democracy is facing. It will pass quickly, but it’s an important stress test.

How can individuals who are not willing to adhere to the norms of American civil society be entrusted with resources to promote civil society in other countries?

The State Department can easily fix the problem. It needs to perform a transparent assessment of who received the funding and why. Once the facts are clear, the grant should be terminated.

Transparency and accountability are fundamental to the rule of law. Anyone who claims otherwise cannot be entrusted with taxpayer money to promote American ideals — at home or abroad.

At the heart of the matter lies a fundamental question: Do we support our long-cherished ideals of democratic fair play or the “by any means necessary” approach that is becoming more prevalent in the current political climate?

Put personal politics aside for a moment and look back through history. Do peddlers of disinformation contribute or detract from our health as a society? The answer is obvious, and the State Department should take a clear stance on the side of honest and responsible discourse.

If the State Department declines to address the issue, Congress should investigate.

The House Oversight subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties hearing, titled 'Confronting White Supremacy: Adequacy of the Federal Response,' was the latest effort by Democrats to spotlight ways they say the Trump administration has systematically cut back on resources used to address threats from domestic extremists even as the FBI has reported a 30-40% rise in domestic terrorism cases just since October.

Federal officials in attendance at Tuesday's hearing included FBI Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Michael McGarrity, FBI Deputy Assistant Director for Criminal Investigations Calvin Shivers and DHS Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Neumann.

Committee chairman Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., opened the hearing by raising issue with the amount of resources he says the FBI devotes towards investigating cases of international terrorism versus domestic terrorism.

Citing figures from the Anti-Defamation League, Raskin noted that from 2009-2018, far-right extremism was responsible for 73% of extremist murders, while international terrorism was responsible for 23% of terrorism deaths.

""The FBI has testified the bureau allocates its resources almost exactly backwards than the problem would suggest,"" Raskin said. ""Devoting 80% of field agents to stopping international terrorism including Islamic extremism and only 20% to stopping domestic terrorism including far right and white supremacist extremism.""

But McGarrity pointed to the success that FBI agents have so far had in disrupting potential domestic attacks in the past several months, and said successful arrests prior to domestic attacks actually outnumbered those arrested prior to attacks in international terror cases.

""In fiscal year 2018 FBI (Joint Terrorism Task Forces) across the country proactively arrested approximately 115 subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations before they could mobilize into violence,"" McGarrity said. ""So far (since Oct. 1 of last year), our JTTFs have disrupted approximately 66 subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations by arrest.""

Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, D-Fla., pressed Neumann on a report that the department recently disbanded and slashed funding for a section of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, which focused on producing reports on domestic terrorism and which Democrats warn could result in a reduction of available data on threats from white supremacist groups.

Neumann countered that the funding dedicated to the department was only inflated due to millions in grant funding committed during the Obama administration, but later in the hearing gave a candid assessment regarding DHS' overall counterterrorism strategy, saying that the administration is actively working to find ways to improve its prevention strategy.

""We know we're not doing enough,"" Neumann said. ""Things haven't been institutionalized. In order for government to work, we have to institutionalize it, you either need to authorize it through Congress or you need to get it in executive order or national security presidential memoranda.""

Following the terror attack on several mosques in New Zealand in March carried out by an alleged white supremacist, President Donald Trump told reporters he didn't see white nationalism as a rising threat to the U.S.

The hearing followed a briefing just two weeks earlier from a senior FBI counterterrorism official who gave sobering statistics to reporters regarding the domestic threat environment.

The official revealed the FBI currently has a total of just under 5,000 open terrorism cases, including 850 domestic terror-related cases, and acknowledged that far more Americans have been killed in domestic terror attacks than Islamic terror attacks since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

According to the official, a significant issue that the bureau faces is that the federal criminal code has made it more challenging to bring charges against domestic terror suspects than in cases involving international terrorism or foreign terrorist organizations.

That's because, according to the FBI Agents Association, ""domestic terrorism"" itself is not a federal crime.

""Domestic terrorism is about political violence,"" Tom O'Connor, the president of the FBI Agents Association said in a statement to ABC News. ""Congress must do everything in its power to provide law enforcement with the tools needed to combat this threat to our country.""

Investigators often are forced to rely on other federal crimes to charge suspects with or rely on state or local laws, such as in the recent case of Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson, who despite being accused in court of plotting mass murder ""on a scale rarely seen in this country,"" is currently facing only gun and drug charges from U.S. attorneys in Maryland.

And while then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions initially described the Charlottesville, Virginia attack by James Fields Jr., which resulted in the death of Heather Heyer, as ""the definition of domestic terrorism,"" Fields in March pleaded guilty to 29 counts of violating federal hate crime law.

The issue surfaced in a contentious exchange between Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and McGarrity, where McGarrity was pressed on why the 2015 Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, and last year's Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh were treated as ""hate crime incidents"" rather than acts of domestic terrorism.

""That's not correct,"" McGarrity said, pointing out that while the attacks are considered instances of domestic terrorism by the Department of Justice, ""there's no domestic terrorism charge.""

In an emotional exchange on the subject later in the hearing, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-MI, read a death threat letter sent to her and fellow Muslim congresswoman Rep. Ilhan Omar that cited the New Zealand mosque attacks and remarked, ""the only good Muslim is a dead one.""

""How is that not enough to fall under domestic terrorism?"" Tlaib said through tears. ""How come we don't have enough tools right now to pull these people in?""

McGarrity expressed sympathy for Tlaib and urged her to bring her concerns directly to the Department of Justice, after earlier noting he personally would welcome Congress passing a law that makes domestic terrorism a federal crime.

“I will say as a former prosecutor and as a former investigator, I want every tool in the tool box,” McGarrity said."
EPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees,https://thehill.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/446897-epa-sued-for-keeping-scientists-off-of-advisory-committees,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was reportedly sued on Monday by a nonprofit over a directive keeping many scientists off of agency advisory panels, according to Reuters.

The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), alleges that an Oct. 31, 2017, directive from former EPA chief Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittEPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees EPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees Overnight Energy: EPA head accuses media of not reporting agency's achievements | Leaked FDA study finds cancer-linked chemicals in food supply | Wheeler calls Flint water 'safe to drink' MORE overturned decades of EPA practices “for no good reason” and without required public comment.

The NRDC claimed that the directive has been used to remove qualified scientists from the agency's roughly 23 advisory committees, allowing EPA to replace scientific advisers with industry representatives, Reuters reported.

The nonprofit environmental advocacy group seeks to set aside the directive and all decisions that have been based on it.

A spokesperson for the EPA told The Hill it does not comment on pending litigation.

Pruitt's 2017 directive bars anyone who receives EPA grant money from serving on advisory panels, citing a need for the committees to be more independent.

The former EPA chief, who resigned in July 2018 amid a growing number of ethics and spending scandals, argued that serving on a committee like the Science Advisory Board would be a conflict of interest for someone receiving agency money to conduct scientific research.

“We want to ensure that there’s integrity in the process, and that the scientists who are advising us are doing so with not any type of appearance of conflict,"" Pruitt said at the time. ""And when you receive that much money … there’s a question that arises about independence.""

Opponents countered that Pruitt wanted to increase representation from the fossil fuel industry and other Trump administration allies on the influential committees.

Since the directive took effect, representation for regulated industries and their allies has grown on the committees, at the expense of academics and researchers, The Hill reported in February.

A legal challenge to the directive fell short that month.

Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee to the District Court for the District of Columbia, dismissed the lawsuit from public health groups, saying it does not dictate who can be appointed to advisory boards.

The laws and regulations at issue “do not dictate whom administrators must, or even should, appoint to federal advisory committees,” McFadden wrote in a ruling dismissing the case.

“To say that certain individuals may not serve is very different than saying that the rest must serve,"" he wrote. ""Agency heads retain substantial discretion to determine membership on federal advisory committees.”"
‘Trump Baby’ and the Trump robot headline London protests over U.S. president’s visit,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Karla Adam', 'London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom', 'June At Pm']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/baby-trump-and-the-trump-robot-headline-london-protests-against-us-presidents-visit/2019/06/04/93764614-8634-11e9-9d73-e2ba6bbf1b9b_story.html,"A giant blimp of a diaper-clad “Trump Baby” and a talking Trump robot sitting on a toilet were among the most vivid props Tuesday as tens of thousands of protesters descended on central London to register their disapproval of President Trump, who was in the British capital for a three-day state visit.

After a day of pomp and pageantry involving the British royals, Tuesday was a day for politics and protests. Trump had meetings at Downing Street, and protesters were hoping that they were close enough — and loud enough — to be heard.

The road outside 10 Downing Street was sealed off with steel barricades, and there was a heavy police presence.

But nearby, the “Carnival of Resistance” was in full swing in on-off rain.

In a news conference Tuesday with outgoing prime minister Theresa May, Trump dismissed the protests. “Even coming over today, there were thousands of people cheering,” he asserted. “A lot of it is fake news, I have to say.”

He added: “I didn’t see the protesters until just a little while ago. And it was a very, very small group of people put in for political reasons. So it was fake news.”

Activists estimated 75,000 people hit the streets Tuesday — fewer than those at the anti-Trump rally in 2018, which organizers said drew more than 100,000.

But the protesters were vocal, their chants — including “Say it loud, say it clear! Donald Trump’s not welcome here!” and “Donald Trump, shame on you!” — ringing in the air as reporters headed to the news conference.

“We come today because we don’t like the tide of right-wing populism that’s going across the Western world, especially in America and Europe,” said Cat Thorneycroft, 35, an illustrator. “I don’t even necessarily mind that he’s had a state visit, but if he’s going to come, then this is what’s going to happen,” she said, referring to the protesters behind her in Parliament Square.

Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, was among those who addressed the crowds. He condemned Trump’s tweets calling London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a longtime Trump foe on Twitter, a “stone cold loser.” Corbyn said he was “proud that our city has a Muslim mayor.”

Trump also denounced Corbyn, calling him a “negative force.”

The Labour leader also said he would resist any attempts to allow private American companies to take over “our precious, wonderful National Health Service. . . . We will not stand for that.”

Trump tweeted Monday that he had not “seen any protests yet, but I’m sure the Fake News will be working hard to find them.” The main protests were planned for Tuesday.

The world’s most famous helium-filled balloon — the 20-foot-tall blimp depicting a baby Trump holding a cellphone — was back, hovering above the scene in Parliament Square.

Kevin Smith, one of the organizers and “Trump babysitters,” said it was a “very effective way to prick the pomposity and ego of Donald Trump.”

[As Trump’s state visit looms, Britain seems a reluctant host]

Asked whether it wasn’t a rather juvenile form of protest, he said it was “part of a long tradition in Britain of political caricature. It’s not unlike cartoons in a newspaper — it just so happens to be 3-D and floats in the air.”

The organizers of the balloon crowdfunded more than 36,00 pounds ($46,000), which they are giving to groups they describe as “pushing back against the politics of hate and division that are represented by Trump.”

There was also a talking Trump robot that sat on a toilet, saying: “You’re fake news! I’m a very stable genius!”

The British tradition of creating witty — and sometimes rude — placards was on full display. One protester held aloft a sign that read: “British Humour: the gift of a book to an illiterate man — well played Your Majesty.” As part of a customary gift exchange at the start of the visit, Queen Elizabeth II gave Trump a book by Winston Churchill on World War II.

Another man was pushing a shopping cart filled with toilet paper featuring Trump’s face on it. “Come on down to Trafalgar and get your Donald Trump toilet paper,” he said.

Footage posted on social media showed supporters and critics clashing at the rally. In one video, a Trump supporter was surrounded by people angrily shouting “Nazi scum!” before he was pelted with a milkshake.

The protests come a day after a lavish state banquet hosted by the queen at Buckingham Palace.

Bryony Doyle, 23, an illustrator and a nanny protesting in Trafalgar Square, said she was “very pleased” that Trump did not “get the red-carpet treatment when he arrived. I know he went for dinner at Buckingham Palace, but he didn’t stay there,” she said.

[The long and bitter feud between Trump and London Mayor Sadiq Khan]

The Trumps are staying at Winfield House, the residence of the U.S. ambassador in London, but not Buckingham Palace, which would normally be the case. The palace is reportedly undergoing renovations.

“I think with us and our culture there’s only so much we can do without feeling impolite,” Doyle said. “I don’t think the queen could actually say no. I think there’s a limit to what the royals can do without causing too much controversy. But that’s not the case with the public, which is why we are here all day!”

Some wondered whether the protests would have any effect.

Mark Davis, 64, a lawyer from California on vacation, said: “Trump could come here and do virtually anything and there are people back in the States who will support him. They’d think he’s being picked on, or this and that. I don’t think this changes anything. In the States, you’re either for him or against him.”

His wife, Monica Richards, 65, a retired employee of Orange County Superior Court in California, said they were nonetheless excited to be among a throng of “like people who have a great hate for Trump. It’s an opportunity to show our support for the forces who are against him.”

She then unrolled a homemade pink sign that read, “Impeach now.”

"Forget Our Money, Big Tech Has a Monopoly On Our Minds",https://www.theamericanconservative.com,[],,,,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/forget-our-money-big-tech-has-a-monopoly-on-our-minds/,"The Wall Street Journal’s May 31 report that the Justice Department is preparing an antitrust investigation against Google is, in a word, yuge. And The Washington Post’s June 1 report that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will be similarly scrutinizing Amazon is equally yuge.

Whatever one thinks of President Donald Trump, superlatives about size are in order with regard to these investigations—if, that is, one or both of them actually turn into lawsuits. And if even one goes forward, it will likely spell the end of Big Tech hegemony. (Or perhaps, we should say, the end of the current era of tech hegemony. After all, technology is a permanent force, as is the human will to power—and so somewhere in the future, the great wheel will turn yet again.)

We might pause to note that the relationship between the White House and the Justice Department is as tight as, well, the relationship between the 45th president and the 85th attorney general. By contrast, the FTC is an independent regulatory agency, although it’s noteworthy that Trump has appointed all five of the sitting commissioners (two of whom are Democrats).

Some will say, of course, that these investigations are the result of Trump’s personal animus towards Big Tech—he has regularly attacked Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos—combined, perhaps, with conservative concerns about Silicon Valley censorship. Indeed, the argument that Trump’s heavy hand improperly affected DOJ decision making was critical to the defense in another antitrust case concerning AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner in 2016, including the latter’s CNN subsidiary—and the feds lost. (Interestingly, as recently as June 3, Trump was still targeting AT&T and CNN.)

Still, these times have an increasingly progressive tenor—Senator Elizabeth Warren, to name just one top Democrat, has called for antitrust action against Google, Amazon, and other companies, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is definitely no fan of Facebook. So it’s probable that the next Democratic presidential administration, whenever that might come, will uphold the antitrust torch, maybe hold it even higher. In other words, the fate of Big Tech will likely be decided by whether bipartisan support for antitrust supersedes partisan feelings of anti-Trump. As a headline in Bloomberg News put it about one of the companies in the crosshairs, “Google Should Be Afraid. Very Afraid.”

Meanwhile, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, an emerging leader of the new breed of populist Republicans, immediately tweeted his support for the looming antitrust action against Google, calling it “very big news, long overdue.” Indeed, back in 2017, when Hawley was his state’s attorney general, he launched an investigation into Google. As he said at the time: “When a company has access to as much consumer information as Google does, it’s my duty to ensure they are using it appropriately. I will not let Missouri consumers and businesses be exploited by industry giants.”

On June 1, in an interview with NBC News, Hawley went even further: “We should have a discussion about the business model of the social media platforms as they have evolved as an ad-supported business model that is pushing addiction and rewarding addiction.”

Addiction, we have learned, is not just a matter of controlled substances entering our bloodstreams; it’s also a matter of computer-controlled images flickering before our eyes.

Here we might pause to note that while Google (technically Alphabet) might seem to be less of a social media company, it includes YouTube, which is all about videos going viral. And when we consider this headline from The New York Times on June 3, “On YouTube’s Digital Playground, an Open Gate for Pedophiles,” we are reminded that “viral,” as in “virus,” is a bad thing, not a good thing. As for Amazon, it’s now just about everywhere, including its product Alexa, the all-knowing and always listening digital deity.

So Hawley seemed to have all the companies in mind when he wondered aloud whether antitrust is a sufficient remedy for the societal ills caused by social media: “If we broke Facebook up into 50 Facebooks who all pursued the same business model, would our lives, our economy, our society be measurably improved? I don’t know that they would.”

This is an interesting argument. Beyond partisan and ideological concerns about bias, censorship, and electoral manipulation—important as those might be, heartfelt on both sides of the aisle—perhaps the greater concern should be social media’s impact on our minds and on our overall commonweal.

Indeed, if the ultimate concern should be about the screen-driven rewiring of our brains, especially as a kind of fuel for reflexive political correctness as a way of shunting off reality—as this author has argued here, here, and here—then any quantitative change in the size of Big Tech looks to be a lot less important than any qualitative change in the way these platforms actually operate.

In fact, with his skepticism of antitrust by itself, Hawley is echoing, as well as updating, the views of one of his heroes, Theodore Roosevelt. In his day, TR was fully aware of the abuses of the “trusts,” and also of the potential remedy of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. And so while he wasn’t opposed to antitrust, he did believe that when abuses were identified, regulation was preferable to litigation. That is, if a company was found to be doing something inimical to the public interest, it was better simply to enact a rule to stop it, as opposed to filing a lawsuit in the hope of breaking up the offender.

In keeping with that spirit, TR established a regulatory Bureau of Corporations within what was then the Department of Commerce and Labor. (This Bureau of Corporations, we might note, was soon to be spun off into the Federal Trade Commission.) In 1907, Roosevelt explained his thinking about regulation: “The design should be to prevent the abuses incident to the creation of unhealthy and improper combinations, instead of waiting until they are in existence and then attempting to destroy them by civil or criminal proceedings.”

TR was focused on the social damage of corporate predation, which he saw as both an injustice and a political fuse that could be ignited, leading to disastrous consequences. Indeed, as early as 1883, he had warned:

There is a strong and growing feeling of indignation among the people at the actions of these great corporations. It is incumbent upon us to see that this feeling takes a lawful shape. …For the sake of protecting honest capital, we ought to punish, if we legally can, the deed of the dishonest wealthy for fear that some day an uprising might come that will overwhelm innocent and guilty alike.

Today, those Rooseveltian social and political concerns are as valid as ever. For instance, every brick-and-mortar retailer, and every Main Street, has an opinion about Amazon. Yet now there’s also the further matter of the psychological impact of social media. Over the past century, concern was expressed—indeed, sometimes still is expressed—over the impact of earlier media innovations, including radio, television, even comic books. And society developed different legal and regulatory responses, albeit with varying degrees of success.

Yet now, we face perhaps the greatest challenge of all: the impact of contemporary tech on human cognition. And if we need perspective on that challenge, we need only recall Google’s original mission statement—on its website to this day—which declares: “From the beginning, our mission has been to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”

To many, such Promethean ambition seemed—and still seems—pretty cool, not to mention darn convenient. This admiration helps explain why Google has been given so much political grace, such that, in just two decades, it has grown into an almost $800 billion behemoth.

Still, all things must pass. And so, too, nudged along by Uncle Sam, the golden age of Google’s growth will slip into history’s pages—or at least its PDF—to be remembered alongside the heyday of Standard Oil and the halcyon years of Microsoft.

To be sure, these lawsuits will be no slam dunk, and any resolution could be far in the future. The Reagan Justice Department’s successful breakup of the original incarnation of AT&T way back in 1984 was the result of a decade of litigation.

Yet in the meantime, as a reminder of the stakes at hand, it’s revealing that Google’s most famous corporate saying, “Don’t be evil,” was retired in 2018. The backstory behind its decision to delete might not be a legal question. Still, uncovering the answer would tell us much about the company’s corporate heart.

DOJ calls new census allegations a 'baseless attack on the integrity' of department and its employees,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Tammy Kupperman']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/politics/doj-census-allegations/index.html,"(CNN) The Department of Justice on Monday night forcefully disputed an account by the American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause and others that the decision to add a citizenship question to the census was politically motivated.

A Justice Department spokesperson says the allegations that a 2015 study by a Republican redistricting expert played a major role in the request to add a citizenship question to the census are meritless.

In a letter last week, the ACLU, Common Cause and others said they had found ""new evidence"" that the government's true motivation in adding the question was to improve the chances of Republicans.

They pointed to a recently disclosed 2015 study written by Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a Republican redistricting expert, who wrote that using ""citizen voting age"" population as the redistricting population base would be ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.""

The challengers say the new information shows Hofeller played a more significant role in the decision to add the citizenship question than has been disclosed and that his study reveals the true motive behind the administration's decision to add the question. Meanwhile, challengers in a separate case in Maryland, citing the Hofeller evidence, asked a federal judge on Tuesday to reopen their case to reconsider whether the Trump administration sought to intentionally discriminate against Latinos and immigrants.

Warren calls for replacing Commerce Department in jobs plan,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-commerce-department-in-latest-policy-proposal,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Tuesday called for doing away with the Department of Commerce and several other smaller agencies, and replacing them with a new department responsible for creating new jobs.

Warren, who currently sits in the middle of the pack in a crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders, wrote in a post on Medium that this new department would have “the sole responsibility to create and defend quality, sustainable American job.”

“The new Department — the Department of Economic Development — will replace the Commerce Department, subsume other agencies like the Small Business Administration and the Patent and Trademark Office, and include research and development programs, worker training programs, and export and trade authorities like the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,” Warren wrote.

She added: “The new Department will have a single goal: creating and defending good American jobs.”

2020 DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT BIDEN AT CALIFORNIA CONVENTION

Warren’s new proposal is part of her ""economic patriotism"" agenda – one of a series of ambitious policy proposals that have become a trademark of her campaign – and comes ahead of her first campaign tour of Michigan. The state, which was once a Democratic stronghold, went to President Trump in the 2016 presidential election – largely thanks to Trump’s appeal with blue-collar workers in the state’s manufacturing base.

Warren’s visit to Detroit and Lansing, and her economic proposal, are both aimed squarely at Midwesterners who have watched millions of manufacturing jobs disappear in recent decades.

“My Administration will pursue fundamental, structural changes in our government’s approach to the economy, finally putting American workers and middle-class prosperity ahead of multinational profits and Wall Street bonuses,” she wrote on Medium.

The Trump campaign mocked Warren's call for ""economic patriotism"" as a recycled Obama idea.

But it's also unclear how Warren would turn some of her most costly policies into reality, especially if Democrats don't win back control of the Senate in next year's elections. The last time Congress approved a significant new Cabinet-level department was 2002, when the Department of Homeland Security was created. And the $2 trillion price tag of Warren's clean energy manufacturing plan would prompt plenty of Republican critics.

That plank of her agenda is directly tied to the Green New Deal, a framework for dramatically cutting the nation's dependence on fossil fuels that's championed by rising liberal star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

WARREN THE LATEST 2020 DEMOCRAT TO LAND ON TIME MAGAZINE COVER

As outlined in her Green Manufacturing Plan for America – another policy proposal she released on Tuesday – Warren would pay for her program with proceeds from her proposed new tax on corporate profits and by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies and rolling back some provisions of the GOP's 2017 tax law.

“According to the independent Moody’s analysis of my plan, nearly its entire cost is covered by my Real Corporate Profits Tax — a tax that ensures that the very largest and most profitable American corporations don’t pay zero corporate income tax — ending federal oil and gas subsidies, and closing corporate tax loopholes that promote moving good jobs overseas,” Warren wrote.

Warren is betting that her campaign pledges will power her forward with Midwestern swing voters who are open to deserting Trump. Her clean manufacturing plan comes hours after another Democratic contender, former Vice President Joe Biden, released his own Green New Deal-linked agenda, which would spend $1.7 trillion over 10 years.

Biden is perceived as a threat to Trump in the Midwest, but Michigan Democrats see ample room for Warren to break through in a state that's twice elected women to its highest office. And although Warren burnished her reputation as an advocate for the working class by criticizing the bailout of Wall Street banks while serving as a watchdog of the government's 2008 financial rescue, she spoke more favorably at that time of the agreement that spent billions of dollars to keep U.S. automakers afloat, a position she is sure to highlight in Michigan.

""Wages have not grown, and people look at layoffs being imminent or threatened, not just in the auto industry,"" said former Michigan Democratic Party chairman, Mark Brewer. ""They're looking for somebody on their side, who understands their problems. Why Trump had such appeal in 2016 was that he tapped into that economic anxiety.""

"Illinois Corn Planting Is Not Even Halfway Finished, USDA Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/illinois-corn-planting-is-not-even-halfway-finished-usda-says,"DES MOINES, Iowa — U.S. corn farmers are still trying to get to the three-quarters planted mark, continuing their slowest pace on record.

Corn

In its Crop Progress Report Monday, the USDA pegged U.S. corn planting at 67% complete, behind the 96% five-year average.

Some in the trade expected a completion rating of 70%. This would suggest 27 million acres of corn will be planted the first time in the month of June, and possibly 1 to 2 million acres of corn will need to be replanted in June, according to Kluis Advisors’ records.

As of Sunday, Iowa farmers had 80% of that state’s corn crop planted vs. a 99% five-year average. Illinois farmers have 45% of their corn seeded, behind a 98% five-year average. Indiana has 31% planted vs. a 94% five-year average. In the eastern Corn Belt, Nebraska farmers have 88% of their corn planted vs. a 98% five-year average.

Also, 19% of the U.S. corn has 46% emerged vs. a 84% five-year average.

Soybeans

In its report, the USDA pegged the U.S. soybean planting completion rate at 39% vs. a 79% five-year average.

Iowa has 41% of its soybean crop in the ground compared with an 89% five-year average. Illinois has 21% of its crop seeded, compared with an 84% five-year average. Indiana soybean growers have 17% of their crop in the ground vs. an 80% five-year average.

Also, 19% of the U.S. soybean crop has emerged vs. 56% five-year average.

The NRDC said the Oct. 31, 2017 directive from Wheeler’s predecessor Scott Pruitt upended decades of EPA practices “for no good reason” and without required public comment.

It said the agency has since used the directive to remove qualified scientists from its roughly 23 advisory committees, freeing it to replace them with industry representatives.

Monday’s complaint seeks to set aside the directive and all decisions based on it.

The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Pruitt’s directive barred anyone receiving EPA grant money from serving on the advisory panels, citing a need for the panels to be more independent.

“Whatever science comes out of EPA, shouldn’t be political science,” Pruitt said at the time.

The directive was welcomed at the time by conservatives opposed to excessive regulation and condemned by Democrats and environmental groups.

U.S. President Donald Trump has tried to roll back what he considers burdensome environmental regulations to make the government more friendly to drilling, manufacturing and mining businesses.

The NRDC said it had legal standing to sue because some of its members include scientists who would have to forgo grants or professional opportunities under the directive.

The case is Natural Resources Defense Council Inc v. EPA et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-05174."
A Brief History of Old Guys Who Became President of the United States,http://nymag.com,['Ed Kilgore'],06-05-2019,2019,6,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/age-and-the-american-presidency-a-brief-history.html,"Trump has replaced Reagan as the oldest president in U.S. history.

In 2020, at least one of the two major-party nominees is going to be the oldest in U.S. history, since Donald Trump, at 74, will be a record-setter (beating out Ronald Reagan ’84, Bob Dole ’96 and John McCain ’08). There’s a decent chance, however, that the 2020 contest will feature the two oldest nominees ever, if one of the two current Democratic front runners, Joe Biden (who will be 77 on Election Day) or Bernie Sanders (who will be 79) is nominated in Milwaukee next July.

Age hasn’t been a big issue in discussions of any of these esteemed gentlemen so far. Trump is so unusual in so many ways that his calendar age seems almost incidental. Sanders’s strong youth following has probably insulated him from some age-related inquiries. And it’s unclear whether voters really know how old any of these people are in the first place. But given the evidence that some voters are concerned about age, you have to figure some of Biden’s and Sanders’s Democratic rivals might find ways to hint at it (e.g., lots of talk about a “new generation” of leadership, or “fresh thinking,” etc.). An incident that suggests an age-related disability could raise eyebrows and fears, as it did for Dole and for Hillary Clinton.

The age of 2020 candidates may help create the impression that there is an upward trend in the age of presidents (or would-be presidents), which would make sense given steadily increasing life expectancies over the decades and centuries. And indeed, two of the three septuagenarian presidents, Reagan and Trump, were in office in the last 40 years. (Eisenhower, who at the end of his presidency was very briefly as old as Trump was when he began his, is the third.)

But actually, if you separate the 45 presidents into three chronological groups of 15, you get a surprise: The oldest is the first group of 15 presidents, from Washington through Buchanan (1789–1861), which averaged 57.1 years of age upon inauguration. The last 15, from Hoover through Trump (1929–present) averaged 56.3 years of age upon inauguration. (In case you were wondering, the middle group, from Lincoln through Coolidge, was by far the most youthful, averaging 51.6 years at inauguration, with nary a one taking office over 60).

What’s really changed is the relationship of presidential age to that of the relevant (for everyone other than Barack Obama) white male population. Statistics are spotty for the early years of the republic, and relatively high infant-mortality rates skew them, but average age expectancy at the turn of the 19th century was around 40. It was under 45 when William Henry Harrison took office at the age of 68 in 1840. It didn’t hit 50 until the early years of the 20th century. It passed 60 in the 1930s, and 70 around 1980. So most recent presidents were not as old compared to the voters who chose them. Today Bernie Sanders’s age is right at the life expectancy of white men. Compared to those early presidents, he and Biden really don’t stand out.

But just because Americans are living longer doesn’t necessarily mean they are immune from physical and cognitive decline, and that’s the real reason there might be some practical ceiling on presidential age, as I discussed in an earlier piece on the subject of presidential candidates who would turn 80 during their first term:

There are certainly octogenarians who are physically fit, sharp as a tack, and as competent at work as any whippersnapper. But it’s no secret that when people, particularly men, get to that age, the risk of mortality rises significantly (a 75-year-old man has a 22 percent chance of dying within six years), and along with it the possibility of cognitive deterioration (an estimated 15 percent of people between the ages of 80 and 84 suffer from some form of dementia). If voters fear any of that happening, it could (particularly with some encouragement from the kind of intensely hostile conservative media that Sanders and Biden were spared in 2016) affect their electability in ways that are not easy to anticipate in scope and power. And even more obviously, if a 77- or 79-year-old candidate suffers from any real or perceived impairment, the issue could take over the campaign to an extent that makes Hillary Clinton’s email problem look minor.

So from a historical perspective, Trump, Sanders, and Biden (and Elizabeth Warren, who will become a septuagenarian later this month) aren’t too old at all as compared to the rest of the population. From a health point of view, it’s hard to say if they are riskier propositions than younger pols. There is the cautionary tale of Reagan, whom many observers thought was showing signs of serious cognitive impairment during his second term. On the other hand, another president who was clearly impaired, Woodrow Wilson, was only 62 when he suffered a debilitating stroke, and three presidents (excluding those who were assassinated) never made it out of their 50s (and a fourth, the physically vigorous Teddy Roosevelt, barely did). So it’s always going to be a matter of individual capacities and health conditions.

If older-than-ever presidents really do become the wave of the future, it does suggest that the current trend of taking vice-presidential nominations seriously — and not simply awarding them to achieve ideological or geographic balance — is a good idea. “Accidental” presidents John Tyler and Andrew Johnson were calamities for their party and (arguably) their country, and Chet Arthur might have been had he not liberated himself from the political bosses who had owned him. The decision of Democratic leaders to substitute Harry Truman for Henry Wallace as veep in 1944 based on their justified fears about FDR’s health had enormous consequences. If the Donkey Party does nominate a 2020 presidential candidate who would require a raging fire of birthday candles, the second spot on the ticket should be occupied by someone who is more than a ticket-balancer. And if one of them wins and thrives, we can begin thinking about a “ceiling” for candidates that’s even higher."

Happy 8th Birthday to MyPlate!

Happy Birthday, MyPlate! Eight years ago, MyPlate was introduced as a symbol of the five food groups that serve as the building blocks for healthy eating. This year, we are encouraged to Start Simple with MyPlate, which provides healthy inspiration and tips that are easily incorporated into busy lives and fit personal preferences, health goals, style, and budget. Learn more and join in the #MyPlateChallenge at: ChooseMyPlate.gov/StartSimple.

In honor of MyPlate’s 8th birthday, we are excited to celebrate with nutrition education gifts for you. The staff here at the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) have come together to provide 8 ways we Start Simple with MyPlate. We hope you enjoy these real-life ideas from our CNPP family:

Making dinner after long workdays can seem like a chore. As a time saver, I always wash and cut my vegetables, as well as marinate my favorite protein foods right when I get home from the grocery store. That way, I’m one-step ahead. (Erica, Nutritionist) With 3 young kids and a variety of activities, snacks have become a necessity when we leave the house. I portion healthy foods into small containers the night before so that they're ready to grab–n–go when we need them. (Corey, Nutritionist) I’m a huge sports fan and enjoy fresh veggies when I watch games. Grape tomatoes, mini sweet peppers, sugar snap peas, and baby carrots are virtually prep-free and help me meet my vegetable goals, even on game day. (Lisa, Nutritionist) Sometimes making balanced meals with all food groups for one person is not easy. To help, I make large batches of dinners such as protein foods (pork loin), grains (wild rice), vegetables (roasted zucchini) and fruit (baked apples). Then, I portion my own “meal kits” for easy “planned over” dinners served with a glass of milk. (Barb, Nutritionist) Now that my kids are grown, I no longer have a grocery list of “favorites” but still like to have a variety of produce. This is easy as ABC -- Apples, Bananas, and Carrots. I always have these on hand for quick and easy snacks. (Janie, Graphic Information Specialist) As an avid traveler, I pack a cooler of sandwiches, water, and healthy snacks for road trips. This avoids the need (or temptation) to stop on the road which helps make sure I eat something healthy and saves money. (Dave, Nutritionist) My boyfriend and I love trying new restaurants on the weekends. We focus on ordering heathy foods cooked in new ways. This gets us inspired with different ideas when eating in. (Hannah, Visual Designer) Every Wednesday, after work I ride my bike to the farmers market down the street. In addition to picking up tasty, local produce I get to fit in some physical activity too. (Melissa, Nutritionist)

Immigrant kids are dying in DHS custody. Pediatricians can help.,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Colleen Kraft', 'Wei-Huan Chen', 'Staff Writer', 'Brittany Britto', 'Maddy Falivene', 'Jordan Blum', 'Chris Tomlinson']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/Immigrant-kids-are-dying-in-DHS-custody-13937192.php,"As a pediatrician, before I begin an exam, I talk with the parents and children about what’s going on in their lives. The 16-year-old patients I care for in my practice in Southern California are starting to drive, starting to date, to talk about colleges. Their eyes are on the horizon, brimming with life and expectation of the future.

Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez was also a 16-year-old boy, but that is where the similarities end. Carlos did not get to dream of any of the rosy milestones my patients share with me. He simply dreamed of living in a land where he might be safe, free from the threat of violence, and with the possibility of a brighter future.

Instead, he died alone, without family, from an illness that is usually treatable in the U.S. He died in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the sixth child to die in nine months in the custody of the federal government. More children will continue to die if we do not make immediate, permanent changes to the way we treat them when they come here.

Carlos and countless children like him are put in DHS-run facilities in which they are forced to sleep on cement floors, where the lights are on 24-7 and the temperatures are frigid. Staff confiscate and destroy medications to treat chronic conditions such as type 1 diabetes, asthma and seizure disorders, and most of the children have no access to pediatricians.

No child should be subjected to these facilities. The American Academy of Pediatrics has made repeated offers to assist in providing medical care, to review screening and treatment protocols, and to make processing of children more child-friendly. Our pleas have gone unheeded.

In direct opposition to AAP recommendations, DHS leadership and a panel they appointed to look at children and families in custody have argued as recently as May 22 — the week Carlos died — that they should be allowed to detain children with their parents for weeks, months or years, through a legislative change to alter the Flores Settlement Agreement. During his testimony before the Senate Homeland Security committee, Acting Secretary McAleenan said that while the agency wants to move children as quickly as possible out of border-patrol custody, “detention for a child is for the safety of the child.”

That’s false. A review of the evidence shows that no amount of time in detention is safe for a child. Even short amounts of time in detention are harmful. When children are detained, they experience physical and emotional stress, placing them at risk for serious short- and long-term health problems. Congress must immediately reject the proposal to extend the time children and families spend in detention.

For children under 18, conditions in DHS custody are not only unsafe but potentially deadly. This agency has proven repeatedly that it cannot care for children. Security personnel are not medical professionals. They play an important role in cyber security and preventing illegal drugs and weapons from entering our country; they should not be charged with meeting the basic needs of children.

Children are not just small adults, and their signs of illness are subtle. They need providers who can recognize the differences between a mildly ill child and a seriously ill child.

America needs to stop detaining and separating children from their parents and stop threatening the community of family members, caregivers and sponsors by putting their housing, financial security, and immigration status in jeopardy. Most of all, our country needs to ensure that no child ever again dies on our watch.

When I send a 16-year-old patient with influenza home from my California practice, he has a parent to care for him, a bed to sleep in, a home in which to recover, and medication to ease the symptoms. He has a pediatrician his parent can call if things get worse.

Carlos did not have any of those comforts. I think about him every day.

Until I see this inequity between immigrant children like Carlos and my patients resolve, until I see our government pursuing policies based on science and designed with compassion, I will continue speaking out. I do so for Carlos, Jakelin, Felipe, and all the other immigrant children who have died in our country, striving for a better life.

Kraft, MD, MBA, FAAP, is the immediate past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics."

“While Congress has pursued comprehensive, bipartisan legislation, the State Department has plowed ahead in its plan to create a bureau with a much narrower mission focused only on cybersecurity,” Engel told The Hill in a statement. “This move flies in the face of repeated warnings from Congress and outside experts that our approach to cyber issues needs to elevate engagement on economic interests and internet freedoms together with security.”

Engel added that the hold on the notification would stand until “the Secretary of State directs his staff to work constructively with Congress to establish a bureau that ensures the Department is able to advance the full range of U.S. interests.”

A spokesperson for the State Department confirmed the agency had “notified Congress regarding its plans to establish the new CSET bureau” but did not comment further.

McCaul, meanwhile, expressed a more positive view of the State Department's move. A committee spokesperson for McCaul told The Hill that he ""looks forward to working with the Administration and his colleagues in the House and Senate to legislate the best possible cyber structure and mission set.""

The State Department’s notification to Congress of its intent to establish CSET, obtained by The Hill on Tuesday, lays out the key staffing and coordination plan for the proposed bureau.

The agency wrote that CSET will “consolidate resources focused on cyberspace security and the security-related aspects of emerging technologies.”

In addition, the State Department’s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs’ focus on “privacy aspects” of cybersecurity and emerging technologies will be increased.

“In considering the growing national security challenge presented by cyber space and emerging technologies, the Department has determined that its efforts in these areas are not appropriately aligned or resourced,” the State Department wrote in justifying these developments.

As part of the establishment of CSET, a “coordinator and ambassador-at-large” would be appointed to lead U.S. international efforts on cyberspace.

Christopher Painter, the State Department coordinator for cyber issues from 2011 through 2017, tweeted Tuesday that while he thinks the agency’s move to prioritize cybersecurity is positive, he's unsure about the approach.

“Great that State is finally re-elevating cyber,” Painter tweeted. “Its a critical issue & needs US leadership. Not so great that they have chosen stove-piping over a coordinated approach.”"
The Trump Administration Might Be Too Incompetent to Undermine Environmental Regulations,https://slate.com,['Richard L. Revesz'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/trump-administration-cant-actually-undermine-environmental-regulation-too-incompetent.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Nivellen77/iStock / Getty Images Plus and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

The Trump administration appears to be entering an alarming new stage of its attack on environmental protection. For the past two-plus years, it has used a retail approach, targeting Obama-era environmental rules one by one, trying to suspend compliance deadlines. This strategy has been met with limited success—more than 90 percent of the administration’s deregulatory efforts are being defeated in court, mostly due to sloppy agency actions. But the Environmental Protection Agency has recently decided it will undertake a new approach in its effort to launch a wholesale attack on environmental regulation—it will change the way it collects and processes data, to provide better justification to dismantle the analytical foundation of its rules. These moves fly in the face of established economics and health sciences, and are inconsistent with the practices of administrations of both parties over four decades. The consequences for the environment and public health could be disastrous. But even as this approach might be more deliberate, these actions are unlikely to survive court challenges as well.

The EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards.

In the coming weeks, the EPA plans to finalize vastly weakened versions of two important climate rules: a regulation controlling greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and standards to limit emissions from vehicles. The draft proposals for the Trump administration’s revisions to each of these rules were rife with analytical problems. In the power plant rule revision, the agency exercised its discretion in a manner that imposed billions of dollars’ worth of net harm on the American public. And the vehicle rule analysis is justified by claims about improved safety that rest on a wholly implausible and discredited economic analysis: It assumes that people will buy more—as opposed to fewer—vehicles as they become more expensive. These failures are likely to reappear in the final rules as well, because the administration would be unable to justify its chosen actions without mangling the underlying analysis. As a result of these analytical failures, the rollbacks will be highly vulnerable to legal challenges and could add to the administration’s string of court losses.

Perhaps sensing urgency as these losses mount and the president’s term slips away, the EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards. The agency has taken steps to begin an assault on the core foundations of environmental rulemaking, signaling that it plans to alter the building blocks of the economic analysis that underlies its rules. This new EPA attack features three dirty tricks that would erase the bulk of the benefits of critical environmental policies. These benefits—tens of thousands of averted deaths and hundreds of thousands of averted hospitalizations for strokes, heart attacks, and respiratory ailments—would, of course, still be there. The administration’s analysis would just pretend otherwise.

One EPA method involves calling into question the benefit of reducing pollution below the level of the national ambient air quality standards. Since the late 1970s, every administration—Republican and Democratic—has acknowledged that more stringent standards would provide greater health benefits. But earlier this month, William Wehrum, who oversees air quality for the EPA, brazenly cast doubt on this long-established, science-based approach, telling the New York Times that counting these benefits in regulatory analyses “doesn’t make any sense” because the standards are set at “safe” levels, thereby implying that there can be no benefits at concentrations below the ones that the EPA deems to be “safe.”

The problem with this understanding is that the Supreme Court has made clear that “the word ‘safe’ does not mean ‘risk-free.’ ” And, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which hears all the challenges to national ambient air quality standards, explained that in setting these standards, EPA must “ ‘select … standard levels that … reduce risks sufficiently to protect public health’ ” even while recognizing that “ ‘a zero-risk standard is [not] possible.’ ”

Wehrum should know better, or at least, he did not too long ago. He had previously served under President George W. Bush in senior positions in EPA’s air office between 2001 and 2007. During that time, in setting national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and for ozone, the EPA acknowledged that significantly higher benefits would accrue to the American people if the agency set the standards at levels more stringent that the ones it ultimately chose. The significant concern with this approach is that it will pave the way for the EPA to support laxer standards without having to acknowledge that there is a cost to human life in doing so.

A second EPA trick involves concealing “co-benefits”—the indirect (and often enormous) benefits that result when a regulation reduces pollutants besides the ones being directly targeted by a particular regulation. EPA has launched an attack on co-benefits most directly as part of a revision to a finding related to a major mercury pollution rule—it’s trying to argue that the $37 billion to $90 billion in health co-benefits resulting from reductions in harmful particulate matter pollution don’t exist. If the administration’s goal is to obscure the value of environmental rules, undermining co-benefits will certainly help.

Co-benefits are so universally accepted as a worthwhile thing to consider that even the Trump EPA’s own handpicked Science Advisory Board recently highlighted the importance of considering them. Furthermore, a landmark guidance document on regulatory analysis issued by the Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush explicitly requires the consideration of indirect benefits, though the EPA has consistently taken co-benefits into account since the Reagan administration. Courts have also ruled that the indirect costs of regulations must be considered, so ignoring indirect benefits would create a lopsided and unjustifiable analysis. Indeed, counting indirect effects when they are negative but ignoring them when they are positive is the embodiment of the type of arbitrary and capricious conduct that the law categorically prohibits. But the Trump EPA now wants to make this the norm.

The EPA’s final dirty trick involves questioning foundational scientific studies on the harmful health impacts of particulate pollution. The detrimental health effects of particulate matter emissions are exceptionally well-documented. Two foundational studies performed in the 1990s found that people in cities with the highest levels of these pollutants were dying two years earlier than those in the least-polluted cities. The results were independently verified by two groups of outside researchers, and these studies have helped inform several major air pollution regulations. But an EPA rule proposed last year would bar the consideration of studies like these, even though they are widely regarded as state-of-the-art, because their individual patient health data cannot be shared publicly, because of patient confidentiality rules. The administration’s approach would make it virtually impossible for regulatory policy to rely on epidemiological studies, a science-denying approach that is unlikely to find a receptive ear in the courts.

During the retail phase of the Trump administration’s attack on environmental rules, the EPA cut corners, which led to most of its actions being overturned in court. This new wholesale attack on environmental rulemaking is far more pernicious than the last. The Trump administration is actively trying to undermine and minimize science that has served as a universal baseline for decades. But once again, it’s pursuing its case sloppily, which means the courts are likely to still see through these dirty tricks and stop them before they have a massively negative impact on public health."
2 more Alabama cities selected for Department of Justice violent crime initiative,https://www.al.com,"['Carol Robinson', 'Crobinson Al.Com']",06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/06/2-more-alabama-cities-selected-for-department-of-justice-violent-crime-initiative.html,"Two more Alabama cities have been selected to take part in a Department of Justice initiative aimed at reducing violent crime nationwide.

The National Public Safety Partnership was launched in 2017 in response to President Trump's directive to reduce crime and improve public safety. Then- Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the National Public Safety Partnership, an alliance of local and federal law enforcement agencies coordinating with community organizations to reduce violent crime in areas long plagued by it. The Attorney General selected Birmingham as one of the initial 12 PSP sites.

On Monday, Attorney General William P. Barr announced 10 more cities, including Anniston and Oxford. To be considered for selection, a site must have sustained levels of violence that far exceed the national average and demonstrate a commitment to reducing crime. Cities must also display compliance with federal immigration requirements.

In addition to Anniston, and Oxford, other sites announced Monday are: Anchorage, Alaska; Davenport, Iowa; Wichita, Kansas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio, Amarillo, Texas and Harris County, Texas.

In a DOJ press release, Barr said the Public Safety Partnership provides a framework for enhancing federal support of state, local and tribal law enforcement officials and prosecutors as they aggressively investigate and pursue violent criminals, specifically those involved in gun crime, drug trafficking and gang violence.

“The Public Safety Partnership is a successful program that directs federal law enforcement resources to the cities where they can have the greatest impact,"" Barr said in a prepared statement. ""These resources help police departments to diagnose where crime is highest—and why—and to find, arrest and prosecute criminals. Several participating cities have already seen dramatic reductions in violent crime over the past two years. As we expand this program to 10 more cities across America, we are determined to replicate that success.”

Birmingham's Public Safety Partnership building alliances for safer communities The task force has been instrumental in identifying the worst violent offenders in the area for arrest and prosecution.

Northern District of Alabama U.S. Attorney Jay Town said the partnership provides data-drive resources to assist law enforcement in removing the habitual offenders from the southeast side of the northern district. ““Our collective goal is simply to reduce crime, especially violent crime, in Anniston, Oxford, and surrounding areas. My office, local and federal law enforcement, and the Department of Justice are fully committed to facilitating the strategies, training, and technical assistance to do just that,’’ Town said. “We have prison beds already reserved for the alpha criminals in Calhoun County…and we are coming.”

To be considered for selection, a site must have sustained levels of violence that far exceed the national average and demonstrate a commitment to reducing crime. Cities must also display compliance with federal immigration requirements.

More than 30 cities have taken part in the Public Safety Partnership. The primary participating Justice Department components include the Office of Justice Programs, Office on Violence Against Women, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, FBI, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Marshals Service.

“We are excited to have the DOJ working with us in conjunction with the East Metro Area Crime Center to reduce gun crimes in our region and to reduce overall crime,’’ said Oxford Police Chief Bill Partridge. “This will help the entire region in reducing crime.”"
State Department says it is now requiring social media info from 'most' visa applicants,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/02/politics/state-department-social-media-visa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The State Department has begun requesting ""most"" US visa applicants provide information on their social media accounts, a department official said in a statement.

The move was expected following an announcement in March of last year that outlined plans to require nearly all US visa applicants to submit their social media handles and other information.

The State Department statement over the weekend said the forms for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants had been updated ""to request additional information, including social media identifiers.""

According to the official's statement, the move is a result of a memorandum issued by President Donald Trump in 2017 on ""vetting"" for people coming to the US and a provision of an executive order from around the same time that sought to block entry to the US for people from several majority-Muslim countries, which included a provision on vetting standards.

CNN previously reported that the change was expected to affect around 15 million people.

Trump, who met the queen at Windsor Castle last year, is the 12th president she has encountered. The queen did not meet just one since taking the throne in 1952.

Over seven decades, Elizabeth diplomatically thanked a president who cloyingly called her a ""fairy princess"" and danced with another after dinner in the Rose Garden.

Between horseback riding and scone recipes, she also built relationships with Britain's most powerful ally. The following is a look back at some of her encounters.

Harry Truman

Queen Elizabeth's first presidential meeting occurred in October 1951, when she was a 25-year-old princess. The future monarch was greeted at National Airport in Virginia by President Harry Truman, and they shared the back seat of a convertible riding to Washington.

At dinner, Truman offered an awkward compliment. ""When I was a little boy, I read about a fairy princess, and there she is,"" Truman said, gesturing.

Elizabeth graciously responded: ""I thank you very much, Mr. President. I propose a toast to the President of the United States.""

Dwight Eisenhower

Elizabeth became figurehead of the waning British Empire in February 1952. President Eisenhower took office a year later, but they did not meet until his second term.

In 1957, Eisenhower, the former supreme Allied commander in Europe, hosted a state dinner at the White House wearing the British Order of Merit medal presented to him by Elizabeth's father George VI.

After hosting the Eisenhowers at Balmoral Castle in 1959, Elizabeth wrote Eisenhower a note on Buckingham Palace stationery. The 33-year-old mother of two shared her drop-scone recipe, advising the president she reduced the flour and milk if making fewer servings.

""I have also tried using golden syrup or treacle instead of only sugar and that can be very good, too,"" she wrote.

John F. Kennedy

President Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline had dinner with the queen at Buckingham Palace in June 1961, after a two-day summit in Vienna with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.

A crowd of Londoners broke through a police line following the dinner and surrounded the first lady's car to look at her. The president was traveling in a separate vehicle that departed earlier.

Like Eisenhower, Kennedy had a wartime connection to Britain. His father was U.S. ambassador in London from 1938 to 1940, at first advocating appeasement of the Nazis, before resigning shortly after their occupation of France.

Richard Nixon

President Lyndon B. Johnson never met the queen. But President Nixon met her many times, usually for lunch.

As vice president, Nixon escorted Elizabeth down the U.S. Capitol steps following a 1957 lunch. In 1958, he and the queen chatted during a war memorial in London.

Nixon as president braved anti-Vietnam War protesters to lunch with the queen at Buckingham Palace in 1969, before joining the queen in 1970 for lunch at the more secluded English country house Chequers, north of London.

The queen's meal at Chequers was called ""unprecedented"" by journalists who noted it was the first known meal taken by a king or queen at the rural getaway for prime ministers.

Gerald Ford

Queen Elizabeth visited Washington for the second time as monarch in July 1976, and found herself treated to an outdoor dinner in the Rose Garden, followed by dancing with President Ford in the emptied-out state dining room.

The summer night dinner was described as beautiful, but soured by jokes by Bob Hope, who made the crowd uncomfortable recounting his interaction with a top hat one night in the Lincoln Bedroom.

A columnist speculated, however, that she may have been bored. ""Nobody but the Fords and the Rockefellers would talk to her, and nobody but Jerry Ford would dance with her,"" wrote Sally Quinn in the Washington Post.

The trip apparently irked the queen because the Secret Service forced her to use a specific limo, resulting in graceless flashes of leg as she exited.

Jimmy Carter

President Carter joined a 51-year-old Queen Elizabeth and six other world leaders for dinner in 1977 at Buckingham Palace.

The dinner coincided with the third annual G-7 summit of the world's leading capitalist powers.

Carter, a farmer from Georgia known for his modesty, posed for a photo with the queen and Prince Phillip. Carter wore a clownishly large black bow tie, poorly matching the one worn by the queen's spouse.

During the same visit, Carter breached protocol by kissing the Queen’s mother Elizabeth, widow of George VI, on the lips. The Queen Mother, who died in 2002 aged 101, snapped: ""Nobody has done that since my husband died."" She later commented: ""I took a sharp step backwards – not quite far enough.""

Ronald Reagan

President Reagan and Queen Elizabeth bonded over a love of horseback riding at Windsor Castle in 1982, and the pair had a notably friendly relationship.

During a 1983 trip to the United States, Reagan and the queen stuffed an itinerary with social events. The two planned to ride horses at Reagan's California ranch, but due to rain had to stay indoors for a taco lunch. First lady Nancy Reagan then sailed to San Francisco with the queen, before Reagan hosted a large state dinner. The day after, the queen threw a yacht party to celebrate the Reagans' 31st wedding anniversary.

Reagan would see the queen twice more as president — in 1984 and 1988 — during trips to London.

George H.W. Bush

President Bush visited London three times while in office, and Queen Elizabeth visited Washington once, in 1991.

During a White House state dinner, the queen praised Bush's role in the recently concluded Gulf War, in which a U.S.-led coalition reimposed an absolute monarchy in Kuwait.

""You led not with bombast but with what is called 'three o'clock in the morning courage,'"" the queen told Bush.

Bill Clinton

President Clinton hobnobbed with the queen during several visits to London, but she never paid him a visit in Washington.

Their first meeting came in 1994 — the same year as palace officials denied as ""complete nonsense"" Trump's public claim that the queen's son Prince Charles had joined Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.

During Clinton's final meeting with the queen in 2000, Clinton chatted about his time golfing with her other son, Prince Andrew.

On his way back to Washington, Clinton reminisced to reporters aboard Air Force One, saying that the 74-year-old queen's hair had gone white, but she had ""youthful eyes.""

""She has these baby blue eyes — just piercing,"" Clinton recalled.

George W. Bush

President Bush also visited with the queen during several visits to England, and she returned to the U.S. for her most recent official trip in 2007 to mark the 400th anniversary of English colonization.

The gaffe-prone Bush suggested during a welcoming speech that the elderly queen was 230 years old — living at the time of the American Revolution.

""She gave me a look that only a mother could give a child,"" Bush recounted, making light of the slip over dinner.

Barack Obama

President Obama gifted the queen an iPod loaded with audio of his speeches during their first meeting in 2009, drawing widespread mockery. Michelle Obama was criticized for touching the queen on her back.

Obama made a safer choice in 2016, when for the queen's 90th birthday he gave her a photo album documenting her visits with U.S. presidents."
Jason Chaffetz: Lawbreaking FBI leaker must be prosecuted – Justice Department fails to do so,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jason Chaffetz', 'Jason Chaffetz Is A Fox News Contributor Who Was The Chairman Of The U.S. House Oversight Committee When He Served As A Representative Utah. He Is The Author Of']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jason-chaffetz-justice-department-leakers,"While the predictable news conference with Special Counsel Robert Mueller made headlines this week for repeating what we already knew, a bigger story from the Department of Justice broke that got far too little attention.

In a Wednesday report released by the Inspector General for the Department of Justice, we learned that the OIG was able to identify a former deputy assistant director at the FBI who violated the law by leaking sealed court documents to the media, engaging in repeated unauthorized contacts with journalists, and accepting a gift from the media.

BARR SAYS DOJ HAS 'MULTIPLE LEAK' PROBES UNDERWAY

We already knew leaking and unauthorized media contacts were a cultural and systemic problem at the FBI. A June 2018 OIG Report revealed the extent of the practice and provided a graphic illustration:

Although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed. We identified numerous FBI employees, at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media, who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters. The large number of FBI employees who were in contact with journalists during this time period impacted our ability to identify the sources of leaks.

But this week, we learned the OIG actually has identified one of the sources and suggested the allegations were supported by ""a preponderance of evidence."" Though that is certainly newsworthy, the real news was the Justice Department response. Officials mysteriously, though not surprisingly, declined to prosecute one of their own.

Creating new laws for theJustice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

These are serious allegations against a very senior FBI official. How can the department not take action when there is direct evidence in hand? This is someone who deliberately and illegally disclosed sensitive information from sealed court filings. If the Justice Department looks the other way, what message does that send to the rest of the FBI? What better way to signal to the entire federal law enforcement apparatus that laws and rules are optional?

Unfortunately, we routinely have people at DOJ who put their thumb on the scale to impact politics. It's obviously part of the culture fostered by the two previous FBI directors, Robert Mueller and James Comey. They have both shown political animus and bias toward President Trump.

Comey himself released sealed information, likely for a political purposes. Mueller this week left no doubt of his own animus toward the president. No wonder the American people have lost faith in our federal law enforcement.

Not only is there no penalty for violating the law, there may actually be an incentive for doing so. For leakers with partisan motivations, the chance to impact an election may outweigh the risk of an unlikely prosecution.

If we want to instill confidence in the system, we need to be able to demonstrate that when somebody violates rules and laws within the FBI, they, too, will be prosecuted and held accountable.

There is little Congress can do legislatively. Leaking is already against the law. Creating new laws for the Justice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., should call on the Justice Department to answer to the American people for this failure to prosecute. Members of the Judiciary Committee in the House and Senate should question Inspector General Michael Horowitz about his findings and demand answers from the DOJ about the failure to prosecute. There may be no better way to get the answers the American people deserve.

Remaining vigilant against EPA's clean water rollbacks,https://thehill.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/446892-remaining-vigilant-against-epas-clean-water-rollbacks,"With the start of summer, America’s kids will be swimming, fishing and enjoying the great outdoors. An important federal rule ensures the safety of those local lakes that kids swim in and the nearby streams their drinking water comes from: the Clean Water Rule.

Signed in 2015, the Clean Water Rule clarified that the Clean Water Act protects small streams and wetlands, vital resources that had been vulnerable to pollution because of two confusing Supreme Court decisions. After an extensive public outreach effort by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) — including a 200-day public comment period and more than 1 million comments — It was clear the rule had substantial public input and support.

But like many other scientifically-based and popular programs, the Clean Water Rule has come under attack by the Trump administration. Since the beginning of his presidency, Trump has instructed his cabinet deputies to weaken, defund or otherwise gut numerous crucial environmental safeguards — all in service to industry polluters and special interests — and sadly, clean water protections were at the top of the list.

In December, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerRemaining vigilant against EPA's clean water rollbacks Overnight Energy: EPA head accuses media of not reporting agency's achievements | Leaked FDA study finds cancer-linked chemicals in food supply | Wheeler calls Flint water 'safe to drink' EPA head says water in Flint 'safe to drink' MORE — a former coal lobbyist — proposed a radical reinterpretation of the Clean Water Act that severely limits protections for crucial streams and wetlands. Bipartisan stakeholders — including public health advocates, sporting groups, businesses, environmental justice activists and laborers — believe this “Dirty Water Rule” is one of the biggest attacks on the Clean Water Act in its history.

Quite simply, Trump’s plan would slash bedrock protections for the water that millions of Americans use and drink. Trump has justified his unprecedented action by claiming the original Clean Water Rule was a partisan “power grab.” But this ignores the nearly 50 years of bipartisan support for the Clean Water Act. A majority of Congressional Republicans supported the original Act, and in the years since, both parties have made clean water a policy priority because everyone should agree that our kids should not drink tainted water. Furthermore, the federal government is the only entity that has the ability to effectively protect water resources that cross through multiple states and municipalities.

Industry groups and corporate polluters, however, took issue with requirements to seek permits to pollute our nation’s waters. And because this administration would seemingly rather listen to the concerns of polluters over the American people, they happily obliged to fight for industry profits at the expense of keeping our water clean.

Even worse, the administration has been frustratingly secretive in their proposed rule. Limiting the public comment period to a paltry 60 days, EPA held just one public hearing and did little to solicit opinions on a rule that would directly impact millions of Americans.

Despite this attempt to exclude the public, opponents of the rule delivered more than half a million comments to the EPA. The Trump administration can try to hide preference for industrial polluters over families, but the American people were watching and made their voices heard.

Not too long ago, the idea that every American has clean water to drink would not have been controversial. Now, the Trump administration, and allies in Congress, are challenging that basic right to make it easier to pollute vital water resources. Water doesn’t stop flowing once it reaches a state line, and pollution doesn’t magically disappear once it reaches federally protected sources. The only way to guarantee clean water for all is a strong federal standard that places the interests of the public above the profits of a few polluters.

This summer, our kids will spend their time outdoors and cool off with a refreshing glass of water. If Trump’s rollback of the Clean Water Rule is enacted, the water that sustains our communities could become unsafe. Congress must reject this administration’s assault on America’s clean water and work together to protect water for all people. We must stay vigilant against attempts to weaken clean water safeguards that have protected our children, outdoors, and wildlife for decades.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale of eight F-16 aircraft and related equipment to Bulgaria at an estimated cost of $1.67 billion, a Pentagon agency said on Monday.

The prime contractor will be Lockheed Martin Corp, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.

“The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve security of a NATO ally and a key democratic partner of the United States in ensuring peace and stability in this region,” the statement said."
Democrats release Homeland Security funding bill without money for border wall,https://thehill.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/446806-democrats-release-homeland-security-funding-bill-without-money-for-border-wall,"House Democrats are bucking President Trump Donald John TrumpYouTube declines to take action against commentator accused of racist, homophobic harassment YouTube declines to take action against commentator accused of racist, homophobic harassment US officials respond to China blaming Trump admin for derailing trade negotiations MORE with their newly released funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including no funds for border walls or barriers of any kind in the legislation.

House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey Nita Sue LoweyHouse advances B agriculture bill House advances B agriculture bill House committee advances 7 billion transportation, housing bill MORE (D-N.Y.) said the 2020 DHS funding bill, released Tuesday, is meant to protect the nation's values.

“This includes upholding the rights and dignity of migrants, protecting against attempts by the Trump administration to steal funds from measures that actually keep us safe for a vanity border wall, and providing no funding for additional Border Patrol agents and checkpoints or border barriers,” Lowey said.



The bill is the opening salvo in a fight that could lead to another government shutdown over border security.

Earlier this year, Trump shut down the government for a record 35 days after Democrats refused to comply with his demands for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

In the end, Trump acquiesced to a compromise of $1.35 billion for barriers, on par with what was offered before the shutdown, and well below the amount he demanded.



Trump went on to declare a state of emergency at the border, which would allow him to circumvent Congress and use military funds to build the barrier.



House Democrats have included provisions in their 2020 spending bills that would block such attempts to reprogram funds to build a wall.

For example, a military construction spending bill blocked funds from being reprogrammed for building a wall, and the financial services spending bill included provisions preventing forfeited funds for that purpose.

Democrats are also seeking to block Trump’s emergency moves in court.



The $63.8 billion DHS bill increases spending by $2.2 billion over current levels, but comes in $1.9 billion below Trump's request.

The DHS bill is the last of 12 spending bills the House Democrats have released for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Combined, the bills represented a broad rejection of Trump's agenda and budget requests. Trump had proposed slashing domestic spending by as much 10 percent, including deep cuts to the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency, National Institutes of Health and Department of Transportation, among other programs.

The House bills flouted his proposals, adding $34 billion to domestic spending and $17 billion to defense.

The Russian government on Tuesday denied withdrawing any of its military troops or technical experts from Venezuela and contradicted recent news reports and a vague tweet from President Donald Trump that Moscow had told him it pulled out its personnel.

""No, we do not inform anyone on this theme,"" Yuri Ushakov, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, told reporters Tuesday, according to the country's state news service. The ""limited number"" of ""technical specialists"" in military and economic affairs are staying in the oil-rich Latin American nation, where the local economy is reeling from U.S.-imposed sanctions.

Ushakov was responding to a question about Trump's tweet, which came Monday amid his ongoing state visit to the U.K., in which the president stated, ""Russia has informed us that they have removed most of their people from Venezuela.""

Political Cartoons on World Leaders View All 24 Images

It is still unclear whether Trump was referring to roughly 100 Russian military advisers that Moscow dispatched to Venezuela at the end of March and that Trump said should “ get out .” They arrived to support the embattled regime of Russian ally President Nicolas Maduro as it faced increased pressure from opposition leader Juan Guaido, backed by the White House and many other Western governments.

Trump's tweet came after a late Sunday report from The Wall Street Journal that Russian private security firm Rostec, owned by a close friend of Putin's, had withdrawn from Venezuela after years of support, striking what the paper described as a blow to the Maduro regime.

A spokesman for U.S. Southern Command, the military headquarters overseeing American operations in the Southern Hemisphere, in an email to U.S. News declined to comment immediately on the content of Trump's tweet. Navy Adm. Craig Faller, the headquarters' commander, has previously commented on Russia's influence in Venezuela.

The State Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

If true, the news would represent an abrupt change for Russia's support for a nation that it may increasingly consider a financial quagmire. The International Monetary Fund predicted earlier this year that Venezuela could experience 10 million percent inflation.

""I think the Russians are thinking harder about their future and what will happen later in Venezuela,"" says William Courtney, a former senior State Department and White House official focusing on Russia, now with the non-partisan, non-profit think tank Rand Corp. ""Russia does not have the economic means to bail out Venezuela economically. And the Venezuelan economy, especially its oil production, has been horribly mismanaged.""

Ushakov, Putin's aide, described the Russian presence in Venezuela as a ""limited number"" of operatives and said reports of any withdrawal on a large scale was ""conjecture.""

Others have doubted the extent to which Russia may be backing away from its allies in Caracas. A source in Venezuela, speaking on the condition of anonymity for security reasons and familiar with Rostec's operations, says the firm does not appear to have altered its operations there as of Tuesday.

The latest reports follow Guaido's failed effort to gain control of the government in Venezuela after claiming victory in January's contentious election. That followed vocal support from national security adviser John Bolton – a noted critic of Maduro's – who reportedly held meetings at the White House and Pentagon that included consideration of U.S. military support for Guaido. Russia and China have expressed support for Maduro in the ongoing political crisis that comes amid spiraling inflation, rampant unemployment and scarcities in food, power and basic supplies.

A failed uprising by the opposition to recruit military support in early May appears to have all but dashed any chances of undermining the regime's control. Despite U.S. support, Maduro and the resources he commands, including the bulk of the Venezuelan military, appear to remain firmly in control against any challengers, perhaps even without outside support."
Senior official at Treasury agency investigated for employee bullying,https://www.politico.com,['Victoria Guida'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/04/employee-bullying-treasury-1492846,"The top human resources official at a Treasury Department agency allegedly created a hostile work environment in which employees feel belittled and afraid to speak up. | Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images finance & tax Senior official at Treasury agency investigated for employee bullying

The top human resources official at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is under an internal investigation over claims of bullying and harassment, allegations that echo complaints against her in a previous government position, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.

Cassandra Cuffee-Graves, hired as deputy comptroller for human capital at the bank regulator in April 2018, has created a hostile work environment in which employees feel belittled and afraid to speak up, five OCC staff members said in interviews. Multiple employees argued that Cuffee-Graves was not properly vetted before being given the job, raising broader questions about hiring practices at the agency, which oversees national banks.

Story Continued Below

Cuffee-Graves and her deputy, Bianca Green, are the subject of an administrative inquiry by the OCC’s legal office, according to the employees, who said they were informed of the probe in March. The employees asked to remain anonymous.

OCC spokesperson Joseph Adamoli said the agency, which is an independent bureau within the Treasury Department, does not comment on personnel matters. Cuffee-Graves and Green did not respond to requests for comment.

Similar allegations were made about the two women when they were top HR officials at the Department of Education. A July 8, 2016, letter to then-Education Secretary John King, signed by human resources staff, claimed a “hostile work environment, fear of retaliation from leadership, verbal abuse, violation of the merit system principles, and collusion against employees.” A signatory of the letter told POLITICO that 19 employees were involved in drafting it.

“Several employees with years of service and no prior suspensions have been suspended for submission of work products that were performed under limited direction by management with the sole intent of using the disciplinary process against the employees,” the letter alleged.

In one instance, an employee was suspended by Green without pay for 30 days for failing to complete certain tasks. A case report published in September 2018 by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that hears appeals from government employees, reversed that decision. The board found that whistleblowing by the employee related to hiring practices at the agency was a “contributing factor” in the suspension.

The employee, Christine Reese, had previously alleged “violations of merit principles and prohibited personnel practices” by several management officials, including Cuffee-Graves, in complaints to the department’s inspector-general and the Office of Special Counsel.

In one of those complaints, she claimed Green was wrongly placed in her position because the department did not follow proper procedures to ensure a competitive hiring process, a claim also lodged by human resources staff in their 2016 letter.

MSPB did not rule on the merits of Reese’s claims but decided in her favor upon finding she was a whistleblower.

The MSPB investigation also found that Cuffee-Graves had imposed an “unreasonable” deadline on the suspended employee, less than 24 hours for a project, which was not completed on time -- one reason for the punishment.

Reese was suspended on April 1, 2018, just a few weeks before Cuffee-Graves started her new position at the OCC. Cuffee-Graves hired Green for a newly created deputy position at the OCC that October, shortly after the case report was finalized.

Cuffee-Graves and Green first worked together in 2012, when both were at Customs and Border Protection.

According to court records, Cuffee-Graves was in bankruptcy proceedings when she was hired by the agency, which the OCC employees believe should have raised questions about her suitability for a management position at a key financial regulator.

According to a review of documents from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland, Cuffee-Graves filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in August 2017 and her plan was confirmed in June 2018.

When applying for a job at the OCC, candidates are asked whether they are delinquent on any federal debt, such as taxes or federally insured student loans or mortgages.

Rich Delmar, an official with the Treasury Department’s IG, asked whether the watchdog had any open investigations into the OCC’s office of human capital, said the office “can’t discuss investigative matters.”

The Education Department IG in its annual plan for fiscal year 2018 said it intended to conduct an audit of the department’s hiring practices, but IG spokesperson Catherine Grant said that audit has been put on hold.

“We do not comment on whether we have received an allegation or complaint, nor do we generally confirm whether we are conducting an investigation,” she said."

While Tim Cook and other Apple brass were at WWDC 2019 showing off new iOS 13 features and what's coming to the Apple Watch, the Department of Justice was apparently cooking up other plans for the iPhone maker.

The DOJ reportedly has obtained jurisdiction to potentially investigate Apple over antitrust concerns, according to a Reuters report on Monday. This news came just hours after it was reported that the Federal Trade Commission secured rights to investigate Facebook. And this past Friday, the DOJ reportedly began preparing for an antitrust investigation on Google for its search practices and other business activities.

These moves by the Justice Department and FTC comes as Apple and other Silicon Valley giants face renewed antitrust scrutiny in the United States. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, has made it a key part of her platform to break up the big tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Amazon.

Oracle Accuses Amazon Of Courting Former Employee Involved In A $10 Billion DOD Program,https://dailycaller.com,"['Chris White', 'Energy Reporter']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/03/amazon-department-of-defense/,"Amazon made a highly lucrative job offer to a former employee while the man was leading a $10 billion winner-take-all cloud computing contract with the government, according to court documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Computing giant Oracle alleged in the May 31 complaint that former Department of Defense official Deap Ubhi was offered shares in Amazon and a salary with the big tech giant while he was finding a company to help build out the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract.

“AWS (during JEDI and with full knowledge made a hidden job offer to Ubhi, to include a massive [redacted] immediate signing bonus payment, a second [redacted] bonus payment after year one, [redacted} shares of Amazon stock (roughly $950-$960 per share in the relevant period), and a [redacted] salary,” the court document notes, referring to Amazon Web Services, one of the companies vying for the contract.

The document added: “AWS offered a former Amazon employee actively running DoD’s $10 billion JEDI procurement nearly [redacted] dollars in cash and stock during a live procurement, not to mention a substantial salary.” (RELATED: Trump’s Acting DOD Secretary Weighs In On A Cloud Contract Conservatives Loathe)

Ubhi never recused himself, according to the document. Instead, “he spent weeks as a DoD official, downloading the JEDI Google drive to his laptop, meeting with AWS competitors as a DoD official, requesting and participating cloud meetings … and obtaining submissions from JEDI competitors,” Oracle notes in its document.

The filing comes several months after Oracle file a similar lawsuit in December 2018 noting Ubhi’s past employment with Amazon, which stands to be one of two potential winners of JEDI, a cloud computing infrastructure for the U.S. military. Oracle’s lawsuit is an attempt to block the contract until further investigation.

Ubhi openly praised Amazon on Twitter while he was working with the DOD, media reports show. “Once an Amazonian, always an Amazonian. Proud today. Thank you, @JeffBezos,” Ubhi tweeted in January 2017, referencing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’s opposition to President Donald Trump’s border wall.

The former DOD official left the government in late 2017. He now works with AWS.

Oracle and IBM have tried to overturn the single-award approach even. They argue that such a contract would force the Pentagon to pay billions of dollars to one company, while losing out on innovations from other companies down the supply chain. Conservatives have made similar arguments in the past.

“A contract of this magnitude should not be awarded as a sole source contract,” conservative groups wrote in a May 16 letter to Russell Vought, the acting director for the Office of Management and Budget. Citizens Against Government Waste and The American Conservative Union were among several groups that signed the letter.

It has become controversial among Republican lawmakers as well.

Reps. Steve Womack of Arkansas and Tom Cole of Oklahoma, for instance, requested a probe in October 2018 into the Pentagon’s handling of the deal. This came after TheDCNF reported that an adviser to former Secretary of Defense James Mattis once consulted for Amazon Web Services through her firm.

Both Amazon and DOJ refused to provide a comment to TheDCNF, citing ongoing litigation.

""Over the decades that followed, the United States hoped that China’s integration into the international system would lead to a more open, tolerant society. Those hopes have been dashed,"" Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement.

Pompeo's statement calls out China's ""new wave of abuses,"" including the the detention of Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang at so-called re-education camps.

Foreign experts estimate as many as 1 million Muslims have been placed into the programs, which Chinese officials likened to ""boarding schools,"" according to The New York Times.

""Even as the party builds a powerful surveillance state, ordinary Chinese citizens continue to seek to exercise their human rights, organize independent unions, pursue justice through the legal system, and simply express their views, for which many are punished, jailed, and even tortured,"" Pompeo said in his Monday statement.

Pompeo also urged the Chinese government to make a ""full, public accounting"" of those killed or missing.

During the June 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, protesters seeking social freedom were forcibly suppressed. Pompeo called the protesters ""heroes"" who inspired future generations to call for freedom and democracy around the world.

""China’s own constitution stipulates that all power belongs to the people. History has shown that nations are stronger when governments are responsive to their citizens, respect the rule of law, and uphold human rights and fundamental freedom,"" Pompeo said."
VA whistleblower says there’s a secret wait list for veterans' care,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whistleblower-says-theres-a-secret-va-wait-list-for-care-the-department-says-thats-not-true/2019/06/01/197e59a2-83df-11e9-bce7-40b4105f7ca0_story.html,"President during the swearing-in ceremony for Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie last year.

Columnist

Jereme P. Whiteman rose quickly through the Department of Veterans Affairs, reaching the top grade on the main employee classification scale in only seven years.

But his future within VA appears stymied. He’s become a rebel within the department’s establishment — a whistleblower who says the scandals that shamed the department during the Obama administration haven’t stopped.

Whiteman, VA’s national director of clinic practice management and a onetime Marine, has accused the department under President Trump of having “a secret VA wait list” for veterans seeking health care.

It’s starkly reminiscent of the tsunami-level scandal that broke in 2014 over the coverup of long patient wait times. That coverup included falsifying records to indicate the wait for medical service was shorter than it really was. Congress went ballistic, and the controversy drove then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, a former Army general and chief of staff, from office.

Whiteman said figures from internal reports indicate the actual number of veterans waiting for VA health care could be much higher than the numbers VA makes publicly available. Whiteman provided copies of the internal reports to The Washington Post.

From May 1, 2018, through May 1, 2019, the monthly average on the department’s public electronic wait list (EWL) was 14,971. During that period, the monthly average on the internal electronic wait list was 44,478.

In an email Wednesday night to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, Whiteman said that “I discovered a secret VA wait list” in September and that “the agency has taken steps to conceal this wait list from the public.” He warned Wilkie that this could hurt the agency “unless swift actions are taken to properly address my concerns.”

Through its Veterans Health Administration, the department runs 1,250 health-care facilities, serving 9 million veterans annually.

VA press secretary Curt Cashour said Whiteman’s allegations are false. Cashour said VA’s electronic wait list has two components — clinical and administrative.

He said the clinical list — the public list — tracks the number of veterans waiting for medical treatment.

Of the other list, he said that “the administrative component of the EWL has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment and tracks routine actions, such as facility and provider transfer requests.”

[VA is gearing up for a massive shift of health care to the private sector. But Democrats are fighting back.]

Cashour said VA does not publicly post the administrative component of the EWL, “because it has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment and would only create confusion.”

Whiteman punched back, telling Wilkie that Cashour’s statement to The Post was “incredibly disingenuous.” Whiteman said any veteran waiting for treatment should be included on the public list, including veterans waiting for VA-funded care by private providers or veterans waiting to be transferred to another facility.

Unlike many federal whistleblowers, Whiteman went public while still on the job. Whiteman went through his chain of command months before becoming frustrated and contacting The Post’s Federal Insider.

Whiteman, 39, said he rose to GS-15, the top of the General Schedule, last year after just seven years as a federal civilian, all with VA. The Temple Hills, Md., resident started as a GS-7, doing pharmacy billing.

Before joining VA, he was a Marine for eight years, leaving as a staff sergeant working on jet weapons systems. His pride in that service is evident from his glass-enclosed uniform displayed on his office wall, along with other Marine and family decorations in his windowless spot on the eighth floor of VA’s Central Office, across Lafayette Square from the White House.

In a September email to his boss, Susan Kirsh, the acting assistant deputy undersecretary for health for access to care, and her boss, Steven L. Lieberman, VA’s acting principal deputy undersecretary for health, Whiteman said the discrepancies in public and internal wait-list numbers “could be seen as VA hiding a very large wait list of Veterans waiting extremely long for care.”

Whiteman was so disappointed in the way leadership handled his concerns that he filed a verbal complaint, under oath, about the discrepancies with the department’s Office of the Medical Inspector. He asked the office to investigate circumstances for patients who died while on the wait list to determine whether the deaths were connected to wait times.

Cashour said the medical inspector’s office found the allegations unsubstantiated. In the email to Wilkie, however, Whiteman said the medical inspector never followed up with him beyond his initial statement.

Whiteman has filed official complaints charging VA with retaliation against him because of his whistleblowing.

In an April 27 email, Whiteman told VA’s whistleblower protection office that one example of retribution followed the successful deployment of a text-message reminder system that led to a significant reduction in the number of missed medical appointments, saving an estimated $112 million annually.

“I lead a team of four VA employees on this project,” he wrote in an email to the whistleblower office. “I was the only one of the four who did not get an award for this project. I believe this was retaliation for my Whistleblower activity.”

Cashour said the department does not tolerate retaliation, but he did not comment on this allegation.

Whiteman also filed a retaliation complaint in an April 29 email to the Office of Special Counsel. This independent federal office protects federal whistleblowers. Despite the name, it is not led by or related to Robert S. Mueller III, who led a special-counsel investigation of Russia’s actions in support of Trump’s candidacy.

Although Whiteman is a GS-15, his email to the special-counsel office said he was subjected to “numerous undesirable work assignments” from Kirsh, including “reporting to a lower grade GS-11 employee. . . . I find this degrading and humiliating, yet I do the work as directed.”

Cashour said, “Whiteman has always reported to someone above the GS-15 level.” Whiteman said that is on paper, not in reality.

Married and the father of five, Whiteman plans to remain at VA, considering it the best place in the federal government for him as a health-care administrator. But his work life is no longer the same.

“It’s well known within headquarters that I am whistleblowing,” he said. “And I see it when I walk down the halls. People, you know, don’t look at me. They don’t make eye contact with me.”

Because of his disclosures, “there’s no more upward mobility for me at this point.” Whiteman said. “I consider myself probably stalled.”"
US Treasury yields drop after much weaker-than-expected private jobs data,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/05/bond-market-treasury-yields-focus-on-fed-comments.html,"U.S. government debt yields slumped on Wednesday after a gauge of private employment showed a sharp contraction in job creation in the month of May.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.086%, while the yield on the 2-year Treasury note shed 9 basis points to trade at 1.783%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

Companies added just 27,000 new positions during the month of May, according to payroll processing firm ADP and Moody's Analytics. The Wednesday report fell well below Dow Jones estimates of 173,000.

The reading represented the worst print since the beginning of the economic expansion in March 2010 with a loss of 113,000. Though just one of many datapoints tracked by the Federal Reserve and U.S. economists, the weak jobs data marks a pivot in what's been one of the brightest spots of the economy in recent years.

""The market response follows intuitively. Underlying strength in the labor market has been a core positive of the cross currents in the domestic economy - remove this support vector and a cut cycle follows,"" Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in an email. ""In short, though still not our base case, the likelihood of a June cut just increased."""

"Local business to pay more than $38,000 after Department of Labor investigation",https://www.wjhg.com,[],,,,https://www.wjhg.com/content/news/Local-business-to-pay-more-than-38000-after-Department-of-Labor-investigation-510780171.html,"A local company will have to pay more than $38,000 in back wages to 78 people after investigation by the United States Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division.

WHD said By The Sea Resorts Inc., based in Panama City Beach, violated overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and labor provisions of the H-2B visa program.

WHD said $7,304 in back wages were found as a result of FLSA violations, while $31,209 in back wages were found for H-2B violations. They say By The Sea Resorts Inc. also had to pay a penalty of $12,695.

WHD said By The Sea Resorts Inc. manages resorts and restaurants in the Panama City Beach area including Beachbreak, Legacy, Shalimar Retreat Center, Sugar Sands, Chateau, and Ocean Breeze.

Investigators found By The Sea Resorts Inc. hired 117 Jamaican employees to work as housekeepers under the H-2B visa program. WHD said the business violated the H-2B provisions by putting those employees in jobs not listed on the temporary employment certification they submitted, such as front desk personnel, dishwashers, and bartenders, but paying them as housekeepers.

WHD also said By The Sea Resorts Inc. also automatically took time away from the workers' time cards for meals even if they didn't take a break.

""Employers seeking H-2B workers must abide by all of the program's requirements, including placing those workers only in occupations listed in their employment certifications,"" Wage and Hour District Director Daniel White said. ""The U.S. Department of Labor will continue to safeguard American jobs and level the playing field for law-abiding employers. We encourage employers to contact the Wage and Hour Division by phone, online, or to attend any of our many outreach events for assistance and to learn more about their responsibilities.""
