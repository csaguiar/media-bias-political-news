Trump claims Japan 'doesn't have to help' if US is attacked,https://www.cnn.com,['Zachary Cohen'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/trump-japan-defense-commitments/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump again lamented what he views as an unequal military alliance Wednesday, claiming that if the US is attacked, Japan ""doesn't have to help us at all"" and ""can watch it on the Sony television.""

Trump's criticism of Japan came during an interview with on Fox Business Network when he was asked about the possibility of bilateral trade deals ahead of his G20 trip, where he will meet with several counterparts, including Japanese President Shinzo Abe.

""Let me start off with general statement -- almost all countries in this world take tremendous advantage,"" of the US, Trump told Fox Business by phone, repeating a common refrain of his 2016 campaign.

The President then criticized NATO broadly, before singling out Japan for the terms of its military alliance with the US.

""If Japan is attacked, we will fight World War Three ... with our lives and with our treasure,"" he said, adding, ""If we're attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us at all,"" Trump said. Japan, he claimed, ""can watch it on the Sony television, okay, the attack.""

President Donald Trump has invited the U.S. women's soccer team to the White House, regardless of whether they win the World Cup, after Megan Rapinoe's assertion that she is ""not going to the f---ing White House.""

Rapinoe, who has described herself as a ""walking protest"" to Trump's policies, made her recent comments about a potential White House visit to soccer magazine Eight by Eight.

""I'm not going to the f---ing White House,"" Rapinoe, the team's co-captain, said during the interview, which was posted to the magazine's Twitter account Tuesday. ""No. I'm not going to the White House. We're not going to be invited. I doubt it.""

Trump responded Wednesday morning with a series of tweets.

Trump called out Rapinoe earlier this week for her protests during the national anthem, telling The Hill in an interview Monday that he disagrees with her actions.

After Rapinoe started kneeling during the anthem, the U.S. Soccer Federation adopted a policy that requires players to stand during it. Now she stands, but she has been criticized for not singing and putting her hand over her heart like other players.

Rapinoe, who scored two goals Monday against Spain to help the U.S. reach the World Cup quarterfinals, previously stated that she would ""absolutely not"" visit the White House in an interview last month with Sports Illustrated.

""I am not going to fake it, hobnob with the president, who is clearly against so many of the things that I am (for) and so many of the things that I actually am,"" Rapinoe told SI. ""I have no interest in extending our platform to him.""

Fellow U.S. star Alex Morgan also has said she would decline an invitation to the White House, telling Time Magazine that she doesn't ""stand for a lot of things the current office stands for.""

""We don't have to be put in this little box,"" Morgan told Time in an interview published last month. ""There's the narrative that's been said hundreds of times about any sort of athlete who's spoken out politically. 'Stick to sports.' We're much more than that, OK?""

"Trump Attacks Mueller, Repeating False Accusations",https://www.nytimes.com,['Eileen Sullivan'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/trump-mueller-testimony.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump lashed out at the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, on Wednesday, dredging up false accusations about the conduct of investigators after House Democrats announced that Mr. Mueller would testify publicly next month.

The president offered no evidence as he repeated earlier accusations that Mr. Mueller destroyed text messages between two former F.B.I. officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who worked on the Russia investigation. “They’re gone and that is illegal,” Mr. Trump said of the texts in an interview with Fox Business Network. “That’s a crime.”

Mr. Trump was referring to a December Justice Department inspector general report that noted 19,000 text messages were lost because of technical problems, not intentionally deleted by Mr. Mueller or anyone.

Thousands of messages between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page have been made public, many highly critical of the president. Both Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page were criticized in an inspector general report last year on the Hillary Clinton email investigation, but the inspector general also said that bias had not affected the F.B.I.’s decision-making process. Another inspector general report on aspects of the Russia inquiry is due in the coming weeks or months."
Eric Trump says he was spit on at Chicago restaurant,https://www.cnn.com,"['Betsy Klein', 'Joe Sutton']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/eric-trump-chicago-restaurant-spit/index.html,"(CNN) Eric Trump , son of President Donald Trump, said Tuesday he was spat on by an employee at a Chicago-area restaurant.

""It was purely a disgusting act by somebody who clearly has emotional problems,"" the President's third child told conservative site Breitbart News by phone Tuesday evening.

The Chicago Police Department was on the scene and assisted Secret Service, per CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

""CPD was on scene and assisting the United States Secret Service with a law enforcement matter. Any and all inquiries regarding a federal protectee must be directed to the Secret Service,"" Guglielmi tweeted

A United States Secret Service spokesperson declined to comment to CNN, and did not respond to inquiries on whether charges had been filed.

Eric Trump cast blame for the incident, which took place at upscale cocktail bar and restaurant Aviary, more broadly on the Democratic Party.

""For a party that preaches tolerance, this once again demonstrates they have very little civility. When somebody is sick enough to resort to spitting on someone, it just emphasizes a sickness and desperation and the fact that we're winning,"" he told Breitbart.

Trump, who, along with his brother, leads their father's real estate business, was in town for a visit to Trump Hotel Chicago

""We did not witness the incident and we are just beginning to learn the details. What is certain is this: no customer should ever be spit upon,"" The Aviary said in a statement Wednesday.

The employee involved in the incident has not yet been spoken to, but has been placed on leave by its human resources team, The Aviary said.

The business also said it is being subjected to online harassment in the wake of the incident.

""Hundreds of people are calling for the demise of our business, threatening our employees, and posting fake reviews... they are wrong to do so based on the actions of a lone individual,"" the restaurant said in the statement. ""So too, however, are those people wrong who are praising this as an act of civil disobedience."""
Supreme Court gives Marine seeking VA benefits second chance in lower court,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Devan Cole']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/supreme-court-kisor-wilkie-marine-veteran-federal-agencies/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave a Marine Corps veteran who sought disability benefits for his service-related post-traumatic stress a second chance to prevail in a case that will impact the amount of power federal agencies have.

But lurking behind the case was a dispute over government agencies that some conservatives feel have become too powerful, upsetting the balance of power.

Writing for five of the nine justices, Justice Elena Kagan narrowed the circumstances in which courts will defer to an agency's interpretation of ambiguous language in its own regulations. But Kagan stopped short of overturning court precedent.

Kagan wrote that such deference ""retains an important role in construing agency regulations,"" but she said it is ""sometimes appropriate and sometimes not."" She outlined ""markers"" for when courts should and should not defer.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment outlining those markers.

""The underlying regulation must be genuinely ambiguous; the agency's interpretation must be reasonable and must reflect its authoritative, expertise-based, and fair and considered judgment; and the agency must take account of reliance interests and avoid unfair surprise,"" Roberts wrote.

Paul Hughes, a lawyer for Kisor, praised the ruling, saying, ""Today's decision will significantly narrow agency authority."" Hughes noted that the lower court had applied a ""reflexive form of deference"" to the agency that was not warranted.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined in full by Justice Clarence Thomas and in part by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, wrote to say they thought court precedent should have been ""easy for the Court"" to overturn. Gorsuch said that while the opinion manages to leave court precedent ""maimed and enfeebled"" the justices should have found the ""nerve"" to wipe it off the books.

""Although it's easy to get lost in the administrative law weeds of this case, the major headline here is that Chief Justice (John) Roberts declined to join the four other conservative justices in overruling prior precedent, and instead joined his more progressive colleagues in narrowing but not ditching the idea that courts should sometimes defer to how administrative agencies resolve ambiguities in their own regulations,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

""The chief justice wrote separately to suggest that there isn't that much daylight between the result the Court reached and the one the dissenters would have adopted, but lower courts may well disagree as cases like these go forward,"" he said.

Vladeck added that the Court ""was unanimous in agreeing to send the case back to the Federal Circuit, but split as to what should happen thereafter.""

""Five Justices still think there is some room for deference to the VA, although they're not sure whether such deference is warranted in this case. Four would have the lower courts resolve the issue without any deference to the VA,"" he said.

Bill Wehrum is leaving his post as the Environmental Protection Agency's top air policy official. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Environmental Protection Agency air chief Bill Wehrum, who helped reverse Obama-era rules aimed at cutting pollutants, is stepping down amid scrutiny over possible violations of federal ethics rules.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s announcement Wednesday did not cite a specific reason for the departure of Wehrum, who as an attorney represented power companies seeking to scale back several air pollution rules before joining the Trump administration. But Wehrum has privately expressed concern about how an ongoing House Energy and Commerce Committee probe was affecting his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, according to individuals familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

“While I have known of Bill’s desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,” Wheeler said Wednesday, praising Wehrum for “his service, his dedication to his job, the leadership he provided to his staff and the agency, and for his friendship.”

Wehrum, who was confirmed for the post in November 2017, is the latest among Trump appointees to depart after coming under investigation for possible misconduct. Four Cabinet members — EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin — have all left amid an ethics cloud, along with other senior staffers such as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator William “Brock” Long.

Interior’s Office of Inspector General is currently investigating seven current or former top appointees for improperly engaging with their former employers or clients on department-related business, including Secretary David Bernhardt. Bernhardt has denied any wrongdoing, and the other officials have not commented publicly on the allegations.

The Energy and Commerce Committee launched its inquiry of Wehrum after The Washington Post reported in February that questions had been raised about his compliance with the Trump ethics pledge, which requires political appointees to recuse themselves from specific matters involving their former employers and clients for two years. If an appointee does meet with a former client, the pledge dictates that the gathering should be open to all interested parties — a requirement that has been interpreted to mean four other participants who were not clients.

Less than one month after joining the EPA, Wehrum met with two former clients at his old firm without consulting in advance with ethics officials, even though they had cautioned him about such interactions. That same month, Wehrum participated in a decision that appeared to benefit a former client, DTE Energy, in which Pruitt issued a memo stating that the agency would not be “second guessing utilities” when they projected whether they would need a few federal permits after expanding their operations.

Wehrum, who heads the air and radiation office at the EPA, acknowledged both incidents in an interview with The Post but said he had determined that he did not violate federal ethics rules.

“I have, from day one, tried to be absolutely strict and assiduous as to what I do about complying with my ethical obligations,” Wehrum said, “because it doesn’t do me any good, and it doesn’t do the agency any good, to be doing things that people see as unethical.”

[Trump administration to relax tailpipe emission standards for cars and trucks, rebuffing automakers' plea for a compromise]

Still, the fallout from reporting on Wehrum’s ties to his former firm and the utility industry by The Post and other outlets — including Politico, the New York Times and E&E News — has continued to reverberate. The Utility Air Regulatory Group, a group of power companies that paid Hunton Andrews Kurth millions in membership dues, disbanded earlier this year.

Still, even Wehrum’s fiercest critics say that he has been able to accomplish some of industry’s long-sought goals even as he’s come under fire for his close ties to energy firms. In doing so, he has rolled back some of President Barack Obama’s most sweeping air policies. Last week the EPA finalized a rule targeting power plants that cuts carbon emissions by less than half of what experts say is needed to avoid catastrophic global warming. He has advanced other proposals as well, including one that would freeze fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks for six years and another that would limit what sort of public health benefits the EPA can count when curbing air pollution from power plants and other sources.

“It is, at the very least, going to take years to undo the damage that has been done,” said John Coequyt, global climate policy director for the advocacy group Sierra Club, in a phone interview.

Coequyt added that as Wehrum returns to the private sector, corporate clients could face blowback from his group and others for enlisting his help. “We believe he’s toxic to their interests, and anyone who hires him will be publicly criticized for doing so.”

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who joined other Democrats in February in asking EPA’s inspector general to investigate Wehrum, predicted that he would end up representing one of the companies that has sought regulatory relief from Trump’s EPA.

“I can’t wait to see where Bill Wehrum lands once he’s out the door,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “What do you bet it’s with one of the fossil fuel interests he has served so well as air chief, delivering one big handout after another?”

A trained chemical engineer who earned his law degree at night while working for a company in Delaware, Wehrum led the EPA’s air and radiation office on an acting basis under President George W. Bush until Democrats blocked his nomination."
White House protocol chief suspended amid State Department investigation ahead of G-20,https://www.cnn.com,['Michelle Kosinski'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/state-department-protocol-chief-suspended/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's protocol chief, Sean Lawler, has been suspended indefinitely just ahead of the G-20 meeting in Japan pending the outcome of a State Department investigation into his conduct, according to multiple State Department officials with direct knowledge of the matter.

Two State officials told CNN that Lawler was called into the office of the deputy secretary on Monday afternoon and told he needed to leave due to the status of the investigation.

On the same afternoon, senior staff in the protocol office met with State Department management and were told that Lawler had to leave over personnel issues, according to the officials.

They were also told in this meeting that their new acting chief of protocol is Mary-Kate Fisher, and her acting deputy is Cathy Fenton, who served as social secretary in the George W. Bush White House and also handled social affairs‎ for Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush. State Department sources said both are highly respected.

One of the State Department officials described what multiple others told CNN was a pattern of behavior on Lawler's part. ""In my decade of government service, I have never seen someone so unprofessional, abrasive and rude as him,"" the official said. ""His bad behavior was terrible, and it was obvious. I personally saw it myself, as did a good chunk of the office.

The civil complaint alleges that the former “Apprentice” star “knowingly and willfully” failed to “file the required public financial disclosure report after her employment terminated with the Executive Office of the President.”

The suit claims that Manigault Newman was given a “post-government employment briefing” in December 2017, after her firing, in which “she was advised of her obligation … to file a termination financial disclosure report” within 30 days as part of the Ethics in Government Act.

Manigault Newman, who served as director of communications for the office of public liaison during her government tenure, allegedly ignored multiple email requests from the Justice Department, as well as the White House Counsel’s Office, reminding her to complete and return the requested documents.

A White House attorney had emailed the controversial reality star after the 30-day deadline had passed to warn that she might face a $200 late filing fee, but she continued to not respond to repeated efforts to get in touch with her.

After her ouster, media reports began circulating that Manigault Newman had been physically dragged out of the White House after her contentious termination.

She denies those allegations, but that didn’t keep her from becoming a Trump target on social media.

In a statement, Manigault Newman’s lawyer John Phillips told The Post: “The White House chooses to abuse process and use the Department of Justice to carry out retaliation. The lawsuit alleges that Omarosa Manigault Newman ‘knowingly and willfully’ failed to file a report. This is untrue.”"

""We were about 90% of the way there [with a deal] and I think there's a path to complete this,"" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Manama, Bahrain. He said he's confident Trump and the Chinese president can make progress in stalled trade talks at the Group of 20 meeting. ""The message we want to hear is that they want to come back to the table and continue because I think there is a good outcome for their economy and the U.S. economy to get balanced trade and to continue to build on this relationship."" He did not provide any detail on what the final 10% of an agreement might entail, or what the sticking points are to completing a deal.

Trump is meeting his Chinese counterpart on Saturday at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The outcome of the meeting could be pivotal for the global economy and financial markets, which has been rattled by 18 months of trade tensions between the economic giants and an escalation of tariffs on each other's imports. Officials have yet to negotiate a breakthrough, but there are hopes that a meeting between the two presidents could help the discussions. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of investors found that about two-thirds expect no deal this weekend, but there would be no new tariffs either. ""I'm hopeful that we can move forward with a plan,"" Mnuchin told CNBC. ""President Trump and President Xi have a very close working relationship. We had a productive meeting at the last G-20."" At their meeting in December at the G-20 in Buenos Aires, Trump and Xi reached a truce in the trade war, but talks in May broke down, and the countries added additional tariffs. Mnuchin said he was hopeful a deal could be struck by the end of the year but said ""there needs to be the right efforts in place."" Dow futures jumped after Mnuchin's comments and signaled a higher open for Wall Street Wednesday.

Slowing growth

Talks between the U.S. and China broke down in May because China reportedly did not want to commit to changes in its laws to help allay U.S. concerns about intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and currency manipulation. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has previously played down hopes for a Trump-Xi breakthrough this weekend, saying in mid-June that ""the most that will come out of the G-20 might be an agreement to actively resume talks."" The trade war has impacted the Chinese and U.S. economies, despite both presidents insisting otherwise. In April, the International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3.3%, down from an earlier forecast of 3.5%, citing ongoing global trade tensions as the rationale for the downgrade."

“I do burn out on people, I do. If somebody’s not really great, I do,” the president said during the interview in the Oval Office. He did not directly address the turnover at Customs and Border Protection, but said he had made “good changes” in the people who run his immigration agencies.

“I understand what I want,” he said. “And we’re starting to get there.”

The White House directed Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, to replace Mr. Sanders with Mr. Morgan after multiple White House officials expressed displeasure that Mr. Sanders was not being aggressive enough at the southwestern border, administration officials said. Mr. McAleenan complied, hoping to diminish friction with the White House, officials said.

Mr. McAleenan resisted an earlier push by Stephen Miller, the architect behind Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, to appoint Mr. Morgan as the head of Customs and Border Protection, according to current and former homeland security officials.

But Mr. Morgan won the approval of the White House after backing the president’s aggressive policies on television. In one appearance on Fox News, Mr. Morgan said that when he looked into the eyes of detained migrant children, he saw a “soon-to-be MS-13 gang member.”

In a letter to Customs and Border Protection employees on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders confirmed his departure.

FedEx has been caught in the crossfire in the conflict between the Trump administration and China's Huawei Technologies. Now, the giant shipper is suing the U.S. Commerce Department to block the agency from enforcing export regulations against FedEx.

""FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,"" the company said in a statement announcing the lawsuit on Monday.

The lawsuit, which also names Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, does not mention Huawei, the world's largest supplier of telecom equipment. But FedEx has become embroiled in the dispute between the U.S. and China over trade and Huawei, and China is reportedly investigating FedEx over misdelivered Huawei packages.

Business FedEx Pushes Back On Trump Administration's Efforts To Target Telecom Giant Huawei FedEx Pushes Back On Trump Administration's Efforts To Target Telecom Giant Huawei Listen · 3:34 3:34

The Trump administration has been pushing other countries to drop Huawei as a supplier of key networking equipment, including the next-generation 5G wireless phone system. The U.S. says it believes Huawei could use its technology to spy on behalf of the Chinese government, a charge that Huawei has repeatedly denied.

In its lawsuit, FedEx says U.S. export regulations ""essentially deputize FedEx to police the contents of the millions of packages it ships daily even though doing so is a virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally."" FedEx says it receives about 15 million packages per day for shipment and its system spans more than 220 countries and territories.

""To comply with the Export Controls,"" the lawsuit says, ""FedEx screens the names and addresses of its shippers and the designated recipients prior to delivering any package in order to identify whether the sender and/or recipient are an entity or person"" on the Commerce Department's ""entity list"" of persons that could pose risks to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.

In a statement to NPR on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said: ""We have not yet reviewed the complaint, but nevertheless look forward to defending Commerce's role in protecting U.S. national security.""

FedEx says it faces substantial penalties — criminal penalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties of $300,000 per violation. That puts FedEx ""between a rock and a hard place — absent the availability of review, FedEx must either forgo lawful activity because of its well-founded fear of prosecution, or willfully violate the Export Controls, thereby subjecting itself to criminal prosecution and punishment,"" the suit says. It also says that ""requiring FedEx to indiscriminately inspect every package abroad could place"" the company in violation of privacy laws.

The suit adds that the export controls require ""considerably more screening than possible from common carriers like FedEx."" Matthew O'Connor, a spokesman for UPS, told NPR on Tuesday that UPS ""continues to follow government directives in the markets where the company operates. UPS will not join the lawsuit filed by FedEx.""

On May 15, the Commerce Department placed Huawei on the entity list, saying there was a ""reasonable basis to conclude"" that the Chinese company ""is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest."" That essentially prevents the transfer of American technology to Huawei without a special license.

Google said it would stop supporting Android devices for phones made by Huawei, the world's second-largest supplier of smartphones, because the Chinese company was on Commerce's list.

Then on May 20, the Commerce Department issued a 90-day delay to give companies doing business with Huawei time to make ""other arrangements.""

On June 1, FedEx said its relationships with Huawei and all of FedEx's customers in China ""are important to us. FedEx holds itself to a very high standard of service. FedEx will fully cooperate with any regulatory investigation into how we serve our customers."""

Veterans Affairs whistleblowers call for end to culture of retaliation,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veterans-affairs-whistleblower-notified-termination-day-congressional-testimony/story?id=63922369,"A Department of Veterans Affairs health care worker said she received a letter from the agency on Monday notifying her that she would be terminated, just one day before she was scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing about how the VA treats other whistleblowers.

Baltimore psychologist Minu Aghevli said she received the letter, which outlined the VA Maryland Health Care Center's proposal to terminate her employment, after working for the agency for nearly 20 years and raising concerns for years about the quality of patient care and manipulating wait lists in opioid treatment programs. In an earlier letter, the VA says she was facing disciplinary action for treating a patient at a non-VA hospital and violating the agency's code of conduct, but she and her lawyer argue the agency is retaliating against her for raising concerns about problems within the department.

The agency denies that the notice was related to her testimony.

The VA has faced dozens of complaints from whistleblowers who say they were retaliated against for raising concerns about the quality of medical care for veterans or actions by agency officials, according to the agency that handles whistleblower complaints from federal employees. Aghevli and two other whistleblowers from the agency testified in front of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Tuesday saying the agency has a culture of trying to silence or punish people who report problems.

Aghevli called the termination proposal scary, because she said it appears to be a warning shot to ward off other potential whistleblowers.

""This feels obviously retaliatory, but worse than that I feel like I'm being used as a threat against other employees who might think about speaking up about patient care concerns and I resent that. I do not want to be used as a pawn,"" she testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli first reported concerns over hospital waitlists in 2014, just as a national scandal erupted over wait times, amid allegations patients had died waiting for care at a VA facility in Phoenix.

""In order to reduce the waitlist, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic waitlist by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,"" Aghevli said in remarks she prepared to share with Congress on Tuesday. ""This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits...The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.

""The VA also pressured me to artificially reduce the number of patients on the waitlist through other improper means,"" she added.

The VA's internal watchdog has investigated concerns about wait lists in opioid treatment facilities in Maryland, though it does not specify if it was prompted by Aghevli's complaint. The inspector general's inquiry published in 2018 confirmed that the VA's opioid program transferred veterans waiting for treatment to another list where they essentially wouldn't be counted. In an earlier report, the agency said they would improve internal controls by 2017 to ensure that all patients receive treatment.

Aghevli said the VA has ""engaged in continuous retaliation"" against her in an apparent effort to oust her from the agency ever since she first reported her concerns, including being stripped of patient-care privileges and assigned to do ""menial administrative tasks.""

""Two months ago, I was told that my clinical privileges are being suspended. So since that time I have been forbidden from having any clinical contact with patients and I was assigned to pretty menial administrative tasks,"" she said. ""It felt like I was put in a position where I would be especially visible to other staff to make it sort of a publicly humiliating situation.""

A letter from her legal team to the Office of Special Counsel -- which aims to safeguard federal employees, especially whistleblowers -- says Aghevli received the ""notice of proposed removal"" on June 24.

""The notice of proposed removal was issued immediately after the Agency learned that Dr. Aghevli's disclosures would be the subject of a front-page story in USA Today and that she would be testifying before Congress,"" her legal team wrote in the letter to OSC.

""The reasons set forth by the Agency for proposing Dr. Aghevli's removal are without merit and cannot be the actual reasons for proposing her removal.""

Aghevli did not send ABC News a copy of the letter because she said wanted to send her official response first.

Aghevli, who served as the former coordinator of the department's opioid addiction treatment program in Baltimore, said hospital officials cited in the letter an ongoing matter with a patient's follow-up care and gave her several business days to respond. In her testimony on Tuesday, she said her privileges were suspended in April because she visited a high-risk patient in a local hospital after he overdosed, and that the patient disclosed he attempted suicide after leaving the VA facility.

Aghevli declined to offer specific details about the April incident, citing potential patient privacy concerns, but she said it involved a ""high risk veteran"" who had visited the hospital’s emergency room in the past.

""So basically, what they say is I shouldn't have followed up with this high risk veteran in a community hospital, despite everything the VA says about following up with high risk veterans,"" she said. ""The VA says that we should engage them, keep them involved in care and provide proper mental health treatment.""

In a statement, the VA Maryland Health Care System said the notice of proposed termination was not related to her scheduled testimony on Tuesday.

""Dr. Aghevli will have an opportunity to respond to the proposed action, and a regional VA leader will decide whether to uphold it or mitigate it after ensuring all procedural protections in the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act have been met,"" it said in a statement, adding ""identifying as a whistleblower doesn’t shield someone from accountability when they have failed to uphold VA’s values and committed clear instances of misconduct.""

Another VA whistleblower who testified Tuesday, Katherine Mitchell a physician and consultant for the VA in Arizona, said she has faced continued retaliation even after the concerns she raised were addressed. She was one of the first people to raise concerns in 2014 about officials manipulating wait lists and jeopardizing care for veterans in Arizona.

She said she's seen a lot of improvement in patient care at the VA but that there's still a culture where some agency leaders make it difficult for people concerned about behavior that could be dangerous for patients to come forward.

""This has nothing to do with who’s in office. Things got worse two years ago because the media's attention turned off whistleblowers and turned on to politics and other things,"" she said Tuesday.

""It has nothing to do with who's in the president's office or who controls Congress. This is a malignant leadership culture that will outlast us all unless someone has the courage to break rank in leadership and finally change it."""
"As Supreme Court decision nears, lower court orders new look at census citizenship question",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Robert Barnes', 'Reporter Covering The U.S. Supreme Court', 'Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team"", 'Tara Bahrampour', 'Reporter Focusing On Aging', 'Generations', 'June At Pm']",06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-top-commerce-aide-says-he-was-directed-by-ross-to-add-census-citizenship-question/2019/06/24/4ba75f2c-96d2-11e9-916d-9c61607d8190_story.html,"Immigration activists rally outside the Supreme Court in April as the justices hear arguments over the Trump administration’s plan to ask about citizenship on the 2020 Census. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)

A federal appeals court said Tuesday that a Maryland judge should examine new allegations that the Trump administration had a discriminatory intent in adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, on the eve of a possible Supreme Court decision on the matter.

The order was part of last-minute wrangling in the lower courts, in the Supreme Court and on Capitol Hill as the justices are set to vote on the issue before the end of their term, presumably this week.

The Supreme Court is considering lower-court decisions that said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross violated administrative law and the enumeration clause of the Constitution by proposing to ask the citizenship question of each household. Critics, even in the Census Bureau, say the question could cause an undercount of millions of people who would be afraid to return the form.

The Maryland case would pose different questions: whether the addition would violate equal-protection guarantees and whether it is part of a conspiracy to drive down the count of minorities.

A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit voted 2 to 1 to send the case back to U.S. District Judge George Hazel so he could consider new evidence that came from the files of a deceased Republican political operative. That operative, Thomas Hofeller, had been in touch with some census officials, and he wrote a memo that said adding the question might help Republicans and white voters in subsequent redistricting decisions based on the census data.

Even as the Supreme Court decision neared, one judge on the panel suggested that Hazel order the question to be put on hold while that was hashed out.

“A preliminary injunction may be necessary to prevent the printing of the Census questionnaire from, at least from the Government’s perspective, rendering the case moot,” wrote Circuit Judge James A. Wynn Jr.

Some census officials have said a decision is needed by the end of June so the forms can be printed; others have said the absolute deadline is in the fall.

Later Tuesday, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, representing the Trump administration, told the Supreme Court that the order from the 4th Circuit “jeopardizes” the census process.

He said the court should “address the equal-protection claim and the immateriality of the Hofeller files in its disposition of the . . . case so that the lawfulness of the Secretary’s decision can be fully and finally resolved.”

He had said in an earlier letter to the Supreme Court that the claims in the Maryland case were “based on a speculative conspiracy theory that is unsupported by the evidence and legally irrelevant to demonstrating that Secretary Ross acted with a discriminatory intent.”

Challengers of the citizenship question have asked the justices to put their deliberations on hold and let Hazel and a judge in New York consider the new evidence. They noted in a letter to the court that Hazel, in an order Monday, said the new evidence “potentially connects the dots between a discriminatory purpose” and Ross’s decision.

Meanwhile, a House panel released information Tuesday that it said “points to a partisan and discriminatory effort” behind the Trump administration’s move to add the question.

In a memo to members of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, the panel’s Democratic staff said that James Uthmeier, a former senior adviser and counsel to Ross, had refused to answer “dozens of questions” but that he had nonetheless “confirmed key information” about the effort to add the citizenship question.

“Mr. Uthmeier disclosed that Secretary Ross directed him to begin examining the citizenship question within weeks of being sworn in as Secretary and that they had multiple conversations about it well before any request came from DOJ — erasing any doubt about the inaccuracy of Secretary Ross’ claim that he added the citizenship question ‘solely’ at DOJ’s request,” the memo reads.

Ross originally told Congress that his decision to add the question came solely in response to a December 2017 request from the Department of Justice, but lawsuits later produced emails showing that Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, had been pushing for the question for months before that.

The Justice Department this month dismissed the allegations that it hid the government’s true motives, calling them “frivolous.”

In a statement, a Commerce Department spokesman argued that the panel’s summary of Uthmeier’s interview “mischaracterizes what he said on multiple topics.” He did not immediately respond to a question about what specific aspects of Uthmeier’s remarks the department believes were mischaracterized.

“In addition, Mr. Uthmeier, a former senior department attorney, answered over 400 questions but declined, consistent with his ethical obligations, to discuss privileged communications,” the spokesman said. “That was entirely appropriate.”

The Oversight Committee voted this month to hold two Cabinet officials — Ross and Attorney General William P. Barr — in contempt of Congress in connection with the administration’s efforts to shield documents related to its decision to add the citizenship question.

The panel is recommending a full House vote on contempt, although the timing of such a vote remains unclear.

In a statement issued Tuesday morning, the committee’s chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), said the Trump administration “claimed that the only reason it wanted to add the citizenship question was to help the Department of Justice enforce the Voting Rights Act, but that claim has now been exposed as a pretext.”

“Official after official appearing before the Committee have refused to answer questions about the real reasons behind their effort, but the mounting evidence points to a partisan and discriminatory effort to harm the interests of Democrats and non-Whites,” he said.

The oversight panel released transcripts Tuesday of interviews with four people on the matter. They include Uthmeier; John Gore, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil rights division; Gene Hamilton, a former official in the Justice and Homeland Security departments; and Kris Kobach, a former Kansas secretary of state who once headed Trump’s voter integrity commission.

Morgan was asked on ""Fox & Friends"" about a report that Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan leaked the plans and ordered him to call off an operation that was expected to target 2,000 families living illegally in up to 10 cities across the country.

President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""

Morgan declined to address the alleged stand-down order from McAleenan, saying it would not be ""appropriate"" for him to talk about ""privileged"" discussions with McAleenan or the White House.

""Detailed information about the operation was leaked and that's egregious. The operation was compromised and when that happens, the lives of agents and officers are absolutely put at risk,"" said Morgan.

The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April — prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello’s departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up — and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

“He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,” the source told Fox News. “He has been fighting this operation since its inception.”

McAleenan's office vehemently denied the accusation, saying through a spokesperson to ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan has never leaked anything in his 18-year career.

""That's exactly what I've heard ... that the acting secretary has denied that the leaks came from him,"" said Morgan.

The Treasury Department will conduct an investigation into the circumstances leading to a delay in the production of a new $20 bill featuring a portrait of slave-turned-slave-emancipator Harriet Tubman.

In a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released Monday, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar explained the inquiry will be folded into a larger examination of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's project management processes for new note design that was already in the works.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote.

In 2016, the Treasury Department announced it would replace former President Andrew Jackson's face with that of the famed abolitionist by 2020. As NPR reported, the update would have made Tubman the first woman since Martha Washington to appear on an American currency note and the first African American. But last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the redesign will be delayed until 2028.

Schumer called on the department to launch an investigation last week, specifically asking for a review of ""the involvement of other participants in the interagency process related to the redesign — including the Secret Service, Federal Reserve, and the White House — to ensure that political considerations have not been allowed to infect the process for designing American currency.""

Delmar noted the review will seek interviews with officials, including senior executives from Treasury, BEP, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), United States Secret Service and the Board's Currency Technology Office.

He added it will take approximately 10 months.

""If, in the course of our audit work, we discover indications of the employee misconduct or other matters that warrant a referral to our Office of Investigations, we will do so expeditiously,"" Delmar said.

Before he was elected, President Trump was critical of a redesign that would eliminate Jackson's image, saying the move was motivated by ""pure political correctness.""

Jackson ""represented somebody that really was very important to this country,"" Trump said in a Today show interview. He suggested it would be ""more appropriate"" to put Tubman's image on a note of different denomination."
Student loan borrowers who say they were defrauded sue Betsy DeVos for failing to cancel their debt,https://www.cnbc.com,['Annie Nova'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/student-loan-borrowers-who-say-they-were-defrauded-sue-betsy-devos.html,"More than 150,000 former students of for-profit colleges filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Tuesday, claiming the agency is depriving them of the student debt relief to which they're legally entitled.

The plaintiffs, represented by Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending and Housing & Economic Rights Advocates, accuse the Department of Education under DeVos of failing to implement an Obama-era regulation known as ""borrower defense, "" which allows students to have their federal student loans cancelled if their school misled them or engaged in other misconduct.

""The law is clear: Students who experienced fraud should not be required to pay back federal loans that should never have been made by the Department in the first place,"" said Toby Merrill, director of Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending.

Around 160,000 people have filed claims with the government that their school defrauded them, and new applications continue to pour in. Almost all of these complaints concern for-profit schools, of which there are some 7,000 around the country and which take in around 15% of government financial aid.

However, student loan borrowers have found themselves waiting without answers. The Department of Education hasn't approved or denied a borrower defense claim since June 2018.

An audit in 2017 by the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General found that government staff working on borrower defense claims had been instructed not to submit any additional applications for approval."

The Trump administration made an unusual last-minute plea to the Supreme Court Tuesday, telling the justices that actions by lower courts make it urgent to act quickly to resolve the legality of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The Justice Department move followed an appeals court order earlier Tuesday, which returned one lawsuit over the census to a district court judge to address recently-discovered evidence that the addition of a citizenship question may have been intended to diminish the political impact of the Latino vote.

Story Continued Below

The latest tumult in the litigation was prompted by citizenship question opponents gaining access to evidence that the views of a deceased GOP redistricting expert, Thomas Hofeller, may have played a role in a Justice Department request that led to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross adding the citizenship query to the census questionnaire.

In a two-page letter to the high court, Solicitor General Noel Francisco essentially invited the justices to shut down the pending lawsuits by declaring that Ross’ decision was lawful and that further inquiry into the motives for the decision is unnecessary.

“The Fourth Circuit’s order underscores the need for this court to address the equal-protection claim and the immateriality of the Hofeller files in its disposition of the above-captioned case so that the lawfulness of the secretary’s decision can be fully and finally resolved,” Francisco wrote. He said the government needs a quick and clear decision by the end of this month in order to finalize the print version of the census forms for use next year.

However, late Tuesday night, civil rights groups fired back in a letter to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Trump administration is trying to short-circuit the normal judicial process by having the justices rule on something that hasn’t been formally presented to them.

“The Solicitor General’s request would require this Court to render an improper advisory opinion on issues that have not been briefed or argued before this Court, relating to cases that are not before this Court, based on a trial record that is not before this Court,” wrote Denise Hulett of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, or MALDEF, and Niyati Shah of Asian Americans Advancing Justice.

They also disputed the government’s claims of urgency, noting that the Census Bureau’s chief scientist testified that with additional resources the questionnaire could be finalized as late as October.

Before the Justice Department’s Supreme Court latest salvo, civil rights advocates celebrated the order from the Richmond, Va.-based 4th Circuit as an indication that arguments against the citizenship question were gaining traction.

“The always-flimsy house of cards shielding the Trump administration’s biased and nefarious intent in adding a citizenship query to Census 2020 is rapidly collapsing,” said Thomas Saenz of MALDEF. “We look forward to presenting our enhanced case demonstrating the unlawful nature of the late addition of the citizenship question, and to vindicating one of our most enduring and important constitutional principles.”

The Trump administration has maintained that it added the question to enhance Voting Rights Act enforcement, but opponents say it was done for partisan reasons to discourage citizen and noncitizen immigrants from responding to the census.

Three federal judges have ruled that the addition of the question was illegal because it was justified inadequately by the officials involved.

The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling on the issue this week. Decisions in some cases are expected Wednesday and additional releases are possible later in the week before the justices depart for their summer break.

“Given the life-and-death stakes of the current situation between the United States and Iran, we can think of no issue where it is more imperative for the department to explain its rationale for, interpretation of, and limits upon the legal authorities that have been provided by the Congress, a co-equal branch of government that the Constitution vests with the sole power to declare war,” wrote Engel and Deutch, who is the chairman of the committee’s Middle East subcommittee.

The pair requested documents by 9 a.m. Friday, adding that if the department doesn’t meet that deadline, “we will be forced to consider other measures to obtain them.”

The letter comes as U.S.-Iran tensions have escalated. On Tuesday, President Trump Donald John TrumpSenate passes .5 billion border bill, setting up fight with House 'Teflon Don' avoids the scorn of the 'family values' GOP — again Court questions whether blue states have standing to seek to uphold ObamaCare MORE threatened that an Iranian attack on “anything” American would be met with “great and overwhelming force.”

Trump’s Tuesday threat stood in contradiction to his decision last week that a U.S. military strike with an estimated 150-person death toll was not a proportional response to Iran shooting down a U.S. drone.

Trump also told Hill.TV on Monday he does not believe he needs congressional authorization to strike Iran.

Publicly and, lawmakers say, privately, administration officials have asserted a link between Iran and al Qaeda. Democrats fear the Trump administration is building a case to use the 2001 authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) for military action against Iran.

The 2001 AUMF was passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to authorize military action against al Qaeda and other perpetrators of the attacks. An AUMF was also passed in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War.

Amid the Iran tensions, Democrats and some Republicans are scrambling to constrain Trump’s ability to launch a military strike.

In the Senate, Democrats are demanding a vote on an amendment to the annual defense policy bill that would block funding for military action against Iran without congressional authorization.

At a House Foreign Affairs hearing last week, Brian Hook, the administration’s special envoy for Iran, repeatedly declined to answer questions on whether the administration believes the 2001 AUMF applies to Iran, instead telling lawmakers to submit a request to the State Department’s legal adviser.

“We hereby submit that request,” Engel and Deutch wrote Wednesday. “We will be abundantly clear: as several members stated during the June 20 hearing, Congress has not authorized the President to attack Iran under any legal theory, including under the 2001 or 2002 AUMF.”"

(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)

The Department of Justice official pictured in a viral video clip debating what specifically constitutes “sanitary conditions” under a court decision governing the detention of minors has received “several” death threats since the clip’s contents were reported by a number of news outlets last week, DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told National Review on Monday.

An edited version of Sarah Fabian’s Tuesday testimony before a panel of Ninth Circuit judges was published on Twitter by NowThis News on Friday under the headline: “A Trump official tried to argue that detained children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.”

A number of media outlets, including the The Hill and the Huffington Post, then highlighted the videos as evidence of the Trump administration’s willful mistreatment of migrants.

Fabian did not argue that children held in federal custody should not be given basic toiletries — as the viral headlines suggest — but rather suggested that the Flores Settlement agreement, a 1997 court ruling which governs the conditions under which minors can be held in federal custody, does not explicitly require the provision of those specific items.

Furthermore, Fabian’s testimony was related to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, under President Obama, violated Flores by failing to provide children with basic sanitary products. The judge presiding over that case found that those items should be provided under Flores and recommended the appointment of a special monitor to ensure CBP provided the items going forward.

The treatment of migrants at CBP holding facilities has received greater scrutiny in recent weeks amid reports that CBP and the Department of Health and Human Services, which assumes custody of the migrants after they are processed by CBP, are unequipped to safely house and provide medical care for the overwhelming number of asylum-seekers arriving at the border each day.

Administration officials have asked Congress for additional funding to address what they claim has become a crisis at the southern border. They have also pleaded for legislative reforms that would grant CBP agents greater latitude to immediately deny entry to asylum seekers if their claims are clearly illegitimate. Under current law, CBP agents must admit virtually all asylum seekers pending an immigration hearing, which as many as 90 percent of them fail to appear for.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that the Senate will vote in the coming days on a $4.5 billion aid package designed to address the government’s inability to adequately shelter the more than 100,000 asylum-seekers that have begun arriving at the southern border each month."
Mark Meadows: DOJ exploring 'unbelievably unusual activity' in final months of Obama administration,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-doj-exploring-unbelievably-unusual-activity-in-final-months-of-obama-administration,"Rep. Mark Meadows said the Justice Department is examining irregularities in the intelligence community as part of its review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

Reacting to newly released documents on changes in U.S. procedures for sharing raw intelligence, Meadows said there was ""unbelievably unusual activity"" in the final months of the Obama administration.

""I can tell you that [U.S. Attorney] John Durham and Attorney General [William] Barr are going to get to the bottom of it,"" the North Carolina Republican said Monday evening on Fox News. ""They are including in part of their surveillance — really looking at the intelligence community to make sure that justice is brought.""

On Sean Hannity's show, before Meadows was brought on to speak along with colleague Rep. Jim Jordan, attorney Jay Sekulow discussed the latest findings by his conservative watchdog group, the American Center for Law and Justice.

The records obtained by the ACLJ showed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under James Clapper pushing to increase access to raw signal intelligence before President Trump took office. The New York Times first reported the expanded access to intercepted communications in January 2017. Although Hannity and Sekulow played up the newly released records, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, as suspiciously timed and ""rushed,"" the Times noted the discussions for such changes to remove bureaucratic barriers stretched back years dating back to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Still, Jordan said he suspects there was evidence of nefarious intent, tying the changes to an interview Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer did in January 2017 in which the New York Democrat warned then-incoming President Trump that intelligence officials ""have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.""

""So this is one of those six ways,"" Jordan said, adding that the other ""ways"" include British ex-spy Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier the CIA's use of informants to make contact with members of the Trump campaign.

Barr tasked Durham, a U.S. attorney from Connecticut, with leading the inquiry focused on the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign, which the FBI began in the summer of 2016. The DOJ review of the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity he can take prosecutorial action.

Jordan noted how first Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to wrap up his investigation into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse and that could influence Durham's efforts. ""The attorney general of the United States and U.S. Attorney John Durham are doing an investigation. And they have told us this is broader than just the FBI — they're going to look at all of this,"" Jordan said.

""First, Horowitz is going to come out. His report a year ago was very good,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""Then we will see where Mr. Durham and Mr. Barr where their investigation and what they come back with.""

The Justice Department's examination of the early stages of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign has been cheered by Republicans and criticized by Democrats. After Trump granted Barr sweeping powers to declassify secret information and instructed a handful of agencies to cooperate with his investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff panned the effort as a ""disturbing"" scheme to politicize intelligence.

A DOJ letter written to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler outlining the scope of its investigation said the review is ""broad in scope and multifaceted"" and includes a look at actions both by the U.S. government and by foreigners."
10-year Treasury yield falls below 2% after weak consumer confidence data,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/us-treasury-yields-lower-ahead-of-powells-speech.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% on Tuesday as investors looked for safety following the release of much weaker-than-expected confidence data.

Short-term rates rose off their lows, however, following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard and Chairman Jerome Powell.

The yield traded at 1.994% as of 3:33 p.m. ET. The 2-year rate held steady at 1.736% while the 30-year bond yield declined to 2.52%.

Bullard said Tuesday he doesn't believe the U.S. central bank needs to lower borrowing costs by 50 basis points at its next meeting despite his push to cut rates last week.

""Just sitting here today, I think 50 basis points would be overdone,"" Bullard told Bloomberg News. ""I don't think the situation really calls for that, but I would be willing to go 25 (basis points).""

In a speech in New York, Powell reiterated that inflation — or how much prices rise throughout the economy — continues to run below the central bank's 2% objective.

""The crosscurrents have reemerged, with apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy. Our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments,"" he said at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The central bank leader also said in prepared remarks that the Fed ""is insulated from short-term political pressures — what is often referred to as our 'independence.'""

""Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests. Central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence,"" he added.

Those comments may allude to President Donald Trump's recent attacks on the Fed and its monetary policies, which he believes are preventing stronger economic growth and keeping a lid on the stock market. Trump has also said the central bank's interest rate strategy undermines the administration's negotiating position in trade deliberations with China.

The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 121.5 in June, reaching its lowest level since September 2017. Conference Board senior director Lynn Franco said escalating trade fears appear to have ""shaken consumers' confidence.""

""Those survey readings of higher consumer confidence were just a lot of hot air as it turns out,"" Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in a note. ""If the Fed had had this almost ten point drop in the confidence number last week it may well have tipped the scale and led them to cut interest rates."""
USDA Confirms Silage Corn Can Be Planted On Prevent Plant Acres,https://www.dairyherd.com,['Anna-Lisa Laca'],,,,https://www.dairyherd.com/article/usda-confirms-silage-corn-can-be-planted-prevent-plant-acres,"This week, farmers in much of the eastern Corn Belt will be eligible to plant cover crops as the late-plant period on prevent plant acres ends there on June 26. Following last week’s announcement about the potential to harvest cover crops on September 1 instead of November 1 many farmers, particularly in the upper Midwest, started to wonder if silage corn would be eligible. According to Richard Flournoy, deputy administrator of product management for the USDA-Risk Management Agency (RMA), silage corn can be eligible for planting on prevent plant acres.

“A cover crop for crop insurance purposes, we have a broad definition, and it's generally many things that any crop that can be planted for erosion control, soil improvement, or any other type of conservation practice,” he told AgriTalk host Chip Flory.

If producers have questions about what could be considered a cover crop in their state, Flournoy suggests a visit to the local National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) office. Individual states can have a list of what crops can be considered cover crops.

Additionally, he says an “ag expert” can deem a crop eligible by determining the prospective crop meets all the cover crop definitions.

“We have on our website a link to all the folks who can be considered an expert,” he said. “A certified crop advisor is [someone] that could say in your area, corn for silage could be a cover crop. One key distinction there is it can't be corn for grain or seed, as long as it's for silage it meets that cover crop definition.”"
New EPA rule could expand number of Trump officials weighing in on FOIA requests,https://thehill.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450169-new-epa-rule-would-allow-more-administration-officials-to-weigh-in-on-foia-requests,"More political appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could soon have the authority to weigh in on public information requests.

The rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as Wednesday and will not allow for a public comment period.

According to the new language in the FOIA rule signed by EPA chief Andrew Wheeler last week, the administrator and other officials would be allowed to review all materials that fit a FOIA request criteria, known as responsive documents, and then decide “whether to release or withhold a record or a portion of a record on the basis of responsiveness or under one or more exemptions under the FOIA, and to issue ‘no records’ responses.”

Lawyers outside the agency who specialize in FOIA requests say the “no records” response could lead to a situation where records seekers are being told there are no documents meeting their search criteria, even if they were found by EPA staffers who handle FOIA requests, with those documents ultimately withheld by political appointees.

“It’s allowing political appointees to make the decision that records someone has presumably identified as being responsive are not actually responsive. That theoretically would allow sensitive documents, that the agency doesn't want to send you, to withhold those records -- and that should shake out eventually in a lawsuit if that's what's happening,” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights.

EPA strongly disputed that interpretation, saying the new rule does not grant appointees the ability to label responsive documents as non-responsive.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” said Michael Abboud, EPA spokesman.

Topic, who reviewed the text of the rule, said it’s common for FOIA officers at government agencies to initially find responsive documents to requests that other officials later dispute in terms of qualifying for public release.

He said the new language in the EPA rule suggests officials may have the opportunity to prevent release of the documents on the basis that they don’t meet the criteria, and are therefore non-responsive.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” he said. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

EPA officials who would be authorized to make that decision include the administrator, deputy administrators, assistant administrators, deputy assistant administrators, regional administrators, deputy regional administrators, general counsel, deputy general counsels, regional counsels, deputy regional counsels and the inspector general or delegates of those individuals, according to the final rule.

The latest version differs from the previous rule, which granted the same rights to the “head of an office, or that individual's designee.”

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“It’s exceptionally difficult to litigate on the ‘basis of responsiveness.’ There is no record,” said Kevin Bell, staff counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “FOIA litigation is always pretty one-sided, there is no discovery … now they are just saying, ‘Oh, it’s not responsive. Oh, we don’t have to tell you.’”

Bell equated EPA’s new FOIA rule to a similar regulatory action unveiled earlier this year at the Interior Department, called an “awareness review,” which allows political appointees 72 hours to review documents that mention them by name prior to release.

“It seems like EPA is doing about the same thing,” he said. “On the ‘basis of responsiveness’ and ‘no records responses’ are both things that we've seen in the environmental FOIA community time and again.""

EPA officials characterized the rule change as a much-needed update to regulations as stipulated by 2007, 2009 and 2016 congressional updates to FOIA processing. The Obama administration failed to change its FOIA regulations as charged by Congress, and the new rule brings EPA into compliance.

“The changes in today’s rule bring EPA’s regulations into compliance with non-discretionary provisions of the amended statute and reflect changes in the agency’s organization, procedure, or practice,” said a senior career EPA official who helped devise the regulation.

Critics argue the new rule specifically bestows more powers on political appointees to weigh in on specific FOIA cases.

“This new notice turns that upside down by substituting a wide array of political appointees for the career officials that heretofore have responded to FOIA requests for records in the possession of their offices,” said John Walke, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“The rule changes, for the first time, place an army of EPA political appointees as the gatekeepers for determining whether Americans receive responsive government records in response to FOIA requests.”

The EPA official said the change to the “final determinations” authority in EPA’s new rule largely combines two previous FOIA rules and is not a significant change.

“This provision is not intended to be broader than the old regulations, which covered the subject in several provisions,” the official said.

“The old regulations state that ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for a record of that office or other agency records when appropriate.’ All positions listed in the updated regulations fall within the ordinary meaning of ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee,’” the official added.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” according to a statement provided by EPA on the rule change.

The agency official described the change as a way to align regional office FOIA responses with the national office.

“We took a look across the agency and saw there were different practices as to how they reached out to requesters in the first instance after a request has come in. We saw an opportunity to create greater uniformity. One of the practices we’ll be adopting as this goes into effect is reaching out consistently to FOIA requesters with an initial letter,” the official said.

Bell warned that the new order could allow EPA political appointees to better control the documents ultimately released by regional offices. He said regional offices often have less political pressure to withhold more responsive materials.

“This is just making sure that every FOIA request that gets reviewed gets taken down the hall or next door to Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerTop EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe Trump pick brings scrutiny to 'revolving door' between Pentagon, industry Overnight Energy: New EPA rule could expand officials weighing in on FOIA requests | Trump plan to strip conservation fund gets bipartisan pushback | Agriculture chief downplays climate concerns MORE's office,” Bell said. “Basically, anytime a FOIA request goes up to the administration you can extend however long it will take and reduce what you get back.”

The EPA official said the changes would neither speed up nor slow down the FOIA process. Under President Trump Donald John TrumpSenate passes .5 billion border bill, setting up fight with House 'Teflon Don' avoids the scorn of the 'family values' GOP — again Court questions whether blue states have standing to seek to uphold ObamaCare MORE, the agency has experienced a huge uptick in FOIA requests and major backlog in processing, which has been exacerbated in some instances by a lack of funding to hire new staff to help with those requests.

“I don’t think this will change the speed or response at all. We’re trying to be consistent with outreach to requesters and not anticipating this will slow down our response,” the senior official said. “Our aspiration is to come into compliance with the statue, in the most straight and most direct way possible, without coming into any discretionary changes with the statue.”

The EPA has come under criticism for its handling of FOIA requests under Trump’s presidency. Last fall, agency heads clashed with top Democratic lawmakers over an admittance by then acting EPA Administrator Wheeler’s chief of staff to investigators with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that certain FOIA requests were put under more intense scrutiny because they were “politically charged.”

Rep. Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsCummings on Conway Hatch Act violations: 'This is about right and wrong' House panel votes to subpoena Kellyanne Conway over Hatch Act testimony TSA to send hundreds of workers to southern border to enforce immigration policies MORE (Md.), who at the time was the panel’s top Democrat and is now chairman, accused the EPA of impeding requests.

In a letter to lawmakers at the time, Kevin Minoli, the EPA’s principal deputy general counsel, defended the EPA’s decision to notify senior officials throughout the FOIA process regarding high-profile requests.

“This ‘awareness review’ process does not itself violate FOIA and can be completed without causing undue delay,” Minoli said.

Inspector General wants to know if USDA concealed worker safety data,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'June At Am', 'Kimberly Kindy Is A National Investigative Reporter For The Washington Post.

Under a proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

The Office of Inspector General is evaluating whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture concealed information and used flawed data to develop and promote a new hog inspection system that would shift many food-safety tasks from federal inspectors to pork industry employees.

The USDA’s inspector general, Phyllis Fong, notified 16 members of Congress on Friday that her office has launched the probe in response to concerns the lawmakers raised in March, according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.

Under the proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want, a provision that has worker safety advocates concerned that worker injury rates would rise. The USDA said in a proposed rule — which if finalized would create the new system — that its data shows worker injury rates probably would be lower than those at traditional plants where limits are placed on line speeds.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the second-highest-ranking Senate Democrat, and more than a dozen other Democrats sought the inspector general’s probe after two university experts reviewed the USDA’s data and analysis and concluded “it is impossible” for the department to “draw any statistically valid conclusion about worker injury rate differences.”

The data was not released until months after the 60-day public comment period for the rule had closed in April 2018 and only after Freedom of Information Act requests were filed by a Texas State University researcher and a worker safety advocacy group, the National Employment Law Project.



Durbin, who says he worked in a slaughterhouse for a year as a college student, said Monday he is glad the inspector general is heeding his request, adding that line speeds are “directly linked to worker safety.”

“Bowing to the meatpacking industry, the USDA relied on sketchy data to justify a major inspections change that could create unsafe working environments at pork processing plants in America,” Durbin said in a prepared statement for The Post. “I am concerned that the USDA also tried to hide this data from the public.”

[Pork industry soon will have more power over meat inspections]

Debbie Berkowitz, a worker-safety expert with the law project, asked USDA officials to extend the public comment period to allow others to examine and remark on USDA’s data and its worker safety analysis, records show. No extension was granted.

A Post analysis of the public comments showed that out of 84,000 public remarks made on the rule, 87 percent were either opposed or expressed negative opinions about the proposal. In numerous instances, groups asked for additional information to properly evaluate the proposal.

“The bottom line here is USDA is rushing this rule through and really abandoning any effort to be transparent,” Berkowitz said in an interview.

USDA declined to comment on the Inspector General probe. In earlier statements, it has said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not USDA, has the “statutory and regulatory authority to promote workplace safety and health.”

Berkowitz, who was OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said the USDA does not “police companies about worker safety.” However, she said, “They should not be in the business of giving a green light to something that could cause further injury to workers.”

Illness rates for people who work in the meatpacking plants — including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis — are 16 times higher than the average for all other industries, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The proposed hog-slaughter rule is based on a study that began 20 years ago, ultimately including five large plants. Efforts to expand the program have sputtered under past administrations, but Trump administration officials have pushed forward with the rule and hoped to finalize it this summer.

The USDA expects 40 of 612 hog plants will use the new system. Collectively, agriculture officials say, these plants will account for 90 percent of the pork produced in the United States.

In her letter to Durbin and other lawmakers, Fong said her office will seek to determine whether the USDA did the following: complied with federal public transparency requirements; made information about its preliminary analysis on worker safety clearly accessible to the public during the comment period; adhered to the department’s own data quality guidelines; came to a reasonable determination about the reliability of OSHA injury data; and consulted with OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as it developed the rule.

The inquiry is expected to be complete by the end of the year, an inspector general spokeswoman said.

On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed a 2020 appropriations bill that provides funding for USDA. However, the bill also requires that the Inspector General perform a more extensive data review before any funds are used for the new inspection system.

That requirement, proposed by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), would also include an examination of USDA data the department used to conclude that pork produced under the new system would be as safe as pork produced at plants using the traditional inspection system. It would also examine data USDA used to conclude the increased line speeds would not impact animal welfare. DeLauro called the proposed rule a “giveaway to large corporate meatpackers.”

In response to the inspector general’s probe, DeLauro said it is “an important first step toward ensuring the swine inspection rule changes are based on sound science by opening an investigation into the department’s use of flawed worker safety data. However, the OIG must expand their investigation to encompass all data USDA used to develop the proposed rule — as would be required by a provision I included in this year’s USDA funding bill.”

In an earlier statement, the North American Meat Institute, an industry group that supports the proposal, said: “This rule is founded on years of sound scientific data and experience. NAMI supports risk-based, science-driven food safety systems. Consumers deserve no less.”

Oregon plant that discharged tons of ammonia signs consent decree with U.S. Justice Department,https://www.oregonlive.com,"['Maxine Bernstein', 'Mbernstein Oregonian.Com', 'The Oregonian Oregonlive']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2019/06/oregon-plant-that-discharged-tons-of-ammonia-signs-consent-decree-with-federal-justice-department.html,"A company that failed to report a large-scale ammonia discharge from its plant just outside St. Helens and annual ammonia emission estimates has entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay a $492,000 fine and buy $931,500 in fire emergency equipment for area responders to handle environmental emergencies.

Dyno Nobel’s civil settlement with federal officials comes a year after the company paid a $250,000 fine for releasing more than six tons of anhydrous ammonia vapor into the air from the plant over three days starting on July 30, 2015 in a separate criminal case.

“We have worked cooperatively with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over the past eight-plus years to address these matters. Independent of its work with EPA, Dyno Nobel has implemented extensive upgrades to the facility to better manage emissions and improve our reporting protocols,” Jeffrey Droubay, the company’s senior vice president of legal and business affairs, said in a statement. “The health and safety of our employees and communities in which we operate is our first priority.''

Federal regulators accused the plant of failing to report hazardous releases of ammonia in a timely way, failing to accurately report annual releases of ammonia and failing to comply with all requirements to reduce the risk of a chemical accident at its plant, according to court records.

Under the decree, the Delaware-based company must hire an independent auditor to conduct regular compliance reviews, submit a revised risk management plan and adopt environmental safety procedures including the purchase of the emergency gear for Columbia Fire & Rescue and the Scappoose Rural Fire District.

The company must buy 50 sets of personal protective equipment, commonly known as “turnout gear,” for Columbia Fire & Rescue, 74 sets of self-contained breathing apparatus for Columbia Fire and 52 sets of the breathing apparatus for Scappoose Rural Fire District.

The Environmental Protection Agency will review all steps the company must take under the decree. If the company violates any of the required changes, it could face further financial penalties ranging from $1,000 per violation per day to $7,500 per violation per day.

A federal judge will retain oversight over the consent decree until the settlement’s terms are completed. It will remain in effect for at least three years after the reforms are adopted.

Dyno Nobel is located on 90 acres of Deer Island near St. Helens, employs 80 people and operates around-the-clock every day of the year. The Oregon plant makes ammonia and nitric acid, which is used in fertilizer, under high pressure and temperature, and other chemical products for fertilizer, refrigerant, and other agricultural and industrial applications, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

In a separate settlement reached last year with federal prosecutors, the company acknowledged that it didn’t immediately notify the National Response Center, which is required under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, known as CERCLA, of its excessive ammonia discharge in 2015.

Company officials knew the excessive ammonia emissions were occurring but made no effort to alert authorities until Aug. 7, 2015, more than a week after the first discharge, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan Bounds and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Karla Gebel Perrin.

Anhydrous ammonia is a pungent gas with suffocating fumes. Exposure to high concentrations can lead to death, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The emissions triggered numerous complaints from neighboring residents in Columbia County, who reported foul odors, eye irritation and difficulty breathing, prosecutors said.

“Dyno Nobel has taken actions to address air emission issues over the past few years including tens of millions of dollars in new technology, investments, and upgrades to improve the facility’s ability to control emissions,’’ Droubay said in the statement.

Treasury watchdog to review delay of Harriet Tubman $20 bill design,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Elinor Aspegren', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/25/treasury-opens-investigation-tubman-redesign/1556955001/,"CLOSE

The U.S. Treasury's Office of the Inspector General will review the delay of a new $20 bill design featuring abolitionist hero Harriet Tubman, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar said in a letter released Monday.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.

The Tubman redesign was initially scheduled for 2020 and coincided with the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment which gave women the right to vote.

But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last month that the redesign would be delayed so the $10 bill and the $50 bill could be redesigned first to make it harder for the bills to be counterfeited. He said those bills will be introduced before a redesigned $20 bill.

A Treasury Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement that process of issuing a new bill is not political. The security of the currency and combating counterfeiting are the only concerns considered in the redesign schedule, the statement says.

Last Month: Mnuchin: $20 bill redesign with Tubman on hold

Announcement: Harriet Tubman replacing Andrew Jackson on $20 bill

The Office of the Inspector General said their audit will be looking into security measures at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The effort is expected to take 10 months, according to the letter.

On June 19, Schumer asked the office to investigate whether the delay was driven by political reasons.

Schumer said in a news release that he is pleased the Treasury Department is looking into the issue.

“There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population, and the previous administration’s plan to put New Yorker Harriet Tubman, on the $20 note was a long overdue way to recognize that disparity, and rectify it,” he said.

Several Democrats criticized Monday the Trump administration after POLITICO reported the Agriculture Department has largely stopped promoting its own climate science.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who's also running for president, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue expressing ""deep concern and alarm"" over the report. The Minnesota Democrat asked the department to explain its justification for not publicizing certain studies and to immediately release ""any [Agricultural Research Service] study related to climate science that was ignored, downplayed, or its findings held back.""

""When federally-funded scientific research is curtailed or withheld because of its attention to the consequences of climate change, farmers are cut out of participating in climate solutions and, at worst, unable to effectively mitigate and adapt their operations and infrastructure to its effects,"" she wrote.

Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) tweeted the story, calling it ""outrageous.""

""Climate change is an urgent threat to our farmers,"" she said. ""The Administration should not be burying vital research that will help us understand and combat the effects of climate change.""

Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, also took to Twitter to criticize the department. The Vermont Democrat said USDA scientists lead the world in studying the effects of climate change.

""While our farmers fight against #ClimateChange, #USDA is shamefully fighting against #science,"" he wrote.

In addition to Klobuchar, two other 2020 contenders logged their disapproval. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) tweeted about the story twice today and issued a statement.

The Trump Administration’s attempts to suppress climate science are unacceptable. This isn’t a political game — this is the livelihoods and futures of farmers & ranchers across the country.

""Our farmers and ranchers know as well as anyone the devastating effects of climate change, because they're living with the realities of droughts in places like Colorado and floods in places like Iowa,"" he said.

VA health care workers say managers are trying to silence them on veteran care,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/25/veterans-affairs-health-care-workers-say-punished-speaking-out/1549658001/,"CLOSE Radiology technologist Jeff Dettbarn, alleges thousands of tests at the Iowa City VA were improperly canceled, potentially risking veterans’ lives. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Health care professionals from the Department of Veterans Affairs testified at a congressional hearing Tuesday that they are being punished for reporting problems with VA care, to the detriment of veterans and despite proclamations by the Trump administration that whistleblowers are celebrated and not scorned.

A physician from the Phoenix area, a psychologist from Baltimore and a CT technologist from Iowa City, Iowa, said they believe managers retaliated against them and tried to stop them from disclosing more issues at VA medical centers.

Their claims, first made in interviews with USA TODAY last week, contradict assertions by agency leaders and President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order and a law creating a VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection within months of taking office. The office, he said, would ""make sure that they're protected.""

The VA inspector general has since launched an investigation of the office's handling of whistleblower cases. A report from the Government Accountability Office last year raised concerns about the office allowing employees accused of wrongdoing by whistleblowers to be involved in investigating the accusations.

The employees who testified Tuesday have a track record of raising concerns about VA health care – and all three have been stripped of patient care and oversight duties.

Dr. Katherine Mitchell reported inadequate training and triage in the emergency room of the Phoenix VA. Psychologist Minu Aghevli reported improper removal of veterans from wait lists for opioid-addiction treatment at the Baltimore VA. CT tech Jeff Dettbarn revealed administrators had mass-canceled diagnostic test orders at the Iowa City VA without determining if veterans still needed the tests.

Dettbarn has been assigned to paperwork duties since his revelations in 2017, Aghevli was transferred to a data entry post in April and Mitchell has been kept from patient safety issues and oversight for nearly five years.

Mitchell said the retaliation against her and others who speak out has sent a signal to other VA employees to keep their mouths shut and ""jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system.""

Aghevli likewise said she feels her treatment is ""being used as a threat against other employees"" and has a ""chilling effect"" on their speaking up about problems.

“It has a terrible effect on veterans,” she said.

""For every person who wants to speak up, there are thousands that have tried, only to be removed, demoted, (and) silence(d),"" Dettbarn said.

They recommended that more resources and staff be provided to an outside federal agency that helps whistleblowers, the Office of Special Counsel, and an independent board that vets employee disciplinary appeals. They called for an overhaul of the Trump-created office.

Jacqueline Garrick, founder of nonprofit peer-support group Whistleblowers of America, testified that they are not alone – almost 200 VA employees have contacted her since 2017 complaining of retaliation for speaking out about problems at the agency.

""VA employees are ignored, attacked,"" she said, adding that the VA whistleblower office has not been the solution. ""Instead, it causes more harm,"" Garrick said.

Tom Devine, legal director at the Government Accountability Project, another nonprofit group that helps whistleblowers, said the office lacks comprehensive regulations and works on an ""ad hoc"" basis.

""This maximizes confusion and enables arbitrary action,"" Devine said.

VA spokesman Randall Noller told USA TODAY last week that an assistant secretary who took over the office in January, Tamara Bonzanto, has been ""working on a number of key improvements.""

""These include providing timelier resolutions, more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers,"" he said.

"Homeland Security, other federal agencies remain vulnerable to cyberattacks, Senate panel finds",https://www.dispatch.com,"['Jessica Wehrman', 'Jessica Wehrman Dispatch Washington Bureau']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190625/homeland-security-other-federal-agencies-remain-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks-senate-panel-finds,"The Department of Homeland Security — the very agency tasked with fighting cyberattacks — and seven other agencies have failed to address the vulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure, a Senate subcommittee chaired by Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has found.

WASHINGTON — Federal government offices are wildly vulnerable to cyberattacks, with the number of cyber incidents reported by federal agencies increasing more than 1,300 percent between 2006 and 2015.

But those being attacked are doing very little to protect themselves, according to the results of a 10-month Senate investigation of eight federal agencies.

The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, found that the Department of Homeland Security — the very agency tasked with fighting cyberattacks — and seven other agencies have failed to address the vulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure, leaving them susceptible to cyberattack and Americans’ personal information vulnerable to theft.

The problems range from systems so antiquated that they can’t be updated with new security patches to agencies that year after year fail to protect the personal information of millions of Americans.

The subcommittee studied 10 years’ worth of government audits of the IT systems of the Homeland Security, State, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Health and Human Services and Education departments and the Social Security Administration.

Their investigation comes after a surge in data breaches in the federal government, with agencies including the Postal Service, the IRS and the White House reporting attacks.

In 2015, for example, a hacker broke into government databases to gain access to 22 million security clearance files from the Office of Personnel Management.

In 2017 alone, federal agencies reported 35,277 cyber incidents.

Federal agencies often have access to sensitive information because of the very nature of what they do.

The Department of Education collects financial data on students and parents applying for college loans.

Disabled Americans must provide years of health records to prove they are entitled to disability benefits from the Social Security Administration.

And homeowners must provide payroll and savings information to HUD to qualify for home loans.

Congress tasked agencies with securing their information technology networks as far back as 2002, and asked each agency’s inspector general to annually audit compliance with basic cybersecurity standards.

But the subcommittee found that most of the agencies studied were failing to comply with even the most basic standards, including properly protecting personally identifiable information.

Five agencies did not maintain a comprehensive and accurate list of IT assets, meaning they had no idea which applications were operating on their networks.

All eight agencies failed to install security patches and other updates to prevent their systems from being vulnerable to attack.

In the most recent audits, seven of the eight agencies failed to provide for the adequate protection of personally identifiable information.

And all of the agencies used legacy systems that were so old that vendors no longer support or issue updates to patch cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Homeland Security, for example, uses Windows 2003 on some of its systems.

The setup used by HUD to initiate and track loan-case numbers and associated data is so old that lenders are unable to submit loan applications electronically and must instead send hard copies through the mail.

In some cases, Social Security’s system to hold retirement and disability information on millions of Americans uses a programming language developed in the 1950s and 1960s — a language that will become increasingly obsolete as the IT professionals who know the language retire.

Some of the agencies are particularly susceptible to attack. The Department of Education, for example, has been unable to prevent unauthorized outside devices from easily connecting to the agency’s network since 2011.

In its 2018 audit, that department’s inspector general found that it had been able to restrict unauthorized access to 90 seconds — still enough time for a hacker to “launch an attack or gain intermittent access to internal network resources that could lead to” exposing the agency’s data.

Portman said federal agencies “have failed at implementing basic cybersecurity practices, leaving classified, personal and sensitive information unsafe and vulnerable to theft.”

“The federal government can, and must, do a better job of shoring up our defenses against the rising cybersecurity threats,” he said.

The report makes a list of recommendations aimed at securing government IT systems. Among them are ones urging federal agencies to consolidate security processes and capabilities in order to better detect cybersecurity incidents and another calling on each agency to give broader authority and latitude to their chief information officer to make organization-wide decisions regarding cybersecurity.

Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, the ranking member of the subcommittee, said the Office of Management and Budget — the agency responsible for cybersecurity efforts across government — “must provide the necessary leadership to ensure that agencies are staying vigilant and prioritizing good cybersecurity practices.”

“We know that the threats posed by cyberattacks continue to evolve and grow every day, so it is crucial that agencies across our government prioritize efforts to better protect their networks from hackers,” he said.

His LinkedIn profile lists “June 2019” as the end of his Treasury job, without providing a specific date. Bloomberg wrote last week about Phillips’ departure.

Phillips’ LinkedIn profile now says: “He supported Secretary Mnuchin in the development of policy for comprehensive housing finance reform.”

What it doesn't say: Oversaw the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Phillips, the ultimate Wall Street insider, was seen by some as the great hope for reforming and releasing the government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, from government conservatorship. In a New York Times story last month saying he planned to leave, Phillips said he would return to Wall Street but didn’t have a job lined up yet. His LinkedIn profile doesn’t list a current position.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said earlier this month that he hoped Treasury’s plan to release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would come by the end of June. The White House is reviewing a draft of the proposal, Bloomberg reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter. The two mortgage giants guarantee more than half of the outstanding residential mortgages in the U.S., according to Federal Reserve data.

The departure of Phillips “matters” to the prospects of getting Fannie and Freddie back to anything resembling the footing they had before the housing crisis a decade ago, Jaret Seiberg, Managing Director at Cowen Group, said in a note to clients on Friday.

“Phillips was one of the few senior folks at Treasury with the clout to negotiate on GSE reform,” Seiberg wrote in the note. “While we believe he finished the Treasury white paper on GSE reform before he left, his departure means that Phillips cannot push the National Economic Council to approve the document. More broadly, Mnuchin has few other senior advisers and he devotes much of his time to trade disputes. The argument is that Mnuchin simply lacks the time and energy needed to advance a housing finance reform plan given the controversy that will surround any plan to recap and release Fannie and Freddie.”

After more than three decades at Wall Street firms, some of it spent as a mortgage trader, Phillips joined the Trump administration in 2017. He left a position as managing director at BlackRock to become Mnuchin’s top housing advisor. Prior to BlackRock, he held managing director positions at both Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, according to LinkedIn.

Last year, Phillips said in a speech at the Mortgage Bankers Association’s annual conference in Washington D.C. that the Trump administration wants to end the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie that began in July 2008 during the financial crisis.

“The administration advocates ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and returning them to private ownership,” Phillips said. “Their charters should be removed from statute and their operations should be overseen by the primary regulator that has the authority to approve additional guarantors to introduce competition into the secondary mortgage market.”"
Why weak leadership at the Defense Department could lead us to war in Iran,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Michael J. Stricof', 'Michael J. Stricof Is A Doctoral Candidate Studying American History At Aix-Marseille Université.']",06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/06/24/why-weak-leadership-department-defense-could-lead-us-war-iran/,"

A sign for the Defense Department at the Pentagon. (Patrick Semansky/AP)

Michael J. Stricof is a doctoral candidate studying American history at Aix-Marseille Université.

Tensions are escalating between the United States and Iran. After Iranians shot down an American drone, President Trump weighed the option of a retaliatory strike, which he then called off because of potential casualties. Yet as bellicose rhetoric builds, the prospect of war continues to loom.

The possibility of war with Iran has sent commentators scrambling for comparisons to the second Iraq War. Destroyed ships in the Gulf of Oman also call up memories of the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which led to open American involvement in Vietnam in 1964. However, there is another historical comparison that may better capture the state of the current leadership in Washington and the risk of a different, dangerous path to war.

In December 1992, lame duck President George H.W. Bush committed U.S. troops to a U.N.-sanctioned humanitarian relief operation in Somalia. Operation Restore Hope was supposed to be a relatively simple mission: Deliver food and medical supplies to a war-torn country, but stay out of the fighting. It was the sort of operation that many were rallying behind in the immediate post-Cold War era; President-elect Bill Clinton publicly supported the move.

Ten months later, however, on Oct. 3, 1993, two Black Hawk helicopters carrying elite Delta Force soldiers, assigned to capture the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, were shot down over Mogadishu. This incident, infamous for images of mutilated bodies dragged through the streets, ended with 13 Americans killed and one captured. A mission designed to offer peaceful aid had slid, almost unnoticed, into a Special Forces operation and ended with a firefight in the streets and an American defeat.

While in many ways a very different situation than the current tensions building around Iran, the Somalia example reveals that weak leadership at the Defense Department, which we have again today, can be catastrophic in a period of potential conflict.

How did a humanitarian assistance mission lead to a Special Operations debacle? After all, American soldiers weren’t supposed to be looking for firefights; they were supposed to be distributing food. While a considerable amount of the shifting mission had to do with changing U.N. missions, on the American side the problem was due to a lack of leadership, notably in the Defense Department itself.

When Bush committed troops, he knew he would be leaving an ongoing military operation in the hands of his successor. This meant near-immediate turnover at every level of management except for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where Colin Powell would remain chairman until September 1993.

In addition to the usual changeover at the beginning of an administration, Clinton’s team got off to a rocky start because Defense Secretary Les Aspin was largely ineffective. He had no major management experience. While he had been chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, his collegial style did not mesh well with the tightly run Pentagon. Aspin also spent much of his first six months in office distracted by social issues, forced to handle the firestorm over Clinton’s attempt to allow gays to serve openly in the military, leading to the mixed “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, and addressing women in combat roles and sexual assault in the military following the 1991 Tailhook aviators conference scandal.

Aspin wasn’t the only one distracted. In the first half of 1993, no one in Washington was really paying attention. Clinton was focused on his domestic agenda, including his struggles to implement new deficit reduction measures. National security adviser Tony Lake meanwhile was preoccupied with elaborating a broader strategy of “Engagement and Enlargement,” which encouraged new post-Cold War deployments. That left the Defense Department to resist the “mission creep” that eventually led to disaster.

In traditional circumstances, this would have been fine. The Defense Department is historically conservative about the use of American military power. Institutional concerns with maintaining resources and a ready force for real threats to American security make it resistant to other missions, often leading it to push back against political or diplomatic leaders hoping to bring U.S. force to bear as a solution to less-than-existential threats.

Some of this traditional dynamic played out in the early months of the Clinton administration. Famously, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright, who supported more direct U.S. involvement in Bosnia, frustratedly asked Powell, “What’s the point of having this superb military that you’re always talking about if we can’t use it?” In his memoir, Powell described his reaction: “I thought I would have an aneurysm. American GIs were not toy soldiers to be moved around on some sort of global game board.”

But in the fall of 1993, Powell was on his way out. He had finished his time as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was preparing to retire at the end of September, just a few days before the Black Hawk incident.

Aspin meanwhile was focused on rolling out a major policy review. He would later be blamed for not approving additional backup for the Army Rangers and Delta Force before the mission to capture Aidid began. Although there is debate among historians about the importance of Aspin’s decision, it gave the Clinton administration somewhere to lay the blame.

In reality, however, as journalist David Halberstam put it, it was “the vagueness and drift in the administration’s policy” that deserved more of the blame for the Battle of Mogadishu. The lack of leadership in the Pentagon, while the president and the national security adviser focused on other things, allowed the mission to creep toward outright combat without any real debate over the potential risks.

The debacle, which outraged Americans, cost Aspin his job. The Clinton administration eventually found its footing in defense, although not before overlooking genocide in Rwanda and retreating from Haiti while the shock of defeat in Somalia wore off.

Today, circumstances are in some ways very different from 1993. It’s not the first year of the president’s term, and an experienced national security adviser, John Bolton, is in place. But there is again weak leadership at the Defense Department at a precarious moment. The well-respected secretary Jim Mattis departed in December over policy disagreements with the president. Acting secretary of defense Patrick Shanahan proved weak, uncomfortably trying to please Trump by justifying the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, which Mattis had refused to do, prompting his resignation. Now Shanahan, too, is out, and a new acting secretary, Army Secretary Mark T. Esper, is in.

Trump has said he doesn’t want to start a war with Iran, but he has also been sending mixed messages. And the weakness at the Defense Department could prove especially significant in the bureaucratic negotiations that shape the president’s agenda.

Bolton has long been an unabashed hawk, and the fear in policymaking circles is that he will push toward war. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, another hawk on Iran, is also sounding threats. Normally, the defense secretary could be counted on to argue against committing U.S. troops. However, a Defense Department lacking leadership leaves a power vacuum that makes it possible that these other voices will win out.

Inattention in the Pentagon also can lead to poorly managed situations that may lead to unplanned, explosive moments of conflict, as the retaliatory strike Trump called off Thursday illustrated. One Gulf of Tonkin-like incident with few voices arguing for caution could very possibly lead to open war, and a poorly managed war at that. Iran is not the only concern; the administration has practiced brinkmanship with North Korea, Venezuela and, via trade policy, China. Although the 1993 Somalia case ended with American withdrawal, history is full of examples that went the other way."
Agriculture Department buries studies showing dangers of climate change,https://www.politico.com,['Helena Bottemiller Evich'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/23/agriculture-department-climate-change-1376413,"poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/1784/1155968404_6052222371001_6052221177001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true President Donald Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue have both expressed skepticism about climate change and appear to have suppressed research efforts on the topic. POLITICO Investigation Agriculture Department buries studies showing dangers of climate change The Trump administration has stopped promoting government-funded research into how higher temperatures can damage crops and pose health risks.

The Trump administration has refused to publicize dozens of government-funded studies that carry warnings about the effects of climate change, defying a longstanding practice of touting such findings by the Agriculture Department’s acclaimed in-house scientists.

The studies range from a groundbreaking discovery that rice loses vitamins in a carbon-rich environment — a potentially serious health concern for the 600 million people world-wide whose diet consists mostly of rice — to a finding that climate change could exacerbate allergy seasons to a warning to farmers about the reduction in quality of grasses important for raising cattle.

Story Continued Below

All of these studies were peer-reviewed by scientists and cleared through the non-partisan Agricultural Research Service, one of the world’s leading sources of scientific information for farmers and consumers.

None of the studies were focused on the causes of global warming – an often politically charged issue. Rather, the research examined the wide-ranging effects of rising carbon dioxide, increasing temperatures and volatile weather.

The administration, researchers said, appears to be trying to limit the circulation of evidence of climate change and avoid press coverage that may raise questions about the administration’s stance on the issue.

“The intent is to try to suppress a message — in this case, the increasing danger of human-caused climate change,” said Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. “Who loses out? The people, who are already suffering the impacts of sea level rise and unprecedented super storms, droughts, wildfires and heat waves.”

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who has expressed skepticism about climate science in the past and allegedly retaliated against in-house economists whose findings contradicted administration policies, declined to comment. A spokesperson for USDA said there have been no directives within the department that discouraged the dissemination of climate-related science.

“Research continues on these subjects and we promote the research once researchers are ready to announce the findings, after going through the appropriate reviews and clearances,” the spokesperson said in an email.

“USDA has several thousand scientists and over 100,000 employees who work on myriad topics and issues; not every single finding or piece of work solicits a government press release,” the spokesperson added.

However, a POLITICO investigation revealed a persistent pattern in which the Trump administration refused to draw attention to findings that show the potential dangers and consequences of climate change, covering dozens of separate studies. The administration’s moves flout decades of department practice of promoting its research in the spirit of educating farmers and consumers around the world, according to an analysis of USDA communications under previous administrations.

The lack of promotion means research from scores of government scientists receives less public attention. Climate-related studies are still being published without fanfare in scientific journals, but they can be very difficult to find. The USDA doesn’t post all its studies in one place.

Since Trump took office in January 2017, the Agricultural Research Service has issued releases for just two climate-related studies, both of which had findings that were favorable to the politically powerful meat industry. One found that beef production makes a relatively small contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and another that removing animal products from the diet for environmental reasons would likely cause widespread nutritional problems. The agency issued a third press release about soy processing that briefly mentioned greenhouse gas emissions, noting that reducing fossil fuel use or emissions was “a personal consideration” for farmers.

By contrast, POLITICO found that in the case of the groundbreaking rice study USDA officials not only withheld their own prepared release, but actively sought to prevent dissemination of the findings by the agency’s research partners.

Researchers at the University of Washington had collaborated with scientists at USDA, as well as others in Japan, China and Australia, for more than two years to study how rising carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could affect rice — humanity’s most important crop. They found that it not only loses protein and minerals, but is also likely to lose key vitamins as plants adapt to a changing environment.

The study had undergone intensive review, addressing questions from academic peers and within USDA itself. But after having prepared an announcement of the findings, the department abruptly decided not to publicize the study and urged the University of Washington to hold back its own release on the findings, which two of their researchers had co-authored.

In an email to staffers dated May 7, 2018, an incredulous Jeff Hodson, a UW communications director, advised his colleagues that the USDA communications office was “adamant that there was not enough data to be able to say what the paper is saying, and that others may question the science.”

""It was so unusual to have an agency basically say: ‘Don't do a press release,’ "" Hodson recalled in an interview. ""We stand for spreading the word about the science we do, especially when it has a potential impact on millions and millions of people.""

Researchers say the failure to publicize their work damages the credibility of the Agriculture Department and represents an unwarranted political intrusion into science.

“Why the hell is the U.S., which is ostensibly the leader in science research, ignoring this?” said one USDA scientist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid the possibility of retaliation. “It’s not like we’re working on something that’s esoteric … we’re working on something that has dire consequences for the entire planet.”

“You can only postpone reality for so long,” the researcher added.

With a budget of just over $1 billion, the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service — known as ARS — is often referred to as “one of the best kept secrets” in the sprawling department because of its outsize impact on society. The agency has pioneered a variety of major breakthroughs, from figuring out how to mass produce penicillin so it could be widely used during World War II to coming up with creative ways to keep sliced apples from browning, and has for decades been at the forefront of understanding how a changing climate will affect agriculture.

The agency has stringent guidelines to prevent political meddling in research projects themselves. The Trump administration, researchers say, is not directly censoring scientific findings or black-balling research on climate change. Instead, they say, officials are essentially choosing to ignore or downplay findings that don’t line up with the administration’s agenda.

Some scientists see the fact that the administration has targeted another research arm of USDA, the Economic Research Service, as a warning shot. Perdue is moving ERS out of Washington, which some economists see as retribution for issuing reports that countered the administration’s agenda, as POLITICO recently reported.

“There’s a sense that you should watch what you say,” said Ricardo Salvador, director of the food and environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s going to result in some pretty big gaps in practical knowledge. … it will take years to undo the damage.”

Among the ARS studies that did not receive publicity from the Agriculture Department are:



A 2017 finding that climate change was likely to increase agricultural pollution and nutrient runoff in the Lower Mississippi River Delta, but that certain conservation practices, including not tilling soil and planting cover crops, would help farmers more than compensate and bring down pollutant loads regardless of the impacts of climate change.

A January 2018 finding that the Southern Plains — the agriculture-rich region that stretches from Kansas to Texas — is increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, from the crops that rely on the waning Ogallala aquifer to the cattle that graze the grasslands.

An April 2018 finding that elevated CO2 levels lead to “substantial and persistent” declines in the quality of certain prairie grasses that are important for raising cattle. The protein content in the grass drops as photosynthesis kicks into high gear due to more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — a trend that could pose health problems for the animals and cost ranchers money.

A July 2018 finding that coffee, which is already being affected by climate change, can potentially help scientists figure out how to evaluate and respond to the complex interactions between plants, pests and a changing environment. Rising CO2 in the atmosphere is projected to alter pest biology, such as by making weeds proliferate or temperatures more hospitable to damaging insects.

An October 2018 finding, in conjunction with the USDA Forest Service, that climate change would likely lead to more runoff in the Chesapeake Bay watershed during certain seasons.

A March 2019 finding that increased temperature swings might already be boosting pollen to the point that it’s contributing to longer and more intense allergy seasons across the northern hemisphere. “This study, done across multiple continents, highlights an important link between ongoing global warming and public health—one that could be exacerbated as temperatures continue to increase,” the researchers wrote.

Those were among at least 45 ARS studies related to climate change since the beginning of the Trump administration that did not receive any promotion, according to POLITICO’s review. The total number of studies that have published on climate-related issues is likely to be larger, because ARS studies appear across a broad range of narrowly focused journals and can be difficult to locate.

Five days after POLITICO presented its findings to the department and asked for a response, ARS issued a press release on wheat genetics that used the term “climate change.” It marked the third time the agency had used the term in a press release touting scientific findings in two and a half years.

While spokespeople say Perdue, the former Georgia governor who has been agriculture secretary since April 2017, has not interfered with ARS or the dissemination of its studies, the secretary has recently suggested that he’s at times been frustrated with USDA research.

“We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers,” he said in April, responding to a question from POLITICO. “That relies on sound, replicable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

President Donald Trump, for his part, has been clear about his views on climate science and agricultural research generally: He doesn’t think much of either.

In each of his budgets, Trump has proposed deep cuts to agricultural research, requests that ignore a broad, bipartisan coalition urging more funding for such science as China and other competitors accelerate their spending. Congress has so far kept funding mostly flat.

The president has also repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus on climate change. After the government released its latest national climate assessment in November, a sweeping document based on science, Trump bluntly told reporters: ""I don't believe it.""

Officials at USDA apparently took the hint and the department did not promote the report, despite the fact that it was drafted in part by its own scientists and included serious warnings about how a changing climate poses a threat to farmers and ranchers across the country.

The USDA’s failure to publicize climate-related research does more than just quell media coverage: It can also prompt universities, fearful of antagonizing a potential source of funding, to reconsider their own plans to publicize studies.

The saga of the rice study last spring shows how a snub from USDA can create spillover effects throughout the academic world.

Emails obtained by POLITICO from one of the study’s co-authors show that ARS communications staff actually wrote a release on the study, but then decided not to send it out. The Agriculture Department and UW in Seattle had initially planned to coordinate their releases, which would both be included in a press packet prepared by the journal Science Advances, which published the study in May.

The journal had anticipated there would be significant media interest in the paper. Several earlier studies had already shown that rice loses protein, zinc and iron under the elevated CO2 levels that scientists predict for later this century, raising potentially serious concerns for hundreds of millions of people who are highly dependent on rice and already at risk of food insecurity. This latest study by ARS and its academic partners around the world had confirmed those previous findings and — for the first time — found that vitamins can also drop out of rice in these conditions.

Several days before the paper was slated to be published, Hodson, the UW communications official, sent ARS communications staff a draft of the press release the university was planning to send out. ARS officials returned the favor, sending UW their own draft press release. The headline on USDA’s draft was clear: “Rising Carbon Dioxide Levels Can Reduce Vitamin Content in Rice,” though the body of the release did not mention the word “climate.”

All seemed to be on track for the rollout. A few days later, however, Hodson got a phone call from an ARS communications staffer. She told him that the agency had decided not to issue a press release after all and suggested UW reconsider its plans, noting that senior leaders at ARS now had serious concerns about the paper, according to the emails.

The staffer explained that officials were “adamant that there was not enough data to be able to say what the paper is saying, and that others may question the science,” Hodson wrote in his email to his colleagues shortly after the call.

Having the Agriculture Department question the data just days before its publication struck many of the co-authors as inappropriate. The paper had already gone through a technical and policy review within ARS, both of which are standard procedure, and it had gone through a stringent peer-review process.

Kristie Ebi, one of the co-authors from UW, replied to Hodson: “Interesting — USDA is really trying to keep the press release from coming out.”

Nonetheless, senior leaders at UW took USDA’s concerns about the paper seriously, Hodson said. (It also wasn’t lost on anyone, he said, that other parts of the university receive substantial grant funding from the Agriculture Department.) The university conducted an internal review and determined that the science was sound. It went ahead with its press release.

The USDA’s attempt to quash the release had ripple effects as far as Nebraska. After catching wind of USDA’s call to the University of Washington, Bryan College of Health Sciences, in Lincoln, Neb., delayed and ultimately shortened its own release to avoid potentially offending the Agriculture Department.

“I’m disappointed,” said Irakli Loladze, a mathematical biologist at Bryan who co-authored the rice paper. “I do not even work at the USDA, but a potential call from the government agency was enough of a threat for my school to skip participating in the press-package arranged by the journal. Instead, our college issued a local and abbreviated release.""

A spokesperson for Bryan College said that the institution supports Loladze’s work and noted that the college ultimately issued its own press release and covered the study in its own publications.

“There was no omission or intentional delay based on what others were saying or doing,” the spokesperson said.

Despite the efforts of the Agriculture Department, the rice paper attracted substantial international press coverage, largely because many of the outside institutions that collaborated on the study, including the University of Tokyo, promoted it.

Kazuhiko Kobayashi, an agricultural scientist at the University of Tokyo and co-author on the paper, said he couldn’t understand why the U.S. government wouldn’t publicize such findings.

“It’s not necessarily bad for USDA,” he said in an interview. “Actually, it’s kind of neutral.”

“In Japan we have an expression: sontaku,” he said, offering his own speculation about the political dynamic in the United States. “It means that you don’t want to stimulate your boss … you feel you cannot predict your boss’s reaction.”

A USDA spokesperson said the decision to spike the press release on the rice study was driven by a scientific disagreement, not by the fact that it was climate-related.

“The concern was about nutritional claims, not anything relating to climate change or C02 levels,” the spokesperson said in an email. “The nutrition program leaders at ARS disagreed with the implication in the paper that 600 million people are at risk of vitamin deficiency. They felt that the data do not support this.”

The spokesperson said no political appointees were involved in the decision.

Authors of the rice study strongly disagreed with the concerns USDA raised about their paper. In an email leading up to publication, Loladze, the Bryan College researcher, accused the department of essentially “cherry picking” data to raise issues that weren’t scientifically valid, according to the emails.

When the Agriculture Department chooses to promote a study, the impact can be significant, particularly for the agriculture-focused news outlets that are widely read by farmers and ranchers.

Earlier this year, when the agency decided to issue its release about the study finding that producing beef — often criticized for having an outsize carbon and water footprint — actually makes up a very small fraction of greenhouse gas emissions, the agricultural trade press cranked out several stories, much to the delight of the beef industry. The study had also been supported by the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.

The USDA’s efforts to hide climate work aren’t limited to ARS. A review of department press releases, blog posts and social media shows a clear pattern of avoiding the topic. These platforms largely eschew the term “climate change” and also steer clear of climate-related terms. Even the word “climate” itself appears to have now fallen out of favor, along with phrases like carbon, greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation and sequestration.

In April, for example, USDA sent out a press release noting that USDA officials had signed on to a communique on the sidelines of a G-20 agricultural scientists' meeting that reaffirmed their commitment to “science-based decision making.” The release made no mention of the fact that most of the principles USDA had agreed to were actually related to “climate-smart” agriculture.

Scott Hutchins, USDA’s deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, told POLITICO at the time that he emphasized science-based decision-making in the release — not climate — because that was the strength the participants brought to these international dialogues. He added that there was “no intent whatsoever” to avoid including the words “climate smart” in the release.

A spokesperson for USDA said that department leadership “has not discouraged ARS or any USDA agency from using terms such as climate change, climate, or carbon sequestration, or from highlighting work on these topics.”

But David Festa, senior vice president of ecosystems at the Environmental Defense Fund, which works with farmers and ranchers on climate mitigation, said tensions within the USDA over climate issues are preventing a more robust discussion of the effects of climate change on American agriculture.

“USDA really could and should be leading … and they’re not,” Festa said.

Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer whose operation is roughly half conventional, half organic grain, said farmers are simply not getting much information from USDA related to how to adapt to or mitigate climate change.

“My farmers tell me this is frustrating,” said Lehman, who serves as Iowa Farmers Union President.

The gap in the conversation is particularly pronounced right now, he said, as an unprecedented percentage of growers across the Midwest have had difficulty planting their crops because fields are either too wet or flooded — an extreme weather scenario that’s been disastrous for agriculture this year.

“Farmers have a sense that the volatility is getting worse,” he said.

“You get the sense that it’s very sensitive,” Lehman said of the current dynamic around climate science at USDA. “But if you can’t have an open conversation about it, if you feel like you’re being shunned, how are we going to make progress?”

Even during the George W. Bush administration, when climate change was first deemed a “sensitive” topic within ARS — a designation that means science and other documents related to it require an extra layer of managerial clearance — the department still routinely highlighted climate-related research for the public.

In the first three years of Bush’s second term, for example, USDA promoted research on how farmers can change their tilling practices to reduce carbon being released into the atmosphere, a look at how various farm practices help capture carbon into soil, and a forecast on how rising CO2 levels would likely affect key crops. The communications office highlighted work showing that using switchgrass as a biofuel in lieu of ethanol could store more carbon in soil, which would not only mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but also boost soil health. There was also a release on a study simulating how climate change would pose challenges to groundwater.

Under Bush, the department publicly launched a five-year project on “Climate Friendly Farming” and touted a sweeping initiative aimed at better understanding and reducing agriculture’s greenhouse emissions.

“Even a small increase in the amount of carbon stored per acre of farmland would have a large effect on offsetting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions,” an ARS release noted in 2005.

Jim Connaughton, who served as chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality and director of the White House Office of Environmental Policy during the Bush administration, said he was encouraged that USDA and other agencies have so far been able to continue conducting climate science even as the issue has become more politically sensitive within the current administration. However, he noted it was “really unusual” for research agencies to systematically hold back scientific communication.

During the Bush era, he said, “The agencies were unfettered in their own decisions about publicizing their own science.”

“The tone from the top matters,” he added. “The political appointees are taking signals about their own communication products.”

During the Obama years, USDA became increasingly outspoken about climate change and the need to involve agriculture, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation.

The department came up with sweeping action plans on climate change and climate science and highlighted its work on a number of different platforms, including press releases, blog posts and social media blasts. In 2014, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack also launched Climate Hubs in 10 regions across the country aimed at helping farmers and ranchers cope with an increasingly unpredictable climate.

“We were trying to take science and make it real and actionable for farmers,” said Robert Bonnie, who served as undersecretary for natural resources and the environment at USDA during the Obama administration. “If you’re taking a certain block of research and not communicating it, it defeats the purpose of why USDA does the research in the first place.”"

At the time, the river was one of the most polluted in the US. Journalists filled glasses with pitch-black river water, while politicians dipped cloth into the waves that came up oil-soaked.

The river fire lasted roughly 20 minutes, but it sparked public outrage that in part led to the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office tasked with making sure ""Americans have clean air, land, and water.""

Ex-top CIA official perturbed by John Durham's review of intelligence analysts,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Manuel Balce Ceneta'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-cia-official-perturbed-by-john-durhams-review-of-intelligence-analysts,"A former top CIA official warned of dire consequences from the Justice Department's review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

As part of the ""investigation into the investigators,"" U.S. Attorney John Durham's team reportedly wants to talk to at least one senior CIA counterintelligence official and a senior CIA analyst who examined Russia's role in meddling in the 2016 election.

The review is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity he can take prosecutorial action. Top CIA officials are said to be anxious over the federal prosecutor's efforts.

Michael Morell, who was deputy director of the CIA during the Obama administration, said Durham's interest in speaking to a CIA analyst concerns him.

""I see no problem with a DOJ review of whether the CIA and other intelligence community agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities related to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons — U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals,"" Morell told CBS News, where he is now a senior national security contributor.

""Having said that, I see a DOJ review of whether or not the intelligence analysts made the right call as wholly inappropriate. I cannot ever remember a DOJ review of analysis,"" Morrell added.

""[Durham] and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis,"" Morell said. ""He and his team could well impose a law enforcement standard in coming to a conclusion — a much higher bar than exists in the intelligence community for analytic judgments.""

American officials say Attorney General William Barr, who is overseeing Durham's efforts and earlier this year riled Democrats when he said ""spying did occur"" against the Trump 2016 campaign, wants to understand how the CIA coordinated with the FBI and how the agency came to its conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the order to sow discord in the election to help Trump and undermine his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.

That effort culminated in the January 2017 release of a intelligence community assessment, commissioned by former President Barack Obama. In that report, the CIA and FBI expressed ""high confidence"" that Russia sought to boost Trump while the National Security Agency had ""moderate confidence.""

The Senate and House intelligence committees both reviewed the assessment, revealing a partisan divide. While the Senate panel, known for being largely bipartisan, called it a ""sound intelligence product,"" the House Intelligence Committee was more critical. In 2018, the then-GOP led House panel said most of the assessment's analysis ""held up to scrutiny,"" but noted the judgment about Putin ""failed to meet most of the analytic standards set forth in the primary guiding document for [intelligence community] analysis."" Democrats on the committee disagreed with that assessment.

Democrats argue Barr's effort is part of a plan to stonewall the public from learning about President Trump potentially committing obstruction of justice. Upon the conclusion of his Russia investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller laid out 10 instances of possible obstruction but declined to make a determination about whether he should be accused of a crime.

""Trump and Barr conspire to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies. The coverup has entered a new and dangerous phase,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in a tweet after the president gave Barr sweeping powers to declassify documents in the investigation.

Siding with Democrats, Morrell said he feels ""strongly"" the Justice Department has ""NO business"" doing a follow-up review of the intelligence community analysis. ""It does not have the knowledge & expertise necessary to get the right answers and it could well have a chilling effect across the analytic community,"" he said in a tweet."
