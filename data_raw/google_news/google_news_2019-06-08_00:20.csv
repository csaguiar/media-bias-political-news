House Intel Dem: 'The lizard brain that I have' hopes 'bad things happen' to Trump,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-intel-dem-the-lizard-brain-that-i-have-hopes-bad-things-happen-to-trump,"Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., blamed his ""lizard brain"" on Thursday for wanting bad things to happen to President Trump.

He made those comments on CNN where host Wolf Blitzer asked him whether, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., he wanted to see Trump ""in prison.""

""More than anything else,"" he told Blitzer. ""This isn't about my feelings or about retribution. Look, the lizard brain that I have says I hope bad things happen to this man because he has been so destructive to our Republic, to the concept of democracy, to the concept that internationally we are a light unto the nations.""

Blitzer was referring to a report that Pelosi made that remark during a meeting with House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who disagreed with her reluctance to impeach.

After the DOJ released Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report in April, both Nadler's committee and the House Intelligence Committee, of which Himes is a member, pressed the administration for more information related to the Russia investigation.

Nadler, along with other Democrats, reportedly wanted to impeach the president but faced opposition from Pelosi who warned that a haphazard attempt could doom future efforts at holding Trump accountable.

Himes, during his Thursday appearance, said that despite his ""emotional reaction"" to Trump, he recognized that the country was a ""nation of laws"" and that impeachment would likely fail to achieve removal from office as long as Republicans controlled the Senate.

""So what I really hope—and this is me personally speaking—what I really hope is that if impeachment is not a mechanism of accountability -- and I will tell you flat out that I can't imagine anything happening, anything at all happening that would cause the Senate to convict and, therefore, remove this president so impeachment stops in the House in my opinion,"" he said.

DEMS' LONG GAME? PELOSI RAISES PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING TRUMP ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE

""My real hope is that in 2020, the American voters look into their hearts, think about the generation that we've been celebrating today, who as young men decided that they would give their lives for their country,"" he said on Thursday, the 75th anniversary of D-Day, ""think about the generation that rebuilt Europe, that didn't live by the notion of 'America First.'""

Himes went on to state that for him, it was more important that America redeemed its values in 2020 rather than seeing Trump in prison.

His comments seemed to touch on a concern among Democrats pushing back against calls for impeachment: Would aggressively pursuing the president's removal hurt the party's chance at taking back the presidency in 2020?

Himes' comments came as Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., repeatedly criticized Trump's attorney general for acting as a corrupt shield for the president. Schiff also accused the administration of endangering national security by giving Attorney General William Barr the power to declassify documents related to the Russia probe's origins."
Barr is lying about Mueller’s evidence.,https://slate.com,['William Saletan'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/barr-lying-mueller-report.html,"Attorney General William Barr testifies in Washington on May 1. Win McNamee/Getty Images

The final report on the Russia investigation, submitted on March 22 by special counsel Robert Mueller, documents multiple attempts by President Donald Trump to obstruct justice. So why hasn’t Trump been indicted? Because one man stands in the way: Attorney General William Barr. Two days after receiving Mueller’s 448-page report, Barr declared Mueller’s evidence insufficient. Since then, Barr has offered no detailed analysis to support his conclusions. Instead, in hearings and interviews, the attorney general has based his judgment on a series of falsehoods.

It’s time to certify Barr’s declaration as a fraud. No one has cleared Trump. Somebody else—Congress, voters, or a new attorney general—will have to adjudicate Mueller’s evidence.

Let’s examine Barr’s statements about the episodes of obstruction Mueller described.

1. The Comey firing. Last week, in an interview with Jan Crawford of CBS News, Barr claimed that Trump’s firing of then–FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 couldn’t be obstruction. The attorney general told Crawford, “We don’t believe that the firing of an agency head could be established as having the probable effect, objectively speaking, of sabotaging a proceeding.”

That statement contradicts Mueller’s report. The report says that Comey’s firing could have reined in the investigation by “providing the President with the opportunity to appoint a director … more protective of his personal interests” or “discourag[ing] a successor director or other law enforcement officials” from pursuing the president. The report presents extensive evidence that Trump, prior to firing Comey, pressed him unsuccessfully for personal “loyalty” and favors. In particular, Trump asked Comey to drop the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had been caught lying about his contacts with Russia. That request exposed Trump’s explicit intent, through the FBI director, to obstruct the investigation.

2. The Rosenstein memo. At a Senate hearing on May 1, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas asserted that when Trump fired Comey, “The president was relying, at least in part, on a recommendation by the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, arising out of Rod Rosenstein’s critique of Mr. Comey’s conduct” in the 2016 investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails. Cornyn asked Barr, “Is that right?” Barr replied: “That’s right.”

No, it’s not right. Mueller’s report spends a dozen pages destroying, through documents and direct witnesses, Trump’s pretense that he relied on Rosenstein’s memo. The report concludes that Trump’s purported reliance on the memo was “pretextual.” Despite this, Barr reaffirmed the pretense.

3. The Lewandowski meetings. Mueller’s report describes two private meetings, in June and July 2017, in which Trump directed his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, to tell then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions to abort the investigation of Russia’s 2016 interference. These meetings illustrated Trump’s intent not just to manipulate evidence or replace investigators, but to shut down the whole inquiry. At the May 1 hearing, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked Barr how these meetings could be squared with Barr’s assertion that Trump “fully cooperated” with the investigation. With a straight face, Barr replied: “I don’t see any conflict between that and fully cooperating with the investigation.”

4. The attempt to fire Mueller. The special counsel’s report details two June 2017 phone calls in which Trump instructed then–White House counsel Don McGahn to tell Rosenstein to remove Mueller. Trump made the calls shortly after the Washington Post reported that Mueller was investigating whether Trump had obstructed the Russia inquiry. In testimony to Mueller’s investigators, McGahn said Trump specifically told him “Mueller has to go” and “Call me back when you do it.”

Barr defends Trump’s contrary account, which the president began peddling only after McGahn’s story came out. At the Senate hearing, Barr presented Trump’s version this way: “What [the president] meant was that the conflict of interest should be raised with Rosenstein, but the decision should be left with Rosenstein.” And in a May 17 interview with Fox News, Barr claimed that according to Mueller’s report, McGahn alleged only that Trump requested to “have Mueller removed for conflicts of interest.” That wouldn’t be obstruction, Barr argued, “because if you remove someone for a conflict of interest, presumably someone else is going to be put in to continue the investigation.”

That’s a misrepresentation of Mueller’s report. “McGahn is a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House,” says the report. It also notes that “McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President’s request.” The report warns that the president’s removal of a special counsel could “chill the actions of any replacement Special Counsel.” Barr simply ignored these points.

5. The McGahn statement. In January 2018, the New York Times reported McGahn’s story about Trump telling him to fire Mueller. In response, Trump demanded that McGahn write a letter denying that that the president had ordered Mueller’s firing. Trump told then–White House staff secretary Rob Porter, “If [McGahn] doesn’t write a letter, then maybe I’ll have to get rid of him.” At a meeting the next day, Trump criticized McGahn for taking notes and asked why McGahn had told Mueller’s investigators about his order to remove the special counsel.

Barr’s position—that a president targeted by an investigation can unilaterally terminate it—is flatly autocratic.

Trump’s demand for a letter resembles one of the acts for which President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998: encouraging Monica Lewinsky to submit a false affidavit that said, “I have never had a sexual relationship with the president.” Clinton later argued that the affidavit was true because “sexual relationship” meant “intercourse,” not oral sex. Barr offers an equally preposterous defense of the letter Trump demanded from McGahn. It “wasn’t necessarily false,” Barr told senators at the May hearing, because “There is a distinction between saying to someone, ‘Go fire him,’ ‘Go fire Mueller,’ and saying, ‘Have him removed based on conflict.’ ”

Barr also misrepresented Mueller’s analysis of why Trump demanded the letter. The attorney general told senators that “as the report shows, there’s ample evidence” to support the argument “that the president’s intent was directed at publicity and the press,” not at the investigation. But the report says just the opposite. Trump’s “efforts to have McGahn write a letter ‘for our records’ approximately ten days after the stories had come out—well past the typical time to issue a correction for a news story—indicates the President was not focused solely on a press strategy, but instead likely contemplated the ongoing investigation,” says the report. Furthermore, it observes the “press strategy” defense can’t explain why Trump, while demanding the letter, also criticized McGahn for telling Mueller’s investigators about Trump’s phone calls seeking to remove Mueller.

6. McGahn’s ongoing testimony. Three times at the Senate hearing, Barr cited McGahn’s cooperation with Mueller as proof that when Trump demanded the letter from McGahn, the president wasn’t trying to obstruct the investigation. “The president was aware,” said Barr, that McGahn “already had testified to the special counsel. He’d given his evidence.” But Mueller’s report makes the opposite point. “Because McGahn had repeatedly spoken to investigators and the obstruction inquiry was not complete,” says the report, “it was foreseeable that he would be interviewed again on obstruction-related topics.” In fact, McGahn was interviewed twice more.

7. What Trump knew. Barr’s most astonishing claim is that Trump was entitled to shut down the investigation because the president knew it was “bogus.” At an April 18 press conference, Barr argued that Trump’s obstructive acts weren’t corrupt because, “as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion.” Two weeks later, Barr told the Senate: “If the president is being falsely accused—which the evidence now suggests that the accusations against him were false, and he knew they were false, and he felt that this investigation was unfair, propelled by his political opponents, and was hampering his ability to govern—that is not a corrupt motive for replacing an independent counsel.” In fact, said Barr, “The president could terminate that proceeding, and it would not be a corrupt intent.”

This position—that a president targeted by an investigation can unilaterally terminate it—is flatly autocratic. For that alone, the attorney general should be impeached. But Barr’s claims about what Trump knew are also false. Mueller’s report documents at least three cases in which Trump tried to thwart, manipulate, or shut down the investigation after learning about suspicious contacts between his advisers and Russia. In January 2017, Trump learned that Flynn had engaged in secret talks with Russia about lifting sanctions. In July 2017, Trump learned that his son, son-in-law, and campaign chairman had met with Russians based on an explicit offer of campaign help from the Kremlin. And in July 2018, Trump was briefed on an indictment that said the 2016 Russian hackers had “communicated with U.S. persons about the release of stolen documents,” including Trump adviser Roger Stone.

By Trump’s account, these revelations were new to him. But instead of reflecting that the investigation might be onto something, he fired Comey, tried to fire Mueller, and hinted at pardons for Stone and others. A week after the president learned of the Trump Tower meeting, he secretly pressed Lewandowski to shut down the investigation. So when Barr says Trump attacked the inquiry based on personal knowledge that it was meritless, the attorney general is either lying, expressing indifference to what’s in the report, or revealing that he hasn’t read it.

Barr’s falsehoods go on and on. He has misrepresented the length of the investigation, the special counsel’s judgment of Trump’s cooperation (“Bob Mueller obviously felt it was satisfactory”), and the known effects of Trump’s obstructive acts (“the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation”). He has told so many whoppers that no sensible person should trust his description, much less his assessment, of the Mueller report. The case against the president remains unanswered."

Seth Moulton, D-Mass., has set his sights on President Trump.

Rep. Moulton, who has also taken aim at former Vice President Joe Biden recently, fired off a tweet Friday bizarrely suggesting the president does not understand the English language.

""Imagine if we had a president who understood English (of which grammar is a part),"" he tweeted.

Moulton was responding to a tweet from Trump that was posted seemingly in response to NASA's preparation for another moon landing in 2024.

""For all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon - We did that 50 years ago,"" he said. ""They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science!""

That wasn't the only sarcastic tweet from Moulton on Friday, with his aforementioned attack on Biden coming earlier in the day. Moulton went after the former VP after he reversed his position on federal funding for abortion.

Moulton's criticisms of high-profile opponents came as he continues to struggle in the Democratic race.

FiveThirtyEight noted that Moulton received ""almost no support in the few polls that bothered to ask about him."" It also cited a poll showing that a majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa had never heard of him."

In the absence of further information about what went on behind closed doors, we are left to mine the formal photo ops for clues ; to parse the hats, formal wear and coats .

After all, this is a White House that prizes pageantry and theater, and embraces them as strategic tools — costume included. The trip was predicated on symbolism, and in such context, all public choices have imp ort. Yet we still can’t agree on what it all meant.

Just as the endless stream of name-calling and off-the-cuff remarks from the president has served to numb us to their content, so too has the elaborate stream of obfuscating outfits.

Alec Baldwin “So Done” With ‘SNL’ Trump Gig: “I Can’t Imagine I Would Do It Again”,https://deadline.com,['Greg Evans'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://deadline.com/2019/06/alec-baldwin-saturday-night-live-donald-trump-snl-so-done-with-that-1202628725/,"Alec Baldwin says he likely won’t be playing Donald Trump on NBC’s Saturday Night Live anymore. “I’m so done with that,” the actor told USA Today yesterday.

In an interview to promote the hybrid feature-documentary Framing John DeLorean, in which he plays the notorious car designer (opening in New York and on-demand today), Baldwin was asked whether he’ll return to SNL when the late-night sketch comedy show returns in the fall.

“I can’t imagine I would do it again,” Baldwin said. “I just can’t. They should find somebody who wants to do it. They’re all my dear friends and I love going there, but the other thing is that I’m going to go to work this fall in a way I haven’t done in a while. My wife and I had a son a year ago, and since he was born, I’ve worked minimally because I wanted to be there for my wife and kids. But the party’s over this fall and I’ll be traveling. SNL just crushes my weekends, and now weekends are going to become much more precious to me because that’s time with my kids.”

Asked who should replace him, Baldwin said, “I don’t know. Darrell Hammond did it and is a far better impressionist than I’ll ever be. When Anthony Atamanuik (started impersonating Trump on Comedy Central’s The President Show), all these people were attacking me, saying, ‘Oh, your impression sucks and you suck. Please go away.’ It also was something I thought to myself: ‘I really don’t have a lot invested in my Trump impersonation, so please find someone and convince Lorne (Michaels) to replace me.’ I’m completely down with that. Winning the Emmy for that show aside, it was not some career goal of mine.”

Baldwin said he’s enjoyed the gig, especially at first. “I mean, I had a lot of fun with (the cast), and when Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider wrote (Trump sketches in 2016 and 2017), that was new, it was fresh and the ratings were good. But I feel like I’m done with that now. I’m so done with that.”"

The records do not indicate why Ohr was given the bonus in November 2016, though they show he also received a $14,520 bonus a year earlier, totaling $42,520 over a two-year period.

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL CITED STEELE IN EMAILS WITH OHR AFTER FLAGGING CREDIBILITY ISSUES TO FBI, DOCS REVEAL

A Justice Department spokesman on Friday did not immediately return an inquiry from Fox News about the bonuses.

The conservative group Judicial Watch, known for suing for public records, released the documents related to Ohr’s salary Friday, saying they obtained them from the Justice Department through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Ohr’s actions during that time have been of interest to investigators, as it’s believed Ohr was the back channel between Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and the FBI. It was also revealed that his wife, Nellie Ohr, conducted opposition research on Trump for the firm Fusion GPS – the same company that commissioned the dossier – raising conflict of interest questions.

Judicial Watch is questioning why Ohr, who was later demoted at DOJ, was given a bonus.

“These documents will raise questions as to whether the conflicted Bruce Ohr, who the FBI used to launder information from Christopher Steele was rewarded for his role in the illicit targeting of President Trump,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement.

Even though Ohr was removed from his position as Associate Deputy Attorney General in 2017, he later received a $2,600 pay increase in 2018, the records indicate, showing Ohr earned $189,000 that year.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP

Lawyers for the House of Representatives are pushing back on the Justice Department's decision to walk away from a statute barring female genital mutilation — and an unusual argument that lawmakers shouldn't intervene to defend the interests of Congress in the case.

The fight is unfolding over the first federal criminal prosecution for female genital mutilation.

Last year, a judge in Michigan threw out charges against several women who had their daughters circumcised. The Justice Department notified Congress it would not appeal that decision because of constitutional considerations.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote to Congress in April to say female genital mutilation should be ""universally condemned"" but that DOJ had ""reluctantly determined"" it lacked a ""reasonable defense"" of the law following Supreme Court rulings in other cases.

In stepped the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center, which is working with Congress to mount a defense of the statute. The lawyers argued Congress has an interest in the enforcement and defense of the laws it has passed.

The ICAP lawyers were surprised, though, to face opposition from the Justice Department, which only once before has opposed moves by the House and Senate to weigh in on legal disputes.

""It's deeply concerning to see the Justice Department abandoning its defense of this important federal law,"" said Joshua Geltzer, the executive director of ICAP.

""It's further concerning to see the department resisting even the effort by the House of Representatives to offer its own defense of the law it helped to enact. The court should reject the department's effort and at a minimum hear the House's arguments in defense of the statute.""

ICAP is arguing that it wants to weigh in to support the law — which made it a crime to ""knowingly"" circumcise young women who have not yet reached the age of 18 — not to try to force the Justice Department to proceed with a criminal prosecution.

Four of the eight people who were originally charged in Michigan face other criminal allegations, including obstruction of justice.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that half a million women and girls inside the U.S. have suffered genital mutilation or are at risk in the future.

Congress outlawed it, but the Justice Department's Office of Legislative Affairs earlier this year asked Congress to amend that existing law to make clear that it applies to travel between states and when payments or offers are made in connection with the circumcision.

The issue is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which covers territory that includes Michigan.

DOJ distance from Congress

DOJ's position in the female genital mutilation case followed closely behind its refusal to defend President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy legislation, the Affordable Care Act.

In practice, the Justice Department routinely defends legislation passed by Congress so long as there are reasonable arguments that are lawful.

Attorney General William Barr and lawyers inside the White House opposed the decision to walk away from the defense of the health care law, but they were overruled by President Trump.

Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail have criticized that move. But Barr appeared unbothered about their concerns in testimony earlier this year — if the law is sound, they shouldn't be bothered, he said.

""You say that administration's position is hokey and then you say the sky is falling?"" the attorney general said. ""If this was such a hokey position to take, what are you worried about?"""

Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham, who was in Washington, D.C., this month.

DEMS UNVEIL CONTEMPT RESOLUTION FOR BARR, MCGAHN

Fox News has learned that Durham has been getting briefed on the “four corners” of the investigations into the FBI's use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, among other issues. Barr appointed Durham, 68, last month.

News of Durham's high level of engagement in the probe comes days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation.

""In fact probably have more questions, and some of the facts that I've learned don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened,"" Barr told CBS News in an interview.

Durham is specifically reviewing the FISA warrant obtained by the FBI to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page, as well as general issues relating to surveillance during the 2016 campaign and matters flowing from the FISA process. Fox News is told Durham would handle the prosecution of any criminal action he might uncover.

During the CBS interview, Barr revealed Durham picked up the FISA and surveillance components from Utah U.S. Attorney John Huber, whose work was put on hold pending DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's findings from his ongoing review. Huber, Barr said, “was essentially on standby” in case Horowitz “referred a matter to him to be handled criminally.”

Horowitz's investigation is expected to be completed shortly.

Before the 2016 midterm elections, sources tell Fox News, Republicans who controlled key House committees sought to “tee up” potential targets for future investigation.

They pointed in particular to the apparent conflict in testimony between the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, and DOJ official Bruce Ohr. Fusion GPS was retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which in turn hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to write the infamous dossier that the FBI relied on in its FISA application to surveil Page.

Simpson testified to the House Intelligence Committee that he contacted Ohr about the largely discredited dossier after Thanksgiving 2016, but Ohr’s records point to contact months earlier, in August. Bruce Ohr became a backchannel for Steele to the FBI in the fall of 2016 after the bureau fired the ex-spy over contacts with the media.

Last month, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows made a criminal referral for Ohr’s wife, Nellie, who worked for Fusion GPS. Nellie did extensive opposition research on Trump family members and campaign aides while working for Fusion GPS, according to a transcript of her closed-door interview with Congress.

""During her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she 'would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation' at DOJ and would not 'have any knowledge of the Department of Justice’s investigations on Russia.' Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer); her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele,"" Meadows' referral stated.

""However, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony."""
State Department rejects US embassy requests to fly LGBTQ pride flags on flagpoles,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-dept-rejects-us-embassies-requests-to-fly-lgbtq-pride-flags-on-flagpoles,"The State Department has rejected at least four requests from different U.S. embassies to fly LGBTQ pride flags during the month of June.

U.S. embassies in Israel, Germany, Brazil, and Latvia have each made requests to fly rainbow flags on the embassy’s flag pole, and the Trump administration has rejected each request, according to NBC News. Pride flags are still allowed to be displayed elsewhere in each facility.

Under President Barack Obama, embassies were given blanket permission to fly LGBTQ pride flags throughout the month of June. The Trump administration altered that policy and now requires each embassy to get special permission to display the flag on the embassy flag pole.

U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, who is openly gay, is leading the Trump administration's campaign to decriminalize homosexuality in the roughly 70 countries around the world where it is illegal.

""The pride flag will be on as many places as it can at the embassy,"" embassy spokesman Joseph Giordono-Scholz said.

""The President's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,"" Grenell said in a statement."
VA watchdog report finds veterans are owed refunds for incorrect fees,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/va-watchdog-report-finds-veterans-owed-refunds-incorrect/story?id=63546615,"For years, disabled veterans were mistakenly charged fees when taking out home loans and the federal government now owes millions of dollars in refunds, a watchdog report revealed this week.

The Department of Veterans Affairs issued more than $280 million in excessive fess between 2012 and 2017, and took no action despite knowing that veterans were owed refunds, the VA Inspector General report found.

In many cases, third-party lenders rely on the VA to certify that a veteran is exempt from certain fees when applying for a home loan. But its exemption certificates were “outdated, incorrect, or missing exemption status resulting in veterans being incorrectly charged a funding fee,” according to the report.

The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE

The Under Secretary for Benefits responded to the report by saying the problem would be corrected by the end of July.

Although most cases involved veterans becoming exempt from the fees only after they were issued, investigators found the VA did not implement its own policy to identify and refund the charges.

“Requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” the report stated.

The fees averaged $4,000 and some were considerably higher. One was for $19,470.

More than half of the 72,900 veterans who are entitled to refunds have yet to be paid by the VA.

When the issue was first identified in 2014, an analysis estimated that 48,000 veterans were owed as much as $151 million in overpaid fees.

When asked why corrective action wasn’t taken at the time, current and former leaders of the loan office said they were “focused on other competing priorities” and said they faced “historically high loan volumes” in the following years, according to the inspector general."

Within days of a January 2016 Flynn phone call to Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak referenced in the court filing, a Russian-born U.K. academic said FBI source Stefan Halper suddenly contacted her to gain information on Flynn.

MUELLER FILES SHOW FLYNN UNDER INVESTIGATION EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT

Asked about the timing, a source familiar with the situation told Fox News that ""nothing is a coincidence"" when it comes to Halper, and that Kislyak was likely under U.S. surveillance at the time of the contacts.

The information was contained in a so-called ""302"" witness report prepared by top FBI brass and finalized more than three weeks after Flynn's Jan. 24, 2017 White House interview with two FBI agents, including Peter Strzok. Flynn previously served as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency during the Obama administration, before advising the Trump campaign and briefly joining that administration. A semi-redacted version of the 302 was released last December that omitted reference to some of Flynn's contacts after his DIA service.

In particular, only the unredacted 302 indicates that Flynn told the interviewing agents that he had ""met with Kislyak at the Russian Ambassador's residence next to the University Club prior"" to traveling to Russia in December 2015. The mid-afternoon visit, which the 302 characterized as a ""courtesy call,"" came as Flynn was preparing to travel to Moscow as a private citizen to speak at a Russia Today (RT) event.

Flynn was paid $45,000 to speak on Middle East issues at the gathering, where he shared a table with President Vladimir Putin. According to the 302, Flynn received an appropriate ""threat briefing"" from U.S. officials before attending.

Additionally, according to both the redacted and unredacted 302s, ""Flynn stated he called Ambassador Kislyak following [former GRU Director Igor] Sergun's death in Lebanon ... to express his condolences"" and note that Sergun was ""someone the U.S. could work with."" Segun died Jan. 3, 2016.

Just days later, as Flynn's role informally advising the Trump campaign became known, a Russian-born U.K. academic, Svetlana Lokhova, said she received an invitation out of the blue to a private dinner party with Halper.

Halper is widely reported to have been a confidential source in the FBI's original probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Halper also reached out to Trump campaign aides including Carter Page, George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis.

“It was very, very unusual because Stefan Halper and I, despite being part of the same group, and meeting pretty much in a public forum, we've had no personal contact at all. [Halper] to me was an obnoxious academic who absolutely hated all Russians,"" Lokhova told Fox News in April.

FLYNN: FBI PUSHED ME NOT TO HAVE LAWYER AT FATEFUL WHITE HOUSE INTERVIEW

In a lawsuit filed last month, Lokhova accused Halper and various news media outlets of conspiring to defame her, by falsely claiming she had inappropriate contact with Flynn to further the narrative that Flynn was compromised by Russia.

The complaint asserted that ""Stefan Halper is a ratf----- and a spy, who embroiled an innocent woman in a conspiracy to undo the 2016 Presidential election and topple the President of the United States of America.""

According to the lawsuit, ""On January 12, 2016, [Cambridge Professor Christopher] Andrew emailed Lokhova, and invited her and her partner, David North ('North'), to Andrew’s house to have dinner with Halper and his wife. Two dates in February were offered. Andrew stated that the purpose of the dinner was to discuss the book that Lokhova and he were authoring. Lokhova was perplexed. At no point before this unexpected invitation had Halper expressed any interest in Lokhova’s work.""

The complaint alleges, ""Halper had no interest in Lokhova’s work. Rather, Halper wanted to have dinner with Lokhova to probe her for information relating to Flynn in the hopes that his FBI handlers might find a basis upon which to file an application to conduct surveillance and spy on General Flynn.""

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' FLYNN

Halper has said virtually nothing in public about his role. During a rare interview with BBC Radio 4 Today in May 2017, Halper was asked if the Trump FBI inquiry was of Watergate proportions. He responded that the probe was ""moving in that direction.""

Multiple independent reviews into potential FBI and DOJ misconduct in 2016 are ongoing, as new information suggests the Trump team was targeted earlier than previously known. Buried in the second volume of the Mueller report was a mention of an existing FBI investigation of Flynn ""based on his relationship with the Russian government,"" which predated Flynn's phone calls during the presidential transition in December 2016 with Kislyak that ultimately led to his termination for lying.

It had been originally thought that Flynn’s communications with Kislyak – picked up by the U.S. intelligence community – made the FBI suspicious, sparking the Flynn probe.

According to Mueller's report, ""members of the intelligence community were surprised by Russia's decision not to retaliate in response to the sanctions. When analyzing Russia's response, they became aware of Flynn's discussion of sanctions with Kislyak. Previously, the FBI had opened an investigation of Flynn based on his relationship with the Russian government. Flynn's contacts with Kislyak became a key component of that investigation.""

After Fox News reported on the development last month, President Trump questioned, in a tweet, why he wasn't briefed on the probe in 2016 ""so that I could make a change?""

Separately, the 302 released Thursday also revealed for the first time that in late December 2016, Kislyak called Flynn to set up a videoconference between the president-elect and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The call was to take place Jan. 21, 2017 -- the day after Trump's inauguration."
Five ways Google could be vulnerable to a Justice Department probe,https://www.theverge.com,['Jun'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18650489/google-justice-department-antitrust-investigation-monopoly-claims,"On Saturday, The Wall Street Journal reported that investigators from the Department of Justice will examine “Google’s business practices related to its search and other businesses.” It’s one of the biggest threats Google has ever faced from US regulators, but so far, we don’t know much about the case itself. The Journal’s description was open-ended, and the nature of Google’s business makes it vulnerable to antitrust challenges from a number of different directions. Google dominates the search market, but it also holds nearly 40 percent of the digital advertising market, and Android is the world’s most popular operating system. In all of these markets, critics have claimed that Google is simply too big, and it’s faced billion-dollar fines over each of them in Europe.

The probe is supposedly in its early stages, and it’s not clear what the Justice Department might consider worth investigating. But the earlier EU fines, along with a 2013 Federal Trade Commission investigation, offer some guidance. We’ve broken down some of the major monopoly allegations against Google as well as how courts and regulators have treated them so far — from search engine rankings to Android app bundling. (Google, perhaps understandably, did not respond to a request for comment.)

Google has monopolized ad placement

Google is the biggest single player in online advertising: one forecast puts its market share at 37.2 percent in 2019, compared to around 22.1 percent for its closest rival, Facebook. It makes money on two fronts: advertisers can buy ad space through a Google exchange, and websites can serve Google ads through the AdSense program. It’s been accused of abusing its power on both sides of the transaction, which is something Google denies.

The European Commission has specifically investigated Google’s relationship with web publishers. In March, it found that Google had unfairly banned AdSense customers from placing other search engines and ad boxes on their sites. (Google phased out this clause, but it retained the right to “premium” ad space on websites until 2016.) Publishers had fewer options for selling their ad space as a result, potentially driving down their revenue. At the same time, anyone using Google’s ad placement service was also pushed toward using the search engine exclusively, making it harder for competitors like Bing to get off the ground. The EC court fined Google €1.49 billion, saying it had “cemented its dominance” through illegal means. “Google’s conduct harmed competition and consumers,” the court said, “and stifled innovation.”

The FTC also examined this policy, and although it cleared Google in 2013, investigators privately expressed serious concerns about the practice. Bloomberg has noted that AdSense is a declining part of Google’s business, and the company has changed its policies to avert some of the key complaints. But the Justice Department could still decide that these exclusivity deals helped Google — unfairly — reach its current level of power.

Google has monopolized ad sales

Antitrust watchdogs aren’t just worried about how Google places ads on websites; they’re worried about how it sells that ad space. Google historically auctioned off space in a way that favored its AdX marketplace. When publishers and ad tech companies tried to get around that with something called header bidding, Google pushed back with a centralized system that would still give Google’s own exchange a potential advantage.

US and EU regulators approved Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick — which helped Google establish its ad empire — in 2008. Since then, they’ve focused their critiques on things like exclusivity deals. And Google could argue that it’s not hurting consumers or treating other exchanges unfairly. Header bidding can make pages load more slowly, so discouraging it could help web users. Google has dropped policies like the “last look” advantage, which let Google one-up other bids. Amazon has also started chipping away at Google and Facebook’s advertising market share, so it could also say there’s more competition.

Even so, “the fact that Google is able to dominate the advertising market is quite dangerous,” says Matt Stoller, a fellow at the anti-monopoly advocacy group Open Markets Institute. It gives Google power over how people can make money online — and, by extension, what kind of content people see when they browse the web.

Google downranks its competitors in search

But for ordinary users, ad tech might still seem a bit abstract, and there’s a much more visible controversy brewing with Google search.

Google uses search to highlight other Google services, including its business review and shopping platforms. More worryingly, it’s also demoted search results from competing companies. The UK-based comparison shopping platform Foundem claims that Google buried its site while promoting Google Shopping, for instance. EU regulators agreed that the company had overstepped, fining Google €2.4 billion.

Restaurant recommendation site Yelp has also complained about Google’s special search cards, which appear on top of its normal results. (Both of these allegations are unrelated to President Donald Trump’s conspiratorial claims of political “search bias.”) “There’s a lot of great evidence out there showing that Google sort of undertook a strategy to keep its competitors at bay,” says Yelp public policy director Luther Lowe.

The FTC took a look at search manipulation but eventually cleared Google, despite internal concerns. American antitrust law centers on harm to consumers, not businesses — and Google successfully argued that it’s simply offering a better experience than these other sites. But Yelp has since countered this claim with its own studies, suggesting that these cards reduce the usefulness of search results. Former FTC adviser Tim Wu called the research “surprising and shocking,” and it might count against Google in a Justice Department probe.

Google forces phone makers to bundle its apps

Google releases its Android operating system under an open-source license, but phone and tablet makers need to license popular apps like Google Maps and the Google Play Store. For a long time, these manufacturers had to bundle a whole suite of Google services, including Chrome and search. This disadvantaged rival browser and search engine companies, leading the EU to hand down a record-breaking €4.3 billion fine. In response, Google started offering European users a choice of browser and search engine. It also unbundled its services in Europe and started charging an app licensing fee instead.

This may be Google’s most direct equivalent to Microsoft’s “browser war,” which led to a massive antitrust trial in the ‘90s. But The Wall Street Journal’s reporting doesn’t mention Android, and the FTC’s earlier investigation focused more on ads and search practices. So we’ll have to wait to see how broad the Justice Department’s investigation really is.

Google could monopolize the web experience

All of the preceding claims have been around for years, and they involve core parts of Google’s business. But they’re not the only things that might catch the attention of antitrust watchdogs. Google AMP, for example, has raised eyebrows among regulators, activists, and web publishers. It makes pages load super fast on mobile browsers, but it also acts like a special Google-built portal to the web, granting the company a huge amount of power. Google has answered this criticism by giving up some control of AMP, which is an open-source project, to a multicompany committee.

To a far lesser extent, some critics are worried about Google’s moves to block “bad” ads on Chrome — noting that Google has the means and motive to favor its own ads in the process, and Chrome holds an estimated two-thirds of the browser market. When some code suggested that Google might limit third-party ad-blocking extensions, the developers of Ghostery threatened to file an antitrust complaint, until Google said it had never intended to break the extensions.

These complaints haven’t garnered nearly as much attention, and they’re likely to remain in the background of any antitrust probe. But they’re a reminder that Google’s reach is constantly expanding — and so are the complaints against it."
"DHS watchdog finds spoiled food, nooses at multiple immigration detention centers",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/dhs-oig-watchdog-spoiled-food-nooses-immigration-detention-centers-b5796c0ff257/,"The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report Thursday detailing the horrific conditions at immigration detention centers across the United States. Inspectors found “immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards” including nooses in detainee cells, overuse of solitary confinement, and spoiled food, among other issues.

DHS OIG inspected four Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, including the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado, the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, and the Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey.

According to the report, the “inspections of the four detention facilities revealed violations of ICE’s detention standards and raised concerns about the environment in which detainees are held.”

OIG described the food service issues at Adelanto and Essex as “egregious.” At Adelanto, “lunch meat and cheese were mixed and stored uncovered in

large walk-in refrigerators,” while chicken “smelled foul and appeared to be spoiled.” Food in the freezer was also expired. At Essex, “open packages of raw chicken leaked blood all over refrigeration units” and “lunch meat was slimy, foulsmelling and appeared to be spoiled.”

All of the facilities demonstrated “serious issues with the administrative and disciplinary segregation of detainees” that violate ICE detention standards and infringe on detainee rights, the report read.

The findings confirm what most immigration activist groups and some progressive members of Congress have been clamoring about for months: ICE is routinely violating the human rights of the individuals in its custody.

“The report’s findings reveal that issues in ICE detention are not isolated — they are systemic,” Freedom for Immigrants, a non-profit that has been monitoring the conditions at Adelanto and other ICE facilities for years, said in a statement. “And yet, not one single entity in this detention apparatus is ever held accountable for these human rights violations. This is outrageous. More and more evidence points to the fact that ICE and private prison companies like GEO are incapable of providing for the well-being of immigrants. That’s why we must abolish detention. It’s time to implement humane community-based alternatives that treat people with dignity and respect.”

While ICE standards require facilities to place detainees in disciplinary segregation only after they have committed a prohibited act, Adelanto, Essex, and Aurora punished immigrant detainees with solitary confinement for unproven disciplinary violations. Detainees in solitary were found to have limited access to recreation and even showers despite ICE standards mandating that individuals have access to these basic resources.

At the facility’s bathrooms, OIG observed mold throughout all the

walls in the bathroom area, including ceilings, vents, mirrors, and shower

stalls. Prolonged exposure to mold and mildew can lead to allergic reactions and long-term health issues.

Immigrants in detention are required to receive toiletries including including shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste, lotion, and soap. At Essex, however, detainees reported not having received any toiletries. Staff at the facility told inspectors that toiletries must be purchased through the commissary, which is against ICE standards.

(Credit: DHS OIG)

At Aurora, visitation rooms go unused. DHS OIG found that while the facility is capable of hosting in-person visitation, it only allows “non-contact visits” — even to children and family.

ICE standards mandate “that detainees shall be able to maintain morale and ties through visitation with their families, the community, legal representatives and consular officials, within the constraints of the safety, security and good order of the facility.”

Three of the four detention centers that were inspected are operated by GEO Group, a private prison company that contracts with the federal government.

GEO Group, among other similar companies like CoreCivic, has greatly benefited from the Trump administration’s increase in immigration enforcement. ICE is detaining more people than ever before, a record-breaking 52,000, and GEO Group is making money off of it. Just this week the private prison company announced a 314 bed expansion at the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas. The expansion would bring the total bed count to 1,314. The company is expected to rake in $10 million as a result."
"VA may owe veterans millions in refunds but knowingly hasn't paid them for years, probe finds",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/06/va-may-owe-disabled-veterans-millions-refunds-home-loan-fees/1367679001/,"CLOSE

WASHINGTON – More than 50,000 disabled veterans could be owed as much as $190 million in refunds from the Department of Veterans Affairs for home loan fees they were wrongly charged or no longer owe, an investigation has found.

Senior leaders knew about the problem for years but didn’t ensure veterans received what they are due, the investigation by the VA inspector general found.

Veterans pay the fees when they buy homes with the help of VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program, but they are supposed to be exempt if they are disabled. Fees can total up to 3.3% of a home's value.

In cases where veterans improperly paid the fees or the VA later determined they were disabled, the agency is supposed to issue refunds.

But the VA didn’t do that in thousands of cases dating back more than a decade because the veterans didn't ask for the refunds.

VA loan managers, who knew about outstanding debts to veterans since at least 2014, told investigators that they had been focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications.

Investigators from the inspector general’s office said in their report released Thursday that they found it “troubling” that the managers were “aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued.”

“It is the review team’s opinion that requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” investigators said.

'Internal quality improvement'

The VA issued a press release last month – as the inspector general was preparing to release the investigation results – announcing that the agency is now notifying veterans when they buy homes under the program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in the release.

The release did not say what is being done to ensure veterans due refunds from loans in prior years are paid. The inspector general found the amounts owed in its review ranged from $5,000 to $20,000.

The VA said veterans who believe they are owed a refund should consult the agency’s website for more information about VA home loan funding fees.

Between 2012 and 2017, the VA collected roughly $10 billion in fees from veterans under the loan program.

The inspector general estimated disabled veterans who were wrongly charged accounted for $286 million of those fees. But the VA only refunded about $100 million, leaving an estimated $190 million that may still be due to 53,200 veterans.

The Loan Guaranty program was established in 1944 to help veterans finance home purchases. Loans are provided by private lenders, but the VA guarantees a portion of the loans for eligible buyers. The lenders collect the fees and transmit them to the VA.

If a veteran wrongly paid the fees, the VA can refund the money directly to the veteran. If the fees were included as part of a loan, the VA pays the lender, which applies it to the loan balance.

'Other priorities'

In 2014, regional VA loan officials in St. Paul, Minnesota, notified senior VA managers that an analysis found nearly $150 million may be due in refunds to disabled veterans for fees on 48,000 loans issued between 2006 and 2014.

“As of January 2019, the review team received no indication that a large-scale effort had been initiated to issue refunds to these veterans,” the inspector general said.

The director of the Loan Guaranty program since 2017, Jeffrey London, told investigators he “considered contracting out the task of issuing refunds, but never requested the award of a contract because other priorities…took precedence,” the investigators wrote.

The inspector general recommended the agency identify and pay all the veterans owed refunds. In addition, the VA should implement procedures to minimize the number of veterans who are wrongly charged fees and conduct periodic reviews to ensure those who are receive prompt refunds.

The VA told investigators some of the fees were incorrectly assessed by lenders, not the VA. But agency officials said in their response to the report that they “generally agreed” with the investigation’s findings and are consulting lawyers about complexities related to issuing refunds.

The agency “has drafted a plan with contingencies ready for implementation depending on the (legal) opinion,” the VA response said. The agency did not elaborate on what the plan is or when refunds will be issued.

Elijah Cummings was denied a request for documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo legal DOJ, Commerce reject Dem subpoenas for census docs

The Justice and Commerce departments on Thursday rejected House Democratic demands for more documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, likely leading to contempt citations for Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

In a letter to Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the documents the panel subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.

Story Continued Below

“[T]he committee’s insistence that the department immediately turn over these documents ... is improper,” Boyd wrote, adding that the Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of documents and made officials available for interviews.

A Commerce Department spokesperson accused the committee of trying to interfere with ongoing litigation that centers on the constitutionality of the citizenship question appearing on the census.

“In its zeal to influence the Supreme Court’s decision, the committee is poised to hold Secretary Ross in contempt,” the spokesperson said. “Holding the secretary in contempt is an empty stunt, and it shows that the committee is simply interested in playing politics.”

The Democrat-led committee gave the Justice Department and the Commerce Department until 5 p.m. on Thursday to comply with its subpoenas, threatening to initiate contempt proceedings absent compliance.

Cummings said his committee gave Barr and Ross every opportunity to provide the documents but they didn’t cooperate and made no counteroffers.

“They seem determined to continue the Trump Administration’s cover-up,” he said in a statement.

The committee has been investigating the decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, with lawmakers accusing the Trump administration — Ross in particular — of lying about its origins.

New evidence emerged last week that the administration allegedly “concealed” the role of now-deceased Republican gerrymandering expert Thomas Hofeller, who believed that adding a citizenship question to the census would boost Republicans in future elections.

The Trump administration has said it is simply trying to enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have argued that such a question would create an undercount of ethnic and racial minorities, resulting in newly drawn congressional districts that would diminish their influence in American elections.

Cummings said this week that the Trump administration was seeking “to gerrymander congressional districts in overtly racist, partisan and unconstitutional ways,” and he accused the Trump administration of a “coverup.” Republicans on the committee have said that holding Barr and Ross in contempt is an effort to improperly interfere with ongoing court proceedings about the census question.

The subpoenas, which were first authorized in April, required the Justice and Commerce departments to turn over all communications with the White House, the Republican National Committee, and President Donald Trump’s campaign, among other entities. The subpoenas also sought memos and witness testimony.

One of those witnesses, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore, refused to answer lawmakers’ specific questions about his role in drafting a DOJ memo, requesting the addition of a citizenship question, and he later skipped a scheduled deposition with the committee.

In a statement, the Justice Department said Gore had “never heard of” Hofeller’s work, and added that it “played no role in the department’s December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question.”

Barr is expected to be formally held in contempt of Congress in a separate matter on Tuesday, when the House is scheduled to vote on a contempt citation for his refusal to turn over former special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report and underlying evidence, allowing the House Judiciary Committee to enforce its subpoena in federal court.

The contempt resolution will also allow other committees to enforce their subpoenas without requiring a full House vote.

At two facilities in California and New Jersey, the investigators said they found ""immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards,"" including ""nooses in detainee cells"" and ""inadequate medical care.""

Expired food and health issues were found at all four facilities mentioned in the report released this week. CNN first obtained details of the report.

Investigators conducted unannounced inspections at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, the Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey), and the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado.

ICE agreed with the inspector general’s recommendations and ensured facilities would take ""corrective action"" in response to the report’s findings.

The newly released report comes on the heels of another Homeland Security oversight investigation that found overcrowded and unsanitary conditions at migrant holding facilities along the border.

In the review of facilities run by Customs and Border Protection, the government watchdog found migrants were kept in ""standing-room-only conditions"" for days or weeks at a time.

Why Mueller’s team omitted that part of the Kilimnik narrative from its report and related court filings is not known. But the revelation of it comes as the accuracy of Mueller’s Russia conclusions face increased scrutiny.

The incomplete portrayal of Kilimnik is so important to Mueller’s overall narrative that it is raised in the opening of his report. “The FBI assesses” Kilimnik “to have ties to Russian intelligence,” Mueller’s team wrote on Page 6, putting a sinister light on every contact Kilimnik had with Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman.

What it doesn’t state is that Kilimnik was a “sensitive” intelligence source for State going back to at least 2013 while he was still working for Manafort, according to FBI and State Department memos I reviewed.

Kilimnik was not just any run-of-the-mill source, either.

He interacted with the chief political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, sometimes meeting several times a week to provide information on the Ukraine government. He relayed messages back to Ukraine’s leaders and delivered written reports to U.S. officials via emails that stretched on for thousands of words, the memos show.

The FBI knew all of this, well before the Mueller investigation concluded.

Alan Purcell, the chief political officer at the Kiev embassy from 2014 to 2017, told FBI agents that State officials, including senior embassy officials Alexander Kasanof and Eric Schultz, deemed Kilimnik to be such a valuable asset that they kept his name out of cables for fear he would be compromised by leaks to WikiLeaks.

“Purcell described what he considered an unusual level of discretion that was taken with handling Kilimnik,” states one FBI interview report that I reviewed. “Normally the head of the political section would not handle sources, but Kasanof informed Purcell that KILIMNIK was a sensitive source.”

Purcell told the FBI that Kilimnik provided “detailed information about OB (Ukraine’s opposition bloc) inner workings” that sometimes was so valuable it was forwarded immediately to the ambassador. Purcell learned that other Western governments relied on Kilimnik as a source, too.

“One time, in a meeting with the Italian embassy, Purcell heard the Italian ambassador echo a talking point that was strikingly familiar to the point Kilimnik had shared with Purcell,” the FBI report states.

Kasanof, who preceded Purcell as the U.S. Embassy political officer, told the FBI he knew Kilimnik worked for Manafort’s lobbying firm and the administration of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose Party of Regions hired Manafort’s firm.

Kasanof described Kilimnik as one of the few reliable insiders the U.S. Embassy had informing on Yanukovych. Kilimnik began his relationship as an informant with the U.S. deputy chief of mission in 2012–13, before being handed off to the embassy’s political office, the records suggest.

“Kilimnik was one of the only people within the administration who was willing to talk to USEMB,” referring to the U.S. Embassy, and he “provided information about the inner workings of Yanukovych’s administration,” Kasanof told the FBI agents.

“Kasanof met with Kilimnik at least bi-weekly and occasionally multiple times in the same week,” always outside the embassy to avoid detection, the FBI wrote. “Kasanof allowed Kilimnik to take the lead on operational security” for their meetings.

State officials told the FBI that although Kilimnik had Ukrainian and Russian residences, he did not appear to hold any allegiance to Moscow and was critical of Russia’s invasion of the Crimean territory of Ukraine.

“Most sources of information in Ukraine were slanted in one direction or another,” Kasanof told agents. “Kilimnik came across as less slanted than others.”

“Kilimnik was flabbergasted at the Russian invasion of Crimea,” the FBI added, summarizing Kasanof’s interview with agents.

Three sources with direct knowledge of the inner workings of Mueller’s office confirmed to me that the special prosecutor’s team had all of the FBI interviews with State officials, as well as Kilimnik’s intelligence reports to the U.S. Embassy, well before they portrayed him as a Russian sympathizer tied to Moscow intelligence or charged Kilimnik with participating with Manafort in a scheme to obstruct the Russia investigation.

Kasanof’s and Purcell’s interviews are corroborated by scores of State Department emails I reviewed that contain regular intelligence from Kilimnik on happenings inside the Yanukovych administration, the Crimea conflict and Ukrainian and Russian politics. For example, the memos show Kilimnik provided real-time intelligence on everything from whose star in the administration was rising or falling to efforts at stuffing ballot boxes in Ukrainian elections.

Those emails raise further doubt about the Mueller report’s portrayal of Kilimnik as a Russian agent. They show Kilimnik was allowed to visit the United States twice in 2016 to meet with State officials, a clear sign he wasn’t flagged in visa databases as a foreign intelligence threat.

The emails also show how misleading, by omission, the Mueller report’s public portrayal of Kilimnik turns out to be.

For instance, the report makes a big deal about Kilimnik’s meeting with Manafort in August 2016 at the Trump Tower in New York.

By that time, Manafort had served as Trump’s campaign chairman for several months but was about to resign because of a growing controversy about the millions of dollars Manafort accepted as a foreign lobbyist for Yanukovych’s party.

Specifically, the Mueller report flagged Kilimnik’s delivery of a peace plan to the Trump campaign for settling the two-year-old Crimea conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

“Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a ‘backdoor’ way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine,” the Mueller report stated.

But State emails showed Kilimnik first delivered a version of his peace plan in May 2016 to the Obama administration during a visit to Washington. Kasanof, his former handler at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, had been promoted to a top policy position at State, and the two met for dinner on May 5, 2016.

The day after the dinner, Kilimnik sent an email to Kasanof’s official State email address recounting the peace plan they had discussed the night before.

Russia wanted “a quick settlement” to get “Ukraine out of the way and get rid of sanctions and move to economic stuff they are interested in,” Kilimnik wrote Kasanof. The email offered eight bullet points for the peace plan — starting with a ceasefire, a law creating economic recovery zones to rebuild war-torn Ukrainian regions, and a “presidential decree on amnesty” for anyone involved in the conflict on both sides.

Kilimnik also provided a valuable piece of intelligence, stating that the old Yanukovych political party aligned with Russia was dead. “Party of Regions cannot be reincarnated. It is over,” he wrote, deriding as “stupid” a Russian-backed politician who wanted to restart the party.

Kasanof replied the next day that, although he was skeptical of some of the intelligence on Russian intentions, it was “very important for us to know.”

He thanked Kilimnik for the detailed plan and added, “I passed the info to my bosses, who are chewing it over.” Kasanof told the FBI that he believed he sent Kilimnik’s peace plan to two senior State officials, including Victoria Nuland, President Obama’s assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs.

So Kilimnik’s delivery of the peace plan to the Trump campaign in August 2016 was flagged by Mueller as potentially nefarious, but its earlier delivery to the Obama administration wasn’t mentioned. That’s what many in the intelligence world might call “deception by omission.”

Lest you wonder, the documents I reviewed included evidence that Kasanof’s interview with the FBI and Kilimnik’s emails to State about the peace plan were in Mueller’s possession by early 2018, more than a year before the final report.

Officials for the State Department, the FBI, the Justice Department and Mueller’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Kilimnik did not respond to an email seeking comment but, in an email last month to The Washington Post, he slammed the Mueller report’s “made-up narrative” about him. “I have no ties to Russian or, for that matter, any intelligence operation,” he wrote.

Kilimnik holds Ukrainian and Russian citizenship, served in the Soviet military, attended a prestigious Russian language academy and had contacts with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. So it is likely he had contacts over the years with Russian intelligence figures. There also is evidence Kilimnik left the U.S.-funded International Republican Institute (IRI) in 2005 because of concerns about his past connections to Russia, though at least one IRI witness disputed that evidence to the FBI, the memos show.

Yet, omitting his extensive, trusted assistance to the State Department seems inexplicable.

If Mueller’s team can cast such a misleading portrayal of Kilimnik, however, it begs the question of what else might be incorrect or omitted in the report.

And former Trump attorney John Dowd made a compelling case that Mueller’s report wrongly portrayed a phone message he left for a witness.

Someday the U.S. Will Have to Actually Deal With Its Nuclear Waste Problem,https://slate.com,['Jane C. Hu'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/department-of-energy-nuclear-waste-reclassification-yucca.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Jeff J. Mitchell—WPA Pool/Getty Images.

Of all the things in the world to worry about, nuclear waste management is not at the top of most people’s lists. We trust (or hope, at least) that expert scientists and policymakers will make good decisions about how to make sure radioactive byproducts stay far, far away from us, by whatever means possible. But, many of those experts say, we’re going to need to figure out a new way to manage our country’s nuclear waste—and soon.

To that end, the Department of Energy announced Wednesday that they are reclassifying the definition of “high-level,” or highly radioactive, waste stored in underground tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. The DOE hopes that the redefinition will expedite cleanup of the waste. Currently, the high-level waste stored at these sites is waiting for the government to open a secure waste repository (like Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which has been in limbo for decades). But if some of the less radioactive waste qualifies under the new definition, it might instead be shipped off to other sites, like one in Texas, where it could be mixed with “concrete-like grout.” The cleanup at Hanford has already cost the country billions of dollars and is projected to cost billions more as we continue the search for the waste’s final home. (Adding some urgency to developing a new plan is the risk that containers could leak and contaminate the environment, especially if there’s an earthquake in Washington.)

The DOE’s new plan could be cost-effective, sure, but the question is whether it’s safe. When the agency first announced reclassification plans in October 2018 and solicited public comment, the proposal received thousands of responses. And Washington state officials are not happy; Gov. Jay Inslee and Department of Ecology Director Maia Bellon have both sent letters of concern to the DOE. “I am gravely concerned with DOE forging ahead with a new interpretation of HLW that does not comport with federal law, despite objections from Washington state,” wrote Bellon.

Some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts.

In addition to the waste we already have sitting around at Hanford and other old nuclear weapons facilities (charmingly called “legacy waste”), nearly 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 60 facilities around the U.S. are creating new waste every day. The type of waste produced by those two types of facility contains different radioactive materials with varying half-lives, but the same storage issues remain: What will we eventually do with all this radioactive stuff?

The lack of solution is not from lack of discussion. There have been all sorts of wacky ideas floated about where to store nuclear waste. Some have proposed we shoot it all into space, maybe have it orbit Venus. But given how spacecraft are prone to explosions, which would effectively mean showering the world with bits of radioactive waste, that idea stalled. In the ’90s, the idea of burying waste in deep ocean seabeds seemed promising, but it never really got off the ground. And some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts. As the earth thaws out, old waste becomes uncovered.

Here in the U.S., we’re running out of space, and experts are concerned about the lack of long-term solutions. “Instead of a planned, coherent system, we have the confusion of an unplanned, less than optimal system,” nuclear experts wrote in a 2018 report on nuclear waste management strategy and policy, calling the U.S. program “an ever-tightening Gordian Knot” subject to technical, scientific, logistical, regulatory, legal, financial, social, and political challenges. “This is not a situation that builds public confidence.”

Currently, we’re at a standstill. In 1987, the government designated Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada as the storage facility for waste, but more than three decades later, proper approvals are still pending. Buckets of radioactive waste are still sitting around at the various facilities around the U.S., waiting for a place to go. While critics from environmental advocacy organizations like Columbia Riverkeeper and National Resource Defense Council have condemned the DOE’s reclassification, calling it “irresponsible,” “outrageous,” and an “attempt to cut corners,” local government welcomed the new policy. Richland, Washington, Mayor Bob Thompson told the Tri-City Herald that the decision was a “fantastic opportunity” to speed up Hanford’s cleanup.

We could avoid adding to the problem by trying to reduce the amount of waste generated. One way to do that is to recycle. By separating out uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, engineers can reuse those in reactors to generate additional energy and throw out the rest. “Ninety-five percent of original energy is in the unused fuel,” says Kathryn Huff, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois, who likens the process to recycling a soda can: You wash out the sugar and dirt to reuse the aluminum. By reusing fuel, nuclear plants could cut down on the amount of space they need for waste containment by an order or two of magnitude.

On that front, countries like France, the U.K., and Japan are way ahead of us. France, in particular, leads the game; it generates about 80 percent of its energy through nuclear plants, but thanks to its recycling site, called La Hague, the waste currently fits “in a room not significantly bigger than a basketball court,” says Huff. Of course, the U.S. is a far bigger country than France, we’ve run our reactors for longer, and we have a lot more waste already sitting around, so we’ll never shrink our waste pile to that size. But La Hague is a testament to how the amount of true waste can be reduced through reprocessing.

Adopting recycling is subject to many of the same logistical and regulatory pitfalls as building a repository. For one, recycling is more expensive, and without regulatory pressure to change existing systems, commercial nuclear energy plants may not want to pony up the cash. (Opponents of reprocessing, like the Union of Concerned Scientists, also point to high costs of reprocessing, estimating it could cost tens or even hundreds of billions to implement.) Beyond the costs of just reprocessing waste, we’d also have to build critical infrastructure, like recycling facilities and retrofitting of existing reactors to accept recycled fuel. France’s energy system is government-run, and its government has decided to invest the money to have less waste sitting around in the long term.

To make progress on recycling, or building a repository, or even having a coherent plan for the roughly 80,000 metric tons of waste in our country, experts say any decisions about nuclear management need to be removed from the political cycle. “The instability in the dynamics of American politics makes it a challenge to develop a sustainable program,” says Huff. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, a group of experts assembled by the Obama administration in 2012, brought up similar concerns in its recommendations and suggested that the government establish an entirely new government entity to oversee nuclear waste policy. “The overall record of DOE and of the federal government as a whole, however, has not inspired widespread confidence or trust in our nation’s nuclear waste management program,” the commission wrote in the final report. “The Commission concludes that a new, single-purpose organization is needed … to get the waste program back on track.” Members recommended also that this organization would solicit active consent from affected communities and implement policies that would provide continuity from administration to administration.

But until then, it seems inevitable that the rules will keep shifting, and we’ll keep passing the buck on the problem of waste management. What’s now “high-level” waste seems destined to be reclassified, but it’s also possible that the next administration could change the definition right back. Unless the government moves toward a longer-term solution, we’ll likely be stuck in limbo until something catastrophic happens, the waste’s radioactivity decreases over thousands of years, or the world ends—whichever comes first.

Treasury pushes back at report critical of Trump tax law's effects,https://thehill.com,[],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/447513-treasury-pushes-back-at-report-critical-of-trump-tax-laws-effects,"The Treasury Department is pushing back on a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report finding that President Trump Donald John TrumpKey figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source De Blasio: There's too much talk about impeachment among Democrats De Blasio: There's too much talk about impeachment among Democrats MORE’s 2017 tax law had little to no effect on the economy in its first year, calling the methodology of the report “flawed.”

“After careful review of the Report, it appears that CRS’s economic analysis of the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] used a flawed methodology that tacitly assumed the anticipation of the Trump Administration’s tax and regulatory relief had no effect on the economic outlook of the United States,” Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy David Kautter wrote in a letter to lawmakers earlier this week.

CRS, an entity within the Library of Congress that provides analyses to lawmakers, said in its report about the 2017 tax law that “the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy.” CRS’s analysis was based on comparing actual gross domestic product (GDP) figures in 2018 to the Congressional Budget Office’s April 2018 estimates of GDP with and without the tax cut.

The report, released late last month, quickly caught the attention of Democratic lawmakers and policy experts, who highlighted it as proof that the GOP tax law has fallen short of Republicans’ promises.

The report comes as Trump is starting to run for reelection, and a key part of his campaign is likely to be the strength of the economy during his first term. The tax law Trump signed in December 2017 is the president’s biggest legislative accomplishment to date, and Democrats are likely to use the CRS report to undercut Trump’s arguments that his policies have boosted the economy.

Treasury’s criticism of the CRS report centers on the fact that the service compared 2018 data to economic forecasts from the beginning of 2018, rather than forecasts from before Trump took office. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had increased its estimate of 2018 GDP between June 2017 and April 2018.

Treasury argued that the CRS report excludes an economic theory that people will take actions, such as new investment and hiring, before a policy change is implemented if they expect the policy change to occur.

“Beginning in January 2017, the Trump Administration began implementing an economic agenda to reduce burdensome regulations, engage the private sector to promote pro-growth policies, and negotiate trade deals to open up market access for American businesses,” Kautter wrote. “Therefore, appropriate — and truly unbiased — economic analysis should have benchmarked the impact of the Trump Administration’s economic agenda against forecasts of the economy generated prior to January 2017.”

“Analysis that commences after that time — let alone after the policies are implemented — is biased by the fact that people in the economy started responding immediately to the aggressive agenda pursued by President Trump, including by the widespread expectation of individual and corporate tax cuts and the resultant effects on the economy,” Kautter added.

He also said that CRS’s report excluded data that “would likely have led to vastly different conclusions.”

Treasury’s letter was sent to a handful of lawmakers, including the leaders of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee.

Michael Zona, a spokesman for Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyDHS official warns GOP senators about 'rented babies' at border DHS official warns GOP senators about 'rented babies' at border Lawmakers expected to offer new version of IRS bill without 'Free File' provision MORE (R-Iowa), said the senator is reviewing the CRS report, Treasury’s letter and other comments the committee has received that have criticized the report.

Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, agreed with Treasury’s arguments and said it was good for the department to push back on the CRS report.

But the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenLawmakers reintroduce bipartisan IRS bill with 'Free File' provision removed Lawmakers reintroduce bipartisan IRS bill with 'Free File' provision removed On The Money: US, Mexico fail to get deal on tariffs | Trump says 'not nearly enough' progress | Dems needle GOP to buck Trump on trade | SEC approves new financial adviser rule MORE (Ore.), said in response to the CRS report that Republicans have attacked every nonpartisan group that has found that their tax law didn’t live up to its promises, and “this is more of the same.”

“The tax cuts haven’t paid for themselves,” Wyden said in a statement to The Hill. “They haven’t raised wages by $4,000. And they haven’t resulted in massive investment.”

Jane Gravelle, one of the authors of the CRS analysis, defended the report.

“We stand by this report. I think the analysis is solid,"" she said.

A CRS spokesperson echoed Gravelle and also said the Service stood behind the report.

Gravelle said that she doesn’t think there was much of a reaction in anticipation of the tax-cut law, because she thinks that people didn’t really know what would happen with tax-cut legislation until late in 2017.

Treasury said in its letter, however, that business optimism and consumer sentiment measures spiked shortly after Trump’s election in anticipation of the president’s agenda.

Kyle Pomerleau, a tax-policy expert at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, said that CRS was correct to compare actual GDP to CBO’s April 2018 projections, rather than to CBO’s projections from 2016, because “more than just the tax law had changed” between 2016 and 2018. He said that the administration’s point about people taking action in anticipation of tax cuts is valid, but not completely relevant to CRS’s analysis which just focused on the law’s effects in 2018.

Pomerleau said that the CRS report “reflects some words of caution that a lot of us have been saying to lawmakers” about not being too optimistic about the GOP tax law’s economic effects.

But he also said that there was an area where CRS misinterpreted some of what CBO estimated, which led to CRS coming to too strong a conclusion about the tax law’s limited impact on the economy.

CRS posted an updated version of the report on Friday that fixed the issue Pomerleau flagged, but Gravelle said that the update doesn't change the report's conclusions."
Watchdog will get an outside review after flawed FEMA disaster response reports,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'June At Pm']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-will-get-an-outside-review-after-flawed-disaster-response-reports/2019/06/07/ebca0b2a-8922-11e9-a870-b9c411dc4312_story.html,"Leslie Andermann Gallagher surveys the flood damage to her home on Aug. 17, 2016, in Sorrento, La. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

The Homeland Security watchdog has agreed to an outside review of its performance following missteps that led it to retract 13 audits of disaster responses that hid problems and instead flattered the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The outside review will be done by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that Homeland Security’s monitor has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA, officials said.

The peer review, to be completed next year, comes after an unusual internal investigation uncovered a disturbing pattern at the oversight agency responsible for rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the sprawling Department of Homeland Security.

John V. Kelly, now the acting inspector general, overrode auditors who flew to communities affected by hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters from 2011 to 2016 to assess how well FEMA helped local residents recover, according to the internal investigation. It said auditors often discovered problems with the response, but Kelly, then in charge of the auditing teams, instead directed them to write what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed its oversight of FEMA’s disaster response with ‘feel good’ reports]

Under pressure from Congress, the inspector general’s office purged the faulty reports from its website in 2017 and 2018 and acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards. Then the watchdog spent 14 months examining what went wrong.

It released an internal investigation in May that found fault with Kelly, his managers and their oversight of a staff that was supposed to offer real-time oversight from the ground of FEMA’s disaster response.

Kelly apologized to his staff of 600 auditors and investigators and took responsibility for failing to “set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

Federal inspectors general are traditionally evaluated by their peers every three years. The Homeland Security inspector general asked to have its next review in 2020, a year early.

Following a report Thursday in The Washington Post, two top Democrats in Congress called on the inspector general’s office to do better.

“We rely on [the office] for fact-based products that are invaluable in conducting oversight, and these reports did not meet the standard,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement.

Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the failures underscore the urgency for the Senate to confirm a permanent inspector general.

“Any effort to gloss over real challenges . . . limits the ability of federal, state and local governments to learn from their mistakes and improve performance for future disasters,” Peters said in a statement.

[Read the inspector general’s internal review of the oversight missteps here]

President Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office.

The office said it is making changes that include more rigorous training of auditors to improve their objectivity, more reliance on direct sources to document their findings and rotating assignments.

The internal review also prompted the agency to address poor employee morale. Deputy Inspector General Jennifer Costello, in her written response, said she wanted “equal measures of self-awareness and accountability” and acknowledged a need for stronger leadership.

The office ranked 303 of 415 of departments that operate as part of larger agencies in last year’s Best Places to Work in the Federal Government survey, and has hovered at the bottom for years.

Charles K. Edwards, the acting inspector general under President Barack Obama, was found by a Senate oversight panel in 2014 to have altered and delayed investigations at the request of senior administration officials, compromising his role as an independent watchdog.

Edwards routinely socialized with department leaders and gave them inside information about the timing and findings of investigations, the report found. And he improperly acquiesced to requests from top political advisers to then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to change the wording and timing of three separate reports.

In an email Thursday, inspector general spokeswoman Erica Paulson said the office is addressing poor morale, appointing an ombudsman, creating an employee advisory council and encouraging more communication between managers and their staffs.

The inspector general “workforce remains focused and dedicated to our mission: rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in DHS programs and operations and issuing high-impact, high-value oversight reports,” Paulson said in a statement.

“While disheartening, the mistakes on this small percentage of our work should not diminish confidence in the great work that this office has done and continues to do on behalf of the American taxpayers.”

Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency watchdog gave Homeland Security a rating of “pass with deficiencies” after reviewing a sample of audits. The black mark came primarily from one audit: The assessment of FEMA’s performance after catastrophic flooding in southern Louisiana in 2016.

The EPA review identified a variety of shortcomings with the audit, including poor supervision and issues with how the staff assessed FEMA’s performance.

“As a result, the audit report may not present a complete assessment of the issues affecting the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) response to the 2016 Louisiana,” reviewers found. The internal investigation supported EPA’s conclusions."
Dems fear report on Russia probe could kill their oversight momentum,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney', 'Tim Starks', 'Laurens Cerulus']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/russia-investigation-probe-justice-trump-1355524,"DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who issued a report on the FBI’s handling of the 2016 Hillary Clinton probe last year, will release a new report on the origins of the Russia probe as soon as this month. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo congress Dems fear report on Russia probe could kill their oversight momentum An internal DOJ report could highlight potential political bias by FBI agents at the heart of the Russia investigation.

Democrats lurching toward potential impeachment and ramping up their probes of President Donald Trump are becoming increasingly worried that the Justice Department will subvert their efforts.

An internal DOJ watchdog report on the origins of the Russia probe is expected to spotlight potential political bias by FBI agents at the heart of the Russia probe. The report, due out as soon as this month and as late as October, could raise pointed questions about the FBI’s decision-making at the time — handing Trump a bludgeon in his long-running campaign to accuse the bureau of mounting a “coup” against him.

Story Continued Below

They fear the report, by DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is respected by lawmakers from both parties, will diminish any momentum Democrats are seeking in their efforts to convince Americans that Trump obstructed the Russia investigation, later taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller.

“Their whole point is to go on a wild goose chase and then to create a chain of implausible connections that show that the special counsel report — and what we’re doing — is somehow fruit of the poisonous tree. It’s absurd,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Judiciary and Oversight committees, said in an interview.

Members of both parties largely acknowledge that the results of the inspector general’s report are likely to bode poorly for the senior FBI officials who decided to launch the investigation into Trump’s presidential campaign — in turn, giving Trump and his allies much-needed political firepower against House Democrats who are seeking to highlight the evidence laid out in Mueller’s report.

Beginning next week, Democrats are pursuing an aggressive public-relations strategy aimed at illuminating the evidence, as laid out in Mueller’s report, that Trump sought to thwart or otherwise shut down the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. That pursuit — part of an effort by Democratic leaders to make the case to the public that Trump should be impeached — could face significant roadblocks if Republicans get their way.

And it’s not just the IG report that could disrupt Democrats’ plans. Trump recently gave Attorney General William Barr broad authority to declassify information about how the Russia probe began — an order that prompted Democrats to warn of selective declassification that wouldn’t tell the full story.

“I don’t think it will throw us off track, but it will certainly give Republicans ammunition to try to divert attention away from the specifics of the Mueller investigation,” said Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. “It’s a profound breach of confidence that the legislative branch has in the executive branch, and a profound disruption in the intelligence apparatus worldwide.”

In particular, the inspector general’s report is likely to embolden Trump and give his allies new ammunition to discredit Democrats’ pursuit of Trump’s personal finances and additional evidence that he obstructed justice — probes that Republicans have long derided as politically motivated and an abuse of congressional authority.

“Because Inspector General Horowitz is known for calling balls and strikes, any validity that he offers in his report that substantiates some of the things that conservative members have been saying for some time … will change the narrative overnight,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a top Trump ally, said in an interview.

Trump is likely to latch on to any hint of evidence that would suggest that an anti-Trump bias permeated the upper echelons of the FBI. His allies on Capitol Hill have been parroting those claims of bias, in addition to allegations that senior officials leaked information to the media and inappropriately relied upon salacious and unverified claims about Trump that were outlined in a controversial dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

“Just like [Democrats] waited for the Mueller report to come out, they should wait for the IG’s report to come out,” Meadows added. “Because the IG’s report will actually go at the root of improper motivations on the investigation.”

Democrats, wary of Republicans’ narrative becoming dominant, are preemptively trying to dispel those claims.

“If there’s really a ‘deep state’ within DOJ to tank Donald Trump, then they should’ve revealed in 2016 that they had a counterintelligence investigation ongoing with regard to the Trump campaign,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), who sits on the Intelligence and Oversight committees. “The fact that they reopened the Hillary Clinton investigation on the eve of the election is potent proof that there’s no deep state conspiracy at DOJ against Donald Trump.”

“There’s nothing there. It’s a big nothingburger,” Krishnamoorthi added.

The release of the IG report will mark the second time in two years that Horowitz’s work will have become a flashpoint in Congress’ efforts to get to the bottom of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Last year, he issued a report on the FBI’s handling of the 2016 Hillary Clinton probe, concluding that he couldn’t find evidence that political bias affected any decisions in the investigation.

His bottom-line finding heartened Democrats, but Horowitz also revealed he was continuing to probe potential bias in the opening of the FBI’s Russia probe, launched just weeks after the Clinton investigation ended in July 2016. One of the agents involved in both investigations, Peter Strzok, has become a fixture for Republicans, who unearthed thousands of text messages last year in which Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page sharply criticized Trump.

“[W]e did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the [Clinton probe] was free from bias,” Horowitz concluded in that report.

Though Horowitz concluded that potential bias was unlikely to have affected the Clinton probe — in part because of multiple layers of decision-making at the FBI — he drew no conclusions on whether Strzok’s personal views infected his actions in the Russia probe, telling lawmakers last year that it was still under review.

The U.S. Agriculture Department has good news it seemingly wants nobody to know about.

On April 23, the USDA released its “School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study,” with no news release, no fanfare. The link on the USDA website disappeared for several days after that and was altogether inaccessible before reappearing under a different URL.

The USDA says the study was “the first nationally representative, comprehensive assessment” of school meals after the implementation of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, a key initiative of the Obama administration that mandated healthy changes in food at schools.

The best news was that the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010), a multicomponent measure of diet quality, shot up dramatically for both school-provided breakfasts and lunches.

For the 2009-2010 school year, the score for breakfast was an abysmal 49.6 out of 100 (even lower than the overall American average of 59), rising to 71.3 by the 2014-2015 school year. In that same time frame, the lunch score went from 57.9 to 81.5. The score for whole grains in school meals went from 25 to 95 percent of the maximum score, and the score for greens and beans rose from 21 to 72 percent.

In addition, there was greater participation in school meal programs at schools with the highest healthy food standards. And the study found food waste, a troubling national problem in the lunchroom, remained relatively unchanged.

[Why banning ‘meal shaming’ isn’t enough]

The 52-page summary of study findings is chockablock with other good news, so why isn’t Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue crowing about it?

The USDA did not respond directly when asked about the rollout beyond a statement that said it conducts studies like this to inform choices on policies and program operations, and that “we intend to use it to make these great programs even better.”

“It seems fairly outside of the norm for a federal agency to release a study that directly contradicts what the administration’s position is,” explained Elizabeth Balkan, food waste director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “That’s why it was released very quietly.”

In December, Perdue announced the USDA was weakening school nutrition standards for whole grain, nonfat milk and sodium, all of which had been tightened during the Obama administration. He cited food waste and nonparticipation as key rationales for the shift.

“If kids are not eating what is being served, they are not benefiting, and food is being wasted,” he said at the time.

About two-thirds of the 30 million children who eat school meals every day qualify as low-income and are getting meals free or for a reduced price. Low-income kids are disproportionately affected by obesity and are less likely to be fed healthy meals at home, so the nutritional makeup of those school meals is impactful. Kids can get more than half of their daily calories from school meals.

[Spray cheese, beef jerky and stuffed olives to be counted as staples under Trump administration food stamp proposal]

“As a nutrition and public-health policymaker, what’s extraordinary is for a policy to have that large an effect, to affect tens of millions of school kids. If you consider the crisis that we face — people living shorter, less healthy lives — solutions usually take decades,” said Jerry Mande, a senior USDA official during the Obama administration who was involved in developing the standards. “Within two years there’s a dramatic change. This demonstrates the power the USDA has to change the way kids eat. We should be doubling down on this.”

Advocates say the push to roll back stricter requirements is consistent with President Trump’s overall mission of deregulation.

“Waste was the smokescreen,” said Margo Wootan, vice president for nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “There have been several studies that showed that food waste hadn’t increased.”

[Big Money Joins Fight Against $1 Trillion in Wasted Food]

Wootan enumerates many things that can be done — beyond making food saltier, fattier or more processed — to reduce food waste in schools. Have recess before lunch to work up hunger and don’t schedule lunch times midmorning before kids are peckish. Cut up apples instead of offering them whole. Offer taste tests and share tables and give students opportunities to provide more input. Perhaps most importantly, adopt an “offer versus serve” approach at elementary schools and middle schools (it is required at high schools). This means that students can select three out of five meal components and avoid things they don’t like and are likely to discard.

“The Trump administration wants to tick off the maximum number of regulations it can say it rolled back,” Wootan said. “It’s another tick mark on the deregulatory agenda.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 13.7 million, or 18.5 percent, of children aged 2 to 19 are obese. That percentage is higher for Hispanics (25.8 percent) and non-Hispanic blacks (22 percent).

The American Medical Association changed the term obesity from a condition into a disease in 2013. The CDC says obesity puts people at an increased risk for all causes of death, but it is linked to high blood pressure and cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and some cancers.

The School Nutrition Association, the trade group for school food-service manufacturers and school food professionals, has commended Perdue for seeking regulatory flexibility.

Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the association, says that although the study findings are very positive, the new standards have presented challenges for school districts.

“We’re seeing a lot of schools struggle with cultural preferences with students. Like white rice — some cultures don’t eat brown rice. And in the Southwest, there are students who are not familiar with a whole-grain tortilla.”

She also says that participation in school lunch programs has dropped, from 32 million to 30 million, under the new standards, and that as a result, costs per student have increased.

Schools are forced to rely more heavily on a la carte items (a sandwich, rather than the full meal with fruits, veggies and milk) to stay solvent.

Schools have also looked to restaurant practices, offering more customizable meals such as burritos made to order, to boost participation, and catering programs on the side to bolster revenue. Bottom line, she says: The cost of preparing the new style of meals frequently exceeds the cost of reimbursement.

However, that runs counter to the study’s finding that healthier meals did not impose a greater financial burden.

“There was no significant association between reported cost per NSLP (National School Lunch Program) lunch and the nutritional quality of the meals,” the study said. “That is, mean reported costs per NSLP lunch were not significantly higher in schools that prepared more-nutritious meals . . . than in schools that produced the least-nutritious meals.”"

Former DHS official on CBP declaring 'full-blown' border emergency: Authorities at point of 'desperation',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/cbp-declaring-full-blown-border-emergency,"The head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) declared Wednesday a ""full-blown emergency"" at the southern border, as the number of apprehensions surged last month to levels not seen in more than a decade.

Responding on ""America's Newsroom"" Thursday, former Department of Homeland Security official Theresa Cardinal Brown said it's clear that authorities at the border are in a state of ""desperation.""

Brown said the situation is different from years past because of the number of families and children who are seeking asylum at the border and having to be detained.

OPERATION TARGETING MS-13 GANG IN TEXAS NETS NEARLY 2 DOZEN ARRESTS, OFFICIALS SAY

TRUMP SAYS MEXICO IS AN ‘ABUSER’ OF THE US, AMID TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS

In his comments to reporters, Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders called the immigration system ""broken,"" explaining that facilities housing migrants near the border are ""well beyond capacity.""

""This ongoing crisis has placed a tremendous strain on our limited resources and operational effectiveness,"" he warned.

Brown told Bill Hemmer that Border Patrol agents and other officials feel like they're not getting enough support and resources from lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

MEXICO OFFICIALS PREPARE TO INTERCEPT ABOUT 1,000 MIGRANTS

""I hear very much the desperation of operators and people whose job it is to deal with the people they encounter at the border effectively and humanely, who feel like they're not able to do their job. ... It is a crisis,"" she said.

Brown said the White House and lawmakers from both parties need to come together and figure out how to deal with the crisis.

She said tensions are high between House Democrats and President Trump in particular, but she pointed back to Bill Clinton negotiating ""significant legislation while he was under impeachment.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible -- more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year.

The number of apprehensions was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

The latest figures could embolden President Trump amid tense negotiations with Mexico over the immigration crisis.

Last week, in an effort to force Mexico to do more to “stop the invasion” of migrants into the U.S., the president vowed to impose a new 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports. The tariffs, set to go into effect on June 10 absent an agreement, would increase over time, reaching 25 percent by Oct. 1.

Congress and Mueller need to step up and protect America from presidents like Trump,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donald Ayer', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/07/trump-tramples-constitution-congress-mueller-protect-america-column/1351993001/,"CLOSE

Congress should pass laws to prevent dangerous norm-smashing by Trump and potential like-minded successors. And Mueller must talk to counteract Barr.

I was appointed a United States attorney by President Ronald Reagan and later a deputy attorney general by President George H.W. Bush. All of us at the Justice Department swore an oath to defend the Constitution, not a president or political party. It is not easy for me to acknowledge that we are witnessing a slow-motion unraveling of the bedrock belief that no one is above the law, not even the president.

This unraveling is aided and abetted by a chief law enforcement officer who first articulated his extreme view of executive power more than 30 years ago: William Barr believes the attorney general is “the president’s lawyer.” He is acting like it today, breaking norms that protect the integrity of the justice system no matter who is in the White House. That is why former special counsel Robert Mueller must resist his own instincts to return to private life, and Congress must insist that the truth be told and that norms threatened today be codified into law.

We need a bipartisan response to Barr

Barr has just been thoroughly contradicted by the special counsel. Mueller’s public appearance makes all the more stunning Barr’s action in stepping in to all but exonerate the president 25 days before releasing even a redacted version of Mueller’s report which explicitly stated the opposite. This pattern of behavior by Barr is rooted in his unsolicited memo to the White House and the Justice Department auditioning for attorney general six months before he was nominated.

Mueller report: Attorney General Barr jumped the gun in clearing Trump of obstruction

In that memo, Barr laid out his extreme interpretation of presidential power and of the obstruction of justice statutes and argued it was nearly impossible for a president to commit the crime. He critically pre-judged Mueller’s conclusions before reviewing evidence, writing “Mueller’s obstruction theory is fatally misconceived.” Barr made the untenable claim that Section 1512(c)(2) does not prevent a president from exercising his or her authority over law enforcement proceedings to improperly interfere in an investigation. This extreme view literally puts a president above the law.

How can all of us across the ideological spectrum who reject that view respond effectively?

First, Congress needs to find its voice. Article I of the Constitution gives Congress far-reaching authority to oversee the executive branch. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham are actively providing political cover for Trump to eviscerate centuries-old norms. They must remind themselves that what benefits a runaway executive of their party, could empower an aspiring despot from the left next time. The Mueller report makes a very strong case that Trump obstructed justice, a conclusion more than 1,000 former prosecutors, including lifelong Republicans, reached independently.

Americans need to hear Mueller testimony

Mueller’s report includes 10 instances where President Donald Trump tried to cover up the truth, including ordering the White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller, and then ordering McGahn to “dispute the story and to create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.” The president sought to influence a number of people to lie, and even directed aides to create false documents and reports. Perhaps worst of all, Trump appears to have attempted to silence a number of witnesses, by dangling pardons as a reward for stonewalling investigators. If anyone else did what the president did, they would be facing prosecution and prison. Congress must hold hearings, with or without administration witnesses.

Second, the American people need to hear direct public testimony from Robert Mueller. I have known Bob Mueller since 1977 when we were assistant U.S. attorneys in adjacent offices, and I have always respected his sense of rectitude and restraint, but he waited weeks to set the record straight. By then, the attorney general had whitewashed his report in a conclusory letter and even held a press conference to further tout the White House political spin now discredited by Mueller — discredited everywhere that is but in the minds of busy Americans without time to dissect Mueller’s 448-page, carefully-worded tome.

Given Barr’s unprecedented efforts to misstate his investigation’s findings, Mueller needs to recognize that his work is not quite done. If all he does is repeat the findings of his own report for a second time, that will in itself be a critical act of public service.

Start the climb back to the America we know

Third, Congress needs to legislate. The Mueller report identified norms smashed by this president which must be codified to have meaning again. Barr’s distressing success in obfuscating the law indicates a need for a new statute (perhaps to be called the William P. Barr No One Is Above The Law Act) reaffirming in unmistakable terms that the president is bound by the law like everyone else.

Given Barr’s assertions to the contrary, Congress should probably spell out that a president commits a crime when he or she falsifies a document or orders someone to create false official documents, uses the offer of a pardon to interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation, or encourages a Justice Department investigation into his or her political adversary. And this should be followed by a statement that the inclusion of these specific behaviors engaged in by Trump does not suggest the exclusion of other acts knowingly taken to obstruct an on-going investigation.

It will be a long climb back to the America we have known for generations — but unless Congress does its constitutional duty where Attorney General Barr has been derelict, future presidents might not feel compelled to lead us back in that direction at all. Patriots of all parties must stop this president from running roughshod over the Constitution we are all sworn to defend.

Former FBI lawyer James Baker cooperating with DOJ inspector general's FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-cooperating-with-doj-inspector-generals-fisa-abuse-investigation,"The Justice Department watchdog's investigation into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse might not be winding down yet.

Former top FBI lawyer James Baker said this week he is cooperating with the Justice Department inspector general's investigation.

""I have had a longstanding relationship with the inspector general's office, because I firmly believe in the appropriateness and the need for effective oversight of the FBI,"" Baker said in a CNN interview.

Baker's admission is another sign that despite what Attorney General William Barr said earlier this year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation may not be completed by early June.

A focus of Horowitz's investigation is the FBI's use of an unverified dossier on President Trump's ties to Russia, written by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, to obtain warrants to surveil onetime Trump campaign official Carter Page.

Although Fox News host Sean Hannity said this week that sources were telling him Barr may already have a copy of the inspector general's report on the FISA abuse investigation, a British newspaper reported Horowitz may soon be interviewing Steele, casting into further uncertainty the status of the inquiry.

Baker took a lead role in reviewing those FISA applications before submitting them to the FISA court. He has said he took the information ""seriously"" but ""not necessarily literally,"" and also that he is ""nervous"" about Horowitz.

Baker told CNN he is also open to helping Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham with their review of the origins of the Russia investigation. He stressed that it was a ""small group"" who led the FBI's counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign, namely former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for the Lawfare blog and joined the conservative think tank R Street Institute.

He is also under criminal investigation for alleged unauthorized leaks to the media during his time at the bureau."
State Dept. Forces Out Official Who Worked on Plan That Led to Ex-Employer’s Arms Deals,https://www.wsj.com,"['Dion Nissenbaum', 'Alex Leary', 'Dion.Nissenbaum Wsj.Com', 'Alex.Leary Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-dept-forces-out-official-who-worked-on-plan-that-led-to-ex-employers-arms-deals-11559772745,"The State Department has forced out a senior official who played a role in crafting a plan that led to billions of dollars going to the defense firm he formerly represented as a lobbyist, according to current and former U.S. officials.

Charles Faulkner, who previously represented Raytheon Co., took part in an unusual Trump administration move to declare an emergency over tensions with Iran to fast-track $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, circumventing normal congressional review, these people said.

He resigned as a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department in early May after working on efforts leading to the emergency declaration, these people said.

Mr. Faulkner’s role in the process has raised concerns in Congress, where Democratic lawmakers want to know if Mr. Faulkner violated Trump administration ethics rules by taking part in discussions on the declaration, which cleared the way for Raytheon’s $2 billion deal to sell precision-guided missiles to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

“Should he be making decisions about arms sales he was working on before he came to government?” asked a congressional aide.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans a hearing on next Wednesday on the State Department decisions, according to the panel, and Mr. Faulkner’s role is expected to be a focus of the questioning.

Mr. Faulkner has been a polarizing figure, according to the current and former officials at the State Department, where he served for the last two years as both deputy assistant secretary and acting assistant secretary for legislative affairs, which manages relations with Congress.

Mr. Faulkner declined to comment, referring questions to the State Department, where officials said they couldn't comment on personnel matters.

Amid the rising tensions with Iran, the State Department sought ways to push through the stalled arms sales to the Gulf, according to the current and former U.S. officials.

Related Trump Invokes Emergency Arms Sales Authority to Counter Iran (May 24)

Under a new U.S. law, Secretary of State Pompeo had to order a suspension of some American military support to the Saudi-led coalition unless he assured Congress in writing that the Gulf nation was doing enough to minimize civilian casualties in Yemen.

At the time, Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) had placed a legislative freeze on Raytheon’s $2 billion proposal to sell 120,000 precision guided missiles to the two Gulf allies in the midst of concerns about their use of American weapons in Yemen.

In last year’s debate, Mr. Faulkner and the legislative affairs team were the only ones to urge Mr. Pompeo to certify that Saudi Arabia was doing enough to satisfy U.S. concerns, according to people familiar with the decision.

Mr. Faulkner and the legislative affairs unit said a failure to do so would jeopardize pending arms sales to the Gulf, which included the stalled Raytheon deals, these people said.

At the time, Mr. Pompeo overruled most others on his team and sided with Mr. Faulkner and the legislative team, these people said, and issued the emergency declaration certifying that Saudi Arabia satisfied U.S. concerns about civilian casualties in the conflict.

Since then, members of Congress have expressed increasing alarm about America’s support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen.

More than 10,000 civilians have been killed by the Saudi-led coalition, according to the U.N., and Congress recently voted to cut off all American support to the Gulf countries amid concerns that they weren’t doing enough to minimize civilian casualties in airstrikes using U.S.-manufactured missiles. Mr. Trump vetoed the measure.

Saudi Arabia’s standing in Washington has also been hit by the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and Washington Post writer killed last year by a Saudi hit team at the country’s consulate in Istanbul.

Mr. Trump has been a steadfast advocate of arms sales to allies in the Middle East. When he defended his close ties with Saudi Arabia after Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, he cited arms sales as a major reason.

Newsletter Sign-up

In a statement in November, he wrote, referring to the military needs of Gulf allies: “$110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be enormous beneficiaries – and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business.”

U.S. lawmakers question Mr. Faulkner’s work on the arms sales and want to know if he violated government ethics rules by working on a decision that directly affects Raytheon.

Mr. Faulkner took part in more recent discussions over whether the department should use the emergency provisions of the arms export control laws to fast-track arms sales to Middle East allies, according to the current and former U.S. officials.

He already was preparing to leave the State Department when the discussions over the arms sales arose, the officials said. But his work on the issue contributed to his departure on May 10, the officials said.

The Trump administration required political appointees like Mr. Faulkner to sign ethics pledges that bar former lobbyists from working on issues “directly or substantially related” to former clients for two years while serving in government.

The administration has granted some limited waivers to the pledge, but Mr. Faulkner’s name does not appear on an administration waiver list.

On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Mr. Menendez, announced plans to try and halt the arms sales. The 22 senators said they would work to convince Congress to reject the deals if Mr. Pompeo doesn’t withdraw his decision, potentially setting up a new showdown with the White House.

“We have an obligation to ensure the adequate guardrails are in place and that weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates do not exacerbate the [Yemen] conflict,” said Sen. Todd Young, (R., Ind.). “Iran remains the world’s leading state sponsor of terror, but the current threats that have been briefed to members of Congress do not justify taking this dramatic step.”

Mr. Menendez, in a statement, said: “We will not stand idly by and allow the president or the secretary of State to further erode congressional review and oversight of arm sales.”

DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border,https://www.politico.com,['Marianne Levine'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/dhs-migrants-renting-babies-border-1356307,"A U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle sits near the border wall with Mexico in Calexico, Calif. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo Immigration DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border

Department of Homeland Security officials told senators at a lunch Wednesday that migrants are “renting babies” to speed their trip across the border, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley.

“I can't believe that this actually happened, that the people down there in Central America or Mexico are renting babies to get across the border and then sending the babies back and renting them again to come back across the border,” he Iowa Republican said Thursday.

Grassley said DHS officials made the claim at the GOP’s weekly Steering Committee lunch. He said he did not request additional evidence but expressed alarm if it is true.

“I hope you guys will help advertise that, assuming that the information I heard yesterday was accurate, because that is a humanitarian crisis that we have to be concerned about,” Grassley said.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This not the first time DHS officials have claimed children are being used to make border crossings, though the agency has presented little evidence of fraudulent cases.

Earlier this year, then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the agency uncovered “‘recycling rings’ where innocent young people are used multiple times to help aliens gain illegal entry.”

DHS has recently begun an initiative to look into “fake families” as a way to discourage child trafficking.

Under the pilot program, federal immigration officials have requested DNA samples to help confirm parent-child relationships of migrants caught at the border.

Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Mark Morgan told reporters Tuesday that 206 fraudulent cases had been identified from mid-April through the end of May. However, he did not say how many of those cases involved children traveling with another relative who was not a biological parent or step-father or step-mother.

Grassley’s comments come amid Republican senators' growing frustration that Mexico has not done more to stem crossings at the border.

“Every carrot I know has been exhausted in terms of getting the Mexican government to be more cooperative on a sustained basis,” Sen. Marco Rubio said. “A lot of what’s driving this migration is the reality that they’re going to be assisted on that path toward the United States.”

“Over and over again, Barr seemed to bank on the fact that few people would actually read the full Mueller report and so Trump’s and Barr’s false narrative of ‘no collusion, no obstruction’ would be accepted in the media and by the public,” wrote Rocah. Now that the report is out and Mueller himself has contradicted this, “Barr has done what many good defense attorneys do — attack the investigation and the investigator,” insinuating there was misconduct in the investigation and going after Mueller’s prosecutorial judgment for not explicitly determining whether the president committed a crime.

“If Barr really thought that it was Mueller’s obligation to announce a conclusion about whether he thought Trump had committed a prosecutable crime, he could have directed Mueller (who worked for him) to render one,” said Rocah. “But Barr didn’t do that. And what about the other investigations into Trump? Shouldn’t any other United States attorney’s office with evidence of Trump’s participation in a crime announce their conclusions? The Southern District of New York has already implicated Trump in a campaign finance fraud scheme. This is surely not the outcome Barr intends, but it is the logical outgrowth of his critique of Mueller.”

In contrast to Mueller, who made clear the precedent he was following in his investigation and analysis, Barr is muddying the waters on the basic issues.

“If Mueller had indeed made a mistake in his legal analysis, it would be within Barr’s power to correct that. But nothing about what Barr has said suggests any error by Mueller,” said Rocah. “In his April 18 press conference, Barr claimed that because Trump was ‘frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks,’ these were ‘non-corrupt motives’ that weighed ‘heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.’ That logic is laughable. Most people charged with obstruction of justice (or any crime) are frustrated and angry. That doesn’t negate the seemingly illegitimate and corrupt motives Trump had when attempting to impede the Mueller investigation and other federal investigations. There is just no question that the ‘angry and frustrated’ defense would not be recognized in federal court by a judge or a jury.

Similarly, Rocah added, Barr’s claim that obstruction requires an underlying crime to be proven is not true. “There are dozens of examples of cases brought by the DOJ under different administrations of people prosecuted for obstruction and perjury where no underlying crime was proven,” she wrote. “Plus, if this was true, only the least successful obstructors would ever be prosecuted.”"
"CNN analyst Mudd: Christopher Steele should not talk to DOJ, could turn into 'car wreck'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cnn-phil-mudd-christopher-steele-should-not-talk-to-doj,"A former FBI official and frequent critic of President Trump said Tuesday that Christopher Steele should avoid being questioned by the Justice Department, warning it could turn out disastrously for the former British spy.

Phil Mudd was responding on CNN to reports that Steele agreed to be questioned by investigators about his salacious and unverified dossier on Trump's ties to Russia.

Steele's interview would reportedly happen within weeks in London and it would come on the heels of Attorney General Bill Barr appointing a U.S. attorney to review the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.

The DOJ inspector general is also looking into how Steele's Democrat-funded dossier was used by the FBI to secure surveillance warrants for a former Trump campaign adviser in 2016, despite questions about its credibility.

Mudd said this could turn into a ""car wreck"" for Steele if he goes forward.

""If you go to car races looking for car wrecks, this is significant. This will be a car wreck,"" said Mudd, doubting whether Steele will have sufficient answers on how he compiled the dossier.

“I can’t believe he has perfect answers about the origins of the Steele dossier. I’m not even sure why he’s showing up. If I were him, I’d go to Disney World. I would not go to the Department of Justice, because it will not end up well,"" he said.

Mudd then speculated that Steele wants to be interviewed in an attempt to clear his name so he can resume doing the same kind of work in the private sector.

“Let me give you how this game ends. Christopher Steele shows up in front of the Department of Justice and I’m guessing doesn’t have terrific answers for the quality of the information in that Steele dossier,” said Mudd.

Republicans have long accused former FBI officials of relying too heavily on Steele's dossier in 2016, when a counterintelligence investigation was launched into the Trump campaign."

EPA chief rips media: ‘Reporters are lazy’,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/epa-chief-rips-media-reporters-are-lazy,"President Trump’s EPA chief is stepping up his campaign against what he sees as media bias skewed to disparage him and his agency, ripping online media as unreliable and reporters as “lazy.”

The last straw for Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler was a quote attributed to him this week by a Yahoo News reporter and retweeted by the New York Times that he felt far out of context.

“I mean, is Yahoo even a real news service?” he said in an interview with Secrets.

“The media does a disservice to the American public"" by reporting on global warming, says EPA head Andrew Wheeler. Wants more positive coverage.https://t.co/YYVs4vqTwi — Alexander Nazaryan (@alexnazaryan) June 3, 2019

“Anybody online thinks that they’re a reporter these days,” he added.

After he spoke to the National Press Club this week, Yahoo News tweeted out, “‘The media does a disservice to the American public’ by reporting on global warming, says EPA head Andrew Wheeler. Wants more positive coverage.”

Yahoo News misreporting my quote does little to educate the public and takes away from other reporters who covered my remarks from yesterday. https://t.co/dpD0A5M87a pic.twitter.com/HP0UdxWBV1 — EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler (@EPAAWheeler) June 4, 2019

Wheeler said that he did not like how the quote was framed in the tweet. He said that his comment was aimed at nonstop negative coverage that doesn’t tell the story of years of improvement, a point made in the Yahoo News story.

Yahoo News is a popular news service. The president of the White House Correspondents’ Association is the former Yahoo News White House reporter.

Wheeler said it was one of a long string of media efforts meant to mock Trump’s environmental record. He added that there is a pack mentality with anti-Trump media and he cited the retweeting of the Yahoo report by other media.

“It tells me that most reporters are lazy these days,” he said. “What does it say about the state of journalism today? It’s atrocious,” he said.

“I get stuff out of context all the time. All the time, every single day, almost every single article written about me by the mainstream media takes something out of context,” he added.

Wheeler also charged that the media would not have retweeted anything disparaging about a Democrat without checking first.

“If somebody had put out a fake quote about somebody else that made them look bad, a Democrat or one of the Democratic presidential candidates, they would have verified and double verified and called to make sure it was accurate. They probably wouldn’t have even tweeted it if it was negative against somebody that they liked. They would either ignore it of just double check and triple check it,” he told Secrets in his office.

Despite his wariness with the press, Wheeler continues to grant interviews and give speeches and even said, “I probably need to do more but I don’t have enough hours in the day.”

And while media coverage frustrates him, Wheeler pledged, “I’m trying to make sure that it does not slow down our agenda.”"
Congressional Democrats Demand State Dept. End ‘Disturbing’ Policy Denying Citizenship to Kids of LGBT Couples,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Scott Bixby', 'National Reporter']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senate-democrats-demand-state-dept-reverse-disturbing-policy-denying-citizenship-to-kids-of-lgbt-couples,"Nearly one hundred members of Congress, including five presidential candidates, have added their names to a pair of letters calling on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately reverse a State Department policy that withholds American citizenship from some children of U.S. citizens who are born abroad.

One letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Kamala Harris of California and signed by 17 other Democratic members of the chamber, calls the policy “a thinly veiled attack on LGBTQ Americans whose children are conceived through the use of egg donors and gestational surrogacy.”

“Your Department’s reinterpretation of immigration law to deny the constitutional right of citizenship to the children of same-sex couples who are born outside the United States is extraordinary and deeply disturbing,” the letter states. The letter’s 19 signatories urge Pompeo to immediately drop the State Department’s appeal of a court ruling striking down the policy, “and make it clear that every U.S. married couple is entitled to the same rights under the U.S. Constitution, no matter whom they love.”

In addition to Merkley and Harris, the letter was signed by Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Udall (D-NM), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Another letter, signed by the co-chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and every gay, lesbian and bisexual member of the House of Representatives, was delivered to Pompeo on Thursday afternoon. In that letter, the 80 signatories called the policy “discriminatory and cruel.”

“Welcoming a new child into a family should be a time of joy and excitement, but instead it is being met by your Department treating these couples differently than their different-sex counterparts,” the second letter, led by Reps. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), stated.

The policy in question changes the State Department’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a 1952 law that codifies eligibility for U.S. birthright citizenship. Under the policy, children born abroad via assisted reproductive technology like gestational surrogacy or sperm donation are considered to have been born “out of wedlock,” even if their parents are legally married U.S. citizens.

“Out of wedlock” births abroad face a bevy of legal and logistical hurdles to gaining birthright American citizenship, and the policy has led to numerous instances of the children of U.S. citizens being effectively turned away at the border.

“They basically take our marriage, and they say ‘It doesn’t mean anything. Your child was born out of wedlock,’” Adiel Kiviti, whose three-month-old daughter was born with the help of an egg donor and a gestational surrogate in Canada, told The Daily Beast last month. “We were there when she was born, she took her first breaths in our arms. Make no mistake: We are her parents—we are her only parents on her only birth certificate.”

“This is a very clear attack on families, on American families,” his husband Roee, who married Adiel in California in 2013, said at the time. “Denying American married couples their rights to pass their citizenship, that is flat-out discrimination, and everyone should be concerned about this.”

Two same-sex couples have sued the State Department over the policy, which they say disproportionately affects LGBT families, who stick out when seeking government documents that recognize the birthright citizenship of children born abroad.

The INA makes no reference to biology in determining birthright citizenship of children born abroad to married U.S. citizens, giving the policy little textual support in law. In February, a federal judge ruled that “the basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, and dismissed attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples as “unilateral.”

But the State Department has appealed that ruling, and has fought to summarily dismiss a suit brought by another same-sex couple against the policy.

The publication of a story by The Daily Beast on the policy brought renewed national attention to the issue, prompting nearly every Democratic presidential candidate, as well as senior congressional leadership, to call for the policy’s reversal.

“Once again, the Trump administration is demonstrating just how far they are willing to go to undermine our core values and advance their hateful agenda,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement last month. “The State Department must uphold our laws, end this cruel and inhumane policy and treat every family with the dignity and respect that they deserve.”

In the letter from Senate Democrats, signatories called the department’s legal defense of the policy part of a larger tapestry of decisions that have hurt LGBT Americans, from its decision to not grant visas to the same-sex partners of some foreign diplomats to what they called the “muted” response to anti-LGBT persecution abroad.

“Every new American parent should focus on celebrating the birth of a child, not be consumed with fear that all members of their family may not be welcomed back home to the United States,” the signatories wrote. “The United States can best advocate for LGBTQ rights around the world by living its values at home, especially during this month of Pride.”

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter."
Interior has 5 versions of the secretary's schedule -- but they don't always match,https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/david-bernhardt-conflicting-calendars-interior/index.html,"Washington (CNN) During the early days of the Trump administration, lawmakers and government watchdogs complained agencies weren't turning over Cabinet secretaries' schedules as has been practice. Now, one department has presented those groups with the opposite problem, creating new questions about a lack of consistency and transparency.

The Interior Department has released five different versions of Secretary David Bernhardt's schedule for the first five months of 2019.

The department released Google calendar entries, two versions of daily cards -- which are synopses of the secretary's calendar given to him as a reminder of upcoming events, according to Interior -- briefing book pages and secretary's schedules, which are released on the same section of the Interior website as press releases.

But many of these sources give conflicting information when compared side by side on any given day.

With none of the five sources apparently being the definitive record, it raises questions about what the secretary is actually using to schedule his days and why the public doesn't have access to it.

Conflicting schedules

Take January 10 of this year.

At 9:30 a.m., Bernhardt had a meeting titled ""deputy secretary lapse working group."" Or did he? That information comes from his Google calendar entry, a schedule page and the daily cards for that day. So, it seems clear.

But the briefing book entry for the day says Bernhardt attended a staff meeting at that time. Is that the same meeting or a different one?

Then, according to the briefing book, he had two vaguely described entries -- another staff meeting at 11 a.m. and an ""external lunch off the record"" at noon.

So, what do the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page have at that time? No mention of an 11 a.m. meeting, but an additional 11:45 a.m. meeting with Matt Pottinger and Eric Johnson (NSC) and no mention of a 12 p.m. lunch but a 12:30 p.m. meeting with Brian Jack (OPA), according to the Google calendar and daily cards. NSC stands for the National Security Council and OPA stands for Office of Political Affairs, an office in the White House. The department schedule page seems to confirm that information in a more opaque way, listing an 11:45 a.m. meeting with NSC and a 12:30 p.m. meeting with OPA.

Depending on which calendar you pick, at 2 p.m., Bernhardt either had a meeting with ""Bremberg & Leggit (DPC)"" according to the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page, or he had an ""external call - TRCP,"" according to the briefing book. TRCP stands for Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. A spokesperson for the group confirmed that a member of their organization had a phone call with Bernhardt on that day and time.

At 4:15 p.m., Bernhardt was either in a staff meeting, according to his Google calendar and secretary's schedule page, or he was in an ""AS/WS Operations Meeting,"" according to two versions of the daily cards for that day.

Maybe those are the same, since an operations meeting would presumably be with staff. And that's just one day.

""Like most (if not all) of us, the Secretary of the Interior has a daily schedule that is subject to constant change,"" Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said.

""Appointments that were expected get canceled, unexpected appointments arise and plans get interrupted by events. The department seeks to ensure that the public has access to the secretary's activities by posting online the various tools used to plan his day by different staff members,"" Block said. ""We are constantly working to ensure that the public has a window into the work the secretary is doing on behalf of the American people.""

Five calendars, no consensus

Not all of the calendars conflict every day. On certain days, all five versions of Bernhardt's schedule line up. In some cases, external meetings that don't include meeting attendees on the daily cards have meeting attendees listed in the secretary's schedule page for the same day. Since mid-March, versions of the secretary's schedule pages have included more names of meeting participants.

But there are too many discrepancies to know what the secretary is doing other days. On February 21, there are at least three discrepancies between the name or subject of the meeting, and another 10 instances of meetings and departure times not listed on all the calendars.

And it's not just the entries themselves that don't line up. The different sources of Bernhardt's scheduling information don't cover all five months of 2019. The department posted Google calendar entries from January to May, two versions of daily cards from January to April 16, briefing book pages from January to March and webpages with the the secretary's schedule page from January to March and April 28 to May 24.

The Center for Western Priorities, a watchdog group that focuses on environmental issues and has been critical of the Trump administration, feels the deluge of contradictory information is not just a matter of sloppy record keeping, but rather a concerted effort to conceal the secretary's activities from the public.

""Despite numerous requests from the public, the press, and Congress, David Bernhardt still refuses to release his actual calendar -- the one that tells him not just where to go, but what his meetings are about,"" Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss told CNN. ""It's not just a lack of transparency. It's Bernhardt taking repeated steps to conceal his actions.""

Some of the entries include vague terms like ""external"" and ""internal"" meeting, which Bernhardt has been criticized for in the past, because it gives little insight into who he's meeting with and for what purpose they're meeting.

A CNN review found 88 entries in Bernhardt's daily cards that use the term ""external"" or ""intergovernmental"" to describe a meeting without any further details.

""No one keeps a day planner that only says 'internal briefing' and 'external meeting' with no details. You simply couldn't' function,"" Weiss said.

Calendar controversy continues

Bernhardt, a former fossil fuel lobbyist, previously came under scrutiny from watchdog groups and Democratic members of Congress for not releasing his full schedule publicly. When asked by the House Natural Resources Committee to provide his complete schedule earlier this year, Bernhardt said he had ""not personally maintained a calendar for years,"" and that he had ""no intention of doing so now,"" in a letter to the committee.

A week before his confirmation vote in the Senate, Interior published hundreds of pages of documents containing new details about some meetings that were left off of previous versions of Bernahrdt's calendars.

The House Oversight Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee requested interviews with four Interior staff members to further investigate recordkeeping practices at the department in March.

Before becoming secretary, Bernhardt served as deputy secretary to former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. When Zinke resigned amid a host of ethics scandals at the end of 2018, Bernhardt stepped in to lead the agency in an acting role and was confirmed to the post in April.

When Zinke announced his resignation in December, he referred to the allegations against him as ""false.""

""I love working for the President and am incredibly proud of all the good work we've accomplished together,"" Zinke wrote on Twitter. ""However, after 30 years of public service, I cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations."""
Ex-DHS secretary: 'I'm not quite sure' Trump's tariffs on Mexico will solve immigration problem,https://thehill.com,[],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/447446-ex-dhs-secretary-im-not-quite-sure-trumps-tariffs-on-mexico-will-solve,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge suggested in an interview that aired Friday on ""Rising"" that he did not believe President Trump Donald John TrumpKey figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source De Blasio: There's too much talk about impeachment among Democrats De Blasio: There's too much talk about impeachment among Democrats MORE's move to slap new tariffs on Mexico would solve the immigration issue at the U.S. southern border.

""I'm not quite sure tariffs on Mexico are going to solve the problem for us,"" Ridge, who served under former President George W. Bush, told Hill.TV's Buck Sexton and Krystal Ball on ""Rising.""

""I have a great deal of support for the notion about securing the borders, but I think we politicize the issue instead of solving the problem,"" he continued.

The Hill obtained a draft document on Thursday showing that the president is planning to declare a national emergency in order to implement sweeping tariffs on Mexico over “the failure of the Government of Mexico to take effective action to reduce the mass migration of aliens illegally crossing into the United States through Mexico.”

The move comes as Trump faces backlash within his own party over the tariffs.

Trump has long called for stricter immigration policies, including a wall along the border to deter migrants.

Ridge said he worries that the situation along the southern border has become overly politicized in Washington.

""I don't think that we advance ourselves toward a solution by politicizing the border by simply talking about a wall, and not taking into consideration all the other dimensions of an immigration policy based on a 21st-century world, based on the technology we have, based on relationships we have with the leaders in the region,"" he said. ""Those leaders have a responsibility to help us as well, and right now we've ignored them.""

Judge won't force DOJ to comply with order to release records relating to Michael Flynn,https://www.salon.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/06/judge-wont-force-doj-to-comply-with-order-to-release-records-relating-to-michael-flynn_partner/,"Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan announced in a filing on Tuesday that he will not force the Justice Department to comply with his previous order to release records relating to Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser who was charged as a part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

Last week, the Justice Department boldly defied Sullivan’s orders in a filing, saying that it was refusing to release the audio recordings of Flynn’s discussions with Russian officials, which would include his conversations with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn pleaded guilty in late 2017 for lying to the FBI about the content of these conversations during the Trump administration’s transition period.

The department did release a separate recording and transcript of a voicemail Flynn received from one of Trump’s lawyers, which was relevant to the obstruction of justice investigation. But it said the other materials were not relevant to Flynn’s sentencing, which is the matter before Sullivan.

Many observers saw the refusal as a brash defiance of a judge’s explicit order, and some suggested that it may be a part of Attorney General Bill Barr’s attempts to cover up damaging information for the president.

But Sullivan’s response on Tuesday makes those interpretations less likely.

“The government is not required to file any additional materials or information on the public docket pursuant to the Court’s Orders of May 16, 2019,” the judge’s filing said.

“It was surprising for the court to have asked for these transcripts to be publicly filed in the first place, but it’s even more surprising to see the court back down in the face of outright DOJ refusal,” said Lawfare Executive Editor Susan Hennessey in a tweet. “I’d imagine there was lots of back and forth behind the scenes here.”

She added that it’s possible Sullivan agreed to let the government file the materials under seal.

Former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti said: “I’m surprised by this move, because the information would appear to be relevant to the factors that he is required to consider at sentencing. He appears to be deferring to DOJ’s view of what is relevant.”"
V.A. Prepares for Major Shift in Veterans’ Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jennifer Steinhauer'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/va-health-care-veterans.html,"In the 2018 fiscal year, 1.7 million veterans used some form of private care. That number, based on the department’s eligibility projections, could increase as much as 30 percent under the new Mission Act, adding just over a half-million veterans to the pool seeking private care — although both critics and supporters of the change believe that number is low.

“I think it’s safe to assume that over the next several years you will see more veterans getting their health care in the community,” said Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America — an advocacy group with ties to the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch — which has pursued expanding the use of private health care for veterans. Democrats on Capitol Hill agree.

Even so, it will take some time to see whether the expanded access to private care results in a gentle migration of veterans who are not being well served by nearby V.A. centers, or in a shift of a significant share of veteran care to an increasingly expensive private health care marketplace, starving the V.A., as critics have warned. The quality of care in the private system, as well as wait times within it, will be closely monitored by both opponents and supporters of private care.

“I don’t expect a flood of veterans coming in tomorrow or next week saying I want to go into the private sector,” Robert Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, said Tuesday in an interview. “I’m confident that we will have a good rollout. I’m looking forward to it.” Mr. Wilkie said he will visit the V.A. in Salem, Va., on Thursday to observe the start there.

Mr. Wilkie has repeatedly said that most veterans would continue to seek care at department health care centers because they largely like the care and the understanding of veterans’ issues. Several studies underscore the V.A.’s popularity."

Speaking to a panel of scientists and industry representatives Wednesday, Wheeler went off script to “caution” the experts to be wary of what they read in the media.

“I did a speech on Monday at the National Press Club. Things that I said — well, actually I didn’t even say it. A reporter for Yahoo News put out a tweet with a made-up quote attributed to me,” Wheeler told the audience.

Wheeler was referencing a tweet by Alexander Nazaryan, a national correspondent for Yahoo News, who was in attendance at the Monday meeting.

Wheeler’s speech earlier in the week chastised reporters for failing to report on the “positive” aspects of EPA’s environmental regulation achievements. The administrator made the comments before being pelted with questions about recent regulatory rollbacks done under President Trump Donald John TrumpKey figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source De Blasio: There's too much talk about impeachment among Democrats De Blasio: There's too much talk about impeachment among Democrats MORE having to do with methane, carbon and car emissions.

The Yahoo News reporter tweeted: “‘The media does a disservice to the American public’ by reporting on global warming, says EPA head Andrew Wheeler. Wants more positive coverage.”

The tweet was later retweeted and commented on by two New York Times employees as well as the Sierra Club. Wheeler and the EPA have said the tweet insinuates incorrectly that his comments were about climate change.

“The quote was then later retweeted by two reporters by The New York Times. That tweet was then used by a fundraising mechanism by the Sierra Club, which makes me wonder if those reporters were colluding with the Sierra Club for fundraising purposes,” Wheeler said.

The Sierra Club promptly hit back at Wheeler's comment on Wednesday.

“A former coal lobbyist working for Trump and regularly meeting with and doing the bidding of fossil fuel executives fits the very definition of collusion. Meeting with auto execs before rolling back fuel economy standards or taking direction from your former coal exec boss before rolling back the Clean Power Plan is collusion,"" Sierra Club Resist Campaign Director Maura Cowley said in a statement to The Hill.

""When lives are at stake, our country cannot afford to have an EPA administrator in cahoots with corporate polluters who makes baseless accusations to cover up that reality.""

Wheeler’s comments came a day after the EPA’s press department sent an email blast to reporters challenging the accuracy of Nazaryan’s tweet. The blunt email sent Tuesday, labeled “media fact check,” alleged that “Yahoo News decided to deliberately spread false information on twitter by misreporting Administrator Wheeler's comments.”

“Not once in his speech, did Administrator Wheeler call on ignoring global warming,” the EPA email read. “This false tweet was aggregated by reporters from the New York Times who failed to fact check the tweet for its veracity, but rather used the inaccurate information to advance on their own narrative.”

Responding to Wheeler’s comments Wednesday, Nazaryan tweeted “No collusion!!!”

One of the New York Times reporters referenced in EPA's email, tweeted a clarification Wednesday that acknowledged that the re-tweet did not include Wheeler's full statement.

""His full statement after listing stats on enviro progress was, "" my purpose in doing this is not to minimize the environmental challenges or threats that we face today...."" the reporter wrote.

Wheeler's remarks against the reporters Wednesday came as he was addressing the first meeting of the latest EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB). The board was largely dismantled under former EPA head Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittEPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage EPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees MORE, who argued it was slanted in the direction of scientists and needed to include industry voices. The action was largely panned by the science community as a stunt to suppress inconvenient scientific studies.

One of the EPA rules the SAB is currently considering has to do with science transparency, a rule that would restrict EPA from using scientific studies that do not include details on where the findings come from and how they are determined. The scientific community has also blasted the plan as uncommon and a barrier to those studies that rely on personal, private information. Critics argue it will make it easier for EPA to pass over science that may call for more stringent environmental regulations.

Wheeler said the advisory process had been ""broken"" but was positive that could change.

""Science is the foundation of everything the agency does. There may be disagreements on the policy decisions but those policy decisions are still grounded in the science,"" Wheeler told the board members Wednesday. ""Your role is to give the best scientific advice."""
"DOJ reveals Dems acknowledged Barr subpoena was 'overbroad'; Nadler fires back, offers to meet 'without conditions'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-fires-back-after-house-dems-announce-barr-contempt-vote-dubs-subpoena-unworkably-overbroad,"Hours after the Department of Justice (DOJ) slammed House Democrats for planning a contempt vote against Attorney General Bill Barr -- and charged that Democrats had privately admitted their subpoena requests were ""overbroad"" -- House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler announced late Tuesday that he is open to negotiating with the DOJ ""without conditions.""

The remarkable turn of events reopened the possibility that Barr's contempt vote may be postponed or canceled, if both sides return to the negotiating table. Nadler, however, pointedly refused to cancel the planned contempt vote prior to beginning any new negotiations, as the DOJ had demanded.

At the same time, Nadler criticized what he called DOJ ""brinksmanship,"" and blamed the Justice Department for purportedly cutting off negotiations on May 7.

The brouhaha began Tuesday morning with a DOJ letter, written by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, that blasted House Democrats and Nadler, D-N.Y., for announcing they would vote next week on whether to hold Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SCHOLAR: CONGRESS HEADING INTO 'WORLD OF HURT' WITH BARR CONTEMPT VOTE

In its letter to Nadler, the DOJ publicly revealed that Democrats had acknowledged in a May 24 letter they were open to ""further negotiations"" regarding concerns that their subpoena demands were ""unworkably overbroad."" Nevertheless, Democrats announced just days later their plans to hold Barr in contempt for allegedly failing to comply with those demands.

The DOJ said it was ""prepared to resume negotiations with the committee regarding accommodation of its narrowed Subpoena"" -- as long as Democrats removed the ""threat of an imminent vote by the House of Representatives to hold the attorney general in contempt.""

""The department was disappointed by the committee's abrupt termination of ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching a reasonable accommodation that respects both sides' legitimate interests regarding the materials sought,"" Boyd wrote to Nadler. ""Further, the department is disappointed by news reports indicating that Democratic leaders have scheduled a contempt vote in the House of Representatives for June 11, 2019.""

In his response late Tuesday, Nadler took issue with the DOJ's characterization of Democrats' May 24 letter, and insisted that Democrats had ""always remained open to continuing negotiations. ... We are here and ready to negotiate as early as tomorrow morning.""

""I ... take exception to your characterization of how our prior accommodation efforts ended,"" Nadler wrote back to Boyd. ""Contrary to the account in your letter, the Committee has always remained open to continuing negotiations. We had an offer on the table late on the evening of May 7 when the Department suddenly declared an end to the accommodation process. My staff was still in their offices after the close of business hours awaiting a counteroffer when the Department broke off negotiations with a letter demanding that the contempt vote—scheduled to begin the next day— be cancelled if we wished to proceed with the accommodations process.""

Nadler continued: ""At any rate, we are ready to proceed without conditions—as shown by the initiative we took with our detailed May 24 offer. I should add that, contrary to your argument that the Committee’s continuing accommodation efforts somehow suggest that our prior requests were overbroad, our offer to compromise was intended to respond to your prior objections by seeking a middle ground. We urge the Department to do the same.""

The DOJ's letter, meanwhile, had called on the House Judiciary Committee to ""moot"" its May 8 vote to hold Barr in contempt, which the DOJ called ""premature and unnecessary."" That vote came after congressional Democrats subpoenaed Mueller's full and unredacted report on his probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.

WHY DID MUELLER EDIT TRANSCRIPT OF VOICEMAIL WITH FLYNN LAWYER TO ELIMINATE KEY DISCLAIMERS?

Republicans have countered that federal law protecting secretive grand-jury information would prevent Barr from turning over the entirety of the report. The DOJ has offered Democrats the opportunity to review the report, minus those grand jury-related redactions, in a secure setting -- but those offers have been rebuffed. (In a rare public statement last week, Mueller specifically remarked, ""I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith"" in deciding to make the report ""largely public."")

""It would hardly make sense for the full House of Representatives to act upon the committee's prior recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt for not complying with a subpoena that even the committee now appears to acknowledge was overbroad in seeking immediate disclosure of the entirety of the special counsel's investigative files,” Boyd wrote.

That was a conspicuous reference to the previously unreported May 24 letter to the DOJ, in which the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wrote to privately emphasize ""the Committee's willingness to engage in further negotiations to resolve this dispute"" -- only to resort to public political posturing, the DOJ charged.

The Democrat-led committee also offered to ""identify specific materials that if produced would be deemed to satisfy the subpoena"" in an effort to make the subpoena more workable, according to the DOJ, which quoted the Committee's letter verbatim.

""In your May 24, 2019, letter, the committee appears to recognize that the subpoena is unworkably overbroad and offers -- for the first time -- to narrow the subpoena's scope to cover a much more limited set of documents,"" the DOJ wrote. ""The department believes that the committee's new offer reflects a more reasonable request and could mitigate some of the legal barriers to disclosure that we have discussed.""

ANALYSIS: BARR DETERMINED TO FIND TRUTH BEHIND ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE -- AND DEMS ARE WORRIED

The letter continued: ""The committee held its contempt vote only 19 days after issuing the subpoena. Traditionally, congressional committees have only proceeded with contempt votes after lengthy periods of negotiations have failed to reach an accommodation. For example, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee negotiated with the department over the Operation Fast and Furious subpoena for months, and only voted to cite Attorney General [Eric] Holder for contempt 252 days after issuing its subpoena.""

Since 1975, according to the DOJ, ""committees and subcommittees have averaged 103 days between issuing a subpoena to an executive branch official and holding a contempt vote. By any measure, the committee rushed its decision and bears responsibility for the termination of the accommodation process.”

But in his letter, Nadler took issues with those characterizations.

""We cannot agree that the House’s sense of urgency here is 'premature and unnecessary,'"" Nadler wrote. ""It has been over 100 days since we first initiated the accommodations process on February 22, 2019. The pace with which we are proceeding is consistent with the exceptional urgency of this matter: an attack on our elections that was welcomed by our President and benefitted his campaign, followed by acts of obstruction by the President designed to interfere with the investigation of that attack. All of this misconduct was documented by the Special Counsel in the documents we now seek.""

In a statement, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., highlighted the DOJ's revelation that Nadler apparently signaled a willingness to work with the DOJ.

“After racing to hold Attorney General Barr in contempt, Chairman Nadler finally seems ready to join the Justice Department at the negotiating table,"" Collins said. ""When Judiciary Democrats wield subpoena power like a sword instead of a plow, their investigations bear little fruit. The House Intelligence Committee has shown us that working with the Justice Department in good faith yields documents. Abusing subpoena and contempt authority, however, has left the Judiciary Committee with little to show for its obsessively unreasonable demands.""

As for McGahn, the White House has instructed its former top lawyer not to testify, saying he is legally immune from being compelled to testify about privileged discussions occurring in the course of his official duties. Democrats have responded that McGahn waived that privilege by agreeing to speak to Mueller.

Trump did not assert executive privilege to shield any aspect of the Mueller report itself, and has derided Democrats' efforts as politically motivated attempts to keep what he's called the ""Russia collusion hoax"" alive -- and to distract from or derail -- Barr's own ongoing probes into Justice Department and FBI misconduct.

News of the planned contempt vote came days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation. Last month, Barr appointed the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, John Durham, to lead the investigation, which is to focus on the use of FBI informants and the alleged improper issuance of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to monitor a variety of individuals, including former Trump aide Carter Page.

A Barr contempt vote would be historic, but not unprecedented. In 2012, the GOP-controlled House's vote to hold the attorney general at that time, Holder, in contempt for failing to comply with investigations into the Obama administration's failed gun-running sting operation, ""Fast and Furious."" Holder became the first-ever sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress in that manner.

The resolution scheduled for a June 11 floor vote would allow the Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement of its subpoenas in federal court.

Such an approach would rule out so-called ""inherent contempt,"" a process in which Congress technically can enforce contempt citations on its own -- whether by arrest or fine. In May, Barr reportedly joked about that possibility with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, asking, ""Did you bring your handcuffs?""

Chris Grundler, who currently serves as director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality, will become director of the Office of Atmospheric Programs that oversees the agency’s climate change programs and other functions, switching roles with Sarah Dunham, who has held that role since 2011.

Grundler, who has been head of the transportation office with about 400 employees since October 2012, oversaw the roll-out of some of the agency’s most important regulations, including greenhouse gas standards for light-duty vehicles, the second phase of commercial heavy-duty truck emissions rules and biofuel requirements.

He has also overseen efforts to address excess diesel emissions in vehicles, including the EPA’s review of Volkswagen AG and Fiat Chrysler polluting vehicles.

Grundler’s office is also investigating Ford Motor Co’s disclosure in February that employees had raised concerns with its fuel economy and emissions testing.

Bill Wehrum, EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, said in a statement the move “brings fresh and different perspectives to these critical EPA offices, while providing new leadership opportunities for two outstanding senior executives.”

Wehrum said in a memo that Dunham “has been at the center of some of EPA’s most important work on climate change and overseen the continuing success” of its market trading programs and implementation of the Montreal Protocol.

Grundler declined to comment and Dunham could not immediately be reached.

The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed rolling back the Obama-era vehicle fuel efficiency rules and greenhouse gas emissions limits in August and backed a freeze on fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026.

Those rules are still being finalized by the agencies and have not yet been submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review."
