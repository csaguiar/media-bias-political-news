"Trump 'deserves' Khashoggi treatment, Maher guest Fran Lebowitz says before backpedaling",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Fran Lebowitz', 'Liberal Author', 'Bill Maher', 'Real Time', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/maher-guest-suggests-trump-should-be-turned-over-to-saudis-for-khashoggi-treatment,"Liberal author Fran Lebowitz went to the extreme Friday night during an appearance on ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" suggesting that President Trump should not only be impeached but killed.

Lebowitz began by saying she felt ""plagued"" by Trump's presidency and ""shocked"" by what she claimed was criminal behavior by Attorney General William Barr over his handling of the Mueller report.

But when she was asked about impeachment, Lebowitz did not think that was enough punishment for the president, who has not been charged with any crimes.

BILL MAHER: THE DEM WHO 'STANDS UP' TO THE TWITTER MOB WILL WIN NOMINATION

""Certainly, he deserves to be impeached. I mean, impeachment is just the beginning of what he deserves. Not even scratching the surface of what he deserves,"" Lebowitz said. ""Whenever I think about this and what he really deserves, I think, 'We should turn him over to the Saudis, you know, his buddies. The same Saudis who got rid of that reporter, you know. Maybe they can do the same for him.'""

""Certainly, he deserves to be impeached. I mean, impeachment is just the beginning of what he deserves. Not even scratching the surface of what he deserves."" — Fran Lebowitz, liberal author

Her remarks, which drew some applause from Maher's studio audience in Los Angeles, was in reference to the 2018 murder of Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi, who is believed to have been tortured and dismembered with a bone saw, purportedly under the orders of the Saudi government.

During the show's ""Overtime"" segment, however, Lebowitz said the ""Real Time"" producers told her that her remarks were getting blowback on social media, which prompted her to walk them back.

""I saw your face when I said it. I didn't even realize that I said it. I had twelve cups of coffee,"" Lebowitz told Maher. ""I regret saying it.""

""You know, everyone's too, too, too, too ... "" Maher told the panel. ""I mean, it's a live show. You really don't want to see the president dismembered by the Saudis. I don't like Donald Trump either. ... but no matter who the president is, we don't want physical harm.""

""I don't like Donald Trump either. ... but no matter who the president is, we don't want physical harm."" — Bill Maher, ""Real Time"" host

""I did not mean that and I regret saying it. I regret that everyone misinterpreted it because they misinterpret everything,"" Lebowitz added.

The situation seemed reminiscent of the May 2017 controversy surrounding comedian Kathy Griffin, who posed for a photo while holding a fake head of Trump, dripping with fake blood, as if the president had been beheaded. The photo drew scorn from around the world, and Griffin lost work as a result, including an annual New Year's Eve gig on CNN.

Lebowitz is an author and speaker best known for her appearances on ""The Late Show with David Letterman."" She also appeared on ""Law & Order"" and in the film, ""The Wolf of Wall Street."""
Opinion | Does Anyone Actually Want Joe Biden to Be President?,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jill Filipovic'],05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/opinion/joe-biden-president.html,"Those assumptions about electability reflect entrenched biases more than political science, and have a dash of arrogance to boot. An electable candidate, the thinking goes, has to be authentic and broadly appealing. But authenticity itself is coded as white and male when it’s defined by white men.

This perpetual reading of the white working-class tea leaves (or beer hops?) only makes sense if those voters are actually more influential than all the others. In the Democratic Party, they’re not. Just under a third of white men without college degrees said they voted for a Democrat in the 2018 midterms. And Democrats don’t need anywhere near a majority of these men to win. Women vote in larger numbers than men; voters with college and post-graduate degrees turn out in larger shares than those without. These high-turnout groups are the same ones that are trending Democratic. If they're motivated to turn out to vote, a Democrat will wind up in the White House.

But what about those Obama-to-Trump swing voters who will reportedly make or break this election, as they did the last one? The Democratic Party shouldn’t leave anyone behind, but working-class white men are declining as a share of the Democratic base, while whites generally are declining as a share of the general population. The entire premise that white men without college degrees are the only possible swing voters is a faulty one.

There’s also little evidence that most voters pick a candidate based on policies and that a moderate candidate who wrote campaign talking points to appeal to a broad swath of voters would do significantly better than a more visionary and progressive one. Instead of trying to win back a waning electoral and demographic force, Democrats would be better served to consider what will get voters to the polls. Hillary Clinton’s loss can only be explained by a long list of factors, but surely one of them was apathy: The certainty that she had the election in the bag probably depressed voter turnout.

Contrast that to the 2018 midterms, which had a record-setting turnout — and a record number of women elected. Disgust with the Trump administration surely pushed voters to the polls. But so did a slew of exciting candidates who don’t look like the old models of “electable.” They looked a lot more like the people actually electing them.

Women made record numbers of political contributions in 2018 and, at least anecdotally, dominated campaigns behind the scenes. Mr. Trump’s white working-class base still voted Republican, although in lower numbers than when he triumphed. Women of color, and particularly black women, continued their trend of staunchly supporting Democrats, and turnout among racial minorities hit a high at 28 percent of voters, and 38 percent of voters under 30. A majority of white women with college degrees voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, but it was this group that gave Democratic candidates a new advantage in 2018, increasing its support for Democrats over Republicans by 13 percentage points from two years earlier.

In several key states, including Ohio and Florida, white women with college degrees flipped: A majority voted Republican in 2016 and Democratic in 2018. White men, regardless of education, did not. It’s white women, not working-class white men, who are the most promising swing voters for Democrats in 2020, and who could wind up as loyal lifelong Democrats."

BILL BARR VOWS TO UNCOVER 'EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED' WITH RUSSIA PROBE, SAYS EXPLANATIONS HAVE BEEN 'INADEQUATE'

The criticisms come after Barr appointed federal prosecutor John Durham to look into the origins of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation into possible collusion with the Trump campaign.

Fleischer praised the decision to commence the new investigation, and told Ingraham that Barr is ""exactly what we need now - [and] to figure out what, if anything, was done improperly when they authorized all of these wiretaps and surveillance techniques to be used against Trump.""

""Yes,"" Barr said. ""I thought I was in a position where this kind of criticism really wouldn't bother me very much.""

""The fact of the matter is, Bob Mueller did not look at the government's activities, he was looking at whether or not the Trump campaign had conspired with the Russians,"" Barr said.

Standoff over venue threatens to derail Trump visit to Ireland,https://www.cnn.com,['Matthew Hoye'],05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/17/politics/us-ireland-trump-visit-venue-hotel-golf/index.html,"(CNN) A standoff is heating up between advance teams from the Irish and US governments over a potential presidential visit next month to the Emerald Isle.

President Donald Trump is expected to travel to Ireland for two nights during his visit to Great Britain and France to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day.

An Irish government source with knowledge of ongoing discussions told CNN that the White House is insisting the Irish prime minister, or taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, come to the President's golf course in Doonbeg to host a meeting between the two leaders.

According to the source, ""The Irish government feel that protocol dictates that any event they host for President Trump should be at a venue of their choosing and certainly not at an hotel owned by Trump.""

""It is a bit unseemly to demand that the taoiseach host President Trump at his hotel,"" the source said.

Trump aides try to quash tax hike rumors amid infrastructure talks,https://www.politico.com,"['Nancy Cook', 'Andrew Restuccia']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/17/trump-tax-hike-rumors-infrastructure-1331703,"White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has been trying to quiet fears of a tax hike to support a White House infrastructure proposal. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images white house Trump aides try to quash tax hike rumors amid infrastructure talks Senior advisers have repeatedly downplayed the possibility in private meetings with fiscal conservatives who are expressing alarm.

The White House is reassuring conservative leaders that it has no plans to hike the gas tax to help fund a massive infrastructure package that President Donald Trump hopes to negotiate with Congress.

Both acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Russ Vought, Trump’s budget director, have repeatedly downplayed the possibility in private meetings with fiscal conservatives who are expressing alarm that Trump might embrace a massive tax increase. Concerns have specifically centered around a potential gas tax boost, an idea that Trump has flirted with during his presidency.

Story Continued Below

“It is my understanding that they are not going to be agreeing to any tax increases,” said Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist in an interview. Norquist said he has discussed the matter with White House officials in recent days, but did not disclose specifics. He was spotted at the White House on Friday, where he attended a meeting with Vought in which conservative leaders discussed upcoming spending battles, according to two attendees.

In a rare moment of bipartisan comity, Trump agreed last month in a meeting with Democratic leaders to devise an infrastructure plan of up to $2 trillion to build things like roads, bridges and high-speed rail. But the feel-good gathering punted the vexing question of where the massive sum of money would come from, prompting competing ideas and speculation from across the political spectrum.

One long-simmering rumor that took off after the meeting was that Trump might endorse an increase in the gas tax to help fund the infrastructure package. It’s a prospect that deeply unsettles conservatives and some administration officials, who oppose any tax increase to pay for the projects. Bloomberg reported Friday that a draft internal document mentioned a gas tax increase as an option for financing the plan, intensifying the jitters in conservative circles.

The notion that Trump might break with conservative anti-tax orthodoxy has also gotten traction because of reports that he expressed support for a 25 cent-per-gallon tax during a meeting with lawmakers in early 2018.

Although officials called the fears overblown, they also concede that — as with any policy issue — Trump could always change his mind.

The private discussions come as Trump is planning to meet next week with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats to discuss options to pay for the plan. The meeting is currently scheduled for Wednesday, according to two administration officials. Pelosi and Schumer previously met with Trump at the White House in late April.

“On Wednesday, the president will welcome congressional Democrats to the White House to continue the discussion on rebuilding our nation’s crumbling infrastructure,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. He otherwise declined to comment.

While the two sides originally settled on a $2 trillion price tag, the president subsequently seemed to backtrack in a tweet in which he put the cost at between $1 trillion and $2 trillion.

Senior White House aides and members of Congress are deeply skeptical that a massive infrastructure bill can get approved. While both Democrats and Republicans agree in theory on fixing the country’s aging roads and bridges, they have been fighting for years about how to pay for such a plan.

The political reality could result in a standoff between Trump and Democratic leaders, with both sides publicly going through the motions of negotiating an infrastructure deal in hopes of pointing the finger at the other side if it falls apart. Both Democrats and Republicans are keen to at least appear productive, reasonable and bipartisan heading into the 2020 presidential election.

“It’s all about positioning themselves it in a way that you can blame the other side for nothing happening,” said a person close to the White House who has been involved in the infrastructure discussions.

Part of the reason White House officials remain wary of delving into specifics about the best way to pay for infrastructure improvements is because they have yet to develop a concrete plan internally. They also fear Democrats will use anything discussed in the meeting to score political points.

Trump acknowledged as much in an interview with Fox News set to air on Sunday, insisting he is interested in an infrastructure deal, but that “I also think we're being played by the Democrats a little bit.”

“I think what they want me to do is say, ‘Well what we’ll do is raise taxes, and we'll do this and this and this,’ and then they'll have a news conference — ‘see, Trump wants to raise taxes,’” he said in a clip released Friday. “So it's a little bit of a game.""

The president also appeared to criticize Mulvaney for publicly downplaying the prospects of passing an infrastructure bill.

“If Mick Mulvaney said that, then he has no right to say that,” Trump said. “He tells me he didn’t say that and he didn’t mean it. He said it’s going to be hard to finance.”

A senior administration aide said the president and Mulvaney remain 100 percent on the same page on infrastructure.

Inside the White House, officials have been making the case that a hypothetical gas tax would not raise anywhere close to the $2 trillion needed. And, they’ve argued, it would ultimately undercut the gains consumers received from the Republicans’ 2017 tax bill.

Conservative groups say they will be closely watching Wednesday’s meeting between Trump and congressional leaders. “I don’t think anyone has gone so far to rule it out ahead of time, because no one wants to get ahead of the president,” said one conservative following the talks.

The administration is weighing other options to raise anywhere from $1 to $2 trillion to fund an infrastructure package. It’s unclear how much of that money would come from the federal government versus the private sector.

Policy ideas that have been floated include selling off government assets to raise additional funds, or re-introducing spending offsets from the president’s past budget proposal as part of the negotiation. Staffers from the White House’s National Economic Council, Vought’s Office of Management and Budget and the Treasury Department have all been part of the discussion.

Outside conservative groups have latched onto a bipartisan bill from Reps. Mike Kelly (R-Penn.), William Lacy Clay, Jr. (D-Mo.) and Ted Budd (R-N.C.) that could pay for at least part of the infrastructure package without raising taxes. The proposal would direct the Agriculture Department to sell its distressed assets and then direct the proceeds toward infrastructure projects. Anti-tax advocates have pitched the bill directly to White House officials in recent days, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Trump has always been interested in an infrastructure package, viewing it as an extension of his career as a real estate developer and a concrete way of building a legacy as president.

Even as far back as May 2015 — a month before launching his campaign — Trump tweeted: “The only one to fix the infrastructure of our country is me - roads, airports, bridges. I know how to build, pols only know how to talk!”"
"Amid cooperation bid, Flynn messaged top Mueller critic in Congress",https://www.politico.com,['Kyle Cheney'],05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/17/flynn-mueller-critic-congress-cooperation-1331715,"Former national security adviser Michael Flynn urged vocal Mueller critic Rep. Matt Gaetz to ""keep the pressure on"" after entering a cooperation agreement with Mueller. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo legal Amid cooperation bid, Flynn messaged top Mueller critic in Congress

Just months into a cooperation agreement with special counsel Robert Mueller, former national security adviser Michael Flynn sent an unsolicited text message to one of President Donald Trump's top allies in Congress, urging him to ""keep the pressure on.""

""You stay on top of what you're doing. Your leadership is so vital for our country now,"" Flynn wrote to Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), one of Congress' most vocal critics of the Mueller investigation. ""Keep the pressure on.""

Story Continued Below

POLITICO confirmed the details of the exchange, first reported by CNN, which came in April 2018, just five months into Flynn's cooperation agreement with Mueller. Flynn began assisting Mueller's probe after a Dec. 1, 2017 guilty plea on charges that he made false statements to the FBI about contacts with Russia's ambassador.

Flynn sent Gaetz a separate set of messages on Feb. 14, 2019, the day Attorney General William Barr was confirmed: images of a bald eagle and an American flag. Gaetz confirmed the substance of the messages and said he didn't reply. He also emphasized he had no past relationship with Flynn or his son, Michael Flynn Jr.

It's unclear if Mueller was aware of Flynn's outreach to lawmakers, particularly to one of the special counsel's top antagonists on Capitol Hill. It's also unclear if Flynn sent messages to other lawmakers. Flynn's attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The special counsel's office declined to comment.

Flynn is still ostensibly cooperating with prosecutors, and his testimony is expected in the July trial of a former business partner charged as part of a scheme to lobby on behalf of Turkish officials seeking to take custody of a cleric who has been living in the United States.

A newly unsealed court filing Mueller submitted to a federal judge in December revealed that prosecutors believe at least one person ""connected to"" Congress made communications to Flynn or his attorneys that seemed geared toward limiting his cooperation with Mueller. The comments ""could’ve affected both his willingness to cooperate and the completeness of that cooperation,"" the special counsel wrote.

There's no indication that Flynn's outreach to Gaetz — which went unreciprocated — had anything to do with Mueller's assertion.

Gaetz was an early and frequent critic of Mueller's probe, and a regular guest on Fox News delivering broadsides against the investigation. He has also voiced his concerns with Mueller's probe directly to Trump and embraced some of the most hot-blooded criticisms of Mueller.

Flynn faces a status update and possible sentencing in his case next month. He was due to be sentenced in December — with Mueller's team endorsing a lenient sentence in the matter, praising his cooperation — but Flynn sought to postpone the decision after the judge, Emmett Sullivan, hinted he might recommend jail time.

""Arguably, you sold your country out,"" Sullivan said to Flynn at the time."

US ATTORNEY JOHN DURHAM HAS BEEN REVIEWING ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE 'FOR WEEKS:' SOURCE

On Monday, multiple outlets reported that Barr had appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine the origins of the Russia investigation

A person familiar with the process told Fox News Tuesday that Durham has been working on his review “for weeks,” to probe ""all intelligence collection activities"" related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Russia investigation and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report continue to be debated by Republicans and Democrats since its release last month.

In an interview that aired on Fox News Thursday, Barr explained that he is trying to get to the bottom of whether or not “government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale” during the early stages of the Russia probe.

McDowell also said Americans deserve to know the truth.

""[According to a Fox News poll released Thursday] a majority, 58 percent think it's at least somewhat likely the FBI broke the law when it started investigating the Trump campaign,"" McDowell said.

""They deserve answers. There is nothing wrong with a thorough look at it.""

Mr. Mnuchin was widely expected to ignore the subpoena, as Mr. Trump has vowed to fight all subpoenas from House Democrats. The Treasury secretary has warned that allowing House Democrats to retrieve the president’s tax returns would open the door to lawmakers from both parties politicizing the Internal Revenue Service in the future.

At a Senate hearing this week, Mr. Mnuchin said that House Democrats were trying to “weaponize” the I.R.S. He said that he had not yet decided how he would respond to the subpoena, but that “you can guess which way we are leaning.” He said that the judiciary, as the third branch of government, would most likely need to settle the dispute between Congress and the executive branch, signaling the potential for a protracted court fight.

House Democrats have been weighing how to respond to the Trump administration’s defiance of congressional subpoenas. On Friday, Mr. Neal made clear his preference for avoiding retaliatory threats, to the disappointment of several of his more liberal colleagues.

Mr. Neal told reporters that he saw little value in trying to hold Mr. Mnuchin or Charles P. Rettig, the I.R.S. commissioner, in contempt of Congress. Instead, he said, he would go straight to the courts to try to enforce his subpoena, potentially as soon as next week. The case could take months or years to resolve."
DHS Urges Cybersecurity Staff to ‘Deploy’ to Border Instead,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy-Woodruff Sam-Brodey', 'Betsy Woodruff', 'Sam Brodey']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-homeland-security-urges-cybersecurity-staff-to-deploy-to-border-instead,"The Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency—which also works to protect schools and places of worship—is urging staffers tasked with handling cyber threats to set their day jobs aside and go on mini-deployments to the U.S.-Mexico border after an earlier request from headquarters failed to recruit enough officials, according to an email obtained by The Daily Beast.

The effort to send more employees to the border comes amid concerns that the agency’s focus on the influx of migrants at the border is siphoning off DHS officials who should be handling other threats—especially to elections. DHS’s other components, including its intelligence arm, have also been asked to send volunteers to the border. It is unclear if those components have found enough volunteers to satisfy headquarters.

On Friday, the deputy director of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sent out an email asking employees to consider a “short-term deployment to the southern border,” ranging from 30 to 45 days, due to the “ongoing surge of migrants.”

“It is never easy to ask colleagues to take on extra challenges, but as DHS employees, serving the needs of the homeland is the cornerstone of what we do,” wrote Matthew Travis, CISA deputy director, to agency employees.

“If it is in your capacity to deploy, please give serious thought to volunteering,” he added.

Earlier this spring, top officials asked employees from all DHS entities to go volunteer at the border, according to a DHS official. The email went out because CISA is still working to send as many people as DHS headquarters has asked for, the official added. In other words, not enough CISA employees want to step away from their cybersecurity work to focus on border security—at least, not yet.

“As we have consistently said, the Department is considering all options to address the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border,” said Tyler Houlton, DHS acting assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement.

“We will continue to work with our workforce to find dynamic solutions and funding to address this very serious problem. As part of this effort, it is our responsibility to explore fiscal mechanisms that will ensure the safety and welfare of both our workforce and the migrant population, which is also reflected in the supplemental request submitted to Congress.”

Among the officials who were asked on Friday to assist the federal government at the border are those tasked with protecting the U.S. government’s cyber infrastructure — including election systems considered vulnerable in the run-up to 2020.

DHS also said the deployments will not hamper the department’s other work.

“DHS is fully capable of deploying more resources to address the crisis at our southern border while simultaneously maintaining our operational capabilities throughout the Department in order to carry out our mission to protect the American people,” said Houlton.

DHS has been urging its personnel who do not work for Customs and Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement to volunteer at the border because they say those agencies need additional assistance due to the flow of migrants from the south. Roughly 400 employees of the Transportation Security Administration, for example, are expected to arrive at the border soon.

But DHS has not offered many details on what specific responsibilities these employees will handle. With many migrants traveling in large groups and often with young children, agents are spending much of their time attending to children, DHS officials have said.

The Border Patrol chief, Carla Provost, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 8 that some agents are serving primarily as “child care professionals, medical caregivers, bus drivers and food service workers.”

Apprehensions of migrants at the southern border have reached a 13-year high. In the last two months, Border Patrol apprehended over 200,000 migrants; the total for April—109,000—is the highest number for a single month since 2007.

Trump administration officials are saying they do not have enough resources to handle the influx, and have requested an additional $4.5 billion for their operations from Congress. Democrats on Capitol Hill have signaled a willingness to fund humanitarian assistance at the border, but have scuttled other uses of funding, like increasing beds in ICE detention facilities."

Comey, a vocal critic of the Trump administration since Trump fired him from the FBI in 2017, appeared to hit Barr over his probes into the Justice Department’s handling of an investigation into whether any Trump associates aided Russia’s efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential race.

Barr this week assigned a federal prosecutor in Connecticut to examine the origins of the inquiry and if any political bias influenced any investigative decisions.

The attorney general in April also formed a team to review the actions of the Justice Department and FBI leading up to the Russia investigation. Barr told Congress around that time that he was ""reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016.""

Barr raised eyebrows last month when he said he believes the FBI spied on the Trump campaign during its probe.

“I think spying did occur,” he said during a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. “But the question is whether it was adequately predicated and I’m not suggesting it wasn’t adequately predicated, but I need to explore that.”

Barr later tried to clarify his testimony, saying he was looking into whether “improper surveillance” occurred in 2016.

""I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I'm saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it. That's all,"" he said."
Nellie Ohr deleted emails sent from husband's DOJ account,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nellie-ohr-deleted-emails-sent-from-husbands-doj-account,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, told her husband she was deleting emails sent from his government account.

The revelation comes as both Ohrs remain under intense scrutiny for their ties to Fusion GPS and British ex-spy Christopher Steele, the author of the anti-Trump dossier that was used to obtain warrants to wiretap a member of President Trump's 2016 campaign.

Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained a series of April 2016 emails from a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Justice Department that show a correspondence between the Ohrs, an aide to Bruce Ohr named Lisa Holtyn, and Stefan Bress, a first secretary at the German Embassy.

They discussed setting up a dinner for the German delegation as well as a meeting to discuss Russian organized crime. Included in a proposed agenda is the “Impact of Russian influence operations in Europe (‘PsyOps/InfoWar’).”

On April 20, responding to the email thread with the subject line, “Analyst Russian Organized Crime – April 2016,"" came the email from Nellie Ohr about deleting the emails. ""Thanks! I’m deleting these emails now,"" she said.

Bruce Ohr was an associate deputy attorney general and director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force while his wife Nellie was an independent contractor and Russia specialist.

Emails previously released by Judicial Watch show Bruce Ohr acting as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Nellie Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS.

Both Ohrs testified last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election. This month, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a criminal referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Nellie Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" to lawmakers.

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said that Nellie Ohr informing her husband about deleting the emails indicates a pattern of covering up a plot against Trump. “This email is disturbing and suggests documents relevant to the improper targeting of President Trump were destroyed,” Fitton said in a statement."

Mnuchin says he won’t comply with subpoena for Trump’s tax returns,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mnuchin-says-he-wont-comply-with-subpoena-for-trumps-tax-returns,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday said he will not comply with a House Democratic subpoena for six years of President Trump’s personal and business tax returns.

In a letter to Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Mnuchin said the request “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose,” saying his department will not “disclose the requested returns and return information.”

HOUSE DEMOCRAT SUBPOENAS MNUCHIN, IRS FOR TRUMP’S TAX RETURNS

Mnuchin said he consulted with the Department of Justice in making the decision. He had been given a Friday deadline by Neal to comply.

Neal issued subpoenas last week to Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig for the tax returns.

“While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material,” Neal said in a statement at the time. “I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work.”

The topic has been a contentious one for the president since his time on the campaign trail in 2015, and throughout his administration, as he has refused to release his financial information. Trump repeatedly has claimed that his tax returns are complicated, and he has maintained that he will not release them while they are under audit by the IRS.

Last week, The New York Times obtained Trump’s federal income tax returns between 1985 and 1994. The documents revealed that Trump claimed to have lost $1.17 billion from his real estate businesses during that decade. The Times added that it had compared Trump’s tax information with other high-income earners and found that Trump “appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer. The newspaper also reported that the losses were so substantial, that in the eight of the 10 years in question, Trump was able to avoid paying income tax.

House Democrats have been targeting Trump’s tax returns and financial documents since they took the majority in Congress in January. As part of their lead-off ethics package, which Trump’s lawyers cited in their filing Wednesday, Democrats’ legislation required presidents to disclose at least 10 years of their tax returns to the public, in what was an apparent swipe at Trump.

"Bill Barr reveals Russia probe review to focus on Trump dossier briefing, leaking",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-russia-probe-trump-dossier,"Attorney General Bill Barr, in an exclusive interview with Fox News, revealed that the recently announced review of the origins of the Russia probe will focus in part on a controversial briefing that intelligence officials gave President Trump shortly before he took office in 2017.

Barr told Fox News’ Bill Hemmer in the interview aired Friday that one portion of the review -- which he has tapped U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead -- would cover the time period between Election Day and Inauguration Day, saying “some very strange developments” took place during that time.

TRUMP CALLS 2016 CAMPAIGN SPYING 'TREASON,' WARNS OF 'LONG JAIL SENTENCES'

Barr specifically was referring to the early January 2017 briefing intelligence officials gave then-president-elect Trump at Trump Tower, and “the leaking of information subsequent to that meeting.” At that meeting, Trump was briefed by intelligence and law enforcement officials on Russian election meddling -- and was also informed by former FBI Director James Comey about the now-infamous anti-Trump dossier which included salacious allegations against him. Details later leaked to the press.

“That’s one of the things … we need to look at,” Barr said of the briefing.

Earlier this week, former FBI general counsel James Baker said he and other officials were ""quite worried"" that it could look like Comey was trying to blackmail Trump when he first told him about the allegations in the dossier. Baker, on an episode of Yahoo News podcast ""Skullduggery,"" said that ""analogies"" were made to J. Edgar Hoover--the former FBI director who famously abused his power to blackmail individuals.

""We were quite worried about the Hoover analogies, and we were determined not to have such a disaster happen on our watch,” Baker said, hoping to convey to the incoming president that they did not want to continue the ""legacy"" of Hoover's blackmailing.

Baker did not recall the moment he first heard about the Steele dossier but remembered the bureau taking it ""seriously"" and said they were ""obligated to deal with it"" and determine whether anything about it was true, but insisted they didn't accept it ""as gospel."" He did, however, believe Trump had to be briefed on the dossier because it was ""about to be disclosed to the press.""

As for the dossier itself, Barr said he is “not sure what role it played,” but it is part of the review.

“It’s a very unusual situation to have opposition research like that, especially one that, on its face, had a number of clear mistakes and in a somewhat jejune analysis,” Barr said. “And to, and to use that, take it to conduct counterintelligence against an American political campaign is a strange—would be a strange development.”

With Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report now complete, the attorney general has opened a new phase by pursuing a formal review into the conduct of the original investigation. Earlier this week, it was revealed that Barr had appointed Durham, the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, to lead that investigation -- to cover “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election and any misconduct during the early stages of the FBI’s original Russia probe.

He is expected to focus on the period before Nov. 7, 2016—including the use of FBI informants as well as alleged improper issuance of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants.

BILL BARR VOWS TO UNCOVER 'EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED' WITH RUSSIA PROBE

A source also told Fox News that Barr is working “collaboratively” on Durham’s investigation with FBI Director Chris Wray, CIA Director Gina Haspel, and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. Durham is also working with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is currently reviewing allegations of FISA abuses and the role of FBI informants during the early stages of the Russia investigation.

“The first step is to find out exactly what happened, and we're trying to get our arms around that, getting all the relevant information from the various agencies and starting to talk to some of the people that have information,” Barr told Hemmer.

While the decision to look back at the origins of the investigation has prompted harsh criticism from Democrats who previously have accused him of acting as the president's lawyer, Barr argued there's much yet to learn.

“I think there's a misconception out there that we know a lot about what happened,” he said.

“The fact of the matter is Bob Mueller did not look at the government's activities. He was looking at whether or not the Trump campaign had conspired with the Russians. But he was not going back and looking at the counterintelligence program. And we have a number of investigations underway that touch upon it -- the main one being the office of inspector general that's looking at the FISA warrants.”

CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/723568597/cfpb-chief-says-education-department-is-blocking-student-loan-oversight,"CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Trump administration's Education Department is getting in the way of efforts to police the student loan industry. The revelation, in a letter obtained by NPR, comes at the same time that lawsuits allege that widespread wrongdoing by student loan companies is costing some borrowers thousands of dollars.

CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger explained the problem in an April letter responding to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers about whether the federal regulator had ""abandoned its supervision and enforcement activities"" related to more than $1 trillion in student loans.

A central issue is that companies that manage student loans, known as student loan servicers, are refusing to share information that the CFPB says it needs to perform proper oversight.

""Since December 2017,"" Kraninger wrote in the letter, ""student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations"" related to federal student loans.

She said servicers are not sharing the information because the Department of Education has issued guidance telling them not to do so, citing ""privacy"" concerns. Kraninger also said that information from student loan servicers is ""necessary for supervisory examinations.""

The letter is a carefully worded response to senators' questions. But Kraninger, a Trump administration appointee, is in essence saying that the CFPB is trying to do its job protecting student borrowers and supervising loan servicing companies, but the Education Department is getting in the way.

""It's actually quite remarkable,"" says Seth Frotman, executive director of the nonprofit Student Borrower Protection Center. ""The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is telling the world that the secretary of education has put in place a series of policies that are obstructing federal law enforcement officials from standing up for the millions of Americans with student debt.""

Frotman used to be the CFPB's student loan ombudsman but quit last summer over frustrations with the Trump administration. In a scathing resignation letter last August, he said the Trump administration was ""turning its back on student borrowers"" and preventing him from doing his job.

Now Kraninger, the administration's hand-picked director for the bureau, is pointing the finger, albeit in a less dramatic way, at the Education Department for hindering efforts to protect student borrowers.

In response to Kraninger's letter, Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, and three other Democratic senators called the revelations ""disturbing"" in a round of letters they fired off this week to loan servicing companies.

The lawmakers say in their letters that since Kraninger says the CFPB has attempted to get documents it needs for supervision and been rebuffed by the servicers, that ""reveals that the Department under Secretary DeVos, has removed the most potent weapon from the CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers, and that federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' requests for information.""

The senators' letters add that no ""guidance"" from the Department of Education ""can absolve servicers of their legal responsibility to comply with state and federal consumer protection law.""

Student borrowers getting hurt

When Jessica Saint-Paul heard about a program called Public Service Loan Forgiveness, she was ecstatic. For borrowers who work in qualifying public service jobs — such as police officers, government workers, people who work at nonprofit organizations — the program promises that if they make loan payments for 10 years, the remainder of their student debt will be forgiven. Saint-Paul had about $80,000 in student loans and she wasn't making much money working for a nonprofit that provides services to foster children.

""I was just like, 'Oh, this is perfect,' "" Saint-Paul says. So she called the company that was servicing her student loans and says she was told she was all set — after 10 years, she should be eligible to get her loans forgiven. That was nine years ago.

Saint-Paul said she called back over the years, including once when she changed nonprofit jobs in 2014, to say, ""just making sure I'm on track."" She says she was told, "" 'OK, no problem.' The conversation was quick; they were so kind.""

The call center workers might have been friendly, but Saint-Paul says she was getting bad information. She says she found that out just last year at a conference she attended. There was an information session on loan forgiveness, and she was told she was in the wrong kind of loan and wrong payment plan so she couldn't qualify. She says many other people were finding out the same thing alongside her at the conference.

""It was like a support group almost it turned into because people were like, 'No, that can't be true,' "" Saint-Paul says. ""I went on my phone, people were on their laptops checking what kind of loan they were in. We were all sitting there just frantic.""

Saint-Paul says that if nine years ago her loan servicer had just told her to convert to the right loan and payment plan, everything would have been OK. Instead, she says she feels as though someone stole tens of thousands of dollars from her.

""I just cannot believe this happened to me,"" she says. ""That's like criminal, it's not right.""

Many people agree that it's not right — regulators and advocacy groups are filing a growing number of lawsuits against loan servicing companies alleging mishandling of the loan forgiveness program. Saint-Paul is a plaintiff in one of them.

Many of the consumer complaints and lawsuits involve allegations that servicing companies gave borrowers bad information or advice that resulted in them thinking they were getting credit toward loan forgiveness, when in fact they were in the wrong loan or payment plan.

The Education Department revealed late last year that about 99% of borrowers who thought they had reached that 10-year milestone and applied for forgiveness were rejected. More than 1 million people are actively pursuing loan forgiveness under the program and hoping to qualify.

That's why Democratic lawmakers say they want to make sure that perhaps the most powerful watchdog — the CFPB — is on top of all this.

Fears that the watchdog has been asleep

Since 2011, the CFPB has monitored loan servicers, lenders and complaints from student borrowers and brought enforcement actions when it discovered wrongdoing. For example, the CFPB in 2015 returned $480 million to allegedly defrauded students of Corinthian Colleges.

In 2017, the CFPB brought a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest student loan servicers, Navient. The bureau said Navient ""created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information, processing payments incorrectly, and failing to act when borrowers complained. Through shortcuts and deception, the company also illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans."" That lawsuit is ongoing.

Navient disputes the allegations in the CFPB lawsuit and other suits brought by state regulators. ""The allegations made in the claims are unfounded, and we are vigorously defending our record in court,"" a Navient spokesman says.

But since Richard Cordray, the bureau's Obama-era director, stepped down in November 2017, consumer advocates have been worried that the Trump-appointed interim director, Mick Mulvaney, and now the permanent director, Kraninger, have backed away from protecting student borrowers.

But in her letter, Kraninger said the consumer protection bureau takes that job seriously.

""As with all industries subject to the Bureau's supervisory or enforcement authority, the Bureau will continue to monitor those subject to its authority — in this case, student lenders and student loan servicers — to ensure they are complying with the law,"" she wrote.

At the same time, Kraninger also explained that the Education Department has created obstacles that are getting in the way of the CFPB doing its job. In addition to the guidance to student loan servicers that is impeding oversight efforts, back in 2017, the Trump administration's Education Department ended information sharing agreements that it had with the CFPB. In her letter, Kraninger said an information-sharing agreement (called a Memorandum of Understanding) is required under law and it is ""a priority"" for the bureau to get a new one in place.

Some advocates say the CFPB should do more than acknowledge such problems in a letter to lawmakers. Frotman, of the Student Borrower Protection Center, says the bureau has broad powers to compel student loan servicing companies to turn over the information it needs about student loans and student borrowers.

""I think just identifying this fact is of little solace to student loan borrowers who desperately need the help of a consumer financial watchdog that is supposed to be independent,"" Frotman says. He says he'd like to see Kraninger more directly demand that the Education Department change its guidance to loan servicers and tell them to cooperate with regulators. The CFPB could also take loan servicers to court to get the information it needs., Frotman says.

In a statement to NPR, the CFPB said: ""The Bureau continues to supervise the student loan market, as well as taking action against those who fail to comply with the law."" And the bureau says it is confident it can resolve the issues to achieve its mission of protecting borrowers.

But for its part the Education Department appears to be defending its stance — that loan servicers not hand over information to the CFPB. The department says in a statement that it takes privacy seriously along with the need to ""protect customers' personal data."" It says requests for information about student loan borrowers should be made to the department.

State regulators also say Education Department impeding oversight

Last month, 21 state attorneys general sent Education Secretary Betsy DeVos a letter calling on her to ""reverse the limitations"" the department has placed on student loan servicing companies sharing information with state law enforcement agencies.

The attorneys general said ""student loan information is vital to our efforts to protect consumers from illegal, unfair, abusive, or deceptive practices by actors in the higher education industry, in which the Department historically has been an important partner. However, the Department's policy reversal impedes states' ability to enforce the law and shields unprincipled industry actors from regulatory enforcement, harming student loan borrowers nationwide.""

The industry group the Student Loan Servicing Alliance told NPR in a statement, ""As contractors of the Department of Education which owns its federal student loan data, federal servicers must follow federal law and ED guidance on disclosure and data sharing.""

Why not just share the information?

It's not clear why the department is blocking state and federal regulators from getting information from servicers to do oversight presumably aimed at protecting the rights of student borrowers.

Jason Delisle, a fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, says there may be a turf war going on here. Even if a particular student loan program has problems, Delisle says the department may feel, ""this is our program and we're designing it the way we want to design it and we're running it the way we want to run it."" And Delisle says if there are problems the department may feel it can sort them out by itself.

Frotman says that's not the issue. He says the Education Department may not like having regulators looking into alleged wrongdoing within the companies managing its loan programs, but ""this isn't about reasonable disagreements, it is about following the law versus obstructing law enforcement."""
Barr: DOJ reviewing FBI's 'very unusual' use of dossier that had 'clear mistakes',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-doj-reviewing-fbis-very-unusual-use-of-dossier-that-had-clear-mistakes,"Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department is reviewing the “very unusual” role that the so-called Steele dossier played in the Trump-Russia investigation.

In a Fox News interview that aired Friday, Barr said there were ""clear mistakes"" in the anti-Trump research. The government’s use of the dossier, whose unverified allegations were used to justify surveillance of a former Trump campaign associate, is “one of the questions that we’re going to have to look at” as part of his broader probe into the actions taken by the DOJ and FBI.

The dossier was authored by British ex-spy Christopher Steele and was packed with unverified claims about President Trump's ties to Russia. It formed a key part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications used to justify surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Steele was working for Fusion GPS which was receiving funding through the Perkins Coie law firm from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee — facts that were not communicated to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Barr said that “it’s a very unusual situation to have opposition research like that — especially one that on its face had a number of clear mistakes and a somewhat jejune analysis.” Barr’s pointed critiques of the Steele dossier’s flaws comes after former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI General Counsel James Baker defended their handling of the dossier in recent days.

Comey said “the most important part” of the dossier was related to “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.” Baker said the FBI treated the dossier “seriously … but not literally.”

Although Barr did not discuss the specific mistakes he was referring to in the dossier, it is likely that he was referring to newly released notes from an Oct. 11, 2016, meeting between Steele and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec, which cast doubt on the reliability of Steele’s dossier and called into question the information provided to the court in the FISA application that was submitted later that month. The notes, which Kavalec is believed to have emailed to the FBI in mid-October, indicate that Steele knew he had been hired by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and had been told they wanted his findings made public prior to the 2016 election on Nov. 8.

The notes also show that Kavalec believed at least some of Steele’s allegations to be false. She said Steele alleged that, as part of Russia’s 2016 election interference efforts, there was a “significant Russian network in the U.S. run by the Russian Embassy that draws on emigres to do hacking and recruiting” and “payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.” But Kavalec pointed out “it is important to note that there is no Russian Consulate in Miami.”

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in May that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele. The report said the inspector general’s office “has been asking why the FBI continued to cite Steele as a credible source in the renewal applications.”

The New York Times reported in April that the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].""

Horowitz further stated that he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source [Christopher Steele]. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.”

Barr has said Horowitz’s investigation should be completed in either May or June."
"Halt: In first, Trump’s ambassador to Germany requests $0 more in budget, cuts spending",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/halt-in-first-trumps-ambassador-to-germany-requests-0-more-in-budget-cuts-spending,"Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany and an ardent supporter of President Trump’s agenda, has broken the long practice of embassies seeking — and getting — more funding every year. In what was described as a first, he asked for zero extra in his budget request.

What’s more, in a demonstration of his pledge to be frugal with tax dollars, he ended his last budget year with a $7.7 million surplus.

In becoming the first American ambassador to seek no future year budget increase and to cut costs, he has won praise in Washington, especially from famed penny-pincher Sen. Rand Paul.

“It is a big step in the right direction,” said the Kentucky Republican.

One year with Ambassador Grenell. From #Kiel in the north to #Tegernsee in the far south, #Leipzig in the east to #Düsseldorf in the west, it’s been a year filled with great experiences. Looking forward to Year 2. pic.twitter.com/KSHcV33tiQ — US-Botschaft Berlin (@usbotschaft) May 8, 2019

“I would give compliments were compliments were due. Anybody that is working in government that says they can hold the line on their budget deserves to be complimented,” he added.

In a call from Berlin, Grenell explained that he believes his mission can do its job without any more money or staff. As a result, he sought nothing in his future year requests.

He said that such a move is unheard of in diplomatic circles.

“First of all I have to give credit by saying President Trump and Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo expect us to be frugal and efficient with the American taxpayer dollars,” he said.

Here’s a tweet from 2015 that is barely mentioned.

“We have to be smart because we also have a job to do and we want to make sure that the job gets done with the responsibilities that we’ve been given. So we’re not going to be reckless,” added the ambassador who oversees a budget of $132 million.

Grenell is one of the administration’s favorites and is the most prominent gay appointed by Trump. He is also very active on social media, recently defending Vice President Mike Pence against surprise attacks by Democratic presidential candidate, South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

Paul said that he hopes other embassies look at and follow Grenell’s move.

“I think it could be a model for all the embassies around the world. Everybody’s always saying, ‘Oh, we don’t have enough money for this or that.’ But it really is like everything else in government, everybody wants more, more, more every year. And really people ought to have to justify why you have more...particularly when we are about a $1 trillion short in our budget,” said Paul."
Homeland Security flying migrants out of Texas to locations throughout U.S.,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Nikki Battiste'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/homeland-security-flying-migrants-out-of-texas-to-locations-throughout-u-s-florida-san-diego/,"With the surge of asylum seekers, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol are now flying migrants from the Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas to cities across the country.

In San Diego on Friday, 100 migrants arrived for processing. It came one day after two south Florida counties were upset with a plan that would bring thousands of migrants there.

""We cannot accommodate in Florida just dumping unlawful migrants into our state,"" said Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""I think it'll tax our resources, the schools, healthcare, law enforcement, state agencies.""

CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and the White House, but neither has responded.

Florida officials have been told to expect two plane loads of migrants each week, up to 1,000 people a month, split between Palm Beach and Broward counties. Both are Democratic strongholds. The migrants do not face criminal charges but would likely be released into the community awaiting immigration hearings.

CBS News reporting found that 80% of the beds at the nation's largest detention center for immigrant families in Dilley, Texas were empty last month. But Brian Hastings, chief of law enforcement operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they're overwhelmed.

""The crisis at hand is causing us to look at multiple different locations where we have capacity to process, to fly these individuals to, simply so we can process them into the system,"" Hastings said.

Florida has no designated shelters or government funding for food and security. Officials there have been told to expect migrants in about two weeks."
Marine vet congressman to the VA: 'It’s time' to decriminalize medical marijuana for veterans,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/marine-vet-congressman-to-the-va-its-time-to-decriminalize-medical-marijuana-for-veterans,"In an opinion piece with the Washington Examiner, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., voiced his opposition to the Department of Veterans Affairs' resistance to allow veterans to use medical cannabis.

Moulton, a Marine Corps infantry veteran, said fellow veterans use cannabis in order to not get addicted to opioids, which the widespread use of has led to overdoses across the country.

""We talk to each other because none of my friends can talk about cannabis with their doctors at the VA. Despite the fact that cannabis is either legal or decriminalized in more than half the states in the country, they might lose their VA benefits if they do,"" Moulton said.

""Veterans seeking cannabis aren’t druggies. Many are American heroes who deserve a VA that researches cannabis and protects veterans from opioids using any method that’s safe. Federal drug laws currently prevent researchers from figuring that out,"" he said. ""It’s time for change.""

Moulton pointed to the three bills he introduced with Rep.

"EPA Watchdog Finds Ex-Chief Scott Pruitt Spent $124,000 On 'Excessive' Airfare",https://www.npr.org,['Nathan Rott'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/724018737/epa-watchdog-finds-ex-chief-scott-pruitt-spent-124-000-on-excessive-airfare,"EPA Watchdog Finds Ex-Chief Scott Pruitt Spent $124,000 On 'Excessive' Airfare

Scott Pruitt, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and his staff spent roughly $124,000 in excessive travel costs during a ten-month period, according to a new report from EPA's internal watchdog.

Pruitt, who resigned from EPA almost a year ago amidst a litany of ethics allegations, and his personal security detail flew in first or business class ""without sufficient justification and, initially without appropriate approval authority,"" the report says.

The EPA's Office of the Inspector General recommended that the agency consider recovering the estimated $123,942 in excessive costs.

In a statement, the EPA says it believes that it complied with federal travel regulations, ""making cost recovery inappropriate.""

The audit reviewed 40 trips, including six canceled ones, that Pruitt planned or took in 2017. Nearly half of those trips stopped in, or were to, Tulsa, Okla., where Pruitt maintained a personal residence while he was the nation's top environmental steward. The report found ""missing detailed support"" for some of those trips.

The travel during that ten-month period cost taxpayers almost $1 million.

Pruitt's 24-hour security detail ate up most of that money. In a previous audit, EPA's inspector general found that the agency spent twice as much protecting Pruitt as it did his predecessor.

The EPA and Pruitt, who now works as a consultant for coal companies, said those protections were necessary because of personal threats against the former-administrator.

During his 16-month stint as head of the EPA, Pruitt's security costs, travel and other actions drew criticism from his predecessors, Democrats, environmental groups and even some Republican lawmakers.

The EPA's inspector general says the office received numerous congressional requests and hotline complaints about Pruitt's travel. The new report came as a result of those.

In addition to first-class travel, the audit found that lodging expenses exceeded per diem limits during some of Pruitt's travel as well. There was also inaccurate or incomplete reports for international travel.

Pruitt is not the first member of the Trump administration to be questioned about his travel on the taxpayer dime.

Tom Price, the former head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, broke federal rules on using chartered and military planes for government travel. Price resigned amidst controversy over that, as President Trump complained that he ""didn't like the optics"" of using taxpayer-funded charter flights.

A report by the Interior Department's inspector general found that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke violated the agency's travel policy by having his wife travel with him in government vehicles.

The EPA's watchdog says that actions are needed to strengthen controls over travel at the agency to ""prevent fraud, waste and abuse."""

Dem criticizes newest calendars for Trump Interior chief as 'fake',https://thehill.com,[],05-17-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/444325-newest-calendars-for-interior-secretary-criticized-for-being-fake,"The latest calendars released for Interior Secretary David Bernhardt are prompting renewed scrutiny of the department's transparency efforts, with one Democrat calling them ""fake.""

Interior published four months' worth of Bernhardt’s schedules to its website on Thursday, a day after he appeared before the House Natural Resources Committee.

While some entries released by the agency list the names of attendees at meetings, others only describe him as having a scheduled ""external meeting."" ADVERTISEMENT

One House Democrat called the Trump Cabinet member's schedules a ""fake calendar.""

""No real calendar says ‘external call’ or ‘external meeting’ w/ no details -you kinda need to know who you're calling/meeting with!” tweeted Rep. Jared Huffman Jared William HuffmanOvernight Energy: Dems dismiss Interior chief's work calendars as 'fake' | Buttigieg climate plan includes carbon tax | Poll finds growing number say climate is crucial 2020 issue Dem criticizes newest calendars for Trump Interior chief as 'fake' Human rights bill on ANWR ignores humans and their rights MORE (D-Calif.).

Huffman, a member of the Natural Resources Committee, added, “This fake calendar only has details if something is politically useful - e.g. 'meeting w/ youth group.' How dumb does he think we are?”

Interior, when asked to respond to criticism of the entries, sent a letter from March 26 addressed to House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) explaining how the office maintains Bernhardt’s calendar.

Bernhardt’s calendars have been an ongoing source of criticism for the department. House Democrats have raised questions over whether the department’s use of Google Docs to maintain his calendar complies with recordkeeping laws.

Interior has offered conflicting information about how Bernhardt’s schedule is maintained, but in April acknowledged that some meetings with industry representatives were intentionally left off his calendar.

Aaron Weiss, deputy director at The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, argued that “it’s not an accident that they waited until the day after his hearing” to share the calendars.

“They’re playing a shell game with Bernhardt’s calendar to still have to avoid saying publicly what he’s working on and who he’s meeting with,” he said.

Getty Images The US Border Patrol has begun fingerprinting some migrant children 14 and younger because of increased concern about fraud and the trafficking of children, a senior agency official said.

A possible government plan to send migrants who are in federal custody to South Florida sparked concern from local officials this week, and one mayor offered a proposal of his own.

""Bring them to the Trump hotels and ask the President to open his heart and home as well,"" Broward County Mayor Mark Bogen said.

Bogen said in a statement that he and other local officials learned this week from US Customs and Border Protection of a plan to release hundreds of migrants weekly into the area.

""This is a humanitarian crisis. We will do everything possible to help these people,"" Bogen said. ""If the President will not provide us with financial assistance to house and feed these people, he will be creating a homeless encampment.""

Neighboring Palm Beach County -- home to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort -- also received a similar notification from CBP, officials there said.

The sheriff said the agency had recently informed the county of a plan to transport 135 migrants from El Paso, Texas, to Broward and Palm Beach counties twice a week.

""The President wants to send his problems to Palm Beach County. And that's not fair,"" Palm Beach County Mayor Mack Bernard told CNN on Friday.

CBP: 'We are not flying anyone to Florida'

On Friday, a CBP official said there were no plans to send migrants to Florida ""immediately,"" adding that the agency has been in ""preliminary"" conversations with a number of localities across the country about ""contingency plans"" to move groups of recently apprehended immigrant families.

""We are not flying anyone to Florida. We were in preliminary planning stages across the nation ... for having contingency plans because we are overcapacity and for our safety and the safety of those that we are charged with caring for, we can't keep them in these facilities,"" the CBP official said of intake facilities along the US-Mexico border.

""This is an emergency of 'get them out of our facilities as quickly as we can and as safely as we can.' This is an emergency. The entire system is overwhelmed.""

The official said record number of family units and unaccompanied minors crossing the border has created ""a serious backlog"" at intake facilities and forced immigration authorities to move the migrants to other areas for processing before release.

CBP last week began moving immigrants by bus and plane to other border communities along the US-Mexico border ""to leverage available capacity for processing and holding,"" CBP said.

Since May 10, CBP has been busing families from the Rio Grande Valley to Laredo, Texas, the official said, as well as flying migrants on planes contracted from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to Del Rio, Texas, and San Diego.

Everyone that is being moved by bus or plane is part of a family unit, and has been initially processed for criminal connections, and given a medical assessment to make sure they are medically cleared to fly, according to the official.

The CBP official said authorities were looking at locations across the country where CBP has temporary detention facilities and adequate computer systems to be able to process the immigrants upon arrival. Those locations are primarily along the northern and coastal border, the official said.

The official denied that the contingency plans being laid were targeting sanctuary cities, which would be in line with President Trump's stated intention of sending immigrants to sanctuary cities.

""All we are looking at right now is where we have the capacity and the bandwidth for the computer systems, and the computer systems to be able to do the processing,"" the official said.

Lawmakers trade blame

Several lawmakers who represent Florida in Congress said details were in short supply -- though they traded blame over who was responsible for the situation.

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said he'd sent a list of questions over the matter to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.

Republican Sen. Rick Scott's office said Democrats were to blame for refusing to fix a crisis at the border, adding that Scott is seeking additional information from local sheriffs, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security.

Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch slammed what he said was a ""stunning amount of confusion"" over the administration's immigration policy.

""Our diverse community treats immigrants with dignity and respect; the Administration should do the same,"" he said in a statement. ""That starts with a thoughtful plan rather than a rash decision apparently made by some in the Administration without any consultation with the rest of the government.""

Earlier this month, CBP said more people had been apprehended illegally crossing the US-Mexico border this fiscal year than any year since 2009. The CBP official said on Friday that the agency has apprehended on average of 4,500 people over the past seven days.

And for months, the agency has been sounding alarm bells as it faces more families and children coming across the border -- a shift from previous years when single adult males made up a large number of border apprehensions. Facilities are over capacity, officials say, and they've asked the military for more help dealing with the influx.

Sanctuary cities under fire

Word of the proposed plan to send large groups of migrants to South Florida comes weeks after Trump vowed to send migrants to sanctuary cities, local jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal authorities when it comes to immigration enforcement.

The administration initially denied that the plan was under active consideration. After reports surfaced in the press where DHS officials said the plan had been scrapped, the President tweeted saying he was considering it.

""We're sending many many of them to sanctuary cities,"" Trump told a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, last month. ""They ain't too happy about it. I'm proud to tell you that was actually my sick idea.""

There are no sanctuary cities in Florida. And state lawmakers approved a sanctuary city ban earlier this month.

Bernard, a Democrat and Palm Beach County's mayor, told CNN Friday that he hoped reasons for transporting the migrants aren't political.

""We hope that this is not politically motivated,"" he said, ""because of the fact that when we're dealing with issues in Palm Beach County in terms of homelessness, housing, hurricanes, we don't look at political affiliations. We look at addressing the needs of our residents.""

Bernard said he hopes the administration will create a more concrete plan to deal with the situation. And local taxpayers, he said, shouldn't have to pick up the tab.

U.S. Orders Partial Evacuation of Embassy in Baghdad,https://www.nytimes.com,['Edward Wong'],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/politics/us-iraq-embassy-evacuation.html,"Mr. Pompeo made a surprise visit to Baghdad on May 7 to brief Iraqi leaders about the threat.

On May 5, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, issued a statement warning against any attack by the Iranian military or a “proxy” against American interests or allies. Mr. Bolton said the United States was sending the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and bombers to the Persian Gulf. Other officials later said that the strike group’s movement to that area had been previously scheduled and was merely being sped up.

On Friday, the Pentagon said it was sending another ship and a Patriot antimissile battery to the Middle East.

The order for a partial evacuation of the Baghdad embassy, which at the height of the Iraq War was the largest in the American diplomatic system, adds to the rising tensions between the United States and Iran. It is unclear when the employees being evacuated will be told they can return.

In September, Mr. Pompeo ordered a full withdrawal from the American Consulate in Basra, in southern Iraq, after a few rockets landed around the grounds of the city’s airport, where the consulate is. The rockets did not cause any injuries. For more than a year beforehand, State Department officials had debated whether to shut down the consulate to save money, and some diplomats said the evacuation of the consulate was related to that.

The Trump administration blamed Shiite militias tied to Iran for the rocket attacks in Basra. It also said that those types of militias were responsible for rocket attacks around the same time in the area of the Baghdad embassy. As in Basra, the attacks in Baghdad did not injure anyone.

Tensions with Iran have been rising since May 2018, when President Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear deal that world powers reached with Tehran. The United States then reinstated major sanctions last November, and those have weakened the Iranian economy.

In April, the Trump administration designated an arm of Iran's military as a foreign terrorist organization and ended waivers it had granted to eight governments to exempt them from sanctions for buying Iranian oil."
Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents,https://www.npr.org,['Jessica Taylor'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/722230017/another-rule-trump-could-break-primary-challengers-doom-incumbent-presidents,"Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Eisen/Getty Images Scott Eisen/Getty Images

An incumbent president with a middling approval rating and mounting controversies is usually an easy draw for primary challengers.

Look to Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. All three presidents survived intraparty battles, but those primary fights left their reelection campaigns so hobbled — exposing longstanding weaknesses with their bases — that each went on to lose out on four more years in the White House.

But even if a viable GOP challenger to President Trump does emerge, it's unlikely he or she could make much headway or have a lasting impact on the president's chances in November. That's because Trump's firm grasp on the Republican Party could help him emerge not only victorious, but relatively unscathed by a primary challenge.

Political polarization is higher than ever, according to Princeton University professor of history and public affairs Julian Zelizer. And the slice of the electorate that likes Trump isn't budging, no matter what the president may say or do. Meanwhile, those who don't like him are resolute in their disdain, leaving a smaller block of persuadable voters than there were in previous elections.

""Trump has essentially remade the Republican Party in his image,"" said Zelizer. ""So many people aren't going to believe anything that the Mueller report says, and they take whatever Trump says as gospel. That just to me is another stumbling block that you probably didn't have in a post-Watergate era.""

In 1976, President Gerald Ford was already in a debilitated position. The Republican was an incumbent that had never been elected president (or even vice president) and was uniquely challenged in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon's resignation and his own subsequent controversial pardon of Nixon. So it's not surprising former California Gov. Ronald Reagan mounted a near-upset bid against him.

During the primaries, momentum swung back and forth between the two GOP candidates. The first ballot of voting at the 1976 Republican National Convention was razor-thin: 1,187 delegates for Ford and 1,070 for Reagan, just a 117 vote difference. But Ford did narrowly clear the 1,130 delegates needed to secure the nomination. Such a fractious ending would prove prescient months later as he lost to former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, netting 240 electoral votes to the Democrat's 297.

Four years later amid a sagging economy and the hostage crisis in Iran, Carter himself would be hamstrung as he sought a second term. Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose brothers had both sought the presidency, saw an opening. But despite strong numbers at the outset of the primary, Kennedy would peter out as his personal scandals surfaced and Carter simply out-organized him. Their fight would continue through 1980 Democratic convention though, where Kennedy, having finished with just over a third of the primary votes, admitted he couldn't win.

The famous not-really-a-concession speech Kennedy gave at the New York City convention laid out his own idealistic vision rather than trying to boost Carter.

""For me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end,"" the political scion told the crowd. ""For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on. The cause endures. The hope still lives. And the dream shall never die.""

As a result, it was Kennedy who got the raucous applause and seemed like the hero of the 1980 DNC, not the incumbent president who had actually won the nomination. Facing a renewed Reagan in the general election, Carter was walloped, winning just 49 electoral votes to the Republican's 489.

Perhaps it's President George H.W. Bush's re-election battle that best foreshadowed the era of Trump. The former vice president and CIA director saw sky high approval numbers in the aftermath of the Gulf War. But the economy would slow, giving conservative commentator Pat Buchanan a divide he could exploit by waging a bid based on fighting the ""culture wars.""

Buchanan would falter and end up taking less than a quarter of the primary vote away from Bush, and billionaire Ross Perot running as an independent in the general election also deeply harmed the incumbent's chances. But there was an anti-establishment vein within the GOP Buchanan may have helped awaken. It might have taken decades to fully manifest, but many saw Trump as the eventual embodiment of what Buchanan helped to shape.

History doesn't always repeat itself

Trump seems to have a stronghold on his party that no candidate can shake. As Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center put it, Trump has simply proven, time and time again, ""that all previous rules do not apply.""

""When we look back at the lessons of history, they may repeat themselves, but they haven't so far,"" Perry said. ""He may get a challenge by either a strong gadfly or a strong personality or a strong presence in the party,"" just as Ronald Reagan was to Ford in 1976 and Ted Kennedy was to Carter in 1980. ""But I don't see that person on the horizon.""

There are some possible challengers emerging to Trump, but Perry is right that less than nine months before the nominating process begins, no Republican has stood out as a formidable alternative.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld is the only major announced candidate so far after running for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016 along with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. But Weld certainly doesn't seem to have the heft of past White House challengers that could irrevocably damage a sitting president.

Some of the potential heavyweights who are still mulling bids include former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who also sought the GOP nomination last time, and popular centrist Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who's already made some early state moves.

Frequent Trump agitators like former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and former Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker were also floated early on. Flake has since ruled out a 2020 run, but the recently retired Corker still sounds open, saying recently that Trump ""purposely seeks to divide"" the American people and someone should challenge him.

""Philosophically, you could look at it and say that it would be a good thing for our country should that occur,"" Corker said during the TIME 100 Summit last month. ""If you had a real primary, where you had someone that was really being listened to, and of substance, things that we were talking about — and I could go through a list of them — they would actually be debated in a real way.""

There might once have been other names on that list — prominent 2016 doubters like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham or former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Despite their blistering criticism almost four years ago toward the polarizing reality TV show host and businessman, they too have come around and been loyal allies of Trump in the case of Graham, or a onetime part of his administration, with Haley serving as UN ambassador until last year.

The president's poll numbers reflect the waning influence of the once vocal critics may have had within the party — winning over converts, even if he may have polarized more independent voters.

The most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey shows a staggering 90 percent of Republicans approve of the job Trump has done, leaving little room for a challenger to grab a foothold. And for now, there's no GOP option who seems like they could truly compete with Trump, given the unprecedented way he has tried to centralize the Republican National Committee around his re-election bid and ward off a primary challenge.

Tribalism is a force that Corker also lamented, saying at the TIME event that Trump ""has an unusually visceral contact with the Republican base as it's made up today... That's in some ways where the electorate is today, where it has become very tribal in nature."""
China sells most U.S. Treasuries in nearly two-and-a-half years,https://www.reuters.com,"['Richard Leong', 'Min Read']",05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-securities/china-sells-most-us-treasuries-in-nearly-two-and-a-half-years-idUSKCN1SL2U4,"(Reuters) - China sold the most U.S. Treasuries in almost 2-1/2 years in March amid uncertainty about a trade deal between Beijing and Washington, data from the U.S. Treasury Department released on Wednesday showed.

Since last week after a dismal 10-year Treasury auction, there has been renewed speculation whether China may sell its U.S. debt in retaliation for increased tariffs on $200 billion of its exports to the United States.

The latest data on China’s U.S. bond holding were collected before a sudden breakdown in trade talks between the world’s two biggest economic powers 1-1/2 weeks ago and prior to the U.S. duty hike on Chinese goods, which went into effect on Friday.

China sold $20.45 billion in Treasuries in March, the most since October 2016, following $1.08 billion in purchases the month before.

China’s stake in Treasuries fell for the first time in four months to $1.121 trillion in March, which was the lowest since May 2017 when it was $1.102 trillion. It was $1.131 trillion in February, the data showed.

“The decline this month brings China essentially flat to where they were in February, erasing the increases from December through February,” Jefferies LLC’s senior money market economist Tom Simons wrote in a research note.

Despite the drop in Treasuries holdings, the world’s second-largest economy remained the largest U.S. creditor.

On the other hand, Japan raised its Treasuries holdings to $1.078 trillion, the highest since November 2017, from $1.072 trillion in February.

However, another set of Treasury data showed Japan sold $11.07 billion in U.S. government debt in March, the most for U.S.’s No. 2 foreign creditor, since February 2018.

(Graphic: China, Japan's sales of U.S. Treasuries - tmsnrt.rs/2J43Ggv)

Meanwhile, foreigners resumed sales of Treasuries in March as U.S. 10-year yields fell to 15-month lows after the Federal Reserve signaled it would not raise interest rates in 2019, according to the latest Treasury data.

They sold $12.53 billion in U.S. government debt in March after buying $19.91 billion the month before.

“Private investors have been big buyers of Treasuries since the beginning of the second half of 2018, but foreign official institutions have been inconsistent,” Simons said.

Official overseas selling of Treasuries coincided with a dollar rally in March spurred by safe-haven bids for the greenback amid worries about the global economy, trade tension and uncertainty around Brexit.

Central banks of export-oriented countries often sell their Treasury holdings to defend their currencies from a sharp appreciation of the greenback.

Overseas accounts also sold stocks for 11 straight months, reducing their equity stakes by $23.64 billion in March.

On the other hand, they bought $4.74 billion in agency securities and $1.11 billion of corporate bonds.

OUTFLOW PERSISTS

The latest data showed a net outflow from the United States totaling $8.1 billion in March, slower than the revised $21.5 billion in February.

Foreign central banks and other government entities accelerated their reduction of U.S. assets, selling $21.7 billion in March versus a revised $10.1 billion the month before.

The official foreign sales in March were offset by net purchases by private overseas investors which acquired $13.6 billion in U.S. assets after a revised $11.4 billion in sales in February."

Horowitz’s work for the Justice Department, but he did say those who “love the rule of law” will be “very upset.”

“We now have two sources that told the FBI and the DOJ, the upper echelon, not the rank and file, I always make the distinction,” Mr. Hannity said. “I am told in both cases that with the [former British spy Christopher Steele] dossier, that [Department of Justice lawyer Bruce] Ohr warned them it was unverified — Hillary paid for it, Steele hated Trump. Also, now, we have the emails before the first application went in. It sounds like a premeditated conspiracy to commit fraud on a FISA court. I’m also hearing: Horowitz is done and it’s devastating.

“I can’t tell you what he found, but I can tell you that if you care about the rule of law you’re going to be very upset about how the DOJ and the FBI behaved themselves during the 2016 election,” he said. “If you hate Trump, you won’t care. If you love the rule of law, you’ll be very upset.”

Mr. Horowitz announced the investigation into alleged FISA abuse in March 2018.

"Education Department hinders policing of student loans, consumer agency says",https://www.politico.com,['Michael Stratford'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/16/student-loans-education-department-1447485,"Kathy Kraninger, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, made the disclosure in a letter to Democratic senators released on Thursday. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo education Education Department hinders policing of student loans, consumer agency says

The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Education Department is impeding access to information that regulators need to oversee the nation’s largest student loan servicing companies.

Kathy Kraninger, the CFPB director, made the disclosure in a letter to Democratic senators released on Thursday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has accused the bureau of abandoning its responsibility to police companies that collect payments from student loan borrowers.

Story Continued Below

Kraninger said that “student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations” related to federal student loans, based on a December 2017 directive from the Education Department. The department is headed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

The CFPB “has pursued options that would have permitted it to obtain” the information it needs to supervise student loan servicers, Kraninger said in the letter, but she didn’t say whether those options had been successful. The letter was first reported by NPR.

Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, as well as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and other Senate Democrats called Kraninger’s disclosure “disturbing news” in a letter to student loan servicers.

The senators said the Education Department had “removed a key weapon from CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers.” They also expressed concern that “federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' request for information.”

The CFPB has the authority to supervise large student loan servicing companies, regardless of whether they collect private student loans or federal student loans. That has long created tension between the Education Department and the CFPB over student loans.

The Education Department policy cited by Kraninger, first reported by POLITICO last year, orders federal student loan servicers to refuse requests for information from third parties like state attorneys general or the CFPB. The policy says those requests must instead be funneled through Education Department officials in order to comply with federal privacy laws.

The policy has been at the center of ongoing disputes between DeVos and state attorneys general seeking to investigate or take legal action against student loan servicers. DeVos has argued that her agency provides adequate oversight over the companies, rejecting efforts by state regulators to police the industry.

Liz Hill, an Education Department spokesperson, said in a statement that the agency “cooperates fully with federal law enforcement officials on matters related to the federal student aid programs.”

Hill said the policy prohibiting student loan servicers from responding directly to information requests by the CFPB or other regulators is about protecting the privacy of loan borrowers. Such requests for information “should be made to the Department, where they will be evaluated for compliance with the Privacy Act,” she said.

The Education Department has previously refused to say how many of those information requests it receives — and whether or not it has granted them. Senate appropriators last year directed the department to publicly disclose those decisions, but the department has declined to do so.

Court records reviewed by POLITICO last year showed that the Education Department had also turned down requests for student loan records made directly by state attorneys general.

The department last year also refused a request for information by the CFPB for information about Navient in connection with CFPB's massive lawsuit against the student loan servicer.

The CFPB said at the time that the Education Department was refusing to give permission for Navient to turn over a trove of documents relating to how the company collects and manages the payments of federal student loan borrowers.

A federal judge ultimately sided with the CFPB in the dispute. He ruled that Navient “cannot assert that the records may ultimately belong to the Department of Education or use the Privacy Act to shield the requested borrower documents” from the CFPB’s requests.

"China's Huawei, 70 affiliates placed on U.S. trade blacklist",https://www.reuters.com,"['David Shepardson', 'Min Read']",05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huaweitech/chinas-huawei-70-affiliates-placed-on-us-trade-blacklist-idUSKCN1SL2W4,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday it is adding Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and 70 affiliates to its so-called “Entity List” - a move that bans the telecom giant from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.

U.S. officials told Reuters the decision would also make it difficult if not impossible for Huawei, the largest telecommunications equipment producer in the world, to sell some products because of its reliance on U.S. suppliers.

Under the order that will take effect in the coming days, Huawei will need a U.S. government license to buy American technology. Huawei did not immediately comment.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement President Donald Trump backed the decision that will “prevent American technology from being used by foreign owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.”

The dramatic move comes as the Trump administration has aggressively lobbied other countries not to use Huawei equipment in next-generation 5G networks and comes just days after the Trump administration imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods amid an escalating trade war.

The Commerce Department said the move comes after the U.S. Justice Department unsealed an indictment in January of Huawei and some entities that said the company had conspired to provide prohibited financial services to Iran. The department said it has a reasonable basis to conclude that Huawei is “engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest.”

Huawei reported first-quarter revenue of $27 billion last month and said it had shipped 59 million smartphones in the first quarter.

In March 2016, the Commerce Department added ZTE Corp to the entity list over allegations it organized an elaborate scheme to hide its re-export of U.S. items to sanctioned countries in violation of U.S. law.

The restrictions prevented suppliers from providing ZTE with U.S. equipment, potentially freezing the Huawei rival’s supply chain, but they were short-lived. The U.S. suspended the restrictions in a series of temporary reprieves, allowing the company to maintain ties to U.S. suppliers until it agreed to a plea deal a year later.

In August, Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government itself from using equipment from Huawei and ZTE.

Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican, said “Huawei’s supply chain depends on contracts with American companies” and he urged the Commerce Department to look “at how we can effectively disrupt our adversary.”"
Jeffrey Rosen confirmed by Senate as DOJ’s No. 2 official,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Jeff Mordock']",05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/16/jeffrey-rosen-confirmed-senate-dojs-no-2-official/,"Jeffrey Rosen, President Trump’s nominee to take over the Justice Department’s No. 2 position, won Senate approval Thursday.

In a 52 to 45 vote along party lines, Mr. Rosen was confirmed as deputy attorney general, the second highest position at the Justice Department. He will replace Rod Rosenstein, who left the Department last week.

Mr. Rosen, who leaves his position as deputy secretary of Transportation, has not worked at the Justice Department nor as a federal prosecutor. That lack of experience was a point of contention during his confirmation last month before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Several Democrats, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut challenged his inexperience as a prosecutor. Mr. Rosen responded by saying that he would not be the first person without a law enforcement background to serve as the attorney general and pledged to surround himself with veteran prosecutors.

Mr. Rosen joins the Justice Department during a turbulent time. He will likely become embroiled in the department’s battles with Congress to obtain information on the unredacted work of special counsel Robert Mueller.

Although the Justice Department released a lightly redacted version of Mr. Mueller’s 448-page report, Democrats have insisted that is not good enough and demanded his complete findings.

Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee took the first step toward holding Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt after he defied a congressional subpoena to turn over all of Mr. Mueller’s findings along with the supporting evidence.

Additional fallout from the Mueller probe includes several ongoing investigations handled by the Justice Department. Mr. Rosen said during his confirmation hearing that he wouldn’t interfere in those cases.

“If I’m confirmed, I would expect in all criminal investigations and prosecutorial matters that they proceed on the facts and the law,” he said.

Mr. Rosen’s confirmation reunites him with Mr. Barr. The pair worked alongside each other at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Mr. Barr is said to have personally selected his former colleague for the position.

Mr. Rosen has served in a host of government positions during a legal career spanning three decades. He was general counsel for the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Transportation in the Bush administration.

The Energy 202: Trump's Interior chief hasn't 'lost any sleep over' new climate record,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy']",05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/16/the-energy-202-trump-s-interior-chief-hasn-t-lost-any-sleep-over-new-climate-record/5cdc4fd01ad2e5092403d1da/,"THE LIGHTBULB

House Democrats grilled Interior Secretary David Bernhardt about what his department is doing to address the causes and effects of climate change, noting that levels of carbon dioxide just hit their highest in human history.

His response? “I haven’t lost any sleep over it.”

The exchange is the latest escalation between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over what responsibility the Interior Department, which oversees more than 400 million acres of federal lands, bears in blunting a worldwide problem such as global warming. It came amid a barrage of legal citations from Democrats who claimed that current law compels the leader of the department to protect public lands from its impacts.

The remark came as Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) pressed Bernhardt about how concerned, on a scale of 1 to 10, he was about the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere eclipsing 415 parts per million, as recorded by the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.

“Okay, so you're a zero or a one, is that it?” Cartwright said in response.

Later in the hearing, Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) gave Bernhardt the chance to expand on his comment, saying that for climate scientists it is a “hair-on-fire crisis.”

“It’s one of those clips of testimony that will reverberate,” he said. “People will look back to what you said.”

Indeed, after the hearing, environmental groups shared widely on social media videos of Bernhardt's “sleep” comment.

In response, Bernhardt said: “I absolutely care that our climate is changing and that we need to factor that into our thinking. I absolutely believe that. And I've said that over and over and over.”

He noted that among developed nations, the United States is “number one” in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The hearing Wednesday in front of the House Natural Resources Committee, ostensibly to discuss the Trump administration's budget proposal for the department, was Bernhardt's second since being confirmed as interior secretary.

Last week in front of a House Appropriations subcommittee, Bernhardt punted the climate issue to Congress, telling members it was up to them to pass legislation compelling him to reduce emissions from public lands. Between 2005 and 2014, a quarter of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions came from the extracting and burning of fossil fuels from federal lands.

“There's no 'shalls,' "" Bernhardt said, referring to the word in law that indicates a legally binding requirement. “You guys come up with the 'shalls.' ""

In the intervening days, House Democrats had clearly dusted off law books.

During the hearing, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) chided the Trump administration for rolling back an Obama-era rule that sought to limit the amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, released by oil and gas wells on the Bureau of Land Management lands.

And another Democrat, Mike Levin of California, rattled off four laws that, for example, compel the interior secretary to ensure that national parks are “unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations” and to “take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation” to BLM areas.

Bernhardt suggests the language in those laws did not direct him to do anything specific in response to climate change, such as stop leasing land for coal, oil or natural gas extraction.

“What I specifically said is you haven’t given me any direction to stop any particular activity,” he said.

John Leshy, interior solicitor under President Clinton, said that the legal language authorizing the government's land management programs is “necessarily general.”

“I give Bernhardt credit,” Leshy told The Post. “He's a wily guy.”

Leshy said Levin could also have mentioned the Endangered Species Act, which compels the interior secretary to use the “best available” science to determine whether a plant or animal is under threat of extinction.

On the dangers of climate change to biodiversity, he said, “the science is increasingly clear.”

At one point in yesterday's hearing, Democrats got Bernhardt to acknowledge that some laws — including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their actions — compel him to take climate change into account when managing lands.

“Certainly, NEPA would be one to them.”

Correction: The original version of this story referred to California Rep. Mike Levin as Mark Levin.

The Trump administration’s attitude to climate change, and our country's fate, in one sentence from @SecBernhardt: ""I haven't lost any sleep over it.""



They don't care. Thanks to @RepCartwright, we don’t have to guess any more.

— Controversial mining leases renewed: BLM has renewed two federal minerals leases for a proposed copper-nickel mine by Minnesota mining company Twin Metals. The controversial decision follows a years-long clash over opening the state to minerals mining, the Star Tribune reports. The leases were ended by the Obama administration in 2016 over concerns about the environmental risks of mining near a protected wilderness, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.

Trump administration touts economic benefit of new mining: “Mining on public lands balances conservation . . . with the need to produce minerals that add value to the lives of all Americans by providing raw materials used in the manufacture of medical aids, automobiles, smartphones and computers, and household appliances,” said Joe Balash, the interior's assistant secretary for land and minerals management.

“Mining on public lands balances conservation . . . with the need to produce minerals that add value to the lives of all Americans by providing raw materials used in the manufacture of medical aids, automobiles, smartphones and computers, and household appliances,” said Joe Balash, the interior's assistant secretary for land and minerals management. But Minnesota lawmakers are gearing up for a fight: ""Every sulfide-ore mine has failed to contain pollution and has affected the surrounding water quality,"" said Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.). ""Once polluted, this incredible landscape and its wildlife will never been the same.""

— 2020 watch: Two Democratic presidential candidates, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, are out this week with new climate policies.

Warren: In a post on Medium, Warren laid out a plan requiring the Pentagon to reach net-zero carbon emissions for its infrastructure and non-combat bases by 2030. Her plan also calls for creating a “dedicated source of funding to adapt our bases in the United States and around the world."" It also targets contractors hired by the Defense Department, proposing that any contractor that doesn't reach the net-zero emissions mark pay 1 percent of the value of the contract, which would be used to “to invest directly in making our military infrastructure more resilient.”

— A plan to put up border wall through protected lands: The federal government is looking to replace barriers across 100 miles of the southern border with Mexico in California and Arizona, including through the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, the Associated Press reports, citing environmental advocates and government documents.

The refuge specifically is meant to provide a designated home for 275 wildlife species. The report follows a move by the Department of Homeland Security to waive numerous laws in order to build more border wall. “The Trump administration just ignored bedrock environmental and public health laws to plow a disastrous border wall through protected, spectacular wildlands,” the Center for Biological Diversity’s Laiken Jordahl told the AP.

— ""So you think we can innovate our way out of this?"" The House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday hearing on climate change was the first to focus on the issue in a dozen years, the Washington Examiner reports, and lawmakers discussed various topics, including a carbon tax and clean energy.

During the hearing, Republican members also acknowledged there’s been a shift in rhetoric on the issue from their party. “We have gone from full of claims of [being] climate deniers to now we seem to be progress deniers,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) said, suggesting Democrats haven’t appreciated the shift. “We are making progress. Is it enough? Absolutely not. But we can learn from what’s brought us that progress to solve the challenge ahead of us, which is real.”

But: Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) meanwhile, dismissed what he called “happy talk” about progress. “There was no acknowledgment about the terrible [climate change] impacts that are getting worse, and the Trump administration's concerted effort to make it even worse. So you think we can innovate our way out of this? We are on a path that is going to be very grim.”

— New York's pipeline predicament: Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has until Thursday to decide whether to approve a proposed pipeline that would connect natural gas fields in Pennsylvania to New Jersey and New York. The pipeline has been at the center of debate about the state’s energy future, the New York Times reports.

Environmental advocates are worried about the impact on vulnerable ecosystems and establishing a reliance on fossil fuels as some New Yorkers look toward pushing renewable energy sources. “While the pipeline has not attracted anywhere near the attention of the Keystone XL or Dakota Access pipelines in the Great Plains region, which carry oil, supporters and opponents alike said the gas project could be similarly consequential,” the Times reports.

— PG&E’s wildfire woes: California state fire officials have concluded that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. equipment is to blame for the devastating Camp Fire that killed 85 people in November and was the most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. According to investigators with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the deadly blaze was sparked by electrical transmission lines controlled by the state’s largest utility and located in the community of Pulga, The Post’s Michael Brice-Saddler reports. In February, the company acknowledged it is “probable that its equipment will be determined to be an ignition point of the 2018 Camp fire.”

— An “an invisible cost” to deadly fires: Fire officials spoke to state lawmakers at a joint California Senate and Assembly hearing this week about the toll frequent deadly fires are having on firefighters and their mental health, as one fire captain from Sacramento called it an “invisible cost that’s rarely discussed.”

In California alone, the Firefighter Behavioral Health Alliance reports there have been 46 firefighter and emergency medical worker suicides in the past five years. Across the country, there have been 33 firefighter and emergency medical personnel suicides this year, E&E News reports. “At the hearing, fire officials said they needed more mental health support for emergency workers, both in the field during events and after the fires. They also said they needed more fire suppression personnel overall.”

— A trade-off for fast-growing trees: Although certain types of plants and trees could experience accelerated growth as a result of higher temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, a new study suggests those same trees could die faster, too. That means even as some experts say faster-growing trees could help combat global warming by drawing carbon in and storing the gas at higher rates, a new study in Nature Communications found “faster-growing trees also die younger, meaning the carbon they store goes back into the atmosphere more quickly,” E&E News reports.

"State Department official cited Steele in emails with Ohr after flagging credibility issues to FBI, docs reveal",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-department-christopher-steele-bruce-ohr-judicial-watch-russia-dossier,"Shortly after the 2016 presidential election, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec and Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr discussed new allegations concerning the Trump campaign's Russia connections that were sourced to British ex-spy Christopher Steele, according to documents made public Wednesday.

The previous month, in October 2016, Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavelec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims were apparently false, to a senior FBI executive.

Despite Kavalec's concerns, the FBI used Steele's information to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant targeting former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page just weeks later. The warrant application did not clearly state that the dossier's creation was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

The email correspondence between Ohr and Kavalec highlighted Steele's influence in the DOJ and State Department even as concerns about his reliability mounted, and shed new light on a pivotal period in federal authorities' probe of the Trump team.

The documents were unearthed this week as part of a transparency lawsuit by the group Judicial Watch.



On Nov. 21, 2016, Kavalec began by thanking Ohr for stopping by to discuss the OCDETF (Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force), then added: ""Regarding the person I mentioned, Simon Kukes, below are a couple of links to the story I mentioned.""

DEEP STATE OF PANIC: DISPUTE ERUPTS OVER WHETHER BRENNAN, COMEY PUSHED STEELE DOSSIER



The first was a Mother Jones piece entitled, ""A Major Russian-American Oil Magnate Is Putting Big Money Behind Trump’s Campaign."" The second was an OpenSecrets article, ""Russian-born oil magnate gives big to Trump Victory.""

The articles reported that Russian-American oil magnate Simon Grigorievich Kukes had donated $150,000 to the Trump campaign and a related committee, his first donations in a federal election campaign.



""On this campaign donation story, I just wondered what, assuming this is true, the original source of the funding might have been,"" Kevalec wrote, noting that State Department colleague Tom Firestone had previously introduced her to Kukes personally.



Ohr responded: ""Thank you for taking the time to meet with us. I really hope we can get something going here."" Ohr did not specify exactly what he meant.



""This is very interesting -- I may have heard about him from Tom Firestone as well, but I can't recall for certain,"" Ohr continued. ""We will take another look at this. Thanks again, and I look forward to seeing everyone at the next meeting.""



In a follow-up email, Kevalec said she was ""re-looking"" at her notes from her October 2016 meeting with Steele, whose anti-Trump views are now widely known.

“I see Chris [Steele] said [Simon] Kukes has [sic] some connection to Serge Millian,"" Kevalec wrote to Ohr. Millian is a Russian businessman and a purported source for the Steele dossier.

The Hill's John Solomon first reported details of Kevalec's meeting with Steele, which Fox News later confirmed. On Nov. 1, 2016, the FBI fired Steele as a source, citing his leaks to the news media.



But the FBI had already relied on much of Steele’s work to pursue a FISA warrant against Page in October 2016. And emails previously uncovered by Judicial Watch revealed that Ohr remained in regular contact with Steele even after he was fired by the FBI as a source -- effectively providing Steele a back channel to reach the FBI and Justice Department.

According to Kevalec's notes, Steele told her of “a technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election"" and acknowledged that he wanted his allegations publicized in advance of the 2016 presidential election.

Steele also told Kevalec that “payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami,"" according to Kevalec's notes. Kevalec quickly debunked Steele's assertion, writing in her memo: “It is important to note that there is no Russian consulate in Miami.”

WHO IS THE US ATTORNEY THAT BARR APPOINTED TO LOOK INTO FBI, DOJ MISCONDUCT?

Fox News reported earlier this year that Ohr's own meetings with Steele in 2016 were shared by Ohr with his expansive circle of contacts inside the department -- including senior FBI leadership and officials later assigned to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.



Additionally, Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked for Fusion GPS, the research group that commissioned the dossier. Nellie Ohr conducted extensive opposition research on Trump family members and campaign aides while working there, according to a transcript of her closed-door interview with Congress released earlier this year.

Her tenure at Fusion GPS lasted from October 2015 to September 2016.

"Commerce Dept. bans Huawei, 70 affiliates from sourcing U.S. components",https://www.fiercewireless.com,['Kendra Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/commerce-dept-adds-huawei-and-70-affiliates-to-telecom-ban-list,"The U.S. Department of Commerce has officially placed Huawei and 70 of its affiliates on the Bureau of Industry and Security’s (BIS) “entity list,” effectively banning the company from buying components from U.S. companies without government approval.

The commerce ban does not prohibit U.S. telecom companies from purchasing Huawei gear, but instead bans Huawei from sourcing its supply chain components from U.S. companies. The move will hamper Huawei’s ability to conduct business internationally because of its reliance on U.S. companies for components for its gear, according to a Reuters report citing unnamed U.S. officials.

The move comes one day after U.S. president Donald Trump declared a national emergency in relation to telecom equipment, claiming that “foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services.” Trump’s executive order prohibits U.S. companies from sourcing telecom gear from companies that pose a national security risk, but does not name Huawei nor China as specific threats.

RELATED: Trump to ban U.S. carriers from using network gear posing security risk: Reuters

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the ban is the result of President Trump’s request that the department to be “vigilant in its protection of national security activities.”

“This will prevent American technology from being used by foreign-owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests,” Ross said in a statement.

In a statement, Huawei argued the ban would hurt American efforts to roll out 5G networks. “Restricting Huawei from doing business in the U.S. will not make the U.S. more secure or stronger; instead, this will only serve to limit the U.S. to inferior. yet more expensive alternatives, leaving the U.S. lagging behind in 5G deployment, and eventually harming the interests of U.S. companies and consumers,” the company said. “Unreasonable restrictions will infringe upon Huawei's rights and raise other serious legal issues.”

“We are ready and willing to engage with the U.S. government and come up with effective measures to ensure product security,” Huawei said.

The Commerce department made a similar move in 2016 against China-based telecom equipment maker ZTE, over allegations that ZTE was breaking U.S. sanctions. The ban had a devastating effect on ZTE’s business, causing the company to suspend its operations, as it was unable to source components from U.S. companies. Last year, ZTE reached an agreement with the U.S, government to pay over $1 billion in fines to have the ban suspended."

Former DHS officials ousted over push back on Trump administration's plan to arrest thousands of migrants,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-dhs-officials-ousted-over-push-back-on-trump-administrations-plan-to-arrest-thousands-of-migrants,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and a top immigration official challenged a previously secret White House plan to arrest thousands of migrant parents and children in nearly a dozen U.S. cities, Fox News confirmed Monday.

The Trump administration wanted to target migrant families that had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico in attempt to show that the U.S. wasn't going to back down on its border stance by detaining and deporting illegal immigrant families, The Washington Post first reported, citing several current and former Homeland Security officials.

NEW TRUMP WH POLICY LETS DEPUTIES DETAIN IMMIGRANTS ON BEHALF OF ICE, SUBVERTING 'SANCTUARY' LAWS

The operation included fast-tracking immigration court cases and allowing the U.S. to deport those who failed to show up in their hearings as well as coordinating raids against parents with children in several cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and several other major metropolitan areas, Fox News confirmed.

Nielsen and top immigration official Ronald Vitiello pushed back on the administration’s plan, citing lack of preparation, public outrage and worries that the operation could use border resources. Stephen Miller and ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence were supportive of the plan arguing that such an operation could deter migrants from crossing into the U.S., according to The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s were concerned over the operation and logistics over the plan and not the ethical reasons behind it, according to the newspaper. Nielsen also worried that targeting parents and children might detract from the White House’s goal of going after so-called “criminal aliens.”

“There was concern that it was being hastily put together, would be ineffective and might actually backfire by misdirecting resources away from critical border emergency response operations,” a Homeland Security official told The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s push back was reportedly part of the reason why Trump pushed both officials out of the administration.

Neither Homeland Security nor the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have commented on the report. Miller, through a White House spokesman, declined comment to The Post.

Nielsen left her position after only 16 months on the job. The Associated Press, citing two sources, reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the southwestern border.

The immediate effect of the Trump administration decision is unclear because of a court injunction issued in 2012 barring the FDA from allowing the importation of a key execution drug, sodium thiopental. Shortages of that drug have led many states to scale back or halt executions in recent years.

In a statement, an FDA spokesperson said the agency would “follow the conclusion of the opinion to the extent permissible” by the 7-year-old order, which remains in effect.

The 26-page opinion , signed by Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel, indicates that it was sought by the attorney general's office, but does not say when. OLC opinions are traditionally treated as controlling law within the executive branch. Courts often take note of such high-level legal advice when it is made public, but are not obliged to follow the opinions.

Engel’s opinion argues that drugs and other items intended for use in executions are not covered by the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, passed in 1938 and repeatedly updated by Congress. The legal memo also says that conclusion is reinforced by so-called federalism problems that could arise from federal officials trying to enforce such regulations in a way that would frustrate state efforts to carry out executions.

“The FDCA cannot be read as authorizing FDA to effectively ban capital punishment, because that reading would contravene or render moot a host of federal statutes that presuppose the lawfulness of capital punishment,” Engel wrote in the opinion, dated May 3 and released by the Justice Department on Tuesday evening.

“The Constitution and numerous federal statutes presuppose that capital punishment will remain available and that the federal government will defer to States over methods of execution,” the opinion says. “Interpreting the FDCA to bar the importation, sale, and distribution of articles intended for use in executions would conflict with that settled understanding. The FDCA’s definitions of ‘drug’ and ‘device’ are broad, but breadth alone fails to manifest the intent needed to alter federal-state relations so dramatically with respect to capital punishment.”

While the 2012 injunction was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit the next year, Engel’s opinion downplays the significance of those rulings. “Neither the district court, nor the D.C. Circuit, addressed the broader question of FDA’s jurisdiction,” the opinion says.

When the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental stopped production in 2009, states began scrambling to find stocks of the drug in the U.S. and abroad. After the 2012 injunction, the FDA moved to halt such imports. In 2015, it blocked a shipment headed for a Texas prison.

Because of the shortage, states have turned to a variety of other methods for executions, including substitutions for thiopental in a three-drug combination and the use of a single drug, pentobarbital. Some of the new methods resulted in a spate of episodes in which the condemned gasped, convulsed or cried out during the execution process.

States have carried out about 25 executions a year since 2015, a significant drop-off from the previous two decades. The last federal execution was in 2003.

Sean Hannity: DOJ inspector general FISA abuse probe is 'done and it's devastating',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-doj-inspector-general-fisa-abuse-probe-is-done-and-its-devastating,"Fox News host Sean Hannity says he is hearing that the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse is ""done and it's devastating.""

He made the assertion during his evening program on Wednesday and asked Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., if he also had heard any word on the investigation.

Graham, whose Judiciary Committee had been conducting his own FISA abuse inquiry, said he could not verify if Inspector General Michael Horowitz is done, but added that he expects the eventual report to be upsetting to anyone who cares about the rule of law.

Hannity first brought up the prospect of Horowitz's investigation being complete earlier in the show, speaking with Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is now a Fox News contributor.

""I have sources telling me that Horowitz perhaps is even finished with his report and certainly the attorney general has been briefed on what is coming,"" Hannity said. He also referred to former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova saying Horowitz determined that the three FISA extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained and was on the brink of finding the first FISA was completely illegal.

The completion of Horowitz's investigation would be news. Attorney General William Barr recently predicted that it would be complete in either late May or June, but there has been no official word of its progress since.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

Horowitz announced his investigation in March 2018 in a statement that said his office was examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into President Trump's campaign. Horowitz also said he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who authored the unverified dossier on Trump's ties to Russia that was used by the FBI in the Page warrant applications.

Horowitz can recommend that people be prosecuted. Jarrett noted that U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr has tasked with reviewing the origins of the Russia investigation, could then ""subpoena people to haul them in front of a grand jury. I suspect there is a grand jury and they're well on their way to potential criminal indictments.""

Jarrett said the people ""likely"" in legal jeopardy are former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former FBI General Counsel James Baker, former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, ""maybe"" former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and ""certainly"" Steele and Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson."

Ethics experts explain how to protect taxpayers from Pruitt-like scandals,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-watchdog-pruitt-scandal-travel-0571e566f505/,"Internal watchdogs opened more than a dozen investigations into a range of scandals surrounding the former heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department last year. Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke both resigned as their ethics, management, and travel scandals mounted.

In doing so, they have largely been able to avoid the accusations and potential consequences, leading experts and politicians alike to demand greater accountability.

Several of the probes into these two former Trump officials have been closed or remain inconclusive due to lack of cooperation from former or current officials. But agency watchdogs are still investigating alleged misconduct. The EPA’s Office of Inspector General issued a report Thursday on Pruitt’s travel expenses that found Pruitt racked up nearly $124,000 in “excessive” travel costs in 2017 — largely due to his penchant for first class travel, which often took place “without sufficient justification and proper approval.”

Among its more than a dozen recommendations, the OIG says the EPA should recover these funds from the “responsible official or officials.” Ten of the 14 recommendations in the report remain unresolved, however, and in its response, the EPA asserted that since the travel was “valid” it does not have any plans to try and recoup the money.

The 84-page report is detailed and pointed, but the EPA’s response left many critics unsatisfied.

Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA), who was the first member of Congress to formally call for Pruitt’s resignation, said current EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is “sweeping [Pruitt’s] wrongdoing under the rug.”

“Andrew Wheeler is allowing him to cheat taxpayers out of thousands of dollars by proclaiming his intention not to follow up on the findings of [the] report,” Beyer said in a statement. “Pruitt should not be allowed to evade the consequences of his actions just because he was dismissed before his offenses were fully uncovered.”

The same can be said of Zinke, who remains largely unscathed by the numerous investigations that dogged him in the Trump administration. After resigning, he failed to cooperate with investigators by not turning in documents regarding his use of a private plane linked to oil executives, along with other charter flights that cost taxpayers thousands of dollars. The inspector general’s report was therefore inconclusive.

So, this all begs the question: How can government officials be held accountable for misuse of taxpayer money when it seems by resigning they largely escape the consequences?

Government ethics watchdogs have long criticized this lack of accountability. “Once a government official resigns from government service, an IG [Inspector General] often closes investigations into wrongful behavior because the IG can no longer compel the person’s testimony,” Rebecca Jones, policy counsel at the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), told ThinkProgress.

“Then, rather than being held accountable for their actions, the former employee often lands in a lucrative private consulting position,” she continued. “This is an accountability loophole that permits flagrant abuse of power. It’s also an unabashed slap in the face to taxpayers left signing the check.”

Pruitt and Zinke now work as high-paid consultants for industries they regulated just a short time ago — Pruitt for coal and Zinke for mining.

The EPA’s latest report seeks to address a portion of this accountability gap by laying out steps for how the misuse of taxpayer funds for first class travel and expensive hotels can be avoided in the future.

In addition to urging the EPA to recoup the $123,942 in excessive travel costs, the OIG calls for the agency to adopt stricter policies and oversight procedures. This includes implementing controls to ensure the official approving first class or business travel has the authority to do so, that this type of travel be “properly justified and documented prior to approval,” and have controls to ensure “adequate cost comparisons” are made before approving a travel route that’s not the most direct or standard route. Nearly half of Pruitt’s domestic flights were routed via his hometown in Oklahoma, for instance.

“I think this makes sense,” Tom Pelton, communications director for the Environmental Integrity Project, told ThinkProgress. “More careful oversight of the spending of cabinet members by the federal government should crack down on this kind of waste and abuse of taxpayer funds.”

Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, agreed. “You are correct that sometimes with administrative matters, the consequences for certain violations may not materialize if they are left up to agency discretion; and sometimes the absence of an official moots an investigation,” she said. “But the fact of this report and the recommendation is significant.”

Annual OIG reports are submitted to Congress, Marsco explained, and the OIG keeps logs of recommendations that were not implemented. “These recommendations can and should be used as a tool for congressional oversight of agency practice with regard to travel, if the agency fails to implement the recommendations on its own,” Marsco said.

Ultimately, preventing future scandals comes down to congressional oversight, according to POGO’s Jones. “I think the solution lies as much in deterring this kind of blatant disregard for ethics as it does in having the ability to hold bad actors accountable after the fact,” she said.

Congress needs to ensure inspectors general and the Office of Special Counsel have adequate funding, said Jones. In February 2018, the EPA OIG said it didn’t have enough funding to investigate all of Pruitt’s scandals, and so it had to limit its travel probe to 2017 — which is why the report out this week does not examine any travel by Pruitt in 2018.

Congressional committees are able to wield greater power than inspectors general to compel information. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ), for instance, has said he’ll use his subpoena power as Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee to hold Zinke to account; with a majority vote, the committee can issue a subpoena for Zinke to testify.

Congress should also introduce reforms to support inspectors general to be able to do the same, Jones said. This includes giving them testimonial subpoena authority (which is separate from issuing a subpoena for documents) so they can call upon former officials to testify even if they’ve resigned. Other reforms should focus on increasing transparency and strengthening the independence of these internal watchdog offices.

At the end of the day, however, “compliance with ethics rules is so dependent on the ethical culture of the agency,” said Marsco. “If we see the most senior officials skirting ethics rules, it’s more likely that less senior employees will feel empowered to do the same.”

There’s no lack of ethics controversies in the Trump administration. Beyond Zinke and Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao have also been criticized over taxpayer-funded travel expenses. Meanwhile, the former heads of Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency all resigned amid expenses controversies. And the current officials leading the EPA and Interior, along with other government agencies, are face questions over conflicts of interest.

“In the absence of ethical leadership, strong prevention mechanisms are necessary,” she said, noting that she felt the OIG’s recommendations to the EPA were “good ones.”

For many politicians, watchdogs, and environmental groups, though, a satisfying first step would be for Pruitt to pay back his travel costs.

“There needs to be accountability for such blatant abuses of the public trust. Mr. Pruitt should repay the taxpayer money that he wasted on his lavish travel expenses,” Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee overseeing the EPA’s budget, said in a statement. He added that “the Trump EPA needs to heed the recommendations of the OIG” to prevent such future abuses.

It’s not unprecedented for officials to reimburse expenses. According to an October 2018 Interior OIG report, for instance, which found that Zinke violated department policy by allowing his wife and others ride with him in department vehicles, the couple repaid the costs associated with the travel. And Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reportedly reimbursed taxpayers for his private travel to watch an eclipse with his wife.

“By resigning, [Pruitt] should not now be able to escape repaying what he owes taxpayers for these improper expenses,” Tim Whitehouse, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), said in an email to ThinkProgress.

But many doubt Pruitt will do this. And as a spokesperson from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) told ThinkProgress, “It’s not about holding the officials accountable as much as holding the government accountable. By removing wrongdoers from the government, the government becomes more accountable to taxpayers.”"
Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers,https://www.npr.org,['Frank Morris'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/18/724433714/critics-say-usda-plan-to-move-federal-agencies-could-hurt-research-vital-for-far,"Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers

A couple of federal agencies you probably haven't heard of keep track of what farmers grow, what Americans eat and how the country's entire food system operates. And the Trump Administration wants them out Washington, D.C.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would relocate somewhere that's closer to farmers and public universities doing agricultural research. But critics, including many scientists, balked, saying the agencies won't be as effective.

ERS collects and crunches numbers on everything from how much corn syrup Americans consume to how tariffs affect farmers, while NIFA funds research that does things like closely track climate change.

USDA has yet to announce a new home for the agencies, but recently narrowed the list to three: the greater Kansas City metro area, the Research Triangle Park area near Raleigh, N.C., and various sites in Indiana — Vice President Mike Pence's home state.

Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran recalled when he heard of Perdue's proposal.

""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" said the Republican, who, along with other Missouri and Kansas members of Congress, supports the move.

""Not every job in government needs to be in Washington D.C.,"" Moran said, noting that about 9 out of 10 USDA employees already work outside of Washington.

He added that ERS and NIFA would boost budding research clusters like the Kansas City area's animal health corridor and give bright kids from the region a chance to stay put and still pursue a research career. The move would also fall in line with the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Moran said office rent and the cost of living is cheaper away from the coasts.

Skepticism about what is driving the move

But many in the research community said efficiency isn't driving the move. It's hostility toward science.

""I think that moving the agencies out of D.C. is going to significantly dilute their effectiveness as well as their relevance,"" says Ricardo Salvador, who is the Director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The agency's effectiveness already is under attack, according to a former ERS employee who was granted anonymity due to fear of losing his current position.

""Efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale,"" the ex-ERS employee said.

He said he enjoyed working at the agency until about a year and a half ago, when researchers began to fear tackling politically sensitive topics. Then, Purdue pushed to take the agency out from under nonpartisan oversight and place it under his control.

Finally, the ex-employee said, the surprise announcement to move most of ERS and NIFA out of Washington triggered a cascade of resignations, including his own.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee said.

Employees remaining at ERS and NIFA are fighting back. ERS researchers recently voted to join the American Federation of Government Employees, and NIFA employees plan to take a vote, too. The union will negotiate to give ERS and NIFA employees longer to decide if they want to move, and is backing legislation that would withhold funds USDA would need to make the move.

The Trump administration wanted staff reductions years ago. And all three Trump budgets, none of which have been accepted by Congress, have proposed deep cuts to the agencies.

Salvador argued that's because objective research often clashes with political ideology. ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.

""So the secretary is clearly dealing with inconvenient facts by going to the source and eliminating them,"" Salvador said.

Sen. Jerry Moran said he believes the research agencies can be relocated and well supported, and he's played a key role in fighting off earlier efforts to cut funding for agricultural research.

Moran said farmers, ranchers and policymakers can't make sound decisions without reliable USDA data.

But that's exactly the problem critics have with the proposal to move ERS and NIFA: They say the USDA hasn't produced data that supports the move."
"Exxon and Energy Department Team Up on Biofuels, Plastics Research",https://www.scientificamerican.com,"['John Fialka E E News', 'About The Author S', 'John Fialka', 'Recent Articles', 'E E News']",,,,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-and-energy-department-team-up-on-biofuels-plastics-research/,"Research collaborations for cleaner, more energy-dense biofuels and recyclable plastics are at the heart of a new agreement between Exxon Mobil Corp. and Department of Energy laboratories.

Bill Farris, associate director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colo., explained that the agreement will give scientists better insights into future energy markets and ways to scale up cleaner forms of energy.

“Exxon has to think about how you scale things up,” Farris said in an interview about Exxon’s commitment to contribute $100 million to research by NREL and 16 other DOE laboratories over the next 10 years. “That’s probably one of the things we’re most excited about: taking things into the marketplace at scale. NREL could never do that alone.”

He said discussions that led to the agreement last week—one of the largest research projects that DOE labs have with a commercial company—started with biofuels and then expanded to a broad array of joint research discussions that are still underway. The labs and Exxon started talking about the agreement in November 2017.

They began with Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development at Exxon Mobil Research and Engineering Co. “Sparks started to fly, we developed a good relationship,” recalled Farris.

In a statement released last week, Swarup said the research partnership is intended to “explore ways to bring biofuels and carbon capture and [energy] storage to commercial uses across the power generation, transportation, and manufacturing sectors.”

Exxon is the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, and it has stressed that the agreement with DOE is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions “on a global basis.”

Biofuels will likely be essential to that effort in the transportation sector, explained Farris, because while research has shown that electric cars can reduce greenhouse gases, the trucking and aircraft industries will require more energy-dense fuels to reduce their emissions. NREL has been experimenting with various biofuels to deliver extra energy, and Exxon has focused on algae-based fuels to fill the gap. But it will likely take more experiments and collaborations to see what technology can be scaled up for global use.

One possibility that’s intriguing researchers is fuel made from captured carbon dioxide emissions. Both NREL and its sister laboratory in West Virginia, DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), are working on capturing emissions and putting them to use.

Exxon is interested in that, as well, along with ways to store energy. The use of hydrogen-based fuels as a way to store renewable forms of energy from electricity sources, such as solar and wind power, is another research objective.

“We see renewable energy producing electricity at very, very low costs in the future,” explained Farris, pointing to uses in transportation, buildings, factories and homes.

NREL has smaller research partnerships with other major oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Norway’s Equinor ASA and France’s Total SA. “They’re all trying to figure out what future markets are going to look like. Where Exxon is coming from, for example, the planet is going to have 9 billion people, and the quality of their life depends on that energy, and that energy has to have lower carbon,” added Farris.

One of the questions under scrutiny by oil companies, he said, is what future gas stations will look like. While Exxon hasn’t raised the question yet in its discussions with DOE, “I have to think they’re interested in that,” Farris said.

Major oil companies own a large number of gas stations, and in the future they may be required to supply fuel cell-powered cars with hydrogen to recharge electric cars quickly and to supply biofuels for heavy trucks.

Exxon, Farris noted, has a substantial presence in the chemical industry, and one of its research objectives is plastics that don’t use petroleum feedstocks, or that can be recycled to rid the world of its plastic waste problem, which is mounting annually.

In the near future, dozens of Exxon scientists from Texas and the East Coast will be coming to Golden to work on some of these projects with their counterparts at NREL. “If you can increase the contact time between researchers, we think you get better results,” Farris said.

DHS could ship border migrants 'across the entire nation',https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/17/dhs-ship-border-migrants-across-entire-nation/,"The border is so overwhelmed that Homeland Security is considering shipping migrants from border states “across the entire nation” to be processed and released — but it has not begun yet, officials said Friday, shooting down reports of imminent flights to Florida.

Things are so out of control that even though the government is processing and releasing migrants almost immediately, there are still too many surging into the U.S. to handle in the key areas of western Arizona, El Paso and southern Texas.

The likely solution, a Customs and Border Protection Official said, is to rope in Border Patrol facilities in non-border states, asking them to process and then release the migrants there.

The northern and coastal states are the likely targets, since that’s where the Border Patrol has a capable enough operation, the CBP official said.

“Wherever CBP has a footprint and has the capacity to accept aliens to process,” the official said. “Anywhere where there’s a Border Patrol facility that has computers and ample holding space.”

Florida politicians began to complain this week, saying they’d been told they were going to get about 1,000 migrants a month.

The CBP official said that was a preliminary conversation, similar those that have happened across the country.

He described it as “contingency” planning.

The goal is to speed up catch-and-release to accommodate the historic surge, which last month saw nearly 110,000 migrants breach the southwest border. The majority were unaccompanied children or families.

The unaccompanied children are shipped to federal health officials for care, but the families cannot be held under current policy, so they have to be released. But there are so many people coming as families that the border stations cannot fingerprint and run criminal checks on them fast enough, the government says.

“The entire system is overwhelmed and we’re simply trying to get them out of our custody as quickly as we can,” the official said.

Cobb veterans welcome new clinic amid uncertainty over VA plans,https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/local/cobb-veterans-welcome-new-clinic-amid-uncertainty-over-plans/hkuHsbc4SyoLMY4GsiceYO/,"The Department of Veterans Affairs celebrated the opening of the first of four new clinics in Cobb County Thursday as the agency prepares to expand and shift services in the county.

The $1.2 million, 9,400-square-foot facility on Roswell Road in east Cobb will offer mainly primary care and is one of several facilities replacing a clinic in Austell, which had been Cobb’s only facility and is now slated to be closed.

Veterans who spoke to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution expressed hope the new facility would improve veteran care, even as some raised concerns over the lack of public transit access to the new clinic and ongoing communication problems with the VA.

They also pointed out that closing the Austell clinic could pose problems for veterans in the southern part of the county who will now have to travel farther to see a doctor.

“I’m so grateful that they are building a new building because Austell is ancient,” said Dan Hydrick, a Vietnam veteran and volunteer with the Cobb Veterans Court. But, he added, most veterans he’s spoken to haven’t been informed of the changes and “Change is always stressful for veterans that are trying to seek treatment.”

That’s especially true of those in treatment for mental health issues, he said. The Roswell clinic will have psychologists but not psychiatrists on staff.

The other clinics in the pipeline will be on Dallas Highway in west Cobb, Herodian Way in Smyrna, and Bells Ferry Road in north Cobb.

In a statement, the VA said its clinic locations were chosen “based on the needs of Veterans through a competitive solicitation process.”

“The VA would be interested in learning of opportunities for improved transportation in Cobb County that would serve our Veterans and support efforts to do so,” it said. “The Austell clinic will not close until the South Cobb County and West Cobb County clinics are fully operational.”

Gregory Kendall, a spokesman for the VA, said the agency had sent letters to affected veterans but “we can always do a better job of communicating.”

The VA is also working to expand telehealth options, officials said.

Robert Smith, 59, an Army veteran of Operation Desert Storm, had his first appointment at the new clinic Thursday. Smith, who lives in south Cobb, said even though it was a longer commute for him, he is willing to travel for better service.

“I like what I see and what I’m feeling,” he said. “They seem like they’re more up to helping a soldier here. Austell, I wasn’t too happy there.”

The DOJ won’t say why Rudy Giuliani hasn’t registered as a foreign agent under FARA law,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/why-isnt-rudy-giuliani-registered-as-a-foreign-agent-fara-lobbying-in-ukraine-a9289f19677e/,"Amid last week’s furor about Rudy Giuliani pledging to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine — and Giuliani’s claim that he wanted to “meddl[e] in an investigation” regarding Biden’s son in Ukraine — was a small, buried detail that may yet unravel Giuliani’s entire plan.

Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, has worked in Ukraine since Trump’s inauguration, nominally as a security adviser to the city of Kharkiv with his firm Giuliani Partners. However, one of his local clients claimed last week that Giuliani provided far more than technical advice and a handful of photo-ops.

According to Ukrainian developer Pavel Fuks, Giuliani had been hired to work as a “lobbyist” for the government of Ukraine, as well as for the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. “This is stated in the contract,” Fuks told the Times. The claim backs up local media coverage of the relationship, with one Ukrainian magazine writing that Fuks hired Giuliani in order to create an office in the U.S. for “supporting investment” in Kharkiv. As Mother Jones reported, Giuliani connected with Fuks via TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a New York-based company that has “advised Russian oligarchs and others with Kremlin ties.”

Giuliani denied Fuks’ claim, saying that Trump remains his “only client.” Giuliani didn’t respond to ThinkProgress’ questions on the matter, and ThinkProgress’ efforts to contact Fuks were unsuccessful.

If anyone needs to be investigated, it’s Rudy Giuliani. Rudy was “a lobbyist for Kharkiv and Ukraine” but failed to register under FARA. His clients, Pavel Fuks and Gennadiy Kernes, have reported ties to organized crime. How is he different than Manafort? https://t.co/O0ZdUkmoex — Michael Carpenter (@mikercarpenter) May 10, 2019

However, Fuks’ claim adds significant fuel to longstanding concerns about Giuliani’s decision not to register as a foreign agent with the Justice Department — even as the agency goes to unprecedented lengths to enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

FARA regulations, on the books since 1938, had remained an afterthought for decades. But thanks to Trump’s rise, and due especially to the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, FARA has seen new life. The DOJ already created a new task force to strengthen FARA, making sure that those working on behalf of foreign governments and officials disclose and detail their work with the DOJ, and prosecutors have shown a new willingness to finally enforce the regulations.

In just the past year, failing to register with FARA has tripped up former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and former White House counsel Gregory Craig — both of whom were found guilty of failing to register their work on behalf of the former Ukrainian government. Manafort’s former business associate Rick Gates pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate FARA.

Giuliani, though, has thus far managed to escape scrutiny. And no one’s quite sure why.

Last September, months before Fuks claimed that Giuliani had been hired directly to lobby on behalf of Ukraine, a number of Democratic senators signed a letter to the DOJ requesting information on Giuliani’s FARA filings (or lack thereof). Giuliani admitted last year that he’d never filed a single FARA registration.

The senators specifically pointed to Giuliani’s work in Ukraine, including a press release linking Giuliani with Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, himself a former member of the party affiliated with ousted Ukrainian strongman Viktor Yanukovych. Both Manafort and Craig were indicted for failing to disclose FARA-related work on behalf of Yanukovych’s regime.

The senators writing to DOJ — including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) — specifically singled out Giuliani’s work in Ukraine:

Giuliani’s work on behalf the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine, whose mayor is a member of the Party of Regions is also concerning. The Ukrainian Party of Regions’ connections to the Russian Government and anti-democratic activity are well-documented. Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, who both served in senior roles on the President’s 2016 campaign team, were convicted of or pleaded guilty to criminal acts in part because of their work on behalf of this Russian-backed Ukrainian political party. Mr. Giuliani’s financial connection to the organization, the organization’s close ties with the Russian government, and Mr. Giuliani’s ongoing public advocacy against Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election raises further questions that warrant review.

And it’s not just Giuliani’s work in Ukraine. As the senators noted, Giuliani’s efforts at recruiting foreign clients — all while working closely with the sitting president — have spanned the globe. He’s represented the Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group, in its efforts to lift their Foreign Terrorist Organization designation from the State Department. He recently signed up with Bahrain’s Ministry of the Interior, as The Daily Beast found. And, perhaps most notably, he wrote a remarkable letter to Romanian authorities, chastising the country’s prosecutor for being too effective at combating corruption — all while working at the behest of another lobbyist representing an official caught up in Romania’s anti-corruption dragnet.

But it was Giuliani’s misadventures in Ukraine that gained the most notoriety. And over the past week, the questions — about Giuliani’s aims, about who’s paying for his travel, about how much Trump knows — have only grown.

The DOJ, though, has been silent. As multiple staffers working for the Democratic senators told ThinkProgress, the DOJ never even bothered to reply to their inquiries about Giuliani’s FARA status.

“DOJ never responded to our letter,” a spokesperson for Udall told ThinkProgress. “However, we did confirm that they received it.”

As Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), another signatory of the letter requesting information on Giuliani’s FARA status, tweeted last Friday, “Giuliani has reportedly been paid by foreign [governments] + political parties, including in Ukraine, but FAILED to register as a foreign agent as the law requires. This is EXACTLY why I joined @SenatorTomUdall to ask DOJ to investigate. We never got a reply.”

Giuliani, unsurprisingly, has long denied any need to register as a foreign agent. Despite the fact that experts on FARA regulations have pointed to Giuliani’s foreign work time and again — both in terms of his speeches and political activities — as examples of FARA-related work, Giuliani has claimed that he’s not influencing American policy.

However, Giuliani also offered a caveat last week: “I don’t think I’m influencing American government except on behalf of my client to further an investigation.” That is, Giuliani admitted that he’s not working to “influence” U.S. policy — except when it comes to his client, the president of the United States.

It doesn’t appear concerns about FARA regulations will slow Giuliani’s work anytime soon. Despite calling off his trip to Ukraine — and despite Fuks’ claims that he has paperwork clarifying Giuliani’s work as a lobbyist in Ukraine — Giuliani has refused to acknowledge any issues with his work in Ukraine, especially as it pertains to FARA.

As he said on Friday, when it comes to Ukraine, “I’m going to make sure that nothing scuttles the investigation that I want.”"
