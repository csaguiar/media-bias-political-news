"Trump Brags About Mexico Deal, but Reveals No Details",https://www.nytimes.com,['Michael D. Shear'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html,"The president offered a series of confusing and contradictory statements, saying repeatedly that Mexico would have to submit the agreement to “their congress” while simultaneously saying that he has the power to impose it unilaterally if he wants to.

“If they bring the numbers way down, we won’t have to, but this is my option,” Mr. Trump said. “It goes into effect when I want it to, but I have a lot of respect for the president of Mexico. I have a lot of respect for the people we dealt with, so I don’t want to do that, and they have to go back to congress to get that approved.”

Moments later, he said that “it will go into effect when Mexico tells me its O.K. to release it.”

Mr. Trump and his aides have repeatedly referred to a “secret agreement” since Sunday morning when he first said on Twitter that a yet-to-be-revealed deal was reached with Mexico and would be “announced at the appropriate time.”

Since then, aides have refused to elaborate, saying that it was up to the president to decide whether to say more about it.

Because of Mr. Trump’s mention of approval by Mexico’s congress, Mexican officials and others have said they believe the president is referring to discussions about changes to the region’s asylum rules, which Mexico has said it would consider if the flow of migrants to the United States is not reduced over the next several months.

But Mr. Ebrard insisted on Monday that such a deal has not been reached with the United States, saying only that the two sides have agreed to potentially revisit the issue in the future."

Trump is reportedly in denial about his campaign’s bleak internal polling,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/11/18661072/trump-campaign-internal-polling-denial,"During campaign rallies since he’s become president, President Donald Trump has repeatedly dismissed polls that reflect poorly on him as somehow representing “suppression,” or not including the 10 percent of people he thinks support him but refuse to say so publicly.

But his denialism about bad polling now reportedly extends to polls conducted by his own campaign.

As Politico recently detailed, the Trump campaign put together a 17-state polling project that found the president lagging behind Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. But according to the New York Times’s Annie Karni and Maggie Haberman, after he was briefed about the “devastating” polling, Trump told his aides to deny it and instead tout polls showing him doing better.

From the Times:

After being briefed on a devastating 17-state poll conducted by his campaign pollster, Tony Fabrizio, Mr. Trump told aides to deny that his internal polling showed him trailing Mr. Biden in many of the states he needs to win, even though he is also trailing in public polls from key states like Texas, Michigan and Pennsylvania. And when top-line details of the polling leaked, including numbers showing the president lagging in a cluster of critical Rust Belt states, Mr. Trump instructed aides to say publicly that other data showed him doing well.

Along the lines of “other data” that shows him doing well, Trump on Monday evening tweeted a poll from his favorite pollster, Rasmussen, showing his approval rating at a relatively robust 50 percent.

Despite the Phony Witch Hunt, we will continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you!! pic.twitter.com/MXuiolM745 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 10, 2019

But there are a couple of reasons not to give much credence to Trump’s tweet. First, as CNN detailed in December, Rasmussen — which is known to skew to the right — was the least accurate pollster out of any that released generic congressional ballot polls in the runup to November’s midterm elections:

Rasmussen’s final poll was the least accurate of any of the 32 polls. They had the Republicans ahead nationally by one point. Democrats are currently winning the national House vote by 8.6 points. That’s an error of nearly 10 points.

Secondly, and relatedly, the Rasmussen poll Trump cited is an outlier when compared to others. For instance, RealClearPolitics’ aggregated polling of Trump’s approval rating, which includes Rasmussen, currently has it pegged at a much more problematic 44 percent, with 53 percent disapproving of his job performance.

Perhaps even more important than Trump’s consistently low approval rating is the fact that he’s underwater in battleground states key to his 2020 prospects. As my colleague Dylan Scott detailed last week, state polls from Morning Consult found Trump’s approval rating below his disapproval rating in New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, and Indiana. Especially bleak is the fact that Trump’s approval rating is more than a dozen points underwater in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa — all states he won in 2016.

Of course, a lot can change between now and November of next year. And in fairness to Trump, it is true that state-level polls underestimated his support in 2016, even if national ones were more accurate about Hillary Clinton’s 2.1 percent margin of popular vote victory than Trump would have you believe. It’s undeniable, however, that the 2020 polling, taken in its totality, doesn’t look good for Trump right now.

But instead of engaging with that reality, Trump is reportedly putting his head in the sand and his faith in Rasmussen.

Trump Wants To Limit Aid For Low-Income Americans. A Look At His Proposals,https://www.npr.org,['Pam Fessler'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/11/730639328/trump-wants-to-limit-aid-for-low-income-americans-a-look-at-his-proposals,"Trump Wants To Limit Aid For Low-Income Americans. A Look At His Proposals

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images John Moore/Getty Images

If you're poor or low-income in the U.S. and use government safety net programs, you could be affected by a number of new rules and actions proposed by the Trump administration. Most of the changes are still pending, and anti-poverty groups are trying to stop them from going into effect. Some of the proposals already face legal challenges.

President Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to get more people off government aid and into the workforce so they can become self-sufficient. To help do that, he issued an executive order last year to reduce poverty ""by promoting opportunity and economic mobility.""

In it, Trump called on federal agencies to streamline existing welfare programs, strengthen work requirements and make sure that taxpayer money is spent on ""those who are truly in need.""

But anti-poverty advocates say the administration's proposals would hurt, rather than help, poor Americans. They say it will make it more difficult for those trying to become self-sufficient by denying them food, housing and medical assistance when they need it most.

""They really are trying to use every agency to make life harder for people who are low-income,"" says Elizabeth Lower-Basch, director of income and work supports at the Center for Law and Social Policy.

Deborah Weinstein, executive director of the Coalition on Human Needs, which represents about 100 anti-poverty groups nationwide, calls the volume of proposals targeting the safety net ""head spinning.""

Here are some of the main proposals and their status:

Loading...

Food aid

The Department of Agriculture has called for stricter enforcement of a requirement that able-bodied adults work, volunteer or get job training for at least 20 hours a week to continue getting their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, or food stamps, after three months. Currently, most states waive that requirement. The administration would make that much more difficult to do. Critics estimate that 750,000 SNAP recipients would likely have their benefits cut off because they would be unable to find jobs or otherwise meet the requirements. The public comment period on the proposal ended April 10 and attracted more than 100,000 comments, overwhelmingly negative.

The Department of Agriculture is weighing a rule to make it harder for people to qualify for both SNAP and other welfare assistance. Currently, states have the flexibility to waive asset and income limits for those who get both food stamps and benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Anti-poverty advocates argue that changing that would penalize hundreds of thousands of working poor families by taking away their food aid just as they start earning enough to pay for other living expenses, such as child care and housing. But supporters of the proposal say states are exploiting a loophole in the law to give aid to those who would otherwise be ineligible. It is unclear exactly what the administration will propose and when. The rule has yet to be published in the Federal Register.

Payday loans

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed rescinding an Obama-era regulation that would require payday lenders to determine whether a borrower has the ability to repay the loan. That regulation, which the Trump administration has delayed until next year, was intended to prevent low-income borrowers from becoming saddled with ballooning debt because payday loans can carry annual interest rates of 300% or more. Consumer advocates say low-income individuals often have to take out new payday loans to pay off earlier ones. The Trump administration argues that rescinding the Obama-era rule will encourage more competition in the industry and provide more options for borrowers. The public comment period on the proposed change closed May 15. It is unclear when a final rule will be issued.

Poverty line

The Office of Management and Budget is considering whether to recalculate the official poverty line using a different inflation measure, one that many economists say would paint a more accurate picture of the price increases that consumers face. But critics say the change would not reflect how inflation affects low- and moderate-income families and, over time, would lead to millions of people seeing their government benefits — such as SNAP, Medicaid, energy assistance and school lunches — reduced or eliminated. The Obama and George W. Bush administrations tried to make a similar change in the poverty line calculation with no luck. The public comment period ends June 21.

Immigration

The Department of Homeland Security has proposed limiting the ability of immigrants to get green cards if they receive government benefits, such as SNAP or housing aid. The administration says it is enforcing existing law, which seeks to block immigrants who could need assistance and become a ""public charge."" But immigrants' rights groups say the proposed change would affect not only immigrants but also family members who are U.S. citizens. Social service providers around the country report that they have already seen a big drop in immigrant families signing up for assistance, including Medicaid and SNAP, because of fears that it could hurt their efforts to get green cards or become citizens. The comment period on the proposed rule ended in December. More than a quarter of a million comments were received, mostly opposed to the change. It is unclear when the final rule will be issued.

President Trump signed a memorandum May 23 calling on federal agencies to enforce a law requiring those who sponsor green card holders to reimburse government agencies for the cost of any public benefits used by the immigrant. The administration says the law has not been fully enforced. ""To protect benefits for American citizens, immigrants must be financially self-sufficient,"" Trump said in a statement announcing the move. Immigrants' rights advocates say the announcement is part of a larger campaign by the Trump administration to restrict both legal and illegal immigration, and that the change will discourage green card holders from applying for benefits for which they or other family members are eligible.

Housing

The Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed a rule that would deny housing assistance to families with one or more members who are undocumented immigrants. The administration notes that those in the country illegally are not eligible for housing aid, although HUD now prorates rental assistance for such ""mixed status"" families to take that into account. By HUD's own estimate, 55,000 children who are either citizens or legal residents could lose their housing as a result of the move. Critics call the proposal ""cruel"" and are waging a vigorous campaign to block it. HUD Secretary Ben Carson defended it, saying that ""it seems only logical that taxpaying American citizens should be taken care of first"" and that the change would provide more aid for needy Americans. However, HUD's own analysis concludes that the rule would lead to fewer people getting housing aid and to an increase in homelessness. The public comment period for the proposed rule runs through July 9, but House Democrats are trying to prevent HUD from enforcing such a rule.

The Agriculture Department is expected to propose a rule later this year similar to HUD's proposal, to restrict the use of rural housing assistance for households that have one or more members who are undocumented immigrants.

HUD has proposed that the operators of federally funded homeless shelters be allowed to determine which services transgender individuals can use. Operators could base their decisions on their religious beliefs, among other factors. Critics say that if the rule is adopted, transgender individuals could be kicked out of shelters or forced to use ones that serve a gender they do not identify with. Carson had assured lawmakers at a congressional hearing May 21 that he did not anticipate eliminating Obama-era rules that protect transgender individuals from housing discrimination, and lawmakers were angry to see the proposed rule on a list published by the administration the following day. Details of the rule are expected to be made public later this year for comment. About 1 in 5 transgender individuals experiences homelessness at some point in their life, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality.

Medicaid work requirement

The administration has approved waivers allowing eight states to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients, although legal challenges have blocked such efforts in Kentucky and Arkansas. The administration argues that the requirement will encourage people to join the workforce, but opponents say that instead it will deny low-income families much-needed medical aid. About 18,000 Arkansas residents lost their Medicaid coverage when the work requirements went into effect in that state last year.

Census citizenship question

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has proposed adding a question to the 2020 census asking whether an individual is a U.S. citizen. The administration says that it needs the information to help enforce the Voting Rights Act, but opponents believe that the real motive is to diminish minority representation. Civil rights groups argue that the question will discourage immigrant and noncitizen households from participating in the census. The result would be an undercount, especially in areas with large immigrant populations. Opponents of the change say low-income communities would be harmed because the census numbers are used to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal aid, including many safety net benefits. They've challenged the citizenship question in court. The case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, which is expected to rule in June.

"Oak Tree Given to Trump by French President Has Died, Official Says",https://www.nytimes.com,['Mihir Zaveri'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/trump-macron-friendship-tree.html,"It wasn’t long after the oak tree arrived on the South Lawn of the White House, a gift from a World War I battlefield in France, that it suddenly disappeared.

The oak, which was supposed to be a symbol of a longstanding French-American alliance, had been placed in quarantine, because it was a living thing imported to the United States, the French ambassador said. It would be replanted, he said.

But that didn’t happen. Now, more than a year later, it appears we know why.

The European sessile oak had died, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed.

“It’s not a tragedy,” Mr. Macron said in an interview in Geneva with the Swiss broadcaster RTS. “One shouldn’t see symbols where there are none.”"
"DHS chief reveals startling stat on asylum seekers who skip hearings, disappear",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-secretary-reveals-startling-stat-on-asylum-seekers-who-skip-hearings-disappear,"The acting Homeland Security secretary gave lawmakers a glimpse Tuesday into just how many asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the United States -- telling a Senate panel that a recent program found 90 percent miss their court dates.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan how many asylum seekers coming across the southern border show up for their hearings.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

“It depends on demographic, the court, but we see too many cases where people are not showing up,” he said, telling Graham that DHS recently conducted a pilot program with family units.

“Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent,” he said.

“90 percent did not show up?” Graham asked.

“Correct, that is a recent sample from families crossing the border,” McAleenan clarified.

McAleenan’s testimony also painted a grim portrait of a border crisis that shows no signs of easing, with Border Patrol overwhelmed and underfunded. The secretary described authorities as hamstrung by laws that limit how long they can keep migrants in custody.

“Currently due to a single district court order, we cannot obtain effective immigration enforcement results for the families arriving at our border -- they cannot be held for longer than 21 days and do not receive rulings from immigration courts for years,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it encountered 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a level not seen in decades, describing the situation as a “full-blown emergency.” McAleenan said that 60,000 children have entered into DHS custody in just the last 40 days.

McAleenan told lawmakers they also suffer due to “misaligned” asylum standards, meaning many of those who demonstrate “credible fear” of returning home -- the initial bar for claiming asylum -- are later judged not to have a valid asylum claim.

PELOSI HITS TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO, ACCUSES HIM OF 'THREATS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS'

He also said the restrictions on how long family units can be held mean that a child is now seen as a passport to the U.S. -- a perception he said is based in reality. He testified that only 30 percent of those coming to the border are actually trying to avoid being captured.

“Unless you’re a single adult, it is very unlikely you’ll be repatriated,” he said.

McAleenan urged Congress to act to end those loopholes and to grant requested DHS funding, and suggested that moves to make asylum seekers claim asylum in their home countries or designated third-countries could help solve the crisis.

Graham’s “Secure and Protect Act of 2019,” being discussed at the hearing, would include a provision to establish refugee processing centers in Mexico and Central America, and the senator asked the DHS chief if such an approach would work.

“First of all, it would break the back of the smuggling organizations, they’re profiting from this cycle.” McAleenan said. ""It would provide access to asylum in country in a much safer manner than taking this dangerous journey and it would stop this flow immediately.”

“I believe the vast majority [of the migrant flow] would stop,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that the administration bears some of the blame for the situation at the border, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointing to McAleenan's recent appointment as an example of dysfunction at the department.

“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department, we have before us an acting secretary who has been on the job for more than two months,"" he said. ""We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.”

McAleenan’s testimony comes amid continued negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico on immigration. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

An administration source told Fox News Tuesday that a new deal for Mexico becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers was completed, but not yet announced.

DOJ pushes back at Dem gloating over Mueller report deal: ‘This isn’t a blank check’,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jake Gibson', 'Jake Gibson Is A Producer Working At The Fox News Washington Bureau Who Covers Politics', 'Law Enforcement', 'Intelligence Issues.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-pushes-back-at-dem-gloating-over-mueller-report-deal-this-isnt-a-blank-check,"Justice Department officials are pushing back on the suggestion that a recently struck deal with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler will give Democrats unfettered access to documents pertaining to former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.

A source familiar with the negotiations told Fox News on Tuesday that while the agreement with Nadler, D-N.Y., would allow members of his committee to review certain underlying evidence associated with the Mueller report, he is not going to get access to “whatever documents he wants.”

NADLER PUTS BARR CONTEMPT PUSH ON HOLD AFTER STRIKING MUELLER REPORT DEAL

“This is not a blank check. They can’t just see whatever they want,” the source told Fox News. “They have to tell us what they want to see and then we will consider that legitimate request. This is just the start of a process.”

The source also told Fox News that when Nadler requests a document, the White House will have the ability to review the files to see if any White House equities are implicated. At that point, President Trump would have the opportunity to assert executive privilege in a bid to protect them from release.

The pushback comes after Nadler on Monday announced the deal with the Justice Department for documents and evidence related to Mueller’s inquiry on whether the president obstructed justice -- an agreement that prompted him to hit pause on efforts to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt, though his House colleagues are still pursuing contempt against Barr on two separate fronts this week.

Nadler in his statement described the document access as key, as fellow Democrats cast the deal as a win over the Trump administration.

“I am pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has agreed to begin complying with our committee’s subpoena by opening Robert Mueller’s most important files to us, providing us with key evidence that the Special Counsel used to assess whether the President and others obstructed justice or were engaged in misconduct,” Nadler said in his statement on Monday. “These documents will allow us to perform our constitutional duties and decide how to respond to the allegations laid out against the President by the Special Counsel.”

Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, went so far as to claim this was a DOJ ""capitulation"" and the department has begun to open up ""all"" the documents Democrats want to see.

The Justice Department agreed to give both Democrats and Republicans access to the files.

“Given our conversations with the Department, I will hold the criminal contempt process in abeyance for now,” Nadler said Monday. “We have agreed to allow the Department time to demonstrate compliance with this agreement. If the Department proceeds in good faith and we are able to obtain everything we need, then there will be no need to take further steps.”

Nadler did say, however, that if “important information is held back,” then the committee would have “no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies.”

HOUSE DEMS PLAN NEW WAVE OF RUSSIA HEARINGS AMID IMPEACHMENT CHATTER

Nadler’s announcement comes after the Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt last month, after the Justice Department did not comply with a subpoena seeking access to an unredacted version of Mueller’s Russia report, as well as underlying documents and evidence. President Trump also asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

However, at this stage House Democrats are still preparing to move forward on a separate contempt-related resolution to enforce subpoenas for Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn. The measure is scheduled for floor action on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Nadler’s committee, which would oversee any potential impeachment proceedings, has sought underlying evidence related to Mueller’s obstruction of justice inquiry for months.

Last month, in his only public appearance as special counsel, Mueller maintained that there was “not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” with regard to whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.

But Mueller left open the question of whether the president obstructed justice.

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”

Elizabeth Warren Demands DOJ Antitrust Chief Recuse Himself From Google and Apple Probes,https://gizmodo.com,"['Victoria Song', 'About The Author', 'Consumer Tech Reporter Day', 'Danger Noodle Night. No', ""I'M Not The K-Pop Star.""]",,,,https://gizmodo.com/elizabeth-warren-demands-doj-antitrust-chief-recuse-him-1835411938,"Photo: Getty Images

The U.S. Justice Department recently signaled it was exploring possible antitrust investigations into Google and Apple. Leading those investigations—assuming they actually happen—would be none other than Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, a former lobbyist that presidential hopeful and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says should recuse himself due to his history with both companies.

In a letter to Delrahim, Warren notes Google paid Delrahim about $100,000 in 2007 to lobby federal antitrust officials for the company’s acquisition of DoubleClick Inc, an online ad company. That gig paid off, as it eventually culminated in a $3.1 billion merger. As for Delrahim’s ties to Apple, Warren notes he also lobbied on behalf of the Cupertino giant regarding patent reforms. The letter further emphasizes that Delrahim worked as a corporate lobbyist until 2016, and counted Anthem, Pfizer, Qualcomm, and Caesars among his clients.

“Your past work as a lobbyist for two of the largest and most scrutinized tech companies in the world creates the appearance of conflict of interest,” writes Warren. “As the head of the antitrust division at the DOJ, you should not be supervising investigations into former clients who paid you tens of thousands of dollars to lobby the federal government.”

Warren also sent a similarly worded letter to DOJ ethics officials, urging Delrahim’s recusal. She also asked for a response from both Delrahim and the DOJ by June 14.

While Big Tech has been under greater overall scrutiny in Washington, it’s fair to say Warren deserves some of the credit for pushing the issue into the national political conversation. Back in March, the Democratic presidential candidate proposed a plan to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook at a rally in New York. On the issue of lobbying, Warren also introduced a bill in 2018 that would prohibit corporate lobbyists like Delrahim from taking government positions for six years.

Meanwhile, potential antitrust probes of the tech giants are gaining steam. While the DOJ has claimed jurisdiction over Apple and Google, the Federal Trade Commission called dibs on Facebook and Amazon. Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee announced it’s launching an all-out antitrust probe into the tech industry, and it’s holding its first hearing on the issue today."
Shanahan issues memos reinforcing 'apolitical nature' of military after McCain controversy,https://www.cnn.com,"['Barbara Starr', 'Zachary Cohen']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/shanahan-dod-apolitical-memo/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan issued two internal memos to all Department of Defense personnel, service members and civilian employees Tuesday calling on Pentagon leaders to ""reinforce the apolitical nature"" of the US military, according to copies obtained by CNN.

Shanahan's memos follow recent reporting that the White House Military Office coordinated directly with the Navy's Seventh Fleet to have the USS John S. McCain hidden from view during President Donald Trump's visit to Japan last month. After the news surfaced, Shanahan told reporters that request was ultimately not carried out.

""Those of us privileged to serve our Nation, in and out of uniform, in the DoD must be the epitome of American values and ethics. Our mission, to protect and defend the Nation, is apolitical,"" Shanahan wrote in one of Tuesday's memos.

""I call on leaders at all levels in the Department to reinforce the apolitical nature of military and civilian service and professionalism, while ensuring all personnel remain free to exercise the responsibilities of citizenship as laws and regulations allow,"" he added.

Following the USS John McCain controversy, Shanahan repeatedly insisted that ""there's no room for politicizing the military"" -- a point he again emphasized in Tuesday's memos to DoD personnel.

In an exclusive interview with ABC News Live, before a rare joint appearance on Capitol Hill, former EPA administrators William Reilly, Lee Thomas and Christine Whitman warned that recent gains in cleaner air and water in the U.S. are beginning to ""backslide.""

""If we continue business as usual, it's catastrophic,"" said Reilly, who led the agency under President George H.W. Bush. ""We're the number two emitter in the world after China.""

Whitman, a former New Jersey governor who ran the EPA under President George W. Bush, raised concerns about ""the disrespecting of science in the administration and the undermining of science and the importance of science.""

Thomas said his old boss, President Ronald Reagan, would have wanted the agency to recommit to its central purpose.

""Change the direction, change the management and go back to the mission of the agency. That's what I think President Reagan would say, 'That's not how I want this agency to operate,'"" Thomas said.

Three Republican former @EPA chiefs join me for an exclusive joint interview @ABCNewsLive on the state of the agency and our #climate. 3:30/5:30/6:30p ET https://t.co/t5KL0KMFpQ or @ABC on Hulu, Roku, Facebook, Apple TV pic.twitter.com/ioQg8e339q — Devin Dwyer (@devindwyer) June 11, 2019

The trio spoke with ABC News before a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing Tuesday on the direction of the EPA, which was created in 1970 by Republican President Richard Nixon to protect the human health and the environment. Former Obama administration EPA chief Gina McCarthy also testified.

Asked to grade the performance of the current EPA leadership, led by Administrator Andrew Wheeler, the three Republicans agreed on ""D"" or ""a little lower.""

""You need an agency that is credible, has consistency in its rule making and is science-based,"" said Thomas, who lamented a steady exodus of career employees from the EPA because of disillusionment with its current direction.

ABC News

When ABC News Live spoke with Wheeler earlier this year, he insisted that the agency remains focused on its core purpose but is balancing other economic priorities. He said he does not believe climate change is a ""hoax,"" as President Donald Trump has insisted, but also does not think it's the ""crisis"" many environmentalists make it out to be.

""That's an unfair characterization,"" said Reilly of Wheeler's position, noting that the agency's own National Climate Assessment has painted a dire picture of the situation.

""The Green New Deal did something really wonderful,"" he said. ""I am told by so many Republican members of Congress that they are never asked about climate when they go on the stump. And now, they're asked. That is marvelous. It's put it on the agenda.""

Whitman agreed.

""For the first time in my memory, an environmental issue is going to be a major part of a political campaign for the presidency,"" she said. ""I haven't seen that before, and it's not going to go away, and that's good.""

The Mid-Continent quarry has sat for decades in the hills of western Colorado, where kayakers paddle the Roaring Fork River and tourists soak in the natural hot springs. But now a proposed expansion of the 16-acre limestone mine has kicked off a battle that stretches to the office of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, whose former employer is lobbying for the project.

The mine's owner, Rocky Mountain Resources, is led by CEO Chad Brownstein, whose father chairs the major lobbying firm where Bernhardt worked for a decade. Bernhardt’s old firm is pushing the mining proposal on two fronts, according to interviews and POLITICO’s review of public records — pressing local government leaders to endorse the project, while meeting in D.C. with Interior staff who could decide the expansion’s fate.

Bernhardt promised nearly two years ago to recuse himself from decisions involving his former firm’s clients. But that ethics pledge expires in August, freeing him to work on those issues. An Interior spokesperson would only refer to that pledge when asked whether he’d recused himself from the mine's proposal, and declined to say what action he may take when the pledge expires.



The hilltop mine leases land owned by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management.

The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs, a community of 10,000 people whose outdoor tourist attractions include hot springs, whitewater rafting, fly fishing and scenic mountain trails. Residents worry that the expansion, which would allow the mine to spread across 440 acres, would bring a surge of truck traffic, dust and noise — as well as the scarring on the mountain ridge that would become visible from the town. And they say the mine is already violating its permits.

The dispute also follows months of questions from House Democrats and Interior’s internal watchdog about whether the department is taking actions that benefit Bernhardt’s former employer, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

“We’re acutely aware of Chad Brownstein and the relationship to David Bernhardt,” said Jeff Peterson, executive director of Glenwood Springs Citizens Alliance, a group formed to oppose the mine expansion. “It’s something unfortunately we can’t control. But there’s a real concern that this will get essentially rubber stamped and it doesn’t matter what it will do to our community.”

Glenwood Springs Mayor Jonathan Godes agreed.

“Our concern is that there is going to be one of the largest mines in Colorado directly abutting our city,” Godes said. “And when you have a former lobbyist for one of the largest legal lobbying firms in the extractive industry running DOI ... and Norm Brownstein the father of the CEO of Rocky Mountain Resources, it doesn't take a huge leap of faith to say something ain’t right here.”

Just the sheer lobbying firepower Rocky Mountain Resources is bringing to the project may be enough to pressure Interior employees, said Daniel Stevens, executive director at the watchdog group Campaign for Accountability.

Brownstein Hyatt “has a lot of pull, and when it asks Interior to jump, Interior jumps,” Daniels said. “Does every other small firm applying for a mining permit run to the top lobbying firm in the country to work on their behalf? Seems a little disproportionate here.”

RMR defended its corporate track record and its project, but the company and its executives did not respond to detailed questions about its lobbying efforts and ties to Bernhardt. Jon Hrobsky, one of the Brownstein lobbyists working on behalf of RMR, has known Bernhardt since they were both staffers for former Republican Colorado Rep. Scott McInnis and worked with him at Interior during the George W. Bush administration. Hrobsky and another Brownstein lobbyist, Luke Johnson, have both met with Interior officials to discuss ""natural resources"" on behalf of the company, according to the disclosure forms.

The Brownstein firm registered as lobbying for RMR as of April 30, according to its disclosure form. But two of its employees, Michael Stratton and Christine Jochim, have been assisting RMR since at least February, according to emails POLITICO received via public information requests. On April 5, Stratton sent a message to Glenwood Springs City Manager Debra Figueroa saying he was “hoping to make progress on behalf of RMR relative to making a presentation about their quarry proposal,” according to one of the emails.

Stratton and Jochim provided legal work for RMR but did not lobby before April 30, a Brownstein spokesperson said.



When asked if Bernhardt had recused himself from the matter, an Interior spokesperson referred to his ethics pledge.

Bernhardt also has personal ties to the area: He grew up in Rifle, Colo., about a half-an-hour drive from Glenwood Springs.

The mine has been in operation since 1982. Glenwood Springs residents who have spoken up at county board meetings overwhelmingly opposed the expansion and said the noise, traffic and sheer size of the project would all but destroy their tourism-based economy.

Garfield County inspectors earlier this year found a range of violations at the mine: It has spread outside its currently permitted acreage, is selling products it wasn’t permitted to and is operating during months it had promised the county it would shut down, the inspectors wrote in a report.

In interviews, residents said the BLM’s office has refused to respond to their complaints, forcing them to turn to the agency’s D.C. headquarters. But the bureau has allowed the mine to keep operating despite its violations.

“We issued a letter [to BLM] saying we don’t think RMR is compliance,” Peterson said. “We’ve heard absolutely nothing from the BLM. It’s been crickets on that front.”

RMR, a holding company based in Beverly Hills, Calif., acquired the Mid-Continent mine in October 2016. CEO Chad Brownstein's father is Norm Brownstein, who founded and still chairs Brownstein Hyatt, where Bernhardt spent most of his professional life.

The fight between the company and the community reached a new level of antipathy in May, when RMR sued the county board and its members. The lawsuit contends that the county agreement the board is trying to enforce should take a back seat to the company’s permit from BLM.

Records indicate that board members have reached out to Bernhardt directly: They called him on Sept. 17 and met with him in his D.C. office on March 5, according to Bernhardt’s official schedules. Neither of those conversations involved the Mid-Continent mine issue, according to an Interior spokesperson and others who attended the meeting, although an initial meeting request form said the commissioners had asked to speak to Bernhardt about topics including BLM.

The board members are unable to speak about the matter, a county spokesperson said after POLITICO tried to ask them questions about the mining permit. But a month after meeting with Bernhardt, the board heard county inspectors list the mine’s violations and gave Rocky Mountain Resources until June 1 to comply.

Bernhardt has already come under fire for making policy decisions that could benefit Brownstein clients. Interior’s inspector general is reviewing Bernhardt’s role in blocking a department report analyzing how a controversial pesticide affected federally protected wildlife, and examining whether he improperly pushed to remove a species of small fish from the endangered species list to benefit a former client.

The House Committee On Oversight and Reform and the National Archives and Records Administration are also probing whether Bernhardt is suppressing the release of his meeting schedules.

Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the government watchdog group Public Citizen, said Bernhardt should allay these concerns by continuing to recuse himself from matters involving his former firm even after his ethics pledge ends in two months.

“Unfortunately, as we have seen over and over again with Bernhardt, the conflicts of interest are so widespread that they keep popping up and Bernhardt seems unable to divorce himself effectively from his former clients and employers,” Holman said.

The Brownstein firm has been actively working on the ground in Colorado to promote the project. Stratton, one of the Brownstein lobbyists, has advised Chad Brownstein on the mine since RMR acquired it in 2016, an RMR spokesperson said. He attended at least one Monday night county board hearing and has met with city officials seeking to persuade them that expanding the mine is in the community’s interests, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.



“Mike Stratton has advised Chad Brownstein for over two decades on corporate matters,” the spokesperson said. “Mike and Chad have equal to that a close personal friendship since Chad was 21.”

He has also participated in meetings and conference calls in which BLM discussed the limestone mine with RMR, said David Boyd, a spokesperson for the bureaus Northwest Colorado District. Boyd said he was “not aware” whether Chad Brownstein was involved in any of the discussions.

Stratton also represents the American Petroleum Association, the country's largest petroleum trade association.



The other Brownstein lawyer, Jochim, has worked on the mine proposal since at least February, according to emails POLITICO obtained. Jochim, a former Nuclear Regulatory Commission attorney and former Justice Department law clerk, requested in April that the city hand over all communications pertaining to the mine, according to documents POLITICO obtained through Colorado public record access laws.

Stratton declined to answer questions, saying he was not the company spokesperson. Jochim did not respond to questions.





A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson did not answer questions about whether Chad Brownstein or anyone in his father’s lobbying firm has discussed the project with either Bernhardt or other senior Interior staff. Company executives declined requests for an interview.

Residents and city officials said they don’t recall having any complaints about the mine before RMR bought it. The site has become the focus of numerous complaints since the new owner took over, however.



The mine’s operations have crept well outside the 16 acres originally stipulated in its county agreement and BLM permit, according to a March memo by Garfield County inspectors. Inspectors also found that RMR had not been paying royalties to the bureau for all the materials it had been extracting and selling from the mine.

Residents also complained that RMR was operating the mine year-round, violating its agreement with the county to shut operations every December to April to minimize harm to wildlife.

David McConaughy, a Glenwood Springs attorney representing the company, told the county board at its April public meeting that BLM has approved RMR’s requests for exemptions to the seasonal shutdowns since 2016. But neither BLM nor the company alerted the county at the time, board members responded.

""We’re trying to be transparent with the county ... to reconcile conflicts in the various permits,” McConaughy said at the hearing.

McConaughy declined to speak to POLITICO, referring questions to RMR.

BLM returned Rocky Mountain Resources’ March expansion proposal to the company within the required 30-day review period, saying the plan didn’t contain enough information. The local BLM office is “currently determining how to address the existing mining operations as well as any future proposal,” the bureau’s Boyd said.

“As would typically be the case for controversial topics in a field office, the BLM Washington Office and DOI have been briefed on the potential expansion proposal for the Mid-Continent Quarry,” Boyd added.

A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson defended the company’s record, saying the violations of the county agreement stemmed from problems inherited from the previous owner. The company also said the expansion would diversify the economy of a town that depends on tourists arriving to hike and ski the nearby mountains.

“Currently, many Glenwood Springs’ employers are unable or unwilling to provide their employees adequate wages to afford the town’s high cost of living, including affordable housing for teachers and developing professionals,” the company said in a statement to POLITICO. “RMR believes a community should embrace opportunities to improve the lives of its constituents, not just those who can afford to influence local politics.”

Residents who spoke to POLITICO said RMR’s economic arguments ring hollow.

Besides expanding the mining pit area, RMR also proposed increasing truck traffic from around 20 round trips a day to as many as 450, according to a proposal it submitted to the BLM in March. The dramatic increase in traffic — plus the sight of the expanded mine in the hills above the town — would all but cripple Glenwood Springs’ tourist economy, said former Mayor Michael Gamba, a Republican civil engineer.

“We had lived harmoniously with that mine for the past 20-plus years,” Gamba said in an interview. “Had nothing changed, we would have had no objections to them having it. But the proposed expansion is an existential threat to our community.”"

Protesters want to fly ‘Baby Trump’ balloon during the president’s Fourth of July address in Washington,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Marissa J. Lang', 'Local Reporter Focused On D.C. Area News', 'June At Pm']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/protesters-want-to-fly-baby-trump-balloon-during-the-presidents-fourth-of-july-address-in-washington/2019/06/11/1a6d46b6-8bbe-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"When President Trump ascends the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to address the nation on Independence Day, a group of activists want him to see the scowling, splotchy face of a giant orange baby floating above the crowd.

The blimp known as “Baby Trump,” which has appeared at protests during the president’s visits to London, might be on its way to Washington for the July 4 festivities.

On Monday, activist group Code Pink became the first organization to request a protest permit from the National Park Service ahead of Trump’s planned overhaul of the city’s premier Fourth of July celebration. But organizers hope the screaming-baby balloon will be a sign of what’s to come that day: protests, and more of them.

The day will be busy as it is. More than a dozen other groups and individuals have requested space on the Mall that day — for activities that include making cards for troops, leading group meditations, selling books of poetry and preaching. They will join hundreds of thousands of Americans who annually head to the Mall to watch the fireworks.

District officials have expressed concern over how the president’s presence might affect visitors and the typically nonpartisan tenor of the celebration.

“It’s about the worst holiday he could have chosen,” D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) has said. “You never want to make events like this around a single person. This is the difference between the Soviet Union — the old Soviet Union — and the United States. Cults of personality are not how we operate in this country.”

Code Pink organizers said the decision to import the blimp originated around the time Trump announced he would hold a military parade in Washington last year. The parade was canceled amid questions about its impact and price tag, estimated to cost as much as $92 million.

Through online fundraising efforts that began in July 2018, Code Pink raised more than $10,000 to bring “Baby Trump” to the District.

[Perspective: A stain on the Lincoln Memorial]

“We’ve just switched our plans from the military parade to the Fourth of July,” Code Pink co-director Ariel Gold said. “We’re appalled that Trump is taking that day to spew his hateful and racist rhetoric . . . and we really hope this gets canceled, too.”

Code Pink is asking to fly “Baby Trump” over “any open grassy area nearest to [the] Lincoln Memorial,” according to a permit application filed with the Park Service. The group said it expects about 40 people — including its setup and teardown crews — to attend its protest.

The Park Service has permitted a protest-by-balloon before: In 2017, an inflatable 30-foot-tall chicken with a golden head of coifed hair meant to look like Trump’s was displayed on the Ellipse south of the White House.

No other protest organizers have requested a permit from the Park Service for July 4. Such requests are handled on a first-come, first-serve basis, Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst said.

The U.S. Secret Service has not released details about the timing and duration of the president’s speech.

The White House declined to comment about the blimp or the day’s activities on the Mall.

Trump announced his plans to speak July 4 in a February tweet promising one of the biggest gatherings in Washington history, with a “major fireworks display, entertainment and an address by your favorite President, me.”

[Trump takes over Fourth of July celebration, changing its location and inserting himself into the program]

The Washington Post reported last month that the president was deeply involved in organizing changes to the annual event, which draws large crowds to the Mall each year.

Calling the program “A Salute to America,” Trump plans to address the nation from the Lincoln Memorial and move the fireworks to West Potomac Park. Federal agencies, including the Park Service and U.S. Park Police, have said they are working with the White House to determine the logistics of the day.

Litterst likened piecing the day’s events together to playing a giant game of Tetris.

“As long as everyone’s flexible, we do our best to accommodate the requests we get,” he said.

This month, House Democratic leaders — including Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) — wrote a letter to Trump, decrying his decision to place himself at the center of the July 4 festivities as something that “could create the appearance of a televised, partisan campaign rally on the Mall at public expense.”

Code Pink’s primary goal, Gold said, is to fly the “Baby Trump” balloon close to where the president will speak.

“We see it as an image of Trump’s behavior, which is, as we all know, unpredictable and prone to tantrums about things that are really, really dangerous,” she said. “It’s a way of saying, we really need an adult in the White House.”

DOJ supports lawsuit demanding religious tuition payments,https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-supports-lawsuit-demanding-religious-tuition-payments,"The U.S. Department of Justice is backing three families who are suing to force the state of Maine to pay tuition for some students to attend religious high schools.

The ""Statement of Interest"" filed Monday supports a lawsuit that targets the state's longstanding tuition policy for students in districts that don't have a high school. In those cases, the state will pay for tuition to a private school, but not a religious school.

Over the years, state and federal courts have consistently upheld the Maine's exclusion of religious-backed private schools from the tuition program.

But the Department of Justice contends that the state has failed to justify its ""discrimination"" against religious schools, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case in which the Missouri Department of Natural Resources denied a grant to a church-affiliated preschool.

The DOJ filing reflects how the U.S. Supreme Court ""seems to be leaning our way on this issue,"" said Steven Whiting, an attorney who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of an Orthodox Jewish organization.

""The law has changed over time and now it's time for the court to look at this thing as a constitutional right. School choice shouldn't depend on whether you're religious or not,"" he said.

But Zachary Heiden from the ACLU of Maine said he didn't see many similarities with the Supreme Court case that dealt with state grants for a playground surface made from recycled rubber tires in Missouri.

""This is a case about whether the state is going to be required to fund religious school education, which I think is very different than shredded rubber tires,"" he said Tuesday.

Maine Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster and Christopher Taub wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling was intended to be interpreted narrowly, and that Maine's tuition system ""is fully constitutional.""

Three families in Glenburn and Palermo are suing in U.S. District Court to force the state to pay for their kids to attend Bangor Christian Schools and Temple Academy.

The lawsuit contends that denying religious schools, while allowing tuition payments for other private schools, violates the families' constitutional rights.

Maine's attorney general advised in 1980 that it's unconstitutional to use public funds to send students to schools ""characterized by a pervasively religious atmosphere."" Lawmakers enacted legislation in 1982 to prevent religious schools from receiving such tuition payments.

The U.S. Department of Justice has filed several similar actions around the country following an executive order promoting ""Free Speech and Religious Liberty"" by President Donald Trump. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions followed up with guidance for federal agencies in October 2017.

Last month, DOJ weighed in with support of students who are suing Vermont. The lawsuit targets the state's refusal to pay college tuition under a dual enrollment program for students attending religious high schools. The program helps students at public or secular private schools obtain college credits while attending high school.

Tree planted at White House by Presidents Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron dies,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tree-planted-white-house-presidents-donald-trump-emmanuel/story?id=63610906,"A tree that President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron planted at the White House last year -- a symbol of the two nations' long friendship -- has died.

The oak tree sapling, imported from France's Belleau Wood forest, was planted by the two presidents last year as a representation of the two nations' friendship.

The European Sessile Oak originated from the site in France where more than 9,000 U.S. Marines died in battle during World War I. It was planted on the South Lawn of the White House on April 23, 2018 during Macron's state visit, but mysteriously disappeared five days later.

A tweet by French ambassador to the U.S. Gérard Araud on April 29 indicated that the tree was not missing, but was quarantined. The mandatory quarantine is for any living organism imported to the U.S. The tree was to be replanted later.

The tree was never replanted and died in quarantine, a diplomatic source told Agence France-Presse.

Since the planting of the ""friendship tree"" the two leaders' relationship has grown rocky over issues including, what to do in Iran, addressing climate change and world trade."
Just One Tiny Industry May Emit More Methane Than EPA Had Estimated for All of Them,https://earther.gizmodo.com,"['Yessenia Funes', 'About The Author', 'I Mostly Write About How Environmental Policy', 'Climate Change Intersect With Race', 'Class Though I Occasionally Write About Animals', 'Science', 'Art', 'Too.

People tend to equate methane with cow farts (though their burps are worse), but we may be pointing our fingers in all the wrong places, according to a new study. The production of ammonia for fertilizer may result in up to 100 times more emissions than has been previously estimated for this sector. And that alone is more than what the Environmental Protection Agency estimates all industries emit across the U.S.

The study, published May 28 in the journal Elementa, zooms into the ammonia fertilizer industry because it relies heavily on natural gas to run its production plants. Ammonia is a compound made of nitrogen, which is used across the agriculture sector to fuel the growth of crops. While the ammonia fertilizer industry’s emissions of carbon dioxide are better understood, emissions of methane—which has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a century—were a huge question mark. Until now.

The team of authors from Cornell University and the Environmental Defense Fund had two sampling adventures in June 2015 and September 2016 that took them to six ammonia fertilizer plants in the Midwest, including Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. They used their findings to estimate industry-wide emissions throughout the U.S. The team found that the fertilizer industry results in 29 gigagrams of methane emissions a year. The EPA, however, reports this industry emitted only 0.2 gigagrams of methane a year between 2015 and 2016. As for all industries (like waste, chemical, and metals production), the EPA estimates 8 gigagrams, which is still much smaller than this single industry’s.

A worst case scenario—where other plants are consuming more natural gas than the ones analyzed—resulted in methane emissions that reached 139 gigagrams a year. For context, that’s equivalent to the carbon emissions from 669,314 passenger vehicles driven in a year. Or more than the carbon emitted from 3 billion pounds of coal burned. Best case scenario, the emissions are just 2 gigagrams of methane a year, which is still a lot more than what the EPA currently estimates for this industry.

That is pretty wild, but this is an estimate based only on six plants. They make up more than 25 percent of the 23 plants operating in 2016 and are also of varying sizes to represent the different facilities throughout the U.S., so the six are a pretty good sample. But the authors would like to examine more plants to be sure.

The researchers drove downwind from the facilities in a Google Street View car decked out with a killer methane analyzer that recorded the methane levels in the air. That way, the team was able to capture the methane emissions near the facility in the areas where wind was likely to push it. This poses some limitations, though, because not every plant had the best road access. The authors recommend looking at airborne measurements next time, too. The team looked at samples over just a few days in a single month over these two years. Capturing a longer timeline of data could further verify (or disprove!) their analysis.

Methane emissions feel especially relevant these days. The Trump administration has been attempting to roll back methane regulations since President Awful took office. (The Department of Energy actually called natural gas “freedom gas” the other day.) A coalition of states and environmental groups like the Sierra Club pressed a judge Friday to stop Trump from rolling back these protections, reports E&E News.

Methane isn’t just dangerous for our planet because it’s worsening climate change; its emissions are often coupled with particulate matter and other air pollutants that pose threats to the health of communities closest to the facilities where it’s being emitted.

Homeland Security watchdog retires early after his office was forced to retract ‘feel-good’ audits of disaster response,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'June At Pm']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-retires-early-after-his-office-was-forced-to-retract-feel-good-audits-of-disaster-response/2019/06/10/a370f488-8b9d-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"A house on Staten Island that was heavily damaged during Hurricane Sandy, shown in 2012. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)

John V. Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency’s performance after federal disasters.

Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief email Monday morning to hundreds of DHS employees and contractors.

“It has been an honor and privilege to serve the American citizens for over 40 years,” he wrote. “However, it is time for me to retire.”

Kelly, who had planned to retire after the confirmation of President Trump’s nominee for the position, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that he “accelerated my retirement because I feel it’s in the best interest of the organization and its employees.”

“As I told the staff, I have truly enjoyed my 11-year tenure with the DHS OIG, an organization with a very important mission and extraordinary staff and managers that successfully execute that mission on a daily basis,” Kelly wrote. “Nobody in DHS leadership or any member of Congress asked me retire.”

Kelly’s announcement follows The Post’s report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to various disasters.

When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed audits of FEMA’s disaster response]

The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.

Under pressure from House Republicans, the inspector general’s office retracted 13 faulty reports and purged them from its website in 2017 and 2018. Officials acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards.

The inspector general’s office then spent 14 months examining what occurred. Kelly was recused from the review.

Investigators found that Kelly had praised FEMA’s work ethic to his auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response

Kelly joined the inspector general’s office in 2008 from the Government Accountability Office, where his long career covered performance and financial audits and program evaluations at numerous federal agencies.

A graduate of the University of Scranton, he quickly rose through the ranks in the DHS inspector general’s office, which provides independent, fact-driven audits and investigations of the performance of the sprawling agency.

The flawed audits on his watch represented a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s oversight of FEMA. The internal review did not find that Kelly was influenced by a personal relationship with anyone at the emergency response agency.

However, Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, told the head of the internal review team that the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable” was “not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to hold itself to “the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.”

When the internal review was made public on May 23, Kelly sent his staff an email of apology, writing, “I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

The office has agreed to an outside review of its performance by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that it has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA.

Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office. His nomination has not yet been voted on by the Senate.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said that the situation underscored the need for Cuffari to be promptly confirmed. “Ensuring a department has an independent inspector general is vital to maintaining transparency and holding government agencies accountable,” Johnson said in a statement."
House Intelligence panel requests documents after reports WH blocked climate change testimony,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/house-intelligence-state-department-climate-change/index.html,"Washington (CNN) House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has requested documents from a State Department agency on the heels of reports that the White House blocked an official from submitting testimony on climate change.

Schiff, a California Democrat, said in a letter dated Tuesday to Ellen McCarthy, the assistant secretary for the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, that his committee was left with ""deep concern"" that the Trump administration recently sought to bar the submission of written testimony from Rod Schoonover ""for political reasons."" Schoonover, an analyst with the State Department agency, testified before the House panel last week.

The Washington Post, citing several administration sources, reported that officials from several different White House offices took issue with Schoonover's prepared testimony in which he was going to warn Congress about wide-ranging and ""possibly catastrophic"" national security concerns as a result of human-caused climate change.

In his letter, Schiff said the administration ""repeatedly confirmed"" ahead of the June 5 hearing that Schoonover would submit written testimony, but that the evening before the hearing, the State Department informed the committee ""without explanation"" that the agency would not submit a written statement.

He said the House Intelligence Committee, ""in light of these reports of undue White House interference in testimony before the Committee,"" now requests testimony from McCarthy or ""an appropriate senior representative"" to address: Schoonover's testimony; communications with the White House about that written testimony; the prepared written testimony itself; and other documents relevant to the hearing and blocked testimony.

Dean, the ex-White House counsel in President Richard Nixon's administration, was convicted of obstruction of justice after striking a deal to cooperate with the Watergate investigation. He has spent decades critical of the GOP and wrote a book in 2004 accusing President George H.W. Bush of acts “worse than Watergate.”

He frequently appears on CNN as a paid contributor, in which he's usually criticizing Trump.

Democrats invited him to serve as their lead witness in a hearing meant to scrutinize the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian collusion with the 2016 Trump campaign.

But Republicans ridiculed his appearance.

“You are functionally here as a prop because they can’t impeach the president,” Gaetz said, referring to the public polling against impeachment and resistance from Speaker Nancy Pelosi to allow an impeachment inquiry.

Dean declined to tell Gaetz how much money he has earned through his GOP criticisms in books and on television. Dean said he didn’t know.

“It’s not by choice I’ve done a lot of this,” Dean said. “I’ve been dragged into this.”

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats praised Dean as a key figure in helping the Watergate prosecutors and whose testimony was deemed truthful.

And Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., recalled his father, left-wing social critic Marcus Raskin, being placed on Nixon’s enemies list. Rep. Raskin on Monday called Dean “a man of honor, a man of integrity, and a man who stands up to the truth.”

But Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., pointed out 19 discrepancies were discovered in Dean’s statements back during the Watergate investigation.

Democrats called on Dean to use his Watergate past to assess Trump’s actions to obstruct the Mueller investigation.

Nadler introduced Dean without mentioning either his criminal conviction or that his law license was revoked.

“He is most well known as a principal witness during the Senate Watergate hearing,” Nadler said. “Where his testimony was later fully corroborated as to its truthfulness by the revelations in President Nixon’s White House tapes.”

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, read through a litany of negative comments Dean has made about Trump, including one in which he describes discussing Trump’s impeachment with Pelosi, D-Calif.

Biggs called Dean a convicted felon offering “conjecture and legal posturing,” offering dubious testimony.

“You are not the fall guy in the Watergate scandal,” Biggs told Dean. “The FBI referred to you as the master manipulator of the cover-up. The U.S. attorney’s office said you were at the center of the criminality.”

Biggs called the hearing a farce.

“So much of what you say seems very difficult to accept at face value quite frankly,” Biggs said."

DOJ investigating 'non-governmental organizations and individuals' as part of 'broad' probe into surveillance abuses,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/durham-investigating-non-governmental-organizations-and-individuals-potentially-including-fusion-gps,"As part of its ongoing ""multifaceted"" and ""broad"" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several ""non-governmental organizations and individuals.""

Additionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, let by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, was looking into the involvement of ""foreign intelligence services."" Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.

The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation. The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

Fusion GPS, in turn, hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to produce an unverified and largely discredited dossier that the FBI went on to cite in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

CARTER PAGE: FBI INFORMANT 'INTENSIFIED' COMMUNICATIONS JUST BEFORE FISA WARRANT OBTAINED

Last week, reports indicated Steele had agreed to talk with Durham if certain preconditions were met. Multiple sources familiar with the matter told Fox News, meanwhile, that Durham is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions."" Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham in Washington, D.C.

Numerous problems with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several issues that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report made plain, for example, that then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

FMR TRUMP AIDE ALLEGES BOMBSHELL INFORMANT TRIED TO 'SEDUCE' HIM IN 'BIZARRE' EPISODE FOR RUSSIA DIRT ON TRUMP

North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News on Sunday he has seen ""additional documents"" that demonstrate that “prior to the first FISA application, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, and others at the FBI knew that Christopher Steele's dossier was not credible.” Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News in March showed FBI brass scrambling to respond to a concern from a senior DOJ official about the potential ""bias"" of a key FISA source.

Meadows, speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" pointed specifically to a report from The Hill's John Solomon, who found that Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in Mueller's report, was actually a U.S. informant. In his report, Mueller linked Kilimnik to Russian intelligence, and did not mention Kilimnik's secretive ties to the U.S. in the report other court filings -- even as Mueller suggested former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Kilimnik were nefarious.

""The deeper the dive we take into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions, and actually some of the facts they put forth in there, are a misrepresentation of what we actually know,"" Meadows said.

Meadows added that he expected DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into potential FBI and DOJ surveillance misconduct to come out later than June, when it was originally expected. Meadows said more information has come to light that might necessitate the delay.

Solomon, reporting for the Hill, also recently unearthed a documented conversation Steele had with a State Department contact -- which were relayed to the FBI -- in which Steele claimed the Russians were running a “technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election"" and that ""payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.""

There is no Russian consulate in Miami, a fact the State Department official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec, emphasized in her notes. Additionally, Steele had suggested his client was ""keen"" to see his information come to light prior to Election Day. Kavalec forwarded her notes to the FBI and other government officials several days before the FISA warrant was issued for Page. Fox News has confirmed The Hill's reporting.

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' MICHAEL FLYNN

Further, in its original FISA application and subequent renewals, the FBI told the FISA court that it ""did not believe"" Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion. Instead, the FBI suggested to the court, the September 2016 article by Michael Isikoff was independent corroboration of the dossier.

But London court records show that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.

Carter Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing, even though the FBI called him an ""agent of a foreign power"" in its October 2016 FISA application. On Sunday, Page told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that his actions had been ""completely spun in the fake Mueller"" report to help advance what he characterized as Democrats' ""ridiculous"" goal of impeachment.

Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447713-trump-appoints-social-security-administration-watchdog-to-also,"President Trump Donald John TrumpTop Armed Services Republican plots push for 0B defense budget Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance MORE has quietly appointed his Social Security Administration (SSA) inspector general to also oversee a much different agency: the Interior Department.

On May 28, Gail Ennis began her second job overseeing the Interior Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a role she will keep for the foreseeable future, the OIG confirmed to The Hill.

The Trump administration is still awaiting the confirmation of Mark Greenblatt, the former assistant inspector general for investigations at the Commerce Department, to formally head the Interior’s OIG office.

Ennis was sworn into the SSA role just five months ago, her first time serving as an inspector general. Her professional background is in securities litigation, working previously as a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm WilmerHale, where she reportedly earned $2 million a year.

At the SSA, Ennis has most recently led efforts to thwart scam Social Security phone calls, at the Interior department she will oversee investigations into Interior’s newly appointed Secretary David Bernhardt's lobbying ties and two ongoing Justice Department investigations into former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior MORE. One of those investigations has reportedly made it to the grand jury.

The appointment of Ennis to Interior was not formally announced by the White House, however, the Interior Department’s website was updated last week to reflect her new position.

Ennis replaces former acting Inspector General Mary Kendall, who retired from the office at the end of May. Kendall oversaw multiple ethics investigations into Zinke, including recommending a number of them to the Justice Department for further investigation. Those investigations reportedly played a heavy factor in Zinke’s decision to leave the administration early this year.

Ennis is the second Trump political appointee whom the administration has attempted to put in the Interior OIG role.

Earlier this year, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonTrump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior Ben Carson decries 'gotcha' politics: 'Give me a break' MORE announced to staff that Assistant HUD Secretary Suzanne Israel Tufts would replace Kendall. Because Tufts had been previously confirmed by the Senate, she would not have to go through another confirmation process for the role.

However, following backlash to that announcement, the Interior Department later said the announcement was a misunderstanding and Carson reversed the move. Tufts resigned not long after.

“On May 28th, Social Security [Inspector General] Gail S. Ennis started at [Department of Interior] OIG as Acting Inspector General. Continuing with her responsibilities as SSA IG, Ms. Ennis will also lead our organization while Mark Greenblatt’s nomination continues to progress in the Senate,” an OIG spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

The White House referred comment to the Interior OIG. The Interior Department did not return a request for comment.

In addition to the ongoing investigations into Interior's current and former secretaries, the OIG is also investigating six high-ranking interior officials for ethics concerns.

Wilmer Hale, the law firm where Ennis previously worked as a partner, lobbies for a number of clients with business before Interior. For example, the law firm represents Twin Metals a Minnesota based mineral mining company that is lobbing to build a hotly debated copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In May, the Trump administration moved to renew one of the mine's mineral leases, reversing a decision from the Obama administration.

Ennis, who was not a registered lobbyist, said the Interior OIG ethics office is currently reviewing her former clients.

""DOI OIG General Counsel is conducting a thorough ethics review that will ensure that I do not participate in any matter that would create a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Ennis told the Hill in a statement.

U.S. refiner group sues Trump EPA over high-ethanol gasoline,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ethanol-lawsuit/u-s-refiner-group-sues-trump-epa-over-high-ethanol-gasoline-idUSKCN1TB2HP,"FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sign is seen on the podium at EPA headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ting Shen

(Reuters) - The main U.S. refining industry association said on Monday it sued to block the Trump administration’s effort to expand sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, arguing the move exceeded the administration’s authority.

The legal challenge from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) association escalated a battle between the oil and corn industries over the nation’s biofuel policy, which requires refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their gasoline, often at great expense.

President Donald Trump had directed the Environmental Protection Agency to lift a summertime ban on the sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, called E15, in an effort to help farmers suffering from the U.S. trade war with China. The EPA unveiled its rule doing so on May 31.

The summertime E15 ban had been implemented during the Obama administration to reduce smog emissions, but Trump’s EPA said E15’s impact on air quality was similar to that of E10, which could already be sold year-round.

The tension over the policy move reflects how Trump has struggled to please both Big Oil and Big Agriculture, two critical constituencies in the Republican president’s 2020 re-election bid.

AFPM asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the EPA’s rule, in papers filed on Monday, said Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for the group.

AFPM has one month to provide the court with the outline of its case, she said."

A Florida strawberry farm has agreed to pay civil penalties and back pay to qualified U.S. workers to settle a claim it discriminated against American workers by employing temporary visa workers, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Tuesday.

The settlement is the seventh achieved through its “Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative,” DOJ explains in a press release detailing the agreement:

“The Department of Justice today announced that it has reached a settlement agreement with Sam Williamson Farms Inc. (SWF), a strawberry farm in Dover, Florida. The settlement resolves the Department’s investigation into whether SWF violated the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by preferring to hire H-2A visa holders to harvest its strawberry crop instead of U.S. workers. This is the seventh settlement under the Civil Rights Division’s Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative, which is aimed at targeting, investigating, and taking enforcement actions against companies that discriminate against U.S. workers in favor of temporary visa workers.

“The Department of Justice’s independent investigation concluded that at the end of the 2016-2017 strawberry picking season, SWF informed its existing U.S. workers that it would rely instead on H-2A workers from a farm labor contractor to harvest its strawberries for the next season, and retained a farm labor contractor for the express purpose of obtaining workers with H-2A visas. Ultimately, the strawberry picking positions were filled by more than 300 H-2A workers and no U.S. workers.

“Refusing to recruit or hire available and qualified U.S. workers because of their citizenship status violates the INA.”

US Treasury yields continue rebound as global trade concerns ease,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/11/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-data-auctions.html,"U.S. government debt yields added to a recent rebound on Tuesday as fears over global trade tensions paused and investors looked toward riskier assets.

At around 1:25 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.145% while the yield on the 2-year note climbed to 1.926%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

The recent uptick in yields comes after President Donald Trump said 5% levies all Mexican imports into the U.S. would be suspended indefinitely. He added he had ""full confidence"" in Mexico's ability to crack down on immigration from Central America.

Wall Street also got a lift from increasing expectations of lower rates from the Fed.

Though market participants grew concerned over a deteriorating economic outlook throughout the month of May amid renewed trade barbs between the U.S. and its economic partners, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disputed that interpretation in an interview with CNBC on Monday.

Mnuchin said falling bond yields, rather than warning of a recession, should be viewed as a sign that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates over the coming months. Bond yields fell to 20-month lows last week after government data showed U.S. job creation slowed more than expected in May.

Investor expectations of a June rate cut from the Fed rose last week to 27.5%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. The market gives a 79% chance of a Fed rate cut in July.

The Labor Department said in a report Tuesday that business prices inched higher in May, the latest data to suggest anemic inflation in the United States. The producer-price index, a gauge of prices businesses receive for their goods, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in May from a month earlier.

Barring the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI rose 0.2% as expected.

The Treasury Department auctioned $38 billion in 3-year notes at a high yield of 1.861%. The bid-to-cover ratio, an indicator of demand, was 2.62. Indirect bidders, which include major central banks, were awarded 56.6%. Direct bidders, which includes domestic money managers, bought 13.4%.

'Dangerous Proposal': USDA Seeking to Replace Government Inspectors at Beef Slaughter Plants With Private Employees,https://www.ecowatch.com,"['Common Dreams', 'Jordan Davidson', 'Yes', 'The Revelator', 'Olivia Rosane']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.ecowatch.com/usda-inspectors-deregulation-2638771530.html,"By Julia Conley

In an apparent effort to boost profits for meat manufacturers despite potential harms to food safety, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reportedly planning to privatize inspections of beef slaughter plants.

""This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors,"" Food and Water Watch said in a statement.

The group released an application from beef, pork, and poultry manufacturer Tyson Foods, in which the company requested a waiver to allow Tyson employees to conduct more inspections at its beef plant in Holcolm, Kansas, instead of relying on USDA food safety inspectors.

Food and Water Watch reported Monday that the USDA is pursuing deregulation of the food inspection system that has been used for years at beef slaughterhouses. The information came from documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.

BREAKING: We have obtained documents that confirm the USDA is seeking to privatize inspections of beef slaughterhouses. This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors. https://t.co/jNospAvLYn pic.twitter.com/cbx4fo6lHy

The documents were uncovered after many recent denials by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) that it plans to privatize inspections of mass-produced beef, Food and Water Watch stated.

Tyson's proposal comes 21 years after FSIS first launched a pilot program in more than two dozen poultry and pork plants in which government food safety inspectors were replaced by the manufacturers' own inspectors, allowing the companies to regulate themselves.

In 2013, the USDA's inspector general found that the agency ""did not critically assess whether the new inspection process had measurably improved food safety at each plant"" that produced pork.

The following year, FSIS expanded the program to the entire poultry industry. The agency will not conduct an assessment of the new system's effects on food safety until 2022.

""The previous attempts at privatized inspection have led to weaker food safety performance and are a ploy by the industry to increase line speeds,"" said Tony Corbo, a senior lobbyist with Food and Water Watch.

Despite a lack of evidence that the privatized food safety inspection system is making food safer — and CDC data showing that foodborne illnesses from foods including chicken have been on the rise since 2015 — FSIS is weakening standards in order to increase the speed with which meat is processed, allowing for greater manufacturing profits.

""The Tyson plant in Holcomb, Kansas is approved to operate at the current maximum line speed allowable"" said Corbo. ""FSIS management has had difficulty meeting its inspection staffing requirements in the past in western Kansas, which has contributed to beef slaughter plants not being able to maintain maximum line speeds. Tyson's solution seems to be to get rid of the government inspectors."""

Thompson criticized CBP and the Department of Homeland Security in general for allowing the data breach to occur, saying in a statement that the privacy of Americans can’t be compromised.

“Government use of biometric and personal identifiable information can be valuable tools only if utilized properly,” Thompson said. “Unfortunately, this is the second major privacy breach at DHS this year.

VA owes $190 million to disabled veterans improperly charged home loan fees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Robert Gearty'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-owes-190-million-to-disabled-veterans-improperly-charged-home-loan-fees,"The Department of Veterans Affairs owes about $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who were charged home loan fees they were exempt from having to pay, an investigation has found.

These veterans were charged the fees under the VA’s Home Loan Guaranty Program and now may be entitled to refunds ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, a VA Inspector General audit released Thursday found.

VA loan managers knew disabled vets were being charged the fees improperly since 2014 but never did anything about it, VA IG auditors determined.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior (Veterans Benefits Administration) management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the IG report says.

DOZENS OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASK BETSY DEVOS TO FORGIVE DISABLED VETS STUDENTS LOANS

The loan managers told the IG they were focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications, USA Today reported.

The report faulted the Veterans Benefits Administration for placing the burden on a disabled vet to submit a claim for a refund.

The VA announced last month that it was notifying veterans when they buy homes through the Home Loan program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled, the paper reported.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” the announcement quoted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as saying.

The Veterans Benefits Administration told the IG that it would identify exempt veterans who paid the fees and issue them refunds and that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, The Washington Post reported.

Auditors looked at the period 2012 to 2017.



They determined nearly $300 million in home loan origination fees had been collected from 73,000 exempt disabled vets during that time.

WASDE: Corn Production Trimmed by 1.4 Billion Bushels,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/wasde-corn-production-trimmed-by-14-billion-bushels/,"WASDE - 589

WHEAT: U.S. 2019/20 wheat supplies are down with lower beginning stocks partly offset by slightly higher production. Beginning stocks are down 25 million bushels on increased 2018/19 exports. Winter wheat production is forecast up 6 million bushels to 1,274 million with an increase to Hard Red Winter more than offsetting decreases for Soft Red Winter and White Winter. Total wheat production is now forecast at 1,903 million bushels, up 5.8 million bushels from the May forecast. Exports for 2019/20 are unchanged at 900 million bushels but feed and residual use is raised 50 million bushels to 140 million on reduced projected corn supplies. Ending stocks are lowered 69 million bushels to 1,072 million, and the season-average farm price is raised $0.40 per bushel to $5.10. The price increase reflects sharply higher wheat futures prices and reduced 2019/20 corn supplies.

World 2019/20 wheat supplies are raised 4.9 million tons on a 1.6-million-ton increase in beginning stocks and a 3.3-million-ton increase in global production. India’s wheat crop is raised 1.2 million tons on updated government data. Production in Russia and Ukraine are each raised 1.0 million tons reflecting favorable weather to date. Projected 2019/20 global trade is expanded 0.8 million tons with a 1.0-million-ton increase for Russia and a 0.5-million-ton increase for Ukraine, both due to larger crops. Russian exports are now projected at 37.0 million tons and Ukraine exports are projected at a record 19.5 million. Partly offsetting is a 0.5-million-ton decrease for EU exports with greater competition from Black Sea origins. Projected 2019/20 world consumption is raised 3.6 million tons on both higher food and feed and residual use. With supplies rising more than use, ending stocks are projected up 1.3 million tons to a record 294.3 million.

COARSE GRAINS: This month’s 2019/20 U.S. corn outlook is for increased beginning stocks and imports, sharply lower production, reduced feed and residual use and exports, and smaller ending stocks. Beginning stocks are up reflecting a 100-million-bushel decline in projected exports for 2018/19 to 2.2 billion bushels, based on current outstanding sales and reduced U.S. price competitiveness. Corn production for 2019/20 is forecast to decline 1.4 billion bushels to 13.7 billion, which if realized would be the lowest since 2015/16. Unprecedented planting delays observed through early June are expected to prevent some plantings and reduce yield prospects. USDA will release its Acreage report on June 28, which will provide survey-based indications of planted and harvested area. With sharply lower supplies, use is projected to decline 425 million bushels to 14.3 billion, based on reductions to feed and residual use and exports. With supplies falling more than use, ending stocks are projected to decline 810 million bushels to 1.7 billion, which if realized would be the lowest since 2013/14. The season-average farm price is raised 50 cents to $3.80 per bushel.

This month’s 2019/20 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, increased trade and lower stocks relative to last month. Argentina corn production is raised on increased area with higher prices. Canada corn production is lowered on reductions to both area and yield with planting delays in Ontario. Russia corn production is higher based on government data indicating larger-than-expected planted area. Barley production is lowered for the EU reflecting a reduction for Spain. For 2018/19, Brazil corn production is raised based on the latest government statistics.

Major global trade changes for 2019/20 include larger forecast corn exports for Argentina and Russia, with a partly offsetting reduction for Zambia. For 2018/19, exports are raised for Brazil and Argentina for the local marketing year beginning in March 2019 based on higher-than-expected shipments during May. Foreign corn ending stocks are lowered from last month mostly reflecting reductions for Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and the EU.

RICE: The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice this month is for lower supplies, reduced domestic use and exports, and lower ending stocks. Projected U.S. all rice production is lowered 20.1 million cwt or 9 percent to 198.1 million with all of the decrease in long-grain, primarily on a reduction in planted area. The excessive spring precipitation in the Delta is expected to result in lower rice area in this region compared to the NASS Prospective Plantings intended acreage, issued March 29. Partially offsetting the smaller production are higher projected imports, which are raised by 1.2 million cwt to a record large 29.2 million with increases for both long-grain and medium- and short-grain. All rice projected domestic and residual use is lowered 7.0 million cwt to 133.0 million, mainly the result of reduced long-grain supplies. Projected all rice exports are reduced 1.0 million cwt to 100.0 million. The reduction in long-grain exports on higher projected prices is partially offset by increased medium- and short-grain exports as a portion of outstanding sales from the 2018/19 market year are expected to be shifted to 2019/20. Projected 2019/20 all rice ending stocks are lowered 7.2 million cwt to 51.6 million with long-grain accounting for all of the reduction. The projected 2019/20 all rice season-average farm price (SAFP) is raised by $0.50 per cwt to $11.70 with increases in the projected SAFPs of all rice classes this month.

Global 2019/20 rice supplies are decreased by 0.5 million tons to 667.8 million as higher carryin stocks are more than offset by lower production. Global production is down as reductions for the United States, North Korea, and Thailand are not completely offset by higher projected production for Madagascar, Egypt, and the EU. World 2019/20 consumption is lowered fractionally to 496.0 million tons on reduced expected use in China, North Korea, and the United States more than offsetting higher use in Madagascar, Bangladesh, Burma, and Egypt. Global 2019/20 trade is lowered 0.4 million tons to 47.2 million as reduced exports by India, Burma, and the United States are not completely offset by higher exports by China. Projected world ending stocks are adjusted lower this month to 171.9 million tons but remain record large.

OILSEEDS: This month’s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2019/20 include higher beginning and ending stocks. Beginning stocks are raised reflecting a 75-million-bushel reduction in projected exports for 2018/19 based on lower-than-expected shipments in May and a lower import forecast for China. Although adverse weather has significantly slowed soybean planting progress this year, area and production forecasts are unchanged with several weeks remaining in the planting season. With soybean use unchanged, 2019/20 ending stocks are projected at 1,045 million bushels, down 25 million from the revised 2018/19 projection. Other changes for 2018/19 include increased soybean meal imports and exports, reduced soybean oil used for biodiesel production, and higher soybean oil ending stocks.

The 2019/20 season-average price for soybeans is forecast at $8.25 per bushel, up 15 cents reflecting the impact of higher corn prices. Soybean meal prices are forecast at $295 per short ton, up 5 dollars. The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 29.5 cents per pound.

The 2019/20 global soybean supply and use projections include lower production and stocks compared to last month. Global production is down 0.3 million tons to 355.4 million due to lower crops for Ukraine and Zambia. The 2019/20 soybean ending stocks are lowered 0.4 million tons mainly reflecting lower carryin due to revisions to 2018/19 balance sheets. Beginning stocks for 2019/20 are reduced for Argentina and China offsetting higher stocks for the United States. For Argentina, stocks are lowered on a 1.5-million-ton increase to exports to 7.8 million for 2018/19 based on the recent pace of shipments. Beginning stocks are lowered for China due to a 1-million-ton decrease to imports to 85 million for 2018/19.

SUGAR: U.S. sugarbeet production for 2019/20 is projected at 33.916 million tons, up 1 percent from last month. Overall planting progress in the United States advanced beyond the pace indicated last month to move the yield forecast to 30.8 tons/acre, up from 30.5. Based on average levels of beet pile shrink and slicing recovery, beet sugar production from this crop is projected at 4.992 million short tons, raw value (STRV) with production occurring in August and September at 511,111. This results in fiscal 2018/19 beet sugar production at 4.920 million STRV, a gain of 9,509 STRV. This increase is largely offset by lower 2018/19 Florida cane sugar production reported by processors. High-tier tariff imports for 2018/19 are increased by 20,000 STRV to 90,000 based on the pace of entries to date. These supply changes result in ending stocks for 2018/19 residually increasing to 1.526 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.40 percent, up marginally over last month.

Beet sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 5.154 million STRV based on the larger sugarbeet crop. This increase is partially offset by lower cane sugar production in Texas due to weather-related area reductions for the 2019/20 crop as reported by the processor. With no changes to imports or use, the combination of higher beginning stocks of 20,469 STRV and a net production increase of 23,457 STRV implies ending stocks of 1.528 million and a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.37 percent.

Mexico sugar production for 2018/19 is estimated at 6.400 million metric tons (MT) based on CONADESUCA-estimated area of 796,770 hectares (ha) and USDA estimates of yield at 71.08 MT/ha and sucrose recovery of 11.30 percent. Mexico sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 6.183 million MT assuming the same area as in 2018/19 and 5-year averages of sugarcane yield and sucrose recovery. With no other changes, the changes to production result in exports to non-U.S. destinations of 1.386 million MT in 2018/19 and 263,100 MT in 2019/20, based on CONADESUCA targets for ending stocks.

LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY: The forecast for 2019 red meat and poultry production is reduced from last month as lower forecast beef, pork, and turkey production more than offset higher broiler production. The decline in beef production largely reflects lower steer and heifer slaughter in the second half of the year. Forecast pork production is lowered from last month primarily as the pace of slaughter to date has been slower than expected. The broiler production forecast is raised on recent hatchery data and expected heavier bird weights. Turkey production is lowered slightly on production data to date.

The 2020 red meat and poultry production forecast is lowered from the previous month. Production growth for livestock and poultry is expected to be slower as producers respond to higher feed costs. The beef production forecast is reduced on lower expected steer and heifer slaughter as incentives to add weight on pasture slows the pace of feedlot placements.

The beef import forecast is raised for 2019 on recent trade data, but the export forecast is reduced from the previous month on the current pace of beef exports to a number of trading partners. No change is made to the 2020 beef trade forecasts. Pork export forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are raised from the previous month, largely reflecting the removal of Mexico’s tariffs on U.S. pork products in late May. The 2019 broiler export forecast is reduced slightly on recent trade data; no change is made to the 2020 broiler export forecast. The turkey export forecast is unchanged for 2019 and 2020.

For 2019, the cattle, hog, and broiler price forecasts are reduced from last month, reflecting current price weakness. The 2019 turkey price forecast is raised slightly on higher second-quarter prices. For 2020, cattle, broiler, and egg price forecasts are reduced on continued demand weakness. The 2020 hog price forecast remains unchanged as slower production growth and stronger exports support prices. The 2020 turkey price forecast is unchanged.

Milk production for 2019 is lowered from last month on slower-than-anticipated growth in milk per cow and lower expected cow numbers. The 2020 milk production forecast is reduced from last month as higher expected feed costs are expected to weaken producer margins, limiting growth in the dairy cow herd and milk per cow next year.

The 2019 and 2020 fat basis import forecasts are unchanged from the previous month. The 2019 fat basis export forecast is reduced from the previous month, as gains in cheese exports due to the elimination of tariffs by Mexico only partly offset weakness in butterfat exports to other markets. The 2020 fat basis export forecast is unchanged. The skim-solids basis import forecast for 2019 is raised from last month on increased imports of milk protein products while the 2020 skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged. The skim-solids basis export forecast for 2019 is reduced on current weakness in exports of nonfat dry milk (NDM), while exports of lactose are expected to be constrained by the additional tariffs imposed by China. The 2020 skim-solids basis export forecast is lowered on continued weakness in sales of lactose.

The 2019 cheese and whey price forecasts are reduced from the previous month while NDM and butter price forecasts are raised. For 2020, cheese and butter price forecasts are raised from the previous month, while NDM is unchanged. The whey price forecast is fractionally lower for 2020. The 2019 Class III price is reduced on lower cheese and whey price forecasts and the Class IV price forecast is raised on higher forecast butter and NDM prices. Class III and Class IV prices are raised in 2020. The all milk price forecast is reduced to $18.00 per cwt for 2019 but is raised to $18.90 per cwt for 2020.

COTTON: The 2019/20 U.S. cotton supply and demand projections are unchanged from last month, with the exception of a 1-cent decline in the season-average upland farm price, to 64 cents per pound. The 2018/19 U.S. cotton balance sheet is unchanged."

"EPA cuts 40 regulations, saves $3.6B, seeks balance on costs",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/epa-cuts-40-regulations-saves-3-6-billion-seeks-balance-on-costs,"Aiming to erase the “fuzzy math” past administrations used to hide the costs of politically favored policies, the Environmental Protection Agency is pulling back the curtain on costs and benefits, and planning to kill regulations that are out of whack.

“It hopefully will take away some of the fuzzy math that administrations have done in the past on justifying regulations,” said EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler of his new policy.

And, he added, it will set a new bottom-line for all regulations in the rules heavy agency. “If the costs are too high we should change the regulatory approach. We shouldn’t be having regulations that cost more than the benefits they provide,” he said in an interview.

With the new rules will come unusual transparency and a pledge to make public the costs and benefits of regulations coming out of the environmental agency.

“It will provide more confidence in the regulatory process,” said Wheeler.

And, he added, “Hopefully there will be fewer people upset with EPA, upset with the federal government.”

The new effort in Wheeler’s policy memo, titled “Increasing Consistency and Transparency in Considering Benefits and Costs in the Rulemaking Process,” is aimed at opening the door to the secretive regulation process and ending suspicions that politics drives policy.

“I really do hope it depoliticizes it,” said Wheeler.

President Trump campaigned on a promise to cut two Obama-era regulations for every new one he proposes. The EPA has led that effort, cutting far more than 2-1 for a total savings to taxpayers of $3.6 billion, Wheeler said. Since Trump came into office, the EPA has cut 40 major regulations and plans to axe another 49, he said.

“We are definitely at the top” of regulation killers, he added.

The new memo to assistant administrators said that regulations on the Clean Air Act will come under scrutiny first.

While Wheeler’s actions may sound like common sense, many EPA laws only “contemplate the consideration of benefits and costs as part of the regulatory decision-making,” said his memo.

Now, he wrote, “the EPA should evaluate and consider both benefits and costs in decision-making.”"
Lawmakers try to save DHS lab that prepares first responders for terror threats,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/politics/dhs-lab-first-responders-funding-house/index.html,"(CNN) Lawmakers are again attempting to keep a Department of Homeland Security laboratory that specializes in first-responder technology and assistance from shutting its doors.

The House overwhelmingly passed a bill Monday evening that would permanently authorize the New York City-based National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, which has been at risk of losing funding over the past couple of years and was not included in the administration's latest DHS funding request.

The lab ""is constantly developing and testing new tools for our brave first responders to use in the event of a terrorist attack, industrial accident or natural disaster and closely collaborates with law enforcement agencies like the FDNY, NYPD and the Nassau County Police Department in my district,"" Rep. Kathleen Rice, a New York Democrat who cosponsored the bill, said Monday on the House floor, urging her colleagues to pass the legislation. The final vote was 395-3.

She said the administration has proposed closing the lab in each of the last two federal budgets.

The potential funding cut comes amid budget battles between the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill, as the administration has shifted its funding and influence to the department's immigration missions.

How a Missouri senator may have been president for one day,https://wtvr.com,['Tribune Media Wire'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://wtvr.com/2019/06/11/how-a-missouri-senator-may-have-been-president-for-one-day/,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

ATCHISON, Kan. - Most history classes teach Zachary Taylor was the 12th U.S. president and Harry Truman was the only president from Missouri.

But a pair of historical markers in Plattsburg, Missouri, and a museum in Atchison, Kansas, tell a different story.

People pass by the towering statue outside the Clinton County Courthouse every day. Few people recognize it as David Rice Atchison, and likely fewer understand the plaque below that declares him ""President of the United States for one day.""

""He was this vital important pre-Civil War person that pretty much vanished off the pages of history,"" said Chris Taylor, Atchison County Historical Society executive director.

But on March 4, 1849, Atchison was the nation`s highest ranking elected official sworn into office.

The nation's 11th president, James Polk's term had expired, and the President-elect, Zachary Taylor, refused to be inaugurated on a Sunday.

Atchison of Missouri had just been named president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate.

""In 1849, there was no pressing thing that would happen. Today, if we didn't have a president for 24 hours, the whole world would be in total chaos,"" Taylor said.

The Atchison County Historical Society Museu boasts ""The World's Smallest Presidential Library.""

In its Hall of Presidents, Atchison is placed between Polk and Taylor and proclaimed ""The Real 12th President."" It features an 1849 newspaper article from Washington D.C.'s National Intelligencer that explained how Atchison may have accidentally become president for a day.

The museum asks visitors to vote in an 1850s Kansas ballot box what they'd do if they were president for a day.

So how did Atchison spend it? After being up for hours signing final presidential orders that had to pass through the Senate from the previous term, he mostly slept.

""His friends started showing up to wake him up to be appointed as ministers to different countries or part of his 24-hour cabinet, so people realized this odd thing was happening,"" Taylor said.

Atchison never gained the official title of vice president either, but would serve in the de-facto capacity under two presidents because of deaths in office. He'd retire from politics shortly after Atchison, Kansas, was named for him, on the losing side of the debate whether Kansas should be admitted as a slave or free state.

A marker next to his Plattsburg, Missouri, grave declares him ""President for a Day."" Memoirs say he'd often boast after his odd attachment to history that he had ""the honestest administration in the U.S.""

Since 1849, whenever Inauguration Day has fallen on a Sunday, the president has been sworn in privately, and then had a formal public ceremony the following day."

Private attorney and GOP activist Brady Toensing is leaving Vermont to take a senior counsel position with the U.S. Department of Justice. He starts work for the Office of Legal Policy Monday.

Toensing, 51, announced his resignation as vice chair of the Vermont Republican Party on May 23. An activist lawyer, advocate for open government and head of President Donald Trump’s Vermont campaign committee in 2016, Toensing has long been a thorn in the side of moderate Republicans, iconoclastic lefty U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and the Democratic establishment in Vermont.

Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox.

“We are going to miss Vermont, but I am excited to be joining the Department of Justice in a dream job and under the leadership of Attorney General Bill Barr,” Toensing said in an email. “Our youngest is graduating from high school this week, so the timing is pretty good.”

Deb Billado, chair of the Vermont Republican Party, said his seat will remain vacant until the party reorganizes in November. “It’s certainly an opportunity that doesn’t come along every day for lawyer and I’m excited for him,” Billado said.

Toensing and Billado have been Trump stalwarts, pushing away moderate Republican Party members, including Gov. Phil Scott who has rebuffed many of the president’s policies.

Toensing’s connection to Trump runs deep. Last year the president considered retaining Toensing’s mother and stepfather, prominent conservative D.C. attorneys Victoria Toensing and Joseph diGenova, to be part of his team handling the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Over the past five years, Toensing has fought with the state’s most prominent politicians in the press and the courts over the state’s gun laws, climate change initiatives, accusations of campaign finance abuse and the state’s refusal to produce public records. He also waded into public disputes with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, Gov. Peter Shumlin, and former Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell, accusing them of misconduct.

TJ Donovan, who took Sorrell’s place when he was elected Vermont attorney general in 2016, says Toensing has been a worthy adversary. Donovan appointed him to the Vermont Campaign Finance Task Force in 2017.

VTDigger is underwritten by:

“I said to him I hope you’re not leaving Vermont for good, that we need lawyers like Brady in our state,” Donovan said in an interview Monday. “He can be a pain in the butt no doubt, but he holds government officials accountable — he was a worthy adversary, he was tough, he was dogged and he was fair.”

“Brady and I have been fighting for the past three years so my sense is our fights will continue,” Donovan said. “But I also think it’s useful, I will have somebody I can call and have a reasonable conversation with — I anticipate calling upon Brady as issues arise … I have respect for his legal acumen and his integrity.”

Others on the left of the political spectrum weren’t as generous in their appraisal of Toensing’s contributions to the legal and political landscape.

State Sen. Chris Pearson, P/D-Chittenden, who was the subject of one of Toensing’s several campaign finance complaints leveled at liberals, said “he really does epitomize the modern Republican ethic of winning at all costs.”

“I know how hard it is to recruit people to run for office and to serve and when they look at the kind of harassment that can entail at the hands of people like Brady Toensing that discourages more people from being engaged,” Pearson said. “At the same time he’s vigorously defended transparency and the public’s right to know, there’s a tension there I think.”

Most recently, Toensing served as local counsel in a case brought by the National Rifle Association against the state of Vermont over the constitutionality of a new magazine limit put in place last year as part of sweeping reforms to the state’s gun laws.

Toensing won a landmark First Amendment case in 2018. The Vermont Supreme Court ruling set a new precedent making the private emails of officials pertaining to government business subject to public records requests. In that lawsuit, the Charlotte attorney represented the interests of the Free Market Environmental Law Clinic and the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, conservative groups funded by the Koch brothers, that were seeking information about a group of state attorneys general offices — including Vermont’s — investigating Exxon Mobil’s alleged early knowledge and longtime denials of climate change.

Toensing is perhaps best known for his 2016 letter to the U.S. Department of Justice alleging that Sanders pressured People’s United Bank to issue a loan requested by his wife, Jane Sanders, the former president of Burlington College, for the purchase of the former Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington headquarters on Lake Champlain. Last fall, the Vermont U.S. Attorney’s Office dropped an investigation into whether Jane Sanders overstated donor pledges used as collateral for the loan.

Toensing also went after then-Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell in 2015 for alleged campaign finance violations when he accepted $200,000 from a PAC set up by the Democratic Attorneys General Association in his 2012 primary against Donovan. Sorrell was accused of improperly coordinating with the PAC. A special investigator found in 2017 that DAGA — not Sorrell — ran afoul of Vermont campaign finance rules.

When former Gov. Peter Shumlin came under criticism for taking advantage of his neighbor Jeremy Dodge in East Montpelier, Toensing represented Dodge pro bono and helped him reclaim his land.

And then there were the campaign finance cases.

When Sanders promoted former staffer Pearson’s campaign for the state Senate in an email to supporters in 2016, Toensing cried foul. He alleged that the email was an in-kind contribution that generated an $80,000 windfall from 12,000 Sanders fans and therefore violated campaign finance laws.

In 2011, Toensing defended former Republican Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie when he was accused of misusing campaign finance laws by allegedly coordinated with the Republican Governors Association on a poll. In a settlement, Dubie paid $10,000 to the state and $10,000 to the Vermont Foodbank. The RGA settled for $30,000.

Toensing holds an undergraduate degree and obtained a juris doctorate from Georgetown University in 1996. He worked for U.S. Sen. Warren Rudman after law school and then went into private practice. Toensing has represented plaintiffs and defendants in gender discrimination cases, and CIA and FBI employees in internal hearings and investigations, according to a bio on his law firm’s website.

Since 2010, he has represented the former president of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International through multiple lawsuits involving allegations of international money laundering and bank fraud.

His mother, Victoria Toensing, and his stepfather, Joseph DiGenova, are prominent conservative Washington lawyers and fierce advocates for Trump. A recent Politico piece characterized the “husband and wife duo” as the staunchest defenders of the president on TV. Toensing and DiGenova were such a dominant media presence in the Lewinsky affair that Washington Post dubbed them the “Power Couple at the Scandal’s Vortex.”

EPA getting common sense with cost-benefit analysis,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Daren Bakst']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/10/epa-getting-common-sense-with-cost-benefit-analysi/,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Shouldn’t Environmental Protection Agency regulations do more good than harm?

The agency hasn’t always thought so.

In 2012, under President Barack Obama, the EPA finalized a rule to reduce emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants. In doing so, the agency decided that it didn’t need to consider the rule’s costs, estimated at $9.6 billion per year — roughly 2,000 times more than its annual benefits of only $4 million to $6 million.

Fortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court directed the agency to take costs into consideration based on specific Clean Air Act language applicable to that rule. If the EPA had its way though, costs wouldn’t have been considered.

That cavalier attitude is evident in other major air regulations, where the EPA didn’t bother to quantify whether there would be any benefits for reducing emissions of the regulated pollutant.

Now, however, there’s reason to hope that some common sense might finally be coming to the EPA.

In May, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler issued a memorandum directing the agency to “ensure that its regulatory decisions are rooted in sound, transparent and consistent approaches to evaluating benefits and costs.”

The full scope of what this process will entail isn’t clear. However, it appears that various offices within the EPA will be proposing rules to codify important principles of cost-benefit analysis into the agency’s work.

The memo explains that “the EPA should evaluate and consider both benefits and costs in decision-making.” The fact that such an obvious point has to be made is sadly instructive.

This entire effort shouldn’t be, and doesn’t appear to be, a scheme to reduce regulations per se. But the need for a reasonable, objective and predictable way to make regulatory decisions is quite evident.

Regulators shouldn’t be allowed to work backwards, deciding what policy they want and then gaming (or ignoring) cost-benefit analysis to reach their preferred policy outcomes. By codifying basic regulatory principles through the rule making process, the EPA will have a more difficult time going back to the “anything goes” mentality that exists now.

There must be a reasonable and transparent process in how the EPA comes up with their regulations. Make no mistake, these EPA regulations have a major impact on the lives of all Americans. In addition to environmental objectives, these regulations impact everything from energy costs, infrastructure development and transportation, to whether a farm includes some dry land that is actually a regulated water under the Clean Water Act.

In moving forward with this process, the EPA should codify basic principles of cost-benefit analysis that have been well-established over the years through various means, including executive orders and Office of Management and Budget documents.

For example, the agency should carefully evaluate to what extent existing regulations or laws contribute to the problem that the agency wants to address. The EPA should also evaluate alternatives to regulation and choose an alternative that achieves the regulatory objective while posing the least burden on society.

The EPA should identify where regulations are outdated, duplicative and unnecessary. Further, unless expressly prohibited in statute, the EPA should assume that cost-benefit analysis is required across the board.

As with the EPA, Congress delegates far too much power to other agencies and is arguably unlawfully delegating its lawmaking power. This is certainly a critical problem that needs to be addressed.

But to the extent agencies are able to exercise this enormous and largely unchecked power, there should be some reasonable rules of the game so that their decision-making is based on sound economic principles. This in no way should suggest that cost-benefit analysis is a panacea for sound policymaking, but applying reasonable principles is far better than having none at all.

To its credit, the EPA is taking on this important endeavor to help ensure the agency properly and consistently considers costs and benefits, now and in the future. Other agencies should follow suit.

Pelosi, who also visited Normandy, refused to discuss impeachment during an interview on D-Day but has repeatedly criticized the administration, especially the attorney general.

Barr, who also served as AG under former President George W. Bush, returned to the Justice Department as Pelosi's party continued pressing the Russia issue and his department faced intense questioning surrounding the investigation.

From the start, Barr was suspected of bias due to a memo he wrote which said he thought Trump was well within his powers when he fired former FBI Director James Comey -- one of the main issues in suspicions surrounding whether the president obstructed justice.

Since his arrival, Barr has taken actions that prompted both media figures and congressional Democrats to accuse him of shielding the president from warranted scrutiny. Barr has also come under fire for pursuing the president's directive to de-classify intelligence material in order to uncover information related to the Russia probe's origins.

HOUSE DEMS TO VOTE ON HOLDING BARR, MCGAHN IN CONTEMPT, SEEKING TO KEEP MUELLER SPOTLIGHT ALIVE

That prompted an inquiry from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who blasted the AG as unworthy of that title. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who also serves on that committee, said that while he was reluctant to impeach Trump, he was ready to pursue that path with both Barr and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

Democrats seemed poised to at least hold Barr in contempt as his Department refused to comply with House Democrats request for more information surrounding the investigation.

Citing Barr's refusal, House Democrats proposed giving congressional investigators the power to ""“to initiate or intervene in any judicial proceeding before a Federal Court."" Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, D-Mass., whose committee would take up the resolution, vowed to hold the administration accountable.

“We will not allow this president and his administration to turn a blind eye to the rule of law,"" he said."

U.S. government debt yields rose Monday after President Donald Trump said U.S. tariffs on goods from Mexico would be suspended.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Sunday that proposed tariffs on Mexican imports would be suspended indefinitely. Trump said in a Twitter post Sunday that he has ""full confidence"" that Mexico will crack down on migration from Central America, after the two neighbors reached a consensus. The New York Times reported Saturday that the deal to avert tariffs largely comprised actions Mexico had already agreed to take.

Meanwhile, investors will be watching trade developments between the U.S. and China ahead of a key meeting between the leaders of the two countries. Speaking to CNBC on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said President Trump will decide about further Chinese tariffs after he meets his Chinese counterpart later this month."
Two Michigan stores named in USDA’s list of retailers who received recalled beef,https://www.mlive.com,"['Benjamin Raven', 'Braven Mlive.Com']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/06/two-michigan-stores-named-in-usdas-list-of-retailers-who-received-recalled-beef.html,"Two Michigan stores were identified in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s list of retailers who received previously recalled raw beef products due to E. coli concerns.

Affected beef products from Aurora Packing Co. were packaged back on April 19, and the federal agency’s Food Safety and Inspection Service is worried some are “in institutional facility freezers.” The two Michigan stores listed in the long list of affected retailers spread across 10 states include the Holiday Market in Royal Oak and Treasure Chest Foods in Lambertville.

The federal agency’s full list of retailers published to its website Monday, June 10 can be found by clicking here. Aurora Packing Co. is based in North Aurora, Illinois. All Kroger stores located in Ohio received recalled raw beef products in addition to Illinois’ 65 affected retail locations.

Products included in the recall bear the establishment number of “EST. 788” inside the mark of inspection. To check out he lengthy list of affected products, click here. For a look at the labels of recalled items, click here.

Those in possession of affected beef products listed in the recall are urged to throw it away or seek a refund at the point of purchase.

The issue was originally discovered during “traceback activities in response to random sample testing.” The recall is labeled as a Class I one with a high health risk, according to the USDA release. A Class I recall is a “situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death.”

There are no known reports of illnesses or incidents related to the recall, according to the news release from the USDA FSIS.

E. coli is a potentially deadly bacteria that can cause severe dehydration, bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Symptoms typically last less than a week, but seniors and children younger than the age of 5 and the elderly are at risk of suffering kidney failure."
Ken Cuccinelli named acting head of DHS's legal immigration division,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/10/ken-cuccinelli-named-acting-head-dhss-legal-immigr/,"Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli was officially named acting director at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Monday, putting him in charge of some of the most important behind-the-scenes immigration initiatives of the Trump administration.

Foremost among his tasks will be to speed changes to a major guest-worker program and to finalize the new “public charge” rules, which are designed to push legal immigrants to prove they can be self-sustaining without becoming dependent on public assistance.

Mr. Cuccinelli, in a statement, pronounced himself “honored” to lead the agency.

“USCIS has the extraordinary responsibility to administer and protect the integrity of our nation’s lawful immigration system,” he said. “Our nation has the most generous legal immigration system in the world and we must zealously safeguard its promise for those who lawfully come here.”

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan announced Mr. Cuccinelli’s accession to the USCIS job in a statement Monday — though there could be some legal hurdles.

Since Mr. Cuccinelli has not been in the agency, Mr. McAleenan created a new deputy position at USCIS and placed it first in the line of succession, giving him a path to be the new director.

Democrats said that was a cheap-shot end run that might not hold up to court scrutiny.

“Once again, this president is trying to circumvent Congress and our Constitution by appointing someone as acting head of an agency who would not be confirmed by the Senate to that post and who is grossly unqualified for it,” said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat.

Mr. Cuccinelli had been under consideration for a job as immigration “czar” at the White House, but instead President Trump deputed him over to Homeland Security as an adviser.

Now he lands in a specific job, taking over for Director Francis Cissna, who had fallen out of favor with the White House for not moving fast enough on what top White House advisers said were the president’s top priorities.

Democrats saw Mr. Cuccinelli’s appointment as an attempt to undermine the agency.

“Mr. Cuccinelli is an anti-immigrant fringe figure that has no business leading a component that is supposed to administer our nation’s legal immigration system,” said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee.

The Mississippi Democrat predicted Mr. Cuccinelli would be a force for chaos at the agency, undermining its mission.

And he said there’s no chance Mr. Cuccinelli would be confirmed to the position if nominated to it, so it makes no sense to install him as the acting director.

Mr. Thompson didn’t say which Senate Republicans he thinks would oppose Mr. Cuccinelli and thus prevent his confirmation, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier this year told reporters he did not want Mr. Trump to select Mr. Cuccinelli.

Mr. Cuccinelli, as head of a conservative activist organization, backed a challenger to Mr. McConnell in his 2014 election, and in 2017 Mr. Cuccinelli signed onto a letter urging Mr. McConnell to give up the leader’s post.

“America is too good for you to lead it,” Mr. Cuccinelli and fellow conservatives wrote.

Though USCIS gets less attention than the other two immigration agencies, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, it is instrumental in the enforcement of immigration laws, deciding on legal immigration applications and some visitor visas.

The agency is under fire from Democrats who say that it has slow-walked legal immigration under Mr. Trump, erecting what activists have labeled an “invisible wall” to prevent migration.

Yet USCIS points to increased processing of citizenship applications and to the border crisis, which has spawned a massive surge in asylum petitions, both of which fall to the agency’s officers to adjudicate.

The White House has been demanding stricter asylum standards out of USCIS, saying it could help cut down on the flow of illegal immigrants if it took a more critical eye of the initial claims migrants make at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“One of the biggest frustrations is the fact that USCIS has not been able to change agency culture about ‘credible fear’ and asylum from the Obama years,” a White House official told reporters two months ago, predicting changes at the agency.

Those comments came as Mr. Trump had ousted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and acting ICE Director Ronald D. Vitiello, seeking a tougher direction from his leaders.

Mr. Cissna survived the initial culling, but White House officials made clear he was on the hot seat.

Quad Acquisition of LSC Communications: Latest on Status of DOJ Antitrust Ruling,https://www.piworld.com,['Mark Michelson'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.piworld.com/article/quad-acquisition-lsc-communications-latest-status-doj-antitrust-ruling/,"The proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of Chicago-based LSC Communications by Sussex, Wis.-based Quad still faces one last hurdle: approval from the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust division. All along, Quad Chairman, President and CEO Joel Quadracci has remained upbeat that the deal — which would make the combined commercial printing conglomerate the largest in North America with approximately $8.1 billion in sales — will close some time around mid-year.

Quad is expected to report its second quarter earnings in the July 29-30 timeframe, so one can assume his organization is pushing hard behind the scenes to have the framework of the deal approved by then, in order to give him and Quad CFO Dave Honan more favorable talking points to relay to analysts during the earnings call than just its quarterly results and current guidance.

The pending DOJ decision about the coupling of the two publicly-held entities has also received a lot of attention both in, and outside, of the printing industry. I've received an ongoing stream of calls from Wall Street analysts and researchers at hedge funds (some pondering intentions whether or not to buy or, even more so, short the stock) seeking my opinion on the matter as a long-time industry watcher. Similarly, I've also been in continued contact with some fellow journalists who specialize in covering and investigating the antitrust implications for various proposed M&A transactions.

One such writer is Diane Alter, of CTFN. Her article filed Friday, June 7, cited an ""unnamed source close to the situation"" who indicated that Quad and the DOJ are in the midst of negotiating a settlement, which will likely be submitted to the DOJ ""front office"" by the end of June, and then finalized around mid-summer. Alter also reported that her source was unsure whether or not the DOJ would require Quad or LSC to divest any of their holdings in order to pass the DOJ's antitrust requirements. LSC, for example, divested its European operations to the Walstead Group in July 2018, most likely as a preemptive move prior to the Oct. 31, 2018, announcement of its intention to be acquired by Quad.

The DOJ is likely scrutinizing how the proposed coupling would potentially monopolize the long-run publication gravure printing market, as well as the U.S. magazine distribution and logistics network, including co-mail advantages. Perhaps a bit surprisingly, major publishers have remained eerily quiet about how the deal would impact their print vendor options and, in theory, give Quad the upper hand when it comes to pricing power.

The only public complaint came from The Authors Guild and PEN America — two authors organizations — in conjunction with the Open Markets Institute, which collectively sent a letter to the DOJ imploring it to require the two printing companies to divest their magazine distribution operations.

They cited industry data showing that a combined Quad/LSC would have 15 times the magazine printing sales of its nearest competitor in that market and 10 times the book printing revenue of its nearest competitor in the book market.

Quad/LSC Dominate Magazine, Book Printing Markets

According to the 2018 Printing Impressions 400 list of the largest printers in the U.S. and Canada ranked by annual sales (click here to access the complete list), Quad and LSC collectively generated approximately $2.31 billion in publication printing segment sales and $1.26 billion in book printing sales in their most recent fiscal years. This makes them the two largest industry players in those markets — not counting the CJK Group, a privately-held national book manufacturer and industry consolidator that won't divulge its annual revenues or segment sales by product.

I've argued all along (including what I wrote when the proposed Quad/LSC deal was first announced) that the M&A transaction will ultimately receive the DOJ's blessing, albeit with the regulatory agency potentially requiring the combined entity to make some adjustments or divestitures. Two main reasons: 1) the printing industry still remains fragmented in comparison to many other manufacturing sectors and 2) it's not a high-profile industry from the standpoint of the public at large or for having a direct impact on consumers. (One stark comparison, for example, is the proposed merger between Sprint and T-Mobile that is currently facing DOJ antitrust scrutiny.)

Mainstream Media Weighs in on Proposed Deal

Ike Brannon, president of Capital Policy Analytics and a contributor to Forbes, recently penned an article that also favors DOJ approval of the merger and which minimizes the deal's impact on long-run magazine publishers. He pointed out there are currently about 77 publications with a print run of more than one million copies, also noting that figure will undoubtedly decline in the years ahead due to continued pressures from electronic media.

""Making a merger decision that looks at today’s economic realities and does not consider the incipient decline of the print environment has the potential to stifle the cost reductions needed for the print industry to compete against digital publications,"" Brannon argued in his commentary.

He also noted how large publishers often split their magazine print runs between multiple printers to get the best price for their press runs. ""The print industry has hundreds of competitors fighting over a shrinking share of business, and exerting market power is difficult for any one of them to do,"" Brannon wrote.

Some privately-held publication and book printers I've talked to actually favor the Quad/LSC deal, noting that many publication and book publishers will prefer to work with smaller print providers like them, which will be able to provide more personalized service and greater deadline and print order run-length flexibility.

As the summer heats up, so too will anticipation over the DOJ's final decision. From my perch, it's not a matter of if the DOJ will allow the acquisition to proceed or not, but rather what stipulations — if any, and how major — the agency may impose in conjunction with its final blessing."
EPA issues guidance critics say would limit state's authorities over pipeline projects,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447782-states-have-shut-down-pipeline-projects-epa-seeks-to-change-that,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a guidance Friday that critics say seeks to limit states’ influence over controversial pipeline projects.

Federal law through the Clean Water Act essentially gives states veto power over large projects that cut through their rivers and streams if they believe those projects would negatively impact their water quality.

Spurred by an

April executive order

“This seems to be another attempt by the Trump Administration to limit states, and by extension local communities, ability to protect their own waterways and to give pipeline developers or other project proponents an ability to skip over one of the steps in the process that had been there to protect local waterways,” said Nathan Matthews, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club, one of the environmental groups weighing action against the EPA.

The Clean Water Act gives states a year to weigh permits and determine how projects would impact their water, but some feel states have used the process to block major projects.

“I welcome this announcement and hope EPA’s new guidance will reduce abuse of the Clean Water Act to block infrastructure needed to provide reliable and affordable energy,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiOvernight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA EPA issues guidance critics say would limit state's authorities over pipeline projects MORE (R-Alaska) said of the guidance in a press release. “EPA’s updated guidance will maintain vital protections for our water resources while promoting responsible development of our energy resources.”

The EPA said states should not take more time than is reasonable to review permits, encouraging them to “promptly begin evaluating the request to ensure timely action.”



The guidance says the timeline for reviewing the permits begins as soon as they are filed, and states should not wait for an environmental assessment to be completed as that may take longer than the year states are granted. The guidance also notes that the clock doesn’t stop because states have requested more information.



States have recently sidelined two large projects using the certification process through the Clean Water Act, actions that contradict the energy dominance strategy promoted by the Trump administration.

New York denied a certification for the Constitution Pipeline, a 124-mile natural gas pipeline that would have run from Pennsylvania to New York, crossing rivers more than 200 times. Washington state denied certification for the Millennium Coal Terminal, a shipping port for large stocks of coal.

“The Trump Administration’s attempt to attack our state’s right to protect the health and well-being of our residents, without any consultation with states or tribal governments, is wrong,” Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement to The Hill. “It will undermine four decades of state and federal cooperation in environmental stewardship.”

But even states with more conservative leadership have spoken out for maintaining states rights under the law.

“We urge you to direct federal agencies to reject any changes to agency rules, guidance, or policy that may diminish, impair, or subordinate states’ well-established sovereign and statutory authorities to protect water quality within their boundaries,” the Western Governors’ Association wrote in a January letter when the White House was still weighing an executive order.

Matthews said states are likely to have trouble getting the information they need in order to meet the timelines. The lengthy environmental assessment process means pipeline routes or construction plans might change long after they’ve applied for permission from the state. Trying to force states to approve a project before they have that information could backfire, he said.

“States cannot make a decision about whether a project will or won’t comply with state water quality standards until they know where and what rivers it will be crossing,” Matthews said. “If they encourage or later require states to make these decisions before all the information is available, states are going to have to deny these applications without prejudice and encourage them to reapply which could slow everything down rather than speed it up.”

Industry groups voiced support for the EPA guidance, arguing it helped restore the balance between the state and federal government.

“The balance between those roles has been disrupted and some states have viewed Section 401 as means of determining which interstate pipeline projects are in the public interest and which are not,” Don Santa, president of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said in a release, referring to the specific portion of the law creating the state certification process.

Environmentalists say they are still weighing what response to take to the guidance, though some say they are more concerned about the coming regulations on the same topic that were also spurred by Trump’s executive order.

“I would say there are several alarming suggestions in this guidance that if taken to their extreme could be very problematic as they play out,” said Moneen Nasmith, an attorney with EarthJustice. “There are a number of places that provide the suggestion that EPA could weigh in in places within the state decisionmaking process that it has never participated in before and doesn’t have the authority to do now.”

She’s concerned the EPA may try to weigh in on what reasons states can give to deny a certification or try to define water quality issues more narrowly, blocking states from weighing certain aspects of projects. Both are things she said EPA is not legally allowed to do.

“I’m worried that in the guidance EPA seems to be contemplating having that kind of role,” she said."
State Dept. denies embassies’ requests to fly rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-denies-embassies-requests-fly-rainbow-pride/story?id=63566900,"The State Department has denied multiple U.S. diplomatic posts' requests to fly the rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles during LGBT Pride Month, according to two State Department sources.

The decision is the latest in a string of moves by the agency under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's tenure that LGBT rights activists say discriminate against the community.

Among the U.S. missions overseas that were denied are Brazil, Germany, Israel, and Latvia, one source told ABC News.

The denials fly in the face of the spirit of President Donald Trump's stated push to launch ""a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality."" While the president tweeted last Friday that the White House would ""celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation"" -– making him the first Republican president to do so – his administration has not proclaimed June as LGBT Pride Month.

Pride flags can be displayed elsewhere on a U.S. mission's grounds, but not the official flagpole, according to department guidance distributed in May. Flying any special flag on the official flagpole at a US diplomatic post overseas requires special permission, per the department's Foreign Affairs Manual.

The denial to the U.S. embassy in Germany is particularly striking since Trump's envoy to Berlin is Richard Grenell, one of the highest-ranking openly gay officials in the administration.

""The President's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,"" Grenell told NBC News, which was first to report on the denials.

In 2016, the Obama administration granted ""blanket written authorization from the Under Secretary for Management to display the pride flag on the external-facing flagpole"" during June, according to a cable sent at the time. But that permission was rescinded under the Trump administration, and individual posts had to request permission to fly the pride flag.

In previous years, an official cable was sent from Washington with guidance on how to mark LGBT Pride month and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.

But this year, Pompeo did not approve the cable and instead, the department sent guidance to posts via email that noted it would not transmit an [an official cable for and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia] and LGBT Pride Month this year.""

That meant embassies and consulates could still mark both with whatever actions they wanted. But they were not given encouragement as in years past to engage in outreach with local LGBT communities, and they had to again get permission to fly the Pride flag on the official flagpole.

This time, those requests were denied, the sources said. The State Department has not responded to requests for comment.

LGBT rights activists expressed concern last week after news broke that the State Department was planning to convene a new commission on human rights that was based on ""natural law"" -- often taken to mean a religiously-based interpretation that excludes LGBT rights.

The author of the commission's concept paper is Robert George, a prominent anti-LGBT academic who created the National Organization for Marriage, a source told ABC News.

The department has also come under fire from Congress for a policy that does not automatically grant birthright citizenship to U.S. citizens' children who are born abroad through assisted reproductive technology, which lawmakers say indiscriminately affects gay and lesbian couples.

Under State Department policy, children born overseas must be the biological child of a U.S. citizen to receive citizenship at birth. But citizenship will not be granted to the child if it is born through in vitro fertilization and surrogacy and the genetic parent is not a U.S. citizen, even if the couple is legally married.

In several cases, the children of same-sex couples have had their citizenship denied or delayed even though at least one parent is a U.S. citizen. The State Department is currently fighting lawsuits from two couples on this issue.

Nearly 20 Democratic senators and 80 House members signed two letters to Pompeo Thursday demanding he reverse the policy."
