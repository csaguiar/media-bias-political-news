Citing the newspaper, Bloomberg News reported that Kim Hyok Chol, North Korea's special envoy to the U.S., and four other North Korean Foreign Ministry officials were executed in March because of the breakdown of the February summit in Hanoi, Vietnam.

Trump’s much-anticipated summit with Kim ended abruptly and without the two leaders signing any agreements over nuclear disarmament.

Top Kim aide Kim Yong Chol is reportedly undergoing hard labor for his role in the breakdown.

He had been Kim’s most trusted policy adviser and was removed from one of his posts.

Nikki Haley begins experiment in political life after Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Eliana Johnson', 'Ian Kullgren', 'Ted Hesson', 'Anita Kumar', 'Burgess Everett']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/nikki-haley-2020-elections-1348432,"Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley is working to redefine herself outside the president’s shadow, emerging as a fundraiser and surrogate for 2020 Republican Senate candidates. | Joe Buglewicz/Bloomberg via Getty Images 2020 elections Nikki Haley begins experiment in political life after Trump The former U.N. ambassador, a rare official to leave on good terms with the president, is re-emerging on the 2020 campaign trail.

Of the many senior officials to leave the Trump administration over the past two years, few have exited on better terms than former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. Before her departure last December, President Donald Trump feted Haley with an Oval Office photo-op and declared that his U.N. diplomat “has been very special to me.”

And while many former Trump officials, from former White House chief of staff John Kelly to former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have kept a low profile in the private sector, Haley is charting a different course. She is emerging as a fundraiser and surrogate for 2020 Republican Senate candidates, and next month will begin zigzagging across the country to campaign for a trio of GOP senators.

By remaining a loyal Republican soldier on good terms with the president — a forthcoming memoir is not expected to join the ranks of cutting insider tell-alls — Haley is also something of a test case for independent political life after Trump.

The former South Carolina governor’s summer itinerary includes a June 15 stop in Boone, Iowa, where Haley will help Sen. Joni Ernst launch her reelection campaign at Ernst’s annual Roast ’n Ride event, where Iowans are slated to grill over 2,000 pounds of pork. Given its location in a key presidential caucus state, the event is sure to spark murmurs about Haley’s own political ambitions, including the prospect of a 2024 presidential bid.

She has already begun to reemerge on the public stage, including with remarks Thursday before an economic club in Grand Rapids, Mich., where she echoed Trump’s recent warnings that socialism threatens the U.S. — a message likely to be a key Trump 2020 campaign theme. Though they have not set a firm date, Haley has spoken with senior adviser Jared Kushner and the president himself about joining him on the campaign trail in 2020, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

“Capitalism is the greatest force for ending poverty and lifting up human beings in history,” Haley said. “America’s dangerous flirtation with socialism is in colleges, in the media and in Congress. We have an obligation to remind everyone that if you care about global poverty, you should support capitalism.” She will also deliver the keynote address at the Susan B. Anthony Foundation’s annual gala on Monday.

“She is one of the few female superstars in the Republican Party and our party needs more conservative women,” said Corry Bliss, a Republican consultant who previously served as the executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC dedicated to winning Republican House seats. “As far as the base is concerned, she stood with Trump, and that’s all they care about.”

While a bevy of Republicans are contemplating how to position themselves for the post-Trump era, Haley is the first to begin the process of redefining herself outside the president’s shadow. This fall, she will publish a book, “With All Due Respect,” offering her reflections on “major national and international matters,” according to the publisher’s website. The book will cast her as a decidedly nonTrumpian figure: that is, “a leader who seeks to bring Americans together in divisive times.” Yet there is no sign she will use the book to criticize Trump — even as she casts herself as a different sort of leader.

Haley was never a Trump true believer. During the 2016 GOP primaries, she initially supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. And for all Trump’s praise when she left the administration, Haley left some raw feelings at the State Department and the White House because of her insistence on maintaining her independence, particularly in the form of barbed statements about Russia at a time when Trump was looking to improve relations with Moscow. Never openly critical of Trump, Haley also didn’t shy from asserting herself either. Indeed, her book title is an in-your-face reference to an April 2018 episode in which Haley publicly announced plans for new U.S. sanctions on Russia, only for a White House official to suggest she had suffered “momentary confusion” and that the president had not yet made up his mind. “With all due respect, I don’t get confused,” Haley replied.

Haley, 47, was seen as a rising GOP star before Trump’s election, which was widely considered a rejection of the more inclusive version of the GOP she championed as the two-term government of South Carolina. She was critical of Trump during the Republican primary, tacitly criticizing him in her nationally televised response to President Barack Obama’s final State of the Union address, and endorsed Rubio.

“I think she’s one of the most effective surrogates we have in the party. Time in the Trump administration gives her credibility with the more conservative elements of the party but she can also showcase diversity,” said Matt Gorman, former communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee.

During the 2018 midterms, a handful of women in the Trump administration, including White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, were among the most popular surrogates on the campaign trail in the 2018 midterms, and National Republican Senatorial Committee aides predicted the same would be true in 2020.

Until now, much of the flesh-pressing and fundraising Haley has undertaken since leaving office has taken place behind closed doors. Last week, for example, Haley helped raise approximately $500,000 for four female GOP Senate candidates — Martha McSally of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia, and Iowa’s Ernst — at a New York City fundraiser hosted by Annie Dickerson, a longtime Republican fundraiser and the founder of the GOP aligned political action committee Winning for Women, according to a source familiar with the event.

That sort of work will take a public turn starting early next month with a spate of political events starting June 10, when she will help kick off Capito’s reelection campaign in Charleston, W.Va.

She has also been asked to campaign alongside Republican candidates who might be more reluctant to stump with the president, including Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, widely considered the most vulnerable of the 2020 cycle. The president’s approval rating in the state is underwater by 13 points, according to an April poll conducted by Morning Consult. Gardner, who was traveling internationally in connection with his position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was not present Thursday when Trump visited Colorado to deliver remarks at the Air Force Academy’s commencement ceremony.

Gardner campaign spokesman Cosey Contres said the campaign invited Haley to Colorado because of “her focus on bringing people together” — something few voters, Republican or Democrat, would say about Trump. “Every day, Cory is trying to find ways to bring people together, and she played a similar role on the world stage,” Contres said.

Since her departure from the Trump administration, Haley has balanced the humdrum of post-political life with the forward-looking calculations of somebody who may run for president in the future.

Aside from book writing, she is delivering a bevy of paid speeches — a CNBC report indicated her fee is as high as $200,000 and that she has requested the use of a private jet. She founded an issue-advocacy group, Stand for America, in late February, and joined the board of Boeing, the besieged aerospace giant, earlier this month.

"Trump announces escalating tariffs against Mexico, starting at 5 percent, until illegal immigrants 'STOP'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs-escalating-illegal-immigrants-stop,"President Trump on Thursday abruptly announced a new 5 percent tariff on Mexico beginning in early June, saying the levy will ""gradually increase"" until the ongoing illegal immigration surge at the southern border is ""remedied"" and illegal migrants ""STOP.""

""On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP,"" Trump wrote. ""The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied, ... ..at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.""

Fox News is told the tariff on all goods by land, sea, and air from Mexico will hike to 10 percent on July 1 -- and potentially increase substantially from there.

""If Mexico still has not taken action to dramatically reduce or eliminate the number of illegal aliens crossing its territory into the United States, Tariffs will be increased to 15 percent on August 1, 2019, to 20 percent on September 1, 2019, and to 25 percent on October 1, 2019,"" Trump said in a statement released later by the White House on Thursday. ""Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory.""

The statement added: ""Thousands of innocent lives are taken every year as a result of this lawless chaos. It must end NOW! ... Mexico’s passive cooperation in allowing this mass incursion constitutes an emergency and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.""

Specifically, White House sources told Fox News that Mexico would need to step up security efforts on the border, target transnational smugglers, crack down on illicit bus lines and align with the U.S. on a workable asylum policy. Mexico could use certain so-called choke points on the southern border to curb illegal migration sharply, according to the sources.

The Washington Post reported earlier in the day that the Trump administration was considering the move, and that it had broad support in the White House -- although some aides reportedly tried to talk Trump out of it.

“We are going to do something very dramatic on the border because people are coming into our country,"" Trump told reporters earlier Thursday.

The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 permits tariffs to be levied by the executive in the event of a national emergency originating from a foreign source. Trump said he was invoking the powers in the law and would use his ""sole discretion"" to determine whether Mexico had taken sufficient action.

""If Mexico does not take decisive measures, it will come at a significant price,"" Trump concluded in his statement.

The situation could complicate the legislative passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), sent to Congress by the White House on Thursday, which has aimed broadly to limit tariffs among the three countries.

However, the White House told Fox News it saw the matters as entirely distinct and did not anticipate complications for the USMCA.

Vice President Mike Pence was in the Canadian capital of Ottawa on Thursday to build support for the USMCA. The U.S. recently lifted steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada that had threatened to sink the arrangement, which was signed in November with the goal of replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement.

TRUMP ORDERS ASYLUM OVERHAUL, CITING STATS SHOWING MOST CLAIMS ARE FRAUDULENT OR UNFOUNDED

The news of the tariff came hours after Politico reported that an internal plan under consideration at the Department of Homeland Security effectively would block Central American migrants from bringing asylum claims, by prohibiting claims from applicants who resided in a country other than their own before seeking entry to the United States.

Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months, with border agents making more than 100,000 arrests or denials of entry in March, a 12-year high. Immigration courts that process asylum claims currently have faced a backlog of more than 800,000 cases and asylum applicants increasingly have been staying in the U.S. even after their claims for asylum have been denied.

More than 4,000 individuals have been apprehended at the border with children who are not their own in recent months, administration officials tell Fox News.

And, Customs and Border Protection said it apprehended or turned away over 109,000 migrants attempting to cross the border in April, the second month in a row the number has topped 100,000.

In a dramatic moment, more than 1,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended by border agents near the U.S.-Mexico border early Wednesday -- the largest ever group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told Fox News on Thursday. The group of 1,036 illegal immigrants found in the El Paso sector included migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to sources.

Trump tweeted a video of the episode on Thursday, with the note: “Democrats need to stand by our incredible Border Patrol and finally fix the loopholes at our Border!”

A top Border Patrol official told lawmakers in April that authorities have apprehended more families illegally crossing the border between October 2018 and February of this year than during all of the 2018 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2017-Sept. 30, 2018).

""Much media attention has focused on caravans coming across from Central America,"" Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector Chief Patrol Agent Rodolfo Karisch told the Senate Homeland Security Committee. ""But, the fact is that RGV is receiving caravan-equivalent numbers every seven days.""

Opinion | Looks Like the Trump Administration Lied About the Census,https://www.nytimes.com,['The Editorial Board'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/opinion/census-citizenship-supreme-court.html,"A trove of documents brought to the attention of the Supreme Court on Thursday makes it hard to see the Trump administration’s efforts to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census as anything but a partisan power grab.

The court will decide before the end of June whether Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, was justified under federal law in adding the citizenship question — a move that would nearly certainly lead to a serious undercounts of Hispanics and in immigrant-rich communities . During a hearing on the case in April, it appeared that a majority of the justices was prepared to allow the administration to include the question.

But the explosive new evidence disclosed by the plaintiff s in the case ought to give the justices pause about the ruling they’re about to issue. This is one of the most consequential cases before the court this term. The decision on it will have far-reaching effects on the distribution of political power and federal funding across the country for the next decade and beyond.

According to the plaintiffs who brought the New York challenge to the citizenship question, Mark Neuman, a key adviser to Mr. Ross on census issues, and John Gore, a Justice Department official who oversees voting rights enforcement, gave false or misleading testimony during the course of the litigation about why the Trump administration was so intent on including a citizenship query in the decennial count."
Team Trump Now Wants Mueller to Testify Before Congress in Hopes of a Grilling,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Sam-Stein Asawin-Suebsaeng', 'Sam Stein', 'Asawin Suebsaeng']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/team-trump-now-wants-mueller-to-testify-before-congress-in-hopes-of-a-grilling,"President Trump’s close advisers are increasingly pining for Robert Mueller to be dragged before Congress and subjected to conservative lawmakers’ questions about the conduct and outcome of his investigation.

Their embrace of such a hearing is a sharp reversal in White House sentiment over the past few weeks since the release of the special counsel’s report. Trump himself has come out against Mueller testifying before Congress, and key Republicans on Capitol Hill have followed suit by stating that the issue is effectively “closed.”

But those positions have softened, if not changed, significantly after Mueller’s public statement on Wednesday, in which he stated that he would have exonerated Trump if he could have and said that he was prohibited by Department of Justice guidelines from bringing charges against a sitting president.

“If they allow [GOP Reps.] Meadows and Jordan and few of the others there, they’ll eviscerate him more than they did Michael Cohen,” said Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal attorney during and after the Mueller probe. Giuliani said it would be “emotionally satisfying to have” Mueller testify and that “in terms of the politics of it, I would love to have him testify. I think he’s afraid to.”

The former New York City mayor and current Trump lawyer said he’d spoken to the president both before and after Mueller’s televised statement to the press. Asked to describe Trump’s views, Giuliani told The Daily Beast that all he could say was, “I can sum up his feelings as: Nothing new, no new facts, it’s all smoke and mirrors, so what?” Of Mueller’s conduct, he added: “I’m angrier about this than [Trump] is.”

Mueller’s announcement on Wednesday was a dramatic coda to a two-year investigation in which he never spoke publicly. Appearing at the Department of Justice, he said he was formally ending his service as special counsel and then summarized the main findings of his report. After a little over nine minutes, Mueller expressed his desire not to testify before Congress and declined to take questions from journalists.

“The report is my testimony,” he explained.

Denizens of Trumpworld were left enraged by the appearance, believing Mueller had taken the opportunity to call Trump’s innocence into question without having to be pressed on how he came to his conclusions. During his broadcast later that evening, Fox News host Sean Hannity fantasized about Trump-aligned lawmakers placing Mueller under oath and grilling him.

“If you are wondering whether or not Mueller is open to transparency [and] accountability in this deeply flawed investigation, think again,” Hannity said. “Oh, Bob Mueller does not want to answer questions [from] Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Matt Gaetz, and other Republicans.”

Hannity is a close friend and adviser of Trump’s and his broadcasts often serve as an indicator of where the president’s mind is on any given subject.

Giuliani said he would like Republican lawmakers to grill Mueller about matters such as whether his team ever leaked damaging information to reporters and how former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was treated in solitary confinement. Other prominent Trump allies said they agreed with the idea that Mueller needed to be called before lawmakers, if only to provide Republicans with the opportunity to pepper him on topics such as the composition of his team of investigators and the evidentiary foundations of his investigation.

“[The Mueller Report was] one of the most dishonest reports ever rendered, and I think the Republicans could take it apart upon examination,” John Dowd, a lawyer who repped the president for nearly a year of the Mueller probe, told The Daily Beast on Thursday. “[Bob Mueller] doesn’t want to go up there. It’s obvious he’s pulled a fast one.” Dowd, who still informally advises Trump and his legal team, added that it would be “great to get him up there” so that GOP lawmakers could “take him apart.”

“ I think it would be really wonderful if Bob Mueller were to testify. I hope he does. I hope he has a respirator with him when he does it. ” — Joseph dGenova, informal legal adviser to President Trump

Joseph diGenova, an informal legal adviser to the president, echoed those sentiments. “I think it would be really wonderful if Bob Mueller were to testify. I hope he does. I hope he has a respirator with him when he does it,” he said in a brief interview. “I think there are many questions to ask him that are legitimate, given the damage that he caused by letting the investigation fester for two years.” DiGenova said he has a list of questions for Mueller that he has “already provided to people” but would not specify if he had shared this list with Trump or anyone else in the administration or in Congress.

Asked for comment on this story, a White House spokesman referred The Daily Beast to the president’s past statements on how it was up to Attorney General William Barr to decide whether Mueller testifies.

While Trump’s advisers are increasingly itching for Mueller to be called before lawmakers, not all Republicans, including many of those lawmakers, are on board with the idea.

Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House and a current outside adviser to Trump, told The Daily Beast that the savvier move for congressional Republicans would be to use whatever investigative powers they had to focus on the origins of the counterintelligence operation into the Trump campaign that preceded Mueller’s appointment as special counsel. As such, he said, Senate Republicans, who are in the majority, would be wise to call in former Obama administration officials along with ex-FBI director James Comey to testify. Mueller, Gingrich said, would be a “dead end.”

“I think Mueller is smart enough that he would not hence be a helpful witness. And I don’t think it leads you to anything,” said Gingrich. “Mueller is a door to nowhere because nothing you will learn will matter.”

If Republicans were to try to force Mueller to testify, it would have to be in the Senate, where the party still has power over committee schedules. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), the chair of the Judiciary Committee, had previously offered Mueller the opportunity to testify but has since stated emphatically that he believes the matter is closed.

Asked Wednesday if the senator’s position had softened at all, Graham’s spokesman, Kevin Bishop, pointed to Mueller’s request not to come to the Hill. As ked if the senator would consider a subpoena, Bishop noted that doing so would go “against [Mueller’s] wishes.”

The more likely venue for Mueller to be compelled to testify remains in the House, where Democrats have been attempting to negotiate a hearing for weeks. But those talks stalled, first after the Department of Justice wouldn’t agree to a date and then when Mueller privately conveyed his fears that any testimony would become a political circus. Leadership has since toyed with the idea of subpoenaing Mueller and hinted that they may well do so despite his request not to testify.

House Republicans have been divided over having Mueller testify. Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA), the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, released a statement on Wednesday effectively conceding that Mueller wouldn’t come to the Hill. But the mood on Thursday appeared to be changing. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) confirmed to The Daily Beast that he wanted Mueller to be questioned before Congress. And a senior GOP aide said other members had begun warming up to the idea of putting the now-former special counsel under oath.

“I think the sense is people are miffed by the way Mueller handled the situation from the time he released the report: the fact he didn’t come to a prosecutorial decision and that he is not taking questions,” said the aide. “My sense is some members do want to get more from him in that regard.”"

With the help of an English translator, Merkel stressed the importance of ""truthfulness in our attitude towards others"" and being ""honest with ourselves.""

“What better place to begin to do so than here, in this place, where so many young people from all over the world come to learn, to research, and to discuss the issues of our time under the maxim of ‘truth,'"" Merkel said. “That requires us not to describe lies as truth, and truth as lies.""

That sparked a roaring applause and a standing ovation from the crowd.

Merkel also invoked the negative effect of ""walls"" and how they represent ""ignorance and narrow-mindedness.""

“It requires us not to accept shortcomings as our normality. Yet what, dear graduates, could stop you, could stop us, from doing that? Once again, the answer is walls. Walls in people’s minds, walls of ignorance and narrow-mindedness,” Merkel said. “They exist between family members, as well as different groups within the society: people of different skin colors, nations, and religions.

Barr says he 'personally felt' Mueller could have reached decision on obstruction,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/william-barr-robert-mueller-donald-trump-obstruction-of-justice-russia-investigation,"Attorney General Bill Barr has said that he “personally” felt that Special Counsel Robert Mueller could have reached a decision about whether or not President Trump obstructed justice during the Russia investigation.

During an exclusive interview with CBS News, Barr was asked whether he agreed with Mueller’s “interpretation” that he could not reach a decision on the president’s alleged obstruction of justice.

MUELLER SAYS CHARGING TRUMP WITH A CRIME WAS 'NOT AN OPTION' IN RUSSIA PROBE

“I personally felt he could’ve reached a decision,” Barr said.

When asked again, he said: “Right, he could’ve reached a conclusion.”

“The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office,” Barr said, referring to the Justice Department policy laid out by its Office of Legal Counsel. “But he could’ve reached a decision whether it was criminal activity, but he had his reasons for not doing it, which he explained.”

Barr added: “I am not going to argue about those reasons but when he didn’t make a decision, the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I felt it was necessary for us as heads of the Department to reach that decision.”

Mueller submitted his full report to Barr in late March. Days later, Barr released a four-page summary of the findings, noting Mueller’s team found no evidence that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russians during the 2016 presidential election. Barr and Rosenstein, who resigned earlier this month from the Justice Department, stated in the summary that the evidence was not sufficient to charge the president with an obstruction of justice offense.

Barr made his comments to CBS News one day after Mueller made the first and only public statement of his tenure as special counsel in which the former FBI director announced the official end of his investigation, his resignation from the Justice Department, and explained his investigatory decisions.

TRUMP BLASTS MUELLER HAS 'HIGHLY CONFLICTED,' CALLS IMPEACHMENT A 'DIRTY, FILTHY, DISGUSTING WORD'

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said Wednesday at the Justice Department. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”

Mueller explained the longstanding Justice Department policy, which states that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, noting that “charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider.”

“We concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime,” Mueller added. “That is the office’s final position.”

Mueller added Wednesday that it would be “unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”

Mueller also said that “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing,”—a statement some on the left took as a green light to intensify talks about impeachment proceedings.

When asked if he thought Mueller was suggesting Congress could be the “venue” to hold the president accountable, Barr said he was “not sure.”

“Well, I’m not sure what he was suggesting,” Barr said. “You know, the Department of Justice doesn’t use our powers of investigating crime as an adjunct to Congress.”

But congressional Democrats and even some 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have seized on Mueller’s public statements and called for impeachment proceedings to begin.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose committee would lead any potential impeachment proceedings, said Wednesday that “all options are on the table.”

“Given that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was unable to pursue criminal charges against the President, it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump—and we will do so,” Nadler said in a statement. “No one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law.”

The president blasted Mueller on Thursday as “highly conflicted,” and claimed that Mueller “would have brought charges” against him in the Russia probe if he had “anything,” but maintained that “there were no charges to bring, and called the idea of impeachment a “scam.”

“I don’t see how they can,” Trump told reporters from the White House lawn Thursday. “It’s a dirty, filthy disgusting word, impeach. It’s high crimes—there was no high crime. So how do you impeach?”

Meanwhile, Barr, who has fallen under intense scrutiny over his handling of the Russia report, appointed U.S. attorney from Connecticut John Durham to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation.

Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for defying the panel’s subpoena requiring that he turn over an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, as well as underlying documents and evidence. In turn, the president asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect those files from release.

Despite the criticism, Mueller defended Barr on Wednesday.

“We conducted an independent criminal investigation and reported the results to the attorney general,” Mueller explained. “The attorney general then concluded that it was appropriate to provide our report to Congress and the American people.”

Mueller said that he requested that only “portions of the report be released,” but that Barr “preferred to make the entire report public all at once,” –a move Mueller said he and the special counsel team “appreciate.”

“I do not question the attorney general’s good faith in that decision,” Mueller said."
State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law',https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Commission on Unalienable Rights will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a move that has surprised and puzzled human rights activists. | Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images foreign policy State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law'

The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.

The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.

Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.

The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signal a religious component, experts said.

Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.

“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.

The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.

The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.

Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.

State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.

But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.

Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.

“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”

“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.

Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.

The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.

The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.

But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.

It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.

According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."
"Trump vows 'dramatic' action at border, as DHS vows to go after human smugglers",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-vows-dramatic-action-border-dhs-vows-human/story?id=63372471,"President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed ""very dramatic"" action to address the refugee crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, saying he would make a ""big league statement"" later in the day or Friday, but otherwise providing few details on how he planned to up the pressure on his signature and divisive issue.

""It will be a statement having to do with the border and having to do with people illegally coming over the border,"" Trump said."" And it will be my biggest statement, so far, on the border. We have brought something to the light of the people. They see now it's a national emergency, and most people agree. The Democrats agree, too, but they won't give us the legislation you need to fix it.""

The president teased the announcement as he left the White House on a trip to Colorado but revealed little when reporters pressed him for more.

""Right now, when you catch somebody, you have to release them,"" Trump answered, blaming Democrats. ""They won't give us the legislation. Whether it's chain migration or whether it's a lottery, they won't give us any. And the asylum procedures are ridiculous. No place in the world has what we have in terms of ridiculous immigration laws.""

Trump's latest political move on illegal immigration comes as administration officials told ABC News in Guatemala that they are now targeting transportation networks for migrants with the same focus and effort as drug smugglers.

It’s the latest push by the administration to try to contain the crisis at the border that’s overwhelmed border communities and tested Trump’s “America First"" policy.

Migrants families are arriving in record numbers this year, with officials expecting to handle some 1 million people at the southern border this year -- double the number of last year. The reasons are complex, ranging from poverty to threats from gangs to weather-related disasters that have wiped out farmland.

The Trump administration also blames court-ordered limits on the ability to detain children past 20 days, insisting that has only encouraged travelers to bring children with the promise of a quick release where they will able to live and work waiting for an overwhelmed immigration court system to take up their case.

Critics counter that the president has done little to address the humanitarian crisis in Central America and say his threats to close the border and build a wall may have even encouraged the latest rush of asylum seekers.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan tells ABC’s Matt Gutman in an interview in Guatemala this week that he was visiting the country to forge a new relationship with the country's security forces. The goal is to break up human smuggling networks that are charging people some $6,000 to $7,000 to reach the U.S.

McAleenan called Guatemala the ""epicenter"" of the migration issue with 40 percent of the migrants arriving at the border coming from there.

""We've got to work with them here to address these smugglers at the front end of the process,"" McAleenan said in the interview.

That view – addressing the root cause of the migration and going after transportation networks -- has long been pushed by the Homeland Security Department, including under McAleenan's predecessor Kirstjen Nielsen. But with the president's repeated promise of ""America First,"" Trump has shown little appetite – at least publicly – to address the crisis through diplomatic channels and foreign aid.

This spring, the State Department announced Trump wanted to cut all direct assistance to Guatemala, as well as El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries that represent the vast majority of asylum seekers arriving at the U.S. border.

Doug Collins suspects ex-FBI leaker is Peter Strzok,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doug-collins-suspects-ex-fbi-leaker-is-peter-strzok,"A top Republican wants to know if a high-ranking FBI official who leaked ""sensitive"" information and improperly accepted a gift from the media was Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who is well known for his text messages displaying a negative opinion of President Trump.

Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, wrote letters to Attorney General William Barr and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on Thursday with questions about the DOJ watchdog's investigation into FBI misconduct.

In his letter to Horowitz, Collins asked about a one-page report released on Wednesday that found a now-former FBI deputy assistant director “engaged in misconduct” by disclosing information to the media that had been filed under seal in federal court, maintaining dozens of unauthorized contacts with reporters, and accepting a $225 ticket from a member of the media to attend a dinner sponsored by the media.

The Georgia congressman said he has reason to believe Strzok was the unnamed former official.

""While the DAD is not named in the Summary, there are several indications the DAD in question is former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok,"" Collins said. ""For example, the 2018 Report noted, 'Peter Strzok is an experienced counterintelligence agent who was promoted to Deputy Assistant Director (DAD) of the Espionage Section in September 2016.' The 2018 Report also said, '[m]ost troubling, on October 29, 2016, Strzok forwarded from his FBI account to his personal email account an email about the proposed search warrant the Midyear team was seeking on the Weiner laptop. This email included a draft of the search warrant affidavit, which contained information from the Weiner investigation that appears to have been under seal at the time in the Southern District of New York . . .'""

Collins asked Horowitz if Strzok is the individual referenced in the report and pressed the inspector general and Barr on whether prosecution was declined. Despite the FBI official's violations of bureau policy, the inspector general said “prosecution of the [deputy assistant director] was declined"" and the matter was being referred to the FBI for ""appropriate action.""

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server. Upon the discovery of these texts, Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation and was later fired from the bureau.

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Among these texts was a reference to a ""media leak strategy,"" which raised concerns last fall among Republican lawmakers and Trump. Despite warnings about ""troubling evidence that the practice of coordinated media interactions"" with the Justice Department and FBI, Strzok's lawyer Aitan Goelman said the term ""media leak strategy"" in his client’s messages refered to a DOJ-wide initiative to detect and stop aides sharing information with the media. ""The President and his enablers are once again peddling unfounded conspiracy theories to mislead the American People,"" Goelman said in a written statement.

Collins, who set a June 7 deadline, also asked Barr and Horowitz about the existence of other investigations into other former FBI officials, including former General Counsel James Baker, former Director James Comey, and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

""Leaking classified and sealed material is a dangerous, illegal action. The DOJ's declination to prosecute leaks is concerning and only emboldens leakers to continue their reckless actions,"" Collins said in a tweet.

Barr testified this month that the Justice Department has ""multiple criminal leak investigations underway.”"
'Molecules of freedom': US Energy Department tries rebranding natural gas,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/molecules-freedom-us-energy-department-rebranding-natural-gas/story?id=63366255,"In a press release touting exports of natural gas, the Department of Energy referred to the fossil fuel as ""molecules of U.S. freedom.""

The statement, dated May 28, issued from the Tenth Clean Energy Ministerial in Vancouver, British Columbia, was touting a natural gas facility on Quintana Island in Texas.

An expansion of the Freeport LNG Terminal -- with ""LNG"" referring to natural gas that's liquefied, for easier transport -- will support 3,000 additional engineering and construction jobs, the department said in the statement.

""Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America's allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy,"" said Under Secretary of Energy Mark Menezes. ""Further, more exports of U.S. LNG to the world means more U.S. jobs and more domestic economic growth and cleaner air here at home and around the globe.""

Menezes added: ""There's no doubt today's announcement furthers this Administration's commitment to promoting energy security and diversity worldwide.""

Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg, who signed the export order and also attended the Clean Energy Ministerial, said he was ""pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of U.S. freedom to be exported to the world.""

The department said it expects domestic natural gas production to reach record rates this year and again in 2020.

Natural gas burns cleaner than coal, according to data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, contributing about 117 pounds of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere per million British thermal units compared with 200 pounds from coal. Natural gas leaks also are responsible for about one-third of all U.S. emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to climate change."
Wyden threatens to hold nominees over Trump tax return defiance,https://www.politico.com,['Bernie Becker'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/wyden-threatens-nominee-holds-over-tax-return-response-1489740,"Sen. Ron Wyden said the Treasury Department's response to congressional requests for the president's tax returns was “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.” | AP Photo/Cliff Owen finance & tax Wyden threatens to hold nominees over Trump tax return defiance

Sen. Ron Wyden threatened on Thursday to put a hold on Treasury Department nominees unless the administration offers fuller answers about congressional efforts to obtain President Donald Trump’s tax returns.

Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, had pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a letter this month about the administration’s handling of House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal’s request for Trump’s returns. He said Thursday that the department’s response — which came not from Mnuchin, but from Justin Sok of Treasury’s legislative affairs office — was “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.”

Story Continued Below

“If the Treasury Department refuses to answer our questions, I am prepared to again place a hold on department nominees as I did previously when routine requests for information went unanswered,” the Oregon Democrat added. “Congress needs to take action to force the administration to comply with oversight.”

Wyden had already said last week that Brent McIntosh, Treasury’s general counsel and Trump’s nominee to be Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, “needs to be prepared to thoroughly answer” questions about his role in the department’s refusal to comply with Neal’s request and a subsequent subpoena if he wanted the position.

Several other Treasury nominees could face a hold: Brian McGuire for assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Michael Faulkender for assistant secretary for economic policy, Brian Callanan for general counsel and Geoffrey William Seiji Okamoto for deputy undersecretary.

In his letter to Mnuchin this month, Wyden asked how often tax committees had sought tax return information this century and how frequently that request has been handled by the Treasury secretary instead of the IRS commissioner.

Sok’s response maintained that Neal’s request was “categorically different” than previous committee requests for “statistical data to inform the drafting of tax legislation,” similar to the arguments that Mnuchin has made in public. Mnuchin repeatedly has said that Neal’s stated reason for requesting Trump’s returns — to conduct fuller oversight of the IRS’ capabilities in its routine auditing of presidents — is a cover and that Democrats are merely seeking ways to embarrass the president.

Wyden placed holds on Treasury nominees last year — including Justin Muzinich, Trump’s choice to be deputy secretary — because he believed the administration was stonewalling requests for oversight information. Muzinich was confirmed in December.

Fact-checking Trump's flurry of falsehoods and lies after Mueller declined to exonerate him,https://www.cnn.com,['Marshall Cohen'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/politics/fact-checking-trump-mueller-claims/index.html,"Washington (CNN) One day after special counsel Robert Mueller publicly refused to exonerate President Donald Trump and hinted at potential impeachment, the President responded Thursday with an avalanche of widely debunked lies about the investigation and its findings.

Over a few hours Thursday morning, Trump spread at least 21 lies and falsehoods about the Russia investigation, Mueller's findings, the cost of the probe, and the legal restrictions that Mueller faced when grappling with the possibility of a President who broke the law.

Here's a breakdown of Trump's comments.

Cost of the investigation

In a tweet , Trump said the Mueller probe cost ""$40,000,000 over two dark years.""

Facts First: It's not clear where Trump is getting his numbers. The latest information from the Justice Department goes through September and says Mueller-specific expenses were around $12 million. Mueller's final price tag will be higher than that, but the data isn't public yet.

The Justice Department spent another $13 million investigating Russian meddling, costs that would have been incurred even if Mueller weren't appointed. That's a total of $25 million, though the price tag will be higher because that doesn't cover the last seven months of the probe. It's unlikely that the final amount for Mueller will reach the $40 million figure claimed by Trump.

Cooperation with the probe

In a tweet , Trump said Mueller had ""unlimited access, people, resources and cooperation.""

Facts First: The White House largely cooperated with the investigation, but it's wrong to say there was ""unlimited"" cooperation. Trump repeatedly refused a sit-down interview with Mueller's team. Some Trump campaign associates ""deleted relevant communications"" or gave conflicting information. Others lied to investigators and were charged with obstruction offenses.

Trump submitted written testimony about Russian meddling but refused to answer any questions about obstruction. Mueller made it clear that Trump's responses were ""incomplete"" and insufficient. The President's son, Donald Trump Jr., also declined an in-person interview.

At least three Trump associates were charged with lying to investigators, which is an obstructive act, and two others were charged with lying to congressional inquiries about Russian meddling.

Mueller's conflicts of interest

In a tweet , Trump said Mueller was ""highly conflicted.""

Facts First: Mueller did not have conflicts of interest, and Trump knows it. The Justice Department cleared Mueller of any conflicts when he took the job in 2017. Trump's top aides told him that these perceived conflicts were ""ridiculous"" and were not considered true conflicts.

Trump has long claimed that Mueller was conflicted for a few reasons: Because he once sought a refund from a Trump-owned golf course, because he interviewed to be FBI director after Trump fired James Comey in 2017, and because his old law firm represented key figures in the investigation.

When Trump raised these concerns with his top aides, they ""pushed back on his assertion of conflicts, telling the President they did not count as true conflicts,"" according to the Mueller report. These White House aides included former chief strategist Steve Bannon, former chief of staff Reince Priebus and former White House counsel Don McGahn, according to the report.

Legal constraints on Mueller

In a tweet , Trump said, ""Robert Mueller would have brought charges, if he had ANYTHING, but there were no charges to bring!""

Facts First: This is the opposite of the truth. Mueller's hands were tied by longstanding Justice Department guidelines that a sitting President can't be indicted. In his public comments this week, Mueller specifically said charging Trump was ""not an option we could consider.""

Mueller made it clear in his public comments on Wednesday that the guidelines had a significant influence on the investigation, tying his hands from the very start from even considering whether a crime had been committed. Trump is therefore creating a false narrative by asserting that Mueller ""would have brought charges"" if there was evidence Trump broke the law.

In fact, Mueller's report presented substantial evidence that Trump obstructed justice on a few fronts. But Mueller didn't offer a conclusion on whether Trump should be prosecuted, because he was bound by Justice Department guidelines that stopped him from even considering it.

Fairness of the investigation

In a tweet , Trump called the Mueller probe a ""witch hunt,"" a label he has used for two years to suggest that the investigation was unfairly targeting him and would bring him down at any cost.

Facts First: If the investigation really were a ""witch hunt,"" things might have been very different. But Mueller said that the facts didn't lead him to a collusion conspiracy, and he repeatedly declined to use hardball tactics against Trump, like issuing a subpoena for his testimony.

First, Mueller went to great lengths to be fair to Trump and said there was not a collusion conspiracy. He didn't play hardball and subpoena Trump's testimony, and he followed the rules that restrained him from charging Trump. If this was a ""witch hunt,"" it wasn't a very good one.

In his comments, Mueller stressed how it would be unfair to Trump to accuse him of a crime without Trump having a legal venue to clear his name, because he couldn't go on trial while in office. Mueller even said it's ""prohibited"" to seek a sealed indictment of Trump for later on.

Many of Trump's top appointees and associates, like FBI Director Chris Wray and former White House lawyer Ty Cobb, have broken with the President and publicly rejected the ""witch hunt"" label. Even Barr rejected the term during his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, specifically saying that Mueller wouldn't be involved in a witch hunt.

Concerns about Russian meddling

In a tweet , Trump said ""Russia has disappeared"" from the public debate because the Mueller investigation did not establish a conspiracy of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.

Facts First: The topic of Russian interference is still at the forefront of national politics.

Mueller zeroed in on Russian meddling during his public comments, solemnly saying, ""I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments, that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. And that allegation deserves the attention of every American.""

Top US intelligence officials have warned about Russia's continued efforts to undermine American politics. Democratic presidential candidates are bringing it up on the campaign trail, and lawmakers are asking about it at Congressional hearings with administration officials.

Trump's handpicked chiefs to lead the US intelligence community have continued to raise the alarm about persistent Russian meddling. And many of the Democratic candidates for president, including frontrunner Joe Biden, feature their positions on how to counter Russia on their websites.

Trump's role in Russian meddling

In a tweet , Trump said, ""I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected.""

Facts First: The Mueller investigation did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump and the Russians. But Trump's tweet ignores his role in promoting the fruits of Russian hacks during the 2016 campaign, which he embraced and amplified at his rallies and on social media.

To be completely clear: Mueller never accused Trump, or any Trump aides, or any Americans for that matter, of criminally conspiring with the Russian government to influence the election.

But that doesn't mean Trump played no role whatsoever, even if it wasn't criminal. Instead of denouncing Russia for intervening in US politics, Trump embraced their actions and used his platform, and his campaign apparatus, to amplify Russian meddling. He regularly cited the emails that Russian hackers stole from Democrats and gave to WikiLeaks for publication.

In his tweet, Trump seemed to accidentally acknowledge for the first time, that Russia tried to help him defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. (This is the assessment of Obama-era intelligence officials and Trump's handpicked appointees.) But later Thursday morning, Trump walked back this part of his tweet, saying ""Russia did not help me get elected.""

Mueller's findings on obstruction

In a tweet , Trump said, ""Mueller didn't find Obstruction either.""

Facts First: This is patently false. Mueller did uncover substantial evidence of obstruction by Trump and the report detailed how Trump's actions crossed the legal threshold on several key episodes. But Mueller said he was prohibited from recommending criminal charges and struggled with ""difficult issues"" of investigating a sitting President. Instead, he alluded to Congress' role in holding a president accountable.

The report details a few incidents with ""substantial evidence"" that Trump obstructed justice, including his efforts to fire the special counsel and have McGahn lie about it to the press, as well as Trump's efforts to influence the cooperation of several key witnesses in the investigation.

""Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations,"" the report said.

Regarding the obstruction inquiry, Mueller said Wednesday , ""if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so."" Mueller submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, who announced in March his conclusion that Trump didn't break the law. Trump's tweet would have been accurate if he cited Barr instead of Mueller.

More obstruction of justice findings

In comments on the White House lawn, Trump said, ""There's no obstruction, you see what we're saying, there's no obstruction, there's no collusion, there is no nothing.""

Facts First: As explained, Mueller found substantial evidence that Trump obstructed justice on a few fronts, but the special counsel didn't make a determination on whether the President had committed a crime. After Mueller submitted his report, Barr concluded that Trump hadn't broken the law. But it's inaccurate for Trump to say there was ""no obstruction"" when the report clearly identifies obstructive acts.

It's true that Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy of collusion. But unlike Trump and Barr, Mueller never used the ""no collusion"" phrase. He was more careful, saying, ""There was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy"" between Trump aides and Russia.

But Mueller was crystal clear in his public comments Wednesday that he was not clearing Trump of obstruction. He implicitly rebuked Barr's finding of ""no obstruction"" by stating, ""If we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.""

Mueller's perceived conflicts

In comments on the White House lawn, Trump repeated lies about Mueller's conflicts of interest that he had shared earlier on Twitter. Trump said: ""I think he's totally conflicted, because, as you know, he wanted to be the FBI director and I said no. As you know, I had a business dispute with him after he left the FBI, we had a business dispute, not a nice one, he wasn't happy with what I did, and I don't blame him, but I had to do it because that was the right thing to do.""

JUST WATCHED Trump: Look, Mueller should have never been chosen Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Look, Mueller should have never been chosen 01:39

Facts First: Mueller did not have conflicts of interest, and Trump knows it. The Justice Department cleared Mueller of any conflicts when he took the job in 2017. Trump's top aides told him that these perceived conflicts were ""ridiculous"" and were not considered true conflicts.

Trump's claim that Mueller aggressively sought the FBI job is contradicted by Bannon's testimony to investigators. Mueller cited Bannon's testimony extensively in his report.

Trump did meet with Mueller at the White House in May 2017, one day before Mueller became the special counsel. But the White House extended the invitation for Mueller to offer insights on the FBI, and Mueller wasn't looking for the job, according to the report.

The ""business dispute"" dates back to 2011, when Mueller quit his membership at Trump's golf club in Virginia and requested a refund. The club replied with a letter saying that the refund would be explored, and there was no further contact, according to the Mueller report.

Trump knows that these perceived conflicts are not real conflicts because his top aides repeatedly told him in 2017, according to their testimony outlined in the Mueller report.

Mueller's relationship with Comey

In comments on the White House lawn, Trump said Mueller ""loves Comey,"" and added, ""You look at the relationship that those two -- so whether it's love or deep like -- he was conflicted."" Trump later said Mueller's ""relationship with Comey was extraordinary"" and that they were ""best friends.""

Facts First: Trump has said many times that Mueller was close friends with Comey, but there isn't any evidence to support that. They crossed paths at the FBI and the Justice Department for many years, but Comey has said in congressional testimony that they are not friends.

Since the beginning of the Mueller investigation, Trump has exaggerated the relationship between Mueller and Comey. By all accounts, they are professional associates but not close friends. Trump has said, with no evidence, that they ""love"" each other and are ""best friends.""

Speaking to lawmakers last year during a private deposition , Comey said of Mueller, ""I admire the heck out of the man, but I don't know his phone number, I've never been to his house, I don't know his children's names. I think I had a meal once alone with him in a restaurant. I like him. I'm an associate of his who admires him greatly. We're not friends in any social sense.""

Mueller has not characterized his relationship with Comey. Regardless, Justice Department ethics officials gave Mueller a green light to lead the probe when he was tapped in 2017.

Interviewing Mueller for the FBI job

In comments on the White House lawn, Trump continued harping on Mueller's perceived conflicts, saying that he ""should have never been chosen because he wanted the FBI job and he didn't get it and the next day he was picked as special counsel. So you tell somebody, 'I'm sorry, you can't have the job,' and then after you say that, he's going to make a ruling on you.""

Trump later said Mueller ""requested"" the job and ""wanted very badly"" to be FBI director again.

Trump later tweeted : ""Robert Mueller came to the Oval Office (along with other potential candidates) seeking to be named the Director of the FBI. He had already been in that position for 12 years, I told him NO. The next day he was named Special Counsel - A total Conflict of Interest. NICE!""

Facts First: As explained earlier, the President's false comments are belied by the Mueller report. The report cites testimony from Bannon, a staunch Trump ally, that contradicts Trump's claims.

The Mueller report says this about the interview: ""As for Mueller's interview for FBI Director, Bannon recalled that the White House had invited Mueller to speak to the President to offer a perspective on the institution of the FBI. Bannon said that, although the White House thought about beseeching Mueller to become Director again, he did not come in looking for the job.""

Though Mueller did accept the President's invitation to come to the White House to discuss the FBI, there isn't any public evidence to support Trump's claim that Mueller ""wanted the FBI job.""

Comey's supposed 'lies'

In comments on the White House lawn, Trump asked why Mueller didn't investigate ""Comey and all the lies."" He asked, ""Why didn't Comey come clean and say the things that he knows are fact?""

Facts First: It's unclear exactly what Trump is referring to here. But after an exhaustive investigation, Mueller found Comey to be a credible and reliable witness, especially when testifying about Trump's troubling interactions with him before he was fired in May 2017.

Taken at face value, Trump's comments are hypocritical. His version of his conversations with Comey was largely dismissed by Mueller, yet he is accusing Comey of being a liar. Mueller agreed with Comey's testimony that Trump asked for his loyalty and that he drop the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump has denied it all

""Despite those denials,"" the report says, ""substantial evidence corroborates Comey's account,"" and that ""Comey's recollections of the encounter have remained consistent over time.""

Regarding the need to ""come clean,"" one way to measure that would be examining a person's willingness to testify under oath, under penalty of perjury. Trump submitted written questions to Mueller on a narrow scope of topics, but refused an in-person interview.

On the other hand, Comey was interviewed by Mueller, publicly testified in 2017 before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and gave two days of private depositions last year for the House Republican-led inquiry into how the FBI handled the Clinton probe and the Russia probe.

The infamous 'insurance policy'

In comments on the White House lawn, Trump asked, ""Why didn't they investigate the insurance policy?"" He continued, ""In other words, should Hillary Clinton lose, we've got an insurance policy. Guess what, what we're in right now is the insurance policy.""

Facts First: Trump is repeating one of his favorite conspiracy theories, which claims that hostile forces inside the FBI hatched a plan to stop him from winning the election. The theory doesn't make much sense. The participants, who have been publicly disgraced by their anti-Trump text messages and their extramarital affair, have offered a more reasonable explanation.

The two former FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, mentioned an ""insurance policy"" in text messages they exchanged in August 2016 about early efforts to investigate Trump's campaign aides. Their message said, in part: ""there's no way he gets elected -- but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40.""

Strzok tried to explain the context in a public hearing last year: The FBI was getting information about links between Trump aides and Russians. But Trump was far behind Clinton in the polls, and FBI officials were trying to decide how aggressively to follow the Russia leads. Strzok said his view was that ""we need to do our job"" so the threats would be assessed if Trump won.

""While it isn't likely according to all the pollsters and everybody that candidate Trump is going to be elected, we need to make sure we are protecting America,"" Strzok testified, offering similar reasoning that Page gave during her private depositions with congressional investigators.

Last year, Strzok was fired from the FBI and Page resigned. The Justice Department's internal watchdog was harshly critical of their anti-Trump texts and said it ""cast a cloud"" over the investigation, though the internal review did not find any evidence that their political opinions affected their decisions regarding the Clinton email investigation.

Russia's support for Trump

In comments on the White House lawn, Trump said: ""Russia did not help me get elected. Do you know who got me elected? I got me elected. Russia didn't help me at all. Russia, if anything, I think, helped the other side."" He later went even further, saying, ""I believe that Russia would rather have Hillary Clinton as president of the United States than Donald Trump.

Facts First: Trump is entitled to his own views. But he stands alone in his belief that the Russians did not try to help his campaign and instead tried to boost Clinton. The US intelligence community announced after the 2016 election that the Kremlin tried to help Trump, a conclusion that has been endorsed by all of Trump's handpicked officials to lead the intelligence agencies.

The stunning assessment that the Russian government tried to help Trump win was first made public in a January 2017 report, released by the Director of National Intelligence, which included unanimous assessments from the FBI, the CIA and the National Security Agency.

""We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,"" the intelligence report said. ""...We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.""

This report was prepared during the Obama administration. But Trump's own appointees at the FBI, CIA and NSA, as well as Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, have all publicly endorsed these conclusions. Additionally, the Senate Intelligence Committee conducted a bipartisan review of the intelligence assessment and said it fully agreed with the findings.

Trump obviously deserves credit for his historic upset victory, and for focusing on disaffected voters in the Midwest. But he's wrong when he says Russia ""didn't help me at all"" in 2016.

It's not about collusion or coordination with the campaign. It's about the wide-ranging Russian campaign to influence American voters, largely in Trump's favor. For instance, Russian propaganda reached 126 million Americans on Facebook, and other social media platforms.

And the Russians hacked Democratic targets and released their emails through WikiLeaks at pivotal moments in the campaign, including during the Democratic National Convention and after the leak of the Access Hollywood tape that featured Trump making offensive comments about women. These hacks, carried out by Russian military officers , gave Trump a massive boost.

Ties between Trump aides and Russians

On the White House lawn, Trump said : ""You take a look at collusion between Hillary Clinton and Russia. She had more to do in the campaign with Russia than I did. I had nothing to do.""

Facts First: This is a lie, plain and simple. Trump's claim that Clinton had ""more to do ... with Russia"" during the campaign is provably false. No connections have emerged between Clinton's campaign and Russian officials. But about 200 pages of the Mueller report are devoted to detailing the plethora of links between Trump campaign associates and Russians.

Even before the Mueller report came out, at least 16 Trump associates were known to have been in contact with Russians during the campaign or transition. More links were revealed in the report, though the investigation did not find that there was any illegal cooperation or collusion.

Also, when Trump said he ""had nothing to do"" with Russia, he is reviving a phrase that he falsely repeated during the 2016 campaign and during his first few months in the White House. It's clear now -- and has been clear for nearly two years -- that Trump and his world had extensive Russian ties, relating both to the election and his personal business empire.

Perhaps the most substantial link was Trump's pursuit of a business deal in Russia during the campaign. Negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow took place while Trump was running for president, and he could have made millions from the deal, but it ultimately fell through.

Obama's effort to stop Russian interference

On the White House lawn , Trump said: ""President Obama was told in 2016 just before the election in September (2016) that Russia may try to interfere with the election. He did nothing.""

Facts First: Lawmakers from both political parties agree Obama could have done more, but it's not true to say that he ""did nothing."" For one, in a face-to-face meeting with Putin before the 2016 election, Obama threatened ""serious consequences"" if Russia did not stop interfering. After the election, Obama imposed new sanctions and expelled dozens of Russian diplomats.

When Obama met Putin in September 2016, he demanded that Russia stop its effort to disrupt the presidential election. According to Obama , he told Putin ""to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequences if he didn't."" Obama claims that after the warning, ""we did not see further tampering of the election process,"" like efforts to manipulate vote totals on Election Day.

In October 2016, the Obama administration publicly announced that the Russians were interfering in the election and were responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee. This staggering announcement came in a paper statement from two US intelligence chiefs, not from Obama directly, and it was quickly overshadowed by the ""Access Hollywood"" tape of Trump, which came out the same day.

After the election, the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russian individuals and companies believed to be involved with election interference. Obama also expelled 35 Russian diplomats and shut down two Russian compounds that the US said were used for spying.

Many politicians and even some senior Democratic members of Congress have criticized the Obama administration for not going far enough in actions against Russia. But it's false to say that Obama ""did nothing"" when he did take steps before and after the 2016 election.

Cracking down on Russian aggression

On the White House lawn , Trump said, ""Nobody has been tougher on Russia than me."" He touted his energy policy, which is supportive of oil pipelines and natural gas fracking, his decision to send weapons to Ukraine and the new sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs.

""Whether it's a whole host of things, there is nobody (who's) ever been more tough or difficult for Russia than Donald Trump,"" he said. ""I have to tell you this, I put sanctions on Russia at a level that nobody has seen before. Nobody even wants to write about it.""

Facts First: Trump is right that his administration has cracked down on Russia on a few fronts. But there is a difference between the Trump administration's actions and the President's own statements, which have been more Russia-friendly than those of any president in modern history.

The President counted off a few of his policies that are tightening the screws on Russia. The Pentagon's move to arm the Ukrainians in their fight against Kremlin-backed proxies was a blow to Moscow. So were the Treasury Department's unprecedented sanctions against Russian oligarchs who are known for doing Putin's bidding around the world.

But this is only one side of the equation. While his administration gets tough on Russia, Trump has repeatedly bucked its moves by echoing Kremlin talking points and praising Putin.

Trump has repeatedly criticized the NATO alliance, which Putin despises. Trump has suggested that the Russians could keep Crimea, the Ukrainian territory they invaded and annexed in 2014. Over and over, Trump has sided with Putin's denials on the questions of US election interference. His plan to withdraw US troops from Syria also would give Putin an edge in the region.

Last year, Trump congratulated Putin on his reelection, even though his senior national security advisers told him not to . ( Independent observers concluded that the Russian election, where Putin secured 76% of the vote, was not conducted under fair and democratic conditions.)

The mantra of 'no collusion'

Trump said on the White House lawn, ""There was no collusion. Read volume one. There was no collusion."" This is a reference to the first volume of Mueller's report, which focused on Russia.

Facts First: Volume I of Mueller's report does not say there was ""no collusion"" or ""no evidence"" of collusion. The conclusions were more nuanced than that. As Mueller explained on Wednesday, the investigation found ""insufficient evidence"" to charge a conspiracy with Russia.

In his new conference, Mueller said out loud what was carefully written in his sweeping report: ""The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election. This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign's response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.""

Obviously, ""insufficient evidence"" is different from ""no evidence."" To be crystal clear, the investigation did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump aides and the Kremlin.

But Trump is whitewashing the collusion-related evidence that Mueller documented in Volume I. The special counsel found ""multiple links"" between Trump's campaign and Russian agents. He found that top people in Trump's orbit were ""receptive"" to offers of Russian help with the election. And he found that the campaign ""expected it would benefit electorally"" from illegal Russian interference.

What 'no charges' really means

On the White House lawn , Trump said, ""There were no charges. None.... That means you're innocent. That means you're innocent."" Trump continued to make the case that because Mueller had not brought any criminal charges, that ""he said essentially, you're innocent.""

Facts First: That's not how the system works, and Mueller specifically said the opposite during his news conference and several times in his report. He said that if his team of prosecutors had determined with confidence that Trump was innocent, they would have said so. They declined.

The investigation featured a unique situation where a federal prosecutor was investigating the sitting President -- someone who is immune from prosecution while in office. Because of those restraints, Mueller said he never considered charging Trump because it was ""not an option.""

That put Mueller in a tough spot. He investigated Trump but even if he found evidence of wrongdoing, he couldn't charge the President. After two years, Mueller decided he would not clear Trump.

He made this very obvious on Wednesday, saying, ""If we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so."" Additionally, on three separate occasions , the report declared, ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.""

The ""if ... then"" construction that Trump is following is not what happened in this investigation.

The report said: ""While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" That's a very far cry from ""you're innocent,"" as Trump claimed.

Presidential powers

In comments on the White House lawn, Trump cited Article II of the US Constitution, suggesting that it provided powers that he could use to battle charges against him.

""Someday you ought to read a thing called Article II,"" Trump said. ""Read Article II which gives the President powers that you wouldn't believe, but I don't even have to rely on Article II. There was no crime, there was no obstruction, there was no collusion, there was no nothing.""

Facts First: While Article II outlines presidential powers and gives the president While vast authorities, it does not give Trump the ability to skirt investigations and accountability from Congress. And Mueller resoundingly rejected this argument when Trump's lawyers tried to make it.

Article II of the US Constitution lays out the President's duties and powers including his abilities as commander in chief of the military, as well as the procedure to elect and remove a president. In his report, Mueller acknowledged that the Constitution gives Trump, ""unique and powerful means of influencing official proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses.""

It's unclear which part of Article II Trump believes would empower him to ""fight back"" against an unfair investigation. In letters to the special counsel, Trump's lawyers argued that Article II essentially shielded Trump from even being investigated for taking actions that he is legally allowed to. This includes removing the FBI director, like he did with Comey in May 2017.

""Even if that Comey argument were correct, there are other elements of obstruction of justice that a president can commit, that a president can be impeached and later indicted for,"" Georgetown Law professor Susan Low Bloch told CNN, noting that the articles of impeachment brought against presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon included alleged obstruction offenses.

Mueller's team agreed with that, and rejected the legal theories promoted by Trump's lawyers.

The Constitution does not give the President ""unfettered authority to direct investigations or prosecutions, with no limits whatsoever,"" Mueller wrote. Prosecutors also concluded that ""we had a valid basis for investigating"" Trump's conduct and that such an investigation ""would not impermissibly burden the President's performance of his Article II function"" and authorities.

Ron Wyden of Oregon wrote. ""Congress needs to take action to force the administration to comply with oversight.""

Trump has broken with decades of presidential precedent by refusing to make his personal tax information public, and has retained his interest in the Trump Organization while in office.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has refused to comply with a subpoena from House Democrats for six years of Trump's tax returns, citing Department of Justice legal advice. Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal has requested the documents under an obscure statute that grants the heads of tax-writing committees access to tax returns for oversight purposes.

Trump has several nominees to the Treasury Department currently waiting for Senate confirmation, including agency general counsel Brent McIntosh, who has been nominated to be Treasury undersecretary for international affairs. Other nominees include Brian McGuire, nominee for assistant secretary for legislative affairs; Michael Faulkender, the nominee for assistant secretary of economic policy; Brian Callanan, the nominee for general counsel and Geoffrey William Seiji Okamoto, nominated for deputy undersecretary.

DOE Releases New Study Highlighting the Untapped Potential of Geothermal Energy in the United States,https://www.energy.gov,[],,,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-releases-new-study-highlighting-untapped-potential-geothermal-energy-united-states,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the U.S. Department of Energy released a groundbreaking analysis detailing how the United States can benefit from the vast potential of geothermal energy.

The analysis culminated in a report, GeoVision: Harnessing the Heat Beneath Our Feet, which summarizes findings showing that geothermal electricity generation could increase more than 26-fold from today—reaching 60 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity by 2050. In addition to describing electricity-generation opportunities, the GeoVision analysis also shows how geothermal can enhance heating and cooling solutions for American residential and commercial consumers through direct-use and heat-pump technologies.

“There is enormous untapped potential for geothermal energy in the United States,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. “Making geothermal more affordable can increase our energy options for a more diverse electricity generation mix and for innovative heating and cooling solutions for all Americans.”

The GeoVision analysis represents a multiyear collaboration among industry, academia, the National Laboratories, and federal agencies to evaluate the potential for different geothermal resources. The effort assessed opportunities to expand nationwide geothermal energy deployment through 2050 by improving technologies, reducing costs, and addressing project development barriers such as long permitting timelines.

In the electric sector, under business as usual, geothermal generation capacity will grow to 6 GW by 2050. By accelerating geothermal development timelines, geothermal capacity could more than double from business as usual, to 13 GW. Geothermal capacity could increase even further—to 60 GW—by combining faster development timelines with technology improvements.

In the non-electric sector, technology improvements could enable more than 17,500 geothermal district-heating installations nationwide, and 28 million U.S. households could realize cost-effective heating and cooling solutions through the use of geothermal heat pumps.

The analysis also examined economic benefits to the U.S. geothermal industry; investigated opportunities for desalination, mineral recovery, and hybridization with other energy technologies for greater efficiencies and lower costs; and quantified potential environmental impacts of increased geothermal deployment.

In addition to summarizing opportunities for geothermal energy in the United States, the GeoVision analysis includes a roadmap of actionable items for stakeholders to reduce technology costs and speed up project-development timelines.

"DOJ watchdog: Former FBI official illegally leaked court docs, disclosed 'sensitive' information and took gift from media",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-watchdog-finds-fmr-fbi-deputy-assistant-director-leaked-sensitive-information-took-gift-from-media-but-declines-prosecution,"The Justice Department's internal watchdog announced in an investigative summary released Wednesday that an unnamed former FBI deputy assistant director engaged in ""misconduct,"" including leaking ""sensitive"" information to the media, violating federal law by disclosing sealed court records and taking a gift from someone in the media.

Nevertheless, the inspector general (IG) indicated, without explanation, that ""prosecution of the DAD [deputy assistant director] was declined."" The investigation's findings will be referred to the FBI for potential further action, the IG said.

The official became the second high-level FBI employee to be formally rebuked by the IG over media contacts seen as improper. Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe was fired from the bureau in March 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions after an inspector general report revealed that he ""lacked candor"" when discussing his communications about federal probes with members of the media.

The IG first indicated in its June 2018 report on DOJ and FBI misconduct that ""although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed.""

The IG, flagging what it called an apparent ""cultural"" problem at the bureau, said at the time it would announce the conclusion of multiple separate ""investigations"" into the matter at a later date. The Wednesday report appeared to be the opening salvo in those reports. A distinct, comprehensive IG report covering a variety of additional matters, including potential FBI surveillance abuses, is expected in a matter of weeks.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, and John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, are conducting independent parallel probes into the FBI and DOJ. Last week, President Trump authorized Attorney General William Barr to declassify and release materials pertinent to the reviews.

The investigative summary released Wednesday specifically found by a preponderance of evidence that the DAD had ""engaged in misconduct when the DAD accepted a ticket, valued at approximately $225, to attend a media-sponsored dinner, as a gift from a member of the media, in violation of federal regulations and FBI policy.""

STRZOK'S SPECIAL COUNSEL PHONE TOTALLY WIPED BY RECORDS OFFICER WHO ASSUMED NOTHING IMPORTANT WAS ON THERE

The report also assessed that the DAD ""disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal in federal court, in violation of 18 USC § 401, Contempt of Court, provided without authorization FBI law enforcement sensitive information to reporters on multiple occasions; and had dozens of official contacts with the media without authorization, in violation of FBI policy."" Contempt of court can be punished by a jail term or a fine, at the court's discretion.

Media leaks played a central role in advancing the narrative that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Russia, and Republican lawmakers have charged that the FBI and DOJ planted sensitive information to further their own political and investigative goals.

The FBI, for example, extensively relied on news articles -- including one from Yahoo News -- to obtain a surveillance warrant to monitor former Trump aide Carter Page. The FBI did not inform the FISA court that the Yahoo article relied on a source that, according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the FBI knew was politically motivated. Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News also show FBI brass fretting that a senior DOJ officials had similar concerns about a FISA source's bias.

And text messages between ex-FBI employees and former lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, unearthed last year, revealed that government officials were ""leaking like mad"" in the run-up to the Trump-Russia collusion probe.

""In addition to the significant number of communications between FBI employees and journalists, we identified social interactions between FBI employees and journalists that were, at a minimum, inconsistent with FBI policy and department ethics rules,"" the IG wrote in June. ""For example, we identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.""

The IG concluded by describing ""the harm caused by leaks, fear of potential leaks, and a culture of unauthorized media contacts.""

""We do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,"" the IG added. ""Rather, we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.""

U.S. police chiefs call for meeting with Homeland Security over immigration issues,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tom Jackman', 'Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally', 'May At Pm']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/05/30/us-police-chiefs-call-meeting-with-homeland-security-over-immigration-issues/,"

Houston police Chief Art Acevedo presides over a meeting of the Major Cities Chiefs Association in Miami on Wednesday. (Major Cities Chiefs Association/Major Cities Chiefs Association)

MIAMI — The police chiefs of America’s largest cities on Thursday called on the federal Department of Homeland Security to meet with them as their departments struggle with the influx of immigrants from the southern border. The chiefs said they want to hear how federal immigration authorities plan to deal with relocating immigrants to their cities and how they will handle “sanctuary city” status declared by local governments, and the police want a voice in the federal policymaking process.

The Major Cities Chiefs Association, comprising the chiefs and sheriffs of the 69 largest law enforcement agencies in the United States, formed an immigration working group at its meeting here, led by Houston police Chief Art Acevedo, who has openly opposed a Texas law banning sanctuary cities. Acevedo and other chiefs here said they do not take immigration status into account when performing their duties, only whether someone is breaking the law or has been a crime victim. They see immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not one for local police.

“From our perspective,” Acevedo said in an interview, “there is no such thing as a ‘sanctuary city’ in terms of taking action against those who would do harm to members of our communities.” Police have long felt that taking on immigration enforcement by routinely checking a person’s status will deter immigrants from reporting crime or cooperating with investigations. Acevedo said there had been a nearly 43 percent drop in reporting of sexual assaults in Houston by its Hispanic community in 2017.

The chiefs’ working group wants to discuss the federal policy on Immigration and Customs Enforcement civil detainers for undocumented immigrants, which a number of police departments and jails have refused to recognize since they are not criminal warrants. They also want to talk about the issue of notifying ICE before releasing prisoners who have immigration detainers. “The immigration authorities have to pick them up,” Acevedo said. “We don’t turn them over.”

Some chiefs told Acevedo that their local social service agencies are being overwhelmed by busloads of suddenly relocated immigrants. “There needs to be a sense of urgency,” Acevedo said, “when we see asylum seekers that are being distributed throughout the country. We need to know what is the plan and what is the impact on public safety. We need to be part of the discussion because while immigration enforcement is a federal issue, these decisions have an impact on the safety and security of the American people, and that is our primary responsibility.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency “has repeatedly and extensively worked with our country’s law enforcement officials to address the current immigration crisis facing our homeland and keep our communities safe. In fact, former Secretary Nielsen met with the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, co-chaired by Chief Acevedo, this past February to discuss law enforcement concerns and Acting Secretary McAleenan continues to meet with various law enforcement leaders to seek feedback and identify viable, lasting solutions to the ongoing crisis and achieve the Department’s humanitarian and security mission.”

Cuba “Sonic Attack” Mystery: How The State Department Botched Its Investigation,https://www.buzzfeednews.com,"['Dan Vergano', 'Buzzfeed News Reporter']",,,,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/havana-syndrome-research-cuba-sonic-attack,"“The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here,” said one medical ethicist. “Not the US State Department and not the Cuban government.”

The second time the American diplomat felt the attack was in her apartment kitchen, after a long day working at the US Embassy in Havana. “I felt an extreme pressure like the full, frontal top of my face was exploding off my head.” Unsteady on her feet afterward, unable to work, she was medevaced to Miami and diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury. But what caused that injury, and more like it to dozens of other US diplomats and their families? That’s still unknown — and may stay that way due to the way the US State Department began the medical investigation into what happened. “Day to day, we still don’t know how to attribute it,” said the injured diplomat, who spoke to BuzzFeed News anonymously to preserve her future chances of working overseas. For the past three years, diplomats working in Cuba have complained of an array of mysterious ailments and symptoms — dizziness, headaches, difficulty concentrating — that often started with reports of metallic shrieks inside their homes in Havana. Many report long-lasting, perhaps permanent effects. The “Havana syndrome” mystery has been the subject of intense, and public, scrutiny, with much of it focused on the search for some sort of weapon — ultrasound, microwaves, psychology, and even crickets have been offered as explanations. Yet despite intense political pressure, international headlines, sanctions against Cuba, and withdrawal of most US diplomats from Havana, very little still is known about the cause of the “health attacks” as then–secretary of state Rex Tillerson described them in 2017, that affected at least 40 US and Canadian personnel working in the country. The syndrome is now under investigation by the big guns in biomedicine, federal health agencies, and the US National Academies of Science. But public health experts who spoke to BuzzFeed News said the State Department dropped the ball by not opening the investigation earlier to a wider swath of medical experts outside of its immediate sphere.

“The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here.”

According to interviews with public health officials and affected personnel, as well as documents obtained by BuzzFeed News via a Freedom of Information Act request that included hundreds of emails exchanged between researchers and the US Navy’s research office, much of the early research into the mystery may have been botched or biased. The initial investigation was confined to two competing sets of researchers, both eager to publish studies on their own work, and whose findings have been at odds with each other. In one case, researchers were also seeking to promote their own newly approved medical device as a diagnostic tool. And until now, the effort has lacked broader oversight by an institution capable of cross-disciplinary research. “The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here,” said medical ethicist Sergio Litewka of the University of Miami, who has written about the political cloud of secrecy and distrust surrounding the diplomats’ injuries. “Not the US State Department and not the Cuban government.” (BuzzFeed has filed a lawsuit with the State Department requesting its communications related to the medical research into the injuries, after the agency denied a request for them on medical privacy and ongoing investigation grounds.) The two medical teams the State Department first tasked with treating victims — one from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the other from the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine — diagnosed the diplomats with injuries centered on their own respective areas of research expertise: inner ear damage and concussions. That drew criticism from other medical experts who saw them and the State Department as embracing familiar theories while closing off other explanations, ranging from viruses to poison to mass psychology. “Medical groups do tend to see what they are used to seeing,” University of Virginia applied ethics professor Deborah Johnson told BuzzFeed News, comparing the situation to the joke about intoxicated people who look for lost keys under a streetlamp because that’s where the light is. “It’s why it is best to hear from a lot of disciplines in an investigation.” Until now only those two US medical teams have reported, inconclusively, on the injuries to 26 US diplomats (and 14 Canadian ones) that began in Havana in late 2016. The US National Academy of Sciences will begin an investigation starting in the next few weeks, consisting of three standing committees of varied specialists investigating for a year. But outside experts are worried it might be too late to crack the case, starting now one year after the last report of injuries in Havana. They also fear that the State Department and other federal agencies have hobbled the medical investigation by keeping the details closed and hidden from the outside world. “The National Academy is an excellent choice, likely to bring in sophisticated scientists with a good arm’s length from the political players,” UCLA neuroscientist Mark Cohen told BuzzFeed News. “I hope that the NAS will also take the step of bringing in experts from outside the US, as well.”

Emails show the teams quarreled, refused to share data, and disagreed over study authorship, as they raced to publish in high-prestige publications.

The State Department does not fund medical research but, after the teams from Miami and UPenn failed to reach a consensus, did ask the CDC to investigate the injuries in December 2017. The CDC has not yet published the results of its investigation, more than a year later. The NIH’s brain trauma research, now open to injured diplomats and their families, is a five-year study. “Our response continues to be guided by the medical facts,” State Department senior medical adviser Behzad Shahbazian told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “World-class brain injury specialists and other scientists” at UPenn, NIH, and CDC, he said, “continue to examine the medical data to gain a better understanding of the nature and mechanism of injury that caused these patients’ symptoms.” But according to public records obtained by BuzzFeed News, emails show the teams quarreled, refused to share data, and disagreed over study authorship, as they raced to publish in high-prestige publications. (The UPenn team requested copies of their own emails, and then declined to comment on them to BuzzFeed News. The Miami-led team responded after it was presented with a list of incidents in the emails.) The emails show the Miami-led team discussed turning the investigation into a multiyear effort at the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) and, more unusual, also looked at the research on the injured diplomats as a marketing opportunity for diagnostic goggles — a medical device that one researcher and his university had a patent application on. (Via a spokesperson, the researcher denied having a financial interest in the patent.) They also worried about “State trying to reclaim ownership” of the investigation, according to their communications, which also privately suggest some saw little chance that the cause of the illnesses that started more than two years ago in Havana would ever be found.

Miami Herald / Getty Images Workers at the US Embassy in Havana leave the building on Sept. 29, 2017, after the State Department announced that it was withdrawing all but essential personnel from the embassy because Cuba could no longer guarantee diplomats’ safety.

In November 2016, the first cases of strange noises and injuries began appearing among a handful of diplomats posted to Havana. Initial reports were of buzzing sounds inside private homes. Embassy security at first thought these were just noises meant to annoy staff, according to US Senate testimony by State Department security official Todd Brown. The erratic nature of the incidents, a few one week, and then none another, added to the confusion, but by February 2017 it was clear that around half a dozen embassy staff were ill with headaches, hearing loss, or vertigo.

From the beginning, the medical investigation into these reports was ad hoc, a side project run by the doctors tasked with diagnosing and treating the diplomats and their families. The research investigation was allowed by the State Department, but not run by it. “I literally got this call, ‘This is the State Department, we have a problem,’” University of Miami medical school otolaryngologist Michael Hoffer told a Pentagon-sponsored presentation last August. “All of these individuals had experienced a loud noise or pressure before and during the symptoms.”

Hoffer, a former Navy doctor with two decades of military experience, had experience with blast victims who sustained traumatic brain injuries during the Iraq War, even receiving funding from the NFL Foundation for his research. Since Miami was the evacuation point for the embassy, it made sense for the State Department to ask the University of Miami expert to look at what resembled head injuries. He and his colleagues examined evacuated staff members with injuries in Miami, giving them neurologic, hearing, and physical exams. He later traveled to Havana to see many more, mostly unaffected personnel. In late March 2017, embassy staff were gathered in Havana by then-ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis, who warned them about the incidents and said they would be evaluated if they wished. It was the first time many had heard about the injuries or the sounds. According to news reports, Canadian diplomats and their families, including children, also began reporting such ailments that month — including headaches, nosebleeds, dizziness, and ringing in the ears — from similar sound-linked incidents. (Fifteen Canadians, including five diplomats, sued their country in February, charging that their government “downplayed the seriousness of the situation, hoarded and concealed critical health and safety information, and gave false, misleading, and incomplete information to diplomatic staff."") And the injuries kept coming. “Like a teapot on steroids, such a very high-pitched sound,” the injured American diplomat told BuzzFeed News about the incident in her Havana apartment in April 2017, one month after the embassy town hall. While in her apartment kitchen, “I literally had to duck around a corner to get away from it,” she said.

“Like a teapot on steroids, such a very high-pitched sound.”

Her vision started to blur over the next three days, so she went to a Cuban eye doctor, who diagnosed bleeding in her retinas. “We couldn’t tell the [Cuban doctor] anything,” she said, but the State Department quickly evacuated her as soon as she alerted them about the problem. She stayed in Florida for about six weeks for treatment for her eyes, before returning to Havana “to resume life.” Shortly after her return, there was a second incident in the apartment, accompanied by a buzzing noise. She said, “A sudden force on my face was pulling it up, everywhere above the nose.” Afterward she felt unsteady while walking and had fatigue and difficulty concentrating. She was evacuated to Miami, where she was evaluated for a traumatic blast injury, in the process donning a pair of experimental diagnostic goggles that tracked her eyes to measure the severity of her vertigo, and serving as a data point in Hoffer’s research. (Essentially, the goggles claim to track how the pupils of the eyes constrict in response to seeing objects move back and forth, an involuntary response that people with even mild traumatic brain injuries find difficult.) By April, the University of Miami’s Hoffer had invited his longtime colleagues, bioengineer Carey Balaban of the University of Pittsburgh and Kurt Yankaskas, their grant officer at the US Navy’s Office of Naval Research hearing loss program, to collaborate on investigating the diplomats’ injuries. The three scientists discussed inner ear “cavitation,” damaging implosions of blood bubbles caused by focused sound waves, as an explanation. In an email obtained by BuzzFeed News, Balaban shared a proposal for a “blood vessel” grant with Yankaskas later that same month. Still more diplomats reported injuries. On May 23, 2017, the State Department told Cuba to send two of its diplomats home from its Washington, DC, embassy, unsatisfied with the Castro government’s protests of innocence concerning the injuries. Cuba had a long history of constant surveillance aimed at US diplomats. It was also known to engage in petty harassment, such as leaving unplugged refrigerators and cigarettes in ashtrays after break-ins. It made the notion of the regime lacking any knowledge of the injuries, or responsibility for them, implausible in US eyes. In all, Hoffer’s team would see 25 diplomats or their families affected by the incidents, 10 who lived with them but were unaffected in Miami, and another 105 unaffected personnel seen separately in Havana. “There was no media attention given to what was happening in Cuba when we saw these individuals,” Hoffer said at the later Pentagon teleconference, calling the group “in a sense, pure.” On July 6, 2017, Hoffer and other medical experts met with federal officials, reportedly including top State Department medical officer Charles Rosenfarb, to discuss the still-secret injuries with the diplomats. The expert panel “came to a consensus that the initial findings were most likely related to neurotrauma from a non-natural source,” according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). That consensus was perhaps unsurprising, given the experts who were looking under the lamppost: They included neurologists and hearing specialists from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, according to a State Department email asking them for travel receipts. But there were no infectious disease, toxicology, tropical medicine, or psychiatric experts listed as meeting specialists — no one who might have had a competing explanation for the injuries was present. Competing theories would, however, come into play much later. Complicating any collaboration, and the research overall, was secrecy about the injuries. This remains a problem today. BuzzFeed News asked the four scientists from Johns Hopkins who were listed as participants in the July 2017 meeting, for example, to comment on the progress of the medical investigation into the Havana injuries so far. A university media representative said that one, otolaryngologist Frank Lin of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health, had signed a nondisclosure agreement, and that the rest “can’t comment” for undisclosed reasons. The July 2017 meeting also included neurosurgeon Douglas Smith of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. The State Department looked to his Penn Center for Brain Injury and Repair, a highly regarded center for the treatment of brain injuries near Washington, DC, where many of the injured diplomats and their families lived, for their extended treatment. “It was good care, they took very good care of us,” the injured diplomat said of UPenn. “They told me, ‘We need to fix you and make you better,’; they would treat us like anyone else who came into their center with our symptoms.” Outside, however, a storm was brewing. On Aug. 9, 2017, in answer to a question from a CBS News correspondent, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said that some embassy personnel “reported some incidents which have caused a variety of physical symptoms,” and mentioned the expulsion of Cuban diplomats in May. Headlines quickly erupted of “hearing loss” and “brain damage” to diplomats caused by an “acoustic attack,” all suggestions that outside experts have later found questionable. Cuban state television in October 2017 blamed the noises heard by the diplomats in the incidents on cicadas or crickets, something the diplomat interviewed by BuzzFeed News scoffed at. “I’ve heard cicadas before,” she said. “It sounded different.” In September, another injured diplomat who spoke to BuzzFeed News under similar conditions of anonymity was evacuated from Havana ahead of Hurricane Irma, which devastated the island. He had heard a buzzing noise in his home and the sensation of pressure, followed by problems with vertigo. “I fell out of my chair at work,” he said. He was also evaluated at UPenn, and is back at work now in the US, although he still has trouble concentrating. “I don’t function at the level I did before,” he said, and worries about the long-term effects, especially, he said, in light of the US government’s longtime wrangling with war veterans with unexplained illness tied to Agent Orange and Gulf War syndrome.

By the middle of August, according to emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News, Hoffer’s University of Pittsburgh colleague Balaban was corresponding with Smith about collaborating on a study of how UPenn’s brain images of injured diplomats might explain how ultrasound beams could selectively damage a person’s inner ear from a distance.

“Your data will be very important in narrowing down plausible scenarios,” Balaban wrote in an Aug. 20, 2017, email to Smith. Smith was dubious, asking how ultrasound “can go through air and [a] possible glass pane, then the skull, to selectively affect the brain.” Competition to publish research results first is the lifeblood of US scientific process. But for Havana syndrome, this drive pitted the two medical teams against each other in a race to publish in the world’s two most prestigious medical journals, the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The fastest team, from UPenn, would submit a paper to a journal within a few weeks of looking at the last diplomats in their study. By November 2017, Hoffer and Balaban were drafting a paper on the diplomats that they had seen, which they planned to submit to the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. That same month, the Food and Drug Administration approved sales by Pittsburgh-based Neuro Kinetics Inc. of the diagnostic goggles that Hoffer used to assess the diplomats’ injuries. Along with his university, Balaban had applied for a patent on the goggles with Neuro Kinetics. They shared the news with Yankaskas, their US Navy ONR grant officer:

BuzzFeed News

“It does not seem imprudent to speculate that a highly specific unidentified energy exposure, perceived as a sound or pressure, could be producing a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or similar inner ear concussion,” said a December 2017 update of the draft paper, obtained via FOIA request. It compiled symptoms that ranged from ringing ears to foggy thinking to dizziness, all signs of inner ear damage, to come to this conclusion. Such symptoms were hallmarks of the blast damage to the head that the medical team had seen and diagnosed during the Iraq War. Those investigations, too, were not without controversy. The Defense Department’s inspector general in 2011 released a report critical of research that Hoffer and Balaban had conducted on US soldiers at Camp Al Taqaddum, Iraq, who were injured by explosions from 2008 to 2009. “Neurological assessments did not adhere to clinical practice guidelines” for mild traumatic brain injury, the report found. It also said that a “potential financial conflict of interest” in the experimental antioxidant tablets was not revealed to the injured personnel in the study, a research ethics violation. (Hoffer held patents on a method of administering the tablets.) A US Navy representative told Time, “The evidence suggests that no physical harm was caused by the administration of the investigational drug,” after the report came out. To close out 2017, the State Department asked the NIH to investigate the diplomats’ injuries — a move the top Republican and Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called for on Dec. 5 — with staff members quoted as critical of the medical investigation.

In January 2018, the journal JAMA notified Balaban and Hoffer that the UPenn doctors had submitted their paper and added them as coauthors. The notice led to an angry face-off between Smith and Balaban, who wanted to see the data and delay publication of the JAMA paper. He told Smith he had complained to ethics officials at the University of Pittsburgh, which posed the threat of a scientific misconduct investigation. (University of Pittsburgh’s communications office did not respond when asked if there had been an outcome of that complaint.)



BuzzFeed News “In or out” email from Smith to Balaban, Feb. 9, 2018.

JAMA released the UPenn study online less than a week after Smith told Balaban he was either “in or out,” without him or Hoffer as authors. The study of 21 people, 11 women and 10 men, concluded “they had sustained injury to widespread brain networks,” a constellation of symptoms similar to concussions caused by physical impacts. “Clinically, it’s clear they have suffered some sort of neurological insult. Something happened,” UPenn’s Randel Swanson, the lead author on the study, then told BuzzFeed News.

Other experts weren’t so certain. Neuroimaging expert Arthur Toga of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California told BuzzFeed News the study was “inconclusive,” noting its MRI results didn’t indicate anything grossly wrong with the diplomats’ brains that corresponded to their symptoms. Neuroscientist Sergio Della Sala of the University of Edinburgh said that the study’s standard for brain damage, seen in only two or three patients, was so loose as to describe roughly 40% of the general population as having brain damage.

“Clinically, it’s clear they have suffered some sort of neurological insult. Something happened.”

The JAMA study authors noted that privacy and secrecy restrictions precluded the release of some of the data about the injured diplomats, noting that only Smith and Swanson were responsible for the data. Nonetheless, they ruled out a viral cause of the injuries, because no one had reported a fever, and called poisoning unlikely to have worked so quickly after the sounds heard by 18 of the 21 patients, some of them on the island for less than 24 hours before reporting symptoms. It also ruled out a mass psychology or “functional” disorders, triggered by everything from whiplash to migraines, because the diplomats wanted to return to work and didn’t show signs of “malingering.” This last conclusion is at odds with how “psychogenic” injuries actually work — people suffer physically from injuries triggered by stress in such cases, often with symptoms like dizziness, headaches, and the others reported in some of the Havana cases. They do not fake injury to get time off work. Despite the presence of neuropsychologists on the UPenn team, the description called into question how well the JAMA study authors had really investigated the possibility of psychology to explain the injuries, medical sociologist Robert Bartholomew, coauthor of Outbreak! The Encyclopedia of Extraordinary Social Behavior, told BuzzFeed News. Four days after the study appeared in JAMA, the State Department’s Rosenfarb gave Balaban and his colleagues authorization to publish their own paper in submission with the New England Journal of Medicine. “My apology for the delay,” said Rosenfarb. They had lost the high-prestige publication race, and the delay hadn’t helped, according to an April 2018 email from Balaban. “An NEJM editor has asked us for rights of a first look before the JAMA paper was published. Our release occurred after the JAMA on-line edition appeared,” he wrote to a University of Pittsburgh publicist planning a news conference with the University of Miami’s medical school on publication of their paper, now under consideration by the journal Frontiers in Neurology. Plans for the press conference included a presentation of the Neuro Kinetics goggles that the paper described as able to uniquely diagnose people with the Havana injuries, as well as setting up advance interviews with the Miami Herald and the New York Times. A draft of the paper in review with Frontiers lists no financial conflicts of interest in the study.

BuzzFeed News A University of Pittsburgh email from Balaban, April 17, 2018.

That seems troublesome to neurologist Mitchell Joseph Valdés-Sosa of the Cuban Neuroscience Center, a leader on a Cuban panel that concluded in 2017 that the injuries were likely caused by mass hysteria. “There could be a conflict of interest, and that could have [led] to confirmation bias,” he told BuzzFeed News by email. “Their hypothesis could have been that they were going to find evidence of vestibular [inner ear] damage, which is what the [Neuro Kinetics] helmet measures.”

In response to this concern, University of Pittsburgh media relations director Joe Miksch told BuzzFeed News by email, “Balaban has not and will not receive any financial benefit from Neuro Kinetics or the sales of the Neuro Kinetics diagnostic goggles, even if the patent is granted.” He did not answer whether Balaban’s employer, the university, which owns intellectual property on the patent and can license the invention, would financially benefit from the goggles. The university has not entered into any license with Neuro Kinetics, according to Miksch. The last report of a US diplomat injured in Havana came one year ago, in May 2018. Cuba’s foreign ministry said the US State Department had informed it that a woman had “reported health symptoms as a result of ‘undefined sounds’ in her place of residence.” That same month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported that two US diplomats in China reported the same sort of illness “entirely consistent” with the past Cuban cases, prompting the State Department to launch a task force with the Health and Human Services and Energy departments to investigate. (Eventually 15 US diplomats from China would be investigated for such incidents, with the Associated Press later reporting that 14 of them were ruled out from suffering the syndrome, with the 15th inconclusive.) In August, a series of letters critical of the JAMA study were published in that journal, written by a mixture of neurologists critical of the brain damage claims, and experts in “functional” disorders triggered by stress who blasted its dismissal of psychology as an explanation.

“Research with this patient cohort was not originally anticipated due to secrecy and privacy concerns,” Smith and his colleagues said in response to the letters. They restated the criteria for “neuropsychological impairment” and wrote, “we are performing advanced neuroimaging studies of the patient cohort, hoping to identify structural brain changes that may underlie the neurological manifestations.” These studies have still not been published. As mentioned, after asking to see the public records of communications released to BuzzFeed News, Smith did not reply to requests for comment. “I can only vet the (published) cognitive data, and these do not hold water,” Della Sala, the editor of the journal Cortex, told BuzzFeed News by email. “These further explanations made things even worse.” Also unpublished was the submitted Frontiers in Neurology paper by Hoffer’s team. The next appearance of their results instead came in August in talks at a “SOFWERX” Defense Department think tank in Tampa, where Hoffer discussed the injuries suffered by the diplomats. Balaban described the “Frey effect” in his talk, the production of clicking noises in the ears by exposure to microwaves, a phenomenon researched in the 1970s. “So, the ability of radiofrequency to affect the nervous system is real,” he said.

Balaban also touted the Neuro Kinetics goggles at the talk, claiming a 90% ability to tell Havana subjects apart from either blast victims or healthy people. “This is a fieldable technology,” he said.

“The promotion of the silly goggles is a shameless attempt at commercial promotion,” said Cohen, the UCLA neuroscientist. Little more than a week after Hoffer’s Tampa appearance, the New York Times published a story citing the Frey effect and suggesting that microwaves were the prime suspects as the technology that hurt the diplomats, with an endorsement of the idea from UPenn’s Smith. This caused some suspicion on both Hoffer’s and Balaban’s part that their August presentation had been eavesdropped upon and their ideas pilfered (in reality, a University of California, San Diego, news release had touted the idea a few days ahead of the story).

BuzzFeed News Email from Hoffer, Sept. 2, 2018.

“I think State trying to reclaim ownership [is] a strong possibility because we noted that the Penn group (which is a group entirely composed of clinicians) now is convince[d] this is microwaves,” Hoffer wrote in a Sept. 2 note to Balaban and Georgetown University neuroethicist James Giordano, another colleague. “Definitely smacks of what we call ‘Penngazzi’. Lol.” The group discussed arguing for the Office of Naval Research, instead of the State Department, to lead an investigation into a “multi-layer” plethora of various kinds of energy beams causing the Havana injuries. They also discussed dropping a “red herring” as part of a “misinformation” campaign at their next talk, scheduled for later that week at a Pentagon-sponsored teleconference.

(As mentioned, BuzzFeed News has filed a lawsuit with the State Department for public records of Hoffer’s communications on his research.) “There was no misinformation campaign,” Hoffer told BuzzFeed News by email. The “red herring” was a symptom to distinguish real Havana syndrome patients from pretenders, he said. “Indeed, we have seen patients who present themselves as such.”

“Definitely smacks of what we call ‘Penngazzi’. Lol.”

When asked about the context of the email suggesting the State Department was trying to reclaim ownership, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine media relations director Joanna Palmer replied, by email, “Dr. Hoffer has no further comment.” Meanwhile, outside experts threw cold water on microwaves, calling the Frey effect wildly implausible as an explanation for the injuries, since its inner ear clicking noises it caused were far too weak to damage tissues. “Maybe Fidel Castro is subjecting them to an ESP attack from beyond the grave,” said University of Pennsylvania bioengineer Kenneth Foster to BuzzFeed News, when shown the discussion of the “multi-layered” radiation attack idea. Foster, who has no affiliation with UPenn’s medical school team, first described the mechanism behind the clicking effect in 1974, but is dubious it is in play in Cuba. “Unless there is some independent evidence for an exposure of some kind, one could speculate endlessly.” Nevertheless, the Pentagon teleconference received press coverage, noting Balaban’s theory of some confluence of radiation and ultrasound perhaps triggering targeted cavitation in the inner ears of the injured diplomats. “I do not believe that we are close to claiming victory. In fact, I doubt that we can identify ‘the source’ for Cuba,” Balaban wrote to ONR’s Yankaskas in the aftermath of the news coverage. In the outside world, skepticism abounded about both mystery noise-making secret weapons and the diagnoses of the research teams. On Oct. 8, 2018, a neuroscience reporter from another news outlet contacted Yankaskas at ONR, for example, asking whether they could discuss “wildly implausible” ideas that Balaban had presented, and questioned whether he had a “proprietary interest” in the diagnostic goggles. Yankaskas forwarded the interview request to Balaban the same day, writing: “He’s the same reporter that I mentioned this morning.”

The US just banned 12 pesticides that are like nicotine for bees. Here's how dangerous they are.,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aria Bendix'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/epa-banned-pesticides-killing-bees-2019-5,"Give a bee neonicotinoids, and it can become addicted.

The pesticide, whose name literally means ""nicotine-like,"" has been used commercially since the 1980s as a way to protect crops from being destroyed by insects. But it was never meant to hurt bees, which are vital to producing crops such as fruits, vegetables, and almonds.

In bees, the effects of neonicotinoids are similar to those of nicotine in humans. Not only is the pesticide detrimental to their health, but bees also tend to prefer it to their own food source. Bees that are exposed to neonicotinoids can experience problems with their central nervous systems, often resulting in impaired memory, movement, and even death.

For years, beekeepers have warned that the pesticides are killing their hives. Any major decline in honeybee numbers could have severe implications for the human diet, since bees pollinate about a third of the world's crops.

Recently, concerns about this threat translated into action in the US.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced a ban on 12 neonicotinoid pesticides from three agro-chemical companies: Syngenta, Valent, and Bayer. Seven of these pesticides are used as a protective coating for crops like soybeans, cotton, and corn.

When farmers use neonicotinoids on their crops, the pesticides can leech into water supplies, which then get absorbed by flowers that serve as vital food sources for bees. In 2017, beekeepers in the US reported losing about 40% of their hives — a trend that has continued in years since.

Of the list of EPA-banned pesticides, six are made by Syngenta. These products contain the active ingredient thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid that can cause bees to become hyperactive in the short term and can impair their motor function in the long term. High doses of thiamethoxam might also make honeybees less tolerant to a virus called Chronic Bee Paralysis, which can kill them.

The other EPA-banned pesticides (two from Bayer and four from Valent) contain clothianidin, a neonicotinoid that's thought to be slightly more toxic than thiamethoxam. One of Bayer's now-banned products is used as a protective coating for potatoes, while the other is a household rose- and flower-care product. In a statement, Bayer's vice president and associate general counsel, Kristine Kring, said those products aren't sold in the US and have ""little or no commercial significance"" for Bayer.

Studies have shown that clothianidin impairs a bee colony's immune response and ability to reproduce. Exposure to clothianidin especially threatens the lives of queen bees, which are the backbone of a hive. A recent study published in the journal Nature Communications found that bee colonies in clothianidin-treated fields saw up to 66% fewer males than colonies that weren't exposed to the chemical, and up to 74% fewer queen bees.

Clothianidin can also lead to colony collapse disorder, in which the majority of worker bees die out and leave behind a queen. A 2017 study in the journal Science found that exposure to clothianidin also makes colonies less likely to clear out dead or sick bees from their hives, which means more bees can become infected over time.

But agro-chemical companies like Syngenta have argued that without neonicotinoids, crops would more easily fall victim to disease or pests. They might also experience water loss, since a pesticide coating helps seal in moisture.

While the EPA ban represents a landmark win for environmentalists, it's still the result of a compromise. The decision follows a December 2018 settlement in which Syngenta, Valent, and Bayer volunteered to give up their rights to sell, use, and distribute the 12 pesticide products. This leaves 47 neonicotinoid-based products on the market.

In a statement to Business Insider, Bayer said the settlement ""represents a big win for growers, sound science, and our regulatory system.""

But the battle between agrochemical companies and environmentalists isn't over. The 47 neonicotinoids allowed by the EPA must be re-registered by 2022, giving environmentalists a few more years to push for a total ban.

The European Union has already banned almost all outdoor uses of neonicotinoids following a 2018 food safety report, which determined that the pesticide poses a risk to bees."

Lightbridge Fuel uses a helically-twisted shape and unique metallic composition which the company says can significantly reduce fuel operating temperatures, improve the fuel's structural integrity and enhance its response to abnormal events. Enfission - a joint venture of Lightbridge Corporation and Framatome - was set up in January 2018 to commercialise nuclear fuel assemblies based on this technology.

The GAIN initiative was launched in November 2015 to provide a way to fast-track nuclear innovation, providing stakeholders with a means of accessing DOE research and development infrastructure to help them meet the challenges of bringing new technologies towards engineering-scale demonstration.

This is Framatome's third GAIN voucher and its first supporting the Lightbridge Fuel design.

Framatome said its collaboration with INL under this GAIN voucher will ""leverage the laboratory's experience in fuel and material development, as well as its performance knowledge, to facilitate Framatome's understanding of phenomena unique to uranium-zirconium metallic fuel"".

Over a one-year period, Framatome and INL will work under the voucher to generate failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and a phenomena identification ranking table (PIRT) based on the Lightbridge Fuel concept. Both the FMEA and PIRT are important steps in licensing an advanced fuel product in the USA and will be required inputs to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

For this work DOE will fund INL at a value of USD477,000.

""This voucher enables Framatome to apply focused attention on key licensing steps to commercialise Lightbridge Fuel,"" said Robert Freeman, vice president of contracts and services, fuel commercial and customer centre at Framatome. ""We are enthusiastic about the transformative science and technology benefits of this metallic fuel's unique composition and geometry for the nuclear energy industry.""

Enfission CEO Seth Grae said: ""We appreciate this support from DOE for Lightbridge Fuel, which is designed to increase power output, enhance economics and provide additional safety benefits for existing and future reactors worldwide. We look forward to working closely with Framatome, INL and DOE to further advance Lightbridge Fuel toward commercialisation.""

Mark Meadows sends referral to DOJ about mysterious UK communique about Christopher Steele,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-referral-to-doj-about-mysterious-uk-communique-about-christopher-steele,"Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a referral to the Justice Department about a message a top United Kingdom national security official delivered to the Trump transition team a week before President Trump's inauguration.

Congressional investigators told the Hill that in January 2017 then-U.K. national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant hand-delivered a memo to soon-to-be national security adviser Michael Flynn's team that asserted the U.K. government had doubts about the credibility of British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Recent reports suggest Steele had briefed British intelligence officials on his dossier after the 2016 presidential election, and the heads of MI5 and MI6 were made aware of the contents of the dossier by late November.

“A whistleblower recently revealed the existence of a communique from our allies in Great Britain during the early days of the Russia collusion investigation,” Meadows said.

“Based on my conversations with that individual, and the credible timelines that are supported by other events, I made a referral to Attorney General William Barr and Inspector General Michael Horowitz for further investigation,” the North Carolina Republican added. “There now is overwhelming evidence to suggest that on multiple occasions the FBI was warned that Christopher Steele and the dossier had severe credibility issues.”

Steele compiled a dossier that contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and was paid, in part, by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. His dossier has become a flashpoint of concern for Republicans after the declassification of a House Intelligence Committee memo that said the FBI used the unverified research to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants beginning in October 2016 to wiretap onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

GOP investigators learned of the communique's existence within the past few weeks by a whistleblower who was part of Flynn's team and are pressing for answers ahead of Trump's visit to the United Kingdom early next month. Its existence came to light a month after the revelation of a State Department official's notes about an October 2016 meeting with Steele, sent to the FBI, that warned he was unreliable and that he had said he was being encouraged to get his allegations out prior to the 2016 presidential election.

The communique could be significant as it would have been delivered before the FBI applied for three FISA renewals against Page in 2017 using Steele's research. Sources said Flynn was not aware of its existence until he was questioned as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian envoy, and therefore Trump too was likely not told about it.

The possible misuse of Steele's dossier has come into greater focus in recent weeks, including questions about whether the dossier contained possible Russian disinformation and whether former FBI Director James Comey or former CIA Director John Brennan tried to include the dossier in the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

At least three federal investigations are looking into alleged FISA abuse, and other matters related to the way the FBI and the Justice Department conducted the Trump-Russia investigation, and several top ex-officials. Among them are Barr's examination of the origins of the counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign. He has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review. Barr says he is working closely with Horowitz, who is nearing completion of his FISA abuse investigation.

Steele is reportedly open to speaking with Horowitz but has declined to cooperate with Barr."
Senators urge USDA to stop Trump farm bailout money from going to foreign-owned companies,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Rachel Siegel', 'National Business Reporter', 'May At Am', ""Rachel Siegel Is A National Business Reporter.

A group of U.S. senators is urging Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to ensure that a bailout program intended to help U.S. farmers weather President Trump’s trade war does not benefit foreign-owned companies.

The program, which buys surplus commodities from farmers and ranchers, was pitched as a way to protect farmers during the U.S.-China trade war. But the USDA hasn’t turned away foreign-owned corporations that want in. Earlier this year, taxpayer money was used to buy $5 million in pork products from a Brazilian-owned meatpacking firm. A Chinese-owned pork producer was slated to tap the program until the contract provoked intense criticism and was eventually canceled.

“It is unacceptable that American taxpayers have been subsidizing our competitors through trade assistance,” according to a letter addressed to Perdue and signed by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.) and eight other Democratic lawmakers. “We ask that you ensure these commodity purchases are carried out in a manner that most benefits the American farmer’s bottom line — not the business interests of foreign corporations.”

Under a $12 billion bailout program announced last year, the Trump administration set aside $1.2 billion to buy surplus products from farmers, including more than $500 million from pork producers. Last week, the White House announced a separate $16 billion bailout that included $1.4 billion in commodity purchase relief for farmers.

The letter’s signatories include Sens. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), Richard J. Blumenthal (Conn.), Patty Murray (Wash.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Tammy Baldwin (Wis.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.).

The senators pointed to what they called “lucrative” contracts that benefit foreign-owned entities and direct taxpayer money abroad. Those contracts include $62.5 million in pork products from JBS USA, which is owned by Brazil-based JBS SA. The food purchase program also was slated to buy $240,000 in pork products from Smithfield Foods, which is a subsidiary of Chinese-owned WH Group. Smithfield later asked that the contract be canceled after a political backlash. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a farmer and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, was among those who expressed alarm that a foreign-owned company could benefit from the bailout. (The USDA said it has not tallied how much money has gone to foreign-owned companies, but the contracts themselves are public.)

“Whether it’s the WH Group, which is closely tied to the Chinese government, or JBS SA, which is benefiting from the U.S’s loss of market share in certain countries, it is counterproductive and contradictory for these companies to receive assistance paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this Administration’s trade policy,” the senators wrote.

Perdue says the program already buys only American-made products.

“JBS is a Brazilian company operating in the United States, buying product from U.S. farmers,” Perdue said in a statement. “What we do through these companies, it’s not helping the companies; they offer a bid to us based on buying U.S. farmers’ production. This helps U.S. farmers by supporting prices. Companies are able to buy from our farmers more because we are buying that product and taking it off the market.”

Dustin Baker, director of economics for the National Pork Producers Council, cautioned against limiting which pork processors could take advantage of the food purchasing program. Baker said that reducing the number of producers trying to get relief would only drive up the cost of delivering the products to food banks and needy families.

Plus, Baker said, just because some processors are foreign-owned doesn’t mean they can’t be “the lifeblood of the economies in which they’re located.” Many of these companies provide thousands of jobs in rural areas and, like their American-owned competitors, they must also comply with USDA guidelines, he said.

“The real purpose [of the program] is to take product off the domestic market that otherwise would have been exported,” Baker said. “By preventing companies from joining, all you’re doing is increasing the cost of delivering that product to those who need it the most.”

In January, Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) said she would introduce the Buy American Agriculture Act, which would require the Agricultural Marketing Service to buy food products only from American companies. The legislation would also push for added transparency by requiring the agency to disclose why companies were awarded contracts.

“We were led to believe this program would assist producers impacted by low crop prices, not line the pockets of foreign companies who already report millions of dollars in annual profits,” DeLauro said in a statement at the time. “The Buy American Agriculture Act would close that loophole and ensure that money spent by USDA on food purchases rightly prioritizes America’s farmers and American businesses.”"
"Sterigenics created cancer risk 10 times higher than federal EPA standards in Willowbrook, new report says",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Michael Hawthorne'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-sterigenics-epa-cancer-risks-20190529-story.html,"Ethylene oxide emitted by Sterigenics continued to pose high cancer risks after the company installed new pollution-control equipment last summer, according to a new federal study based in part on months of air quality testing in Willowbrook and nearby west suburban communities.

Top officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Wednesday that toxic pollution from the company’s Willowbrook sterilization plant was responsible for long-term cancer risks up to 10 times higher than what the EPA considers acceptable.

Cancer risks remained high in the area despite improvements Sterigenics voluntarily undertook to prevent all but one-tenth of 1% of the ethylene oxide it used from escaping into surrounding neighborhoods.

“Based on current science, there are very high levels of risk,” said William Wehrum, the Trump administration’s top air official, who told sometimes angry residents at a public meeting in Burr Ridge that he takes their concerns “very, very seriously.”

Responding to questions, EPA officials said pollution from Sterigenics increased the risk of developing cancer for people living as far as 25 miles away from Willowbrook. The biggest risks were in six suburbs — Willowbrook, Darien, Burr Ridge, Hinsdale, Indian Head Park and Western Springs — and declined steadily the farther away a neighborhood was from the facility, according to a map the EPA posted online and statements from agency officials during the meeting.

Wehrum and other EPA officials suggested the company could take more aggressive steps that would allow its now-shuttered facility to safely resume operations. But bipartisan state legislation sent Thursday to Gov. J.B. Pritzker would ban Sterigenics from reopening unless medical equipment suppliers — the company’s main clients — certify their products can only be sterilized with ethylene oxide.

The new EPA report comes as the federal agency is pledging to adopt more stringent restrictions on sterilization facilities nationwide, a rare departure from attempts by Wehrum and other Trump appointees to block, delay or undermine environment and public health regulations.

Willowbrook is a focal point in the ongoing debate, largely because EPA scientists determined last year that neighborhoods near Sterigenics are among just a few dozen throughout the U.S. where breathing toxic chemicals is responsible for more than 1 case of cancer for every 10,000 people exposed during their lifetime.

Like in the Willowbrook area, ethylene oxide is the main chemical of concern in nearly all of those other areas. The volatile gas has been on the federal list of carcinogens since 1985, and in 2016 the EPA released a long-delayed reassessment linking it more conclusively to breast cancer, leukemia and lymphomas at extremely low levels of exposure.

Several residents at the Wednesday meeting said they don’t trust the EPA or Sterigenics to protect them. Agency officials, they noted, acknowledged that local cancer risks likely were significantly higher in the past when the Willowbrook facility emitted up to 169,000 pounds of ethylene oxide a year.

“The only appropriate resolution … is for Sterigenics to permanently shut down,” said Margie Donnell, a member of the Stop Sterigenics community group.

More than 19,000 people live within a mile of the Willowbrook facility. Four schools and a day care center also are close by, including Hinsdale South High School in Darien and Gower Middle School in Burr Ridge.

Laws and regulations don’t allow the EPA to force Sterigenics to close for good, Wehrum said, but the agency can take action to ensure cancer risks posed by the company’s pollution are within federal guidelines.

Wednesday’s meeting was the third public forum organized by federal and state officials since the EPA released its latest National Air Toxics Assessment in late August.

A Chicago Tribune analysis of agency data revealed that of 73,057 census tracts in the United States, seven tracts near Sterigenics are among just 109 nationwide with long-term cancer risks exceeding the agency’s guidelines. The findings prompted months of intense pressure from elected officials and the public, forcing the EPA to pay closer attention to a once-obscure industry.

“It is not lost upon us, and it certainly isn’t lost upon me, the depth to which this has affected you,” John Kim, acting director of the Illinois EPA, told residents. “We are doing everything we can to bring you relief.”

After months of meetings with Wehrum and his staff, Sterigenics is vowing to overhaul its facility again, even as the company contends that other sources of ethylene oxide were responsible for spikes of the toxic gas recorded by monitoring equipment deployed near its facility between November and March."
Ex-State Department head of diplomatic security 'surprised' by Hillary Clinton's private email use,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-state-department-head-of-diplomatic-security-surprised-by-hillary-clintons-private-email-use,"The official in charge of protecting State Department staff said he was ""surprised"" to learn that Hillary Clinton used a personal email address to conduct government business.

Eric Boswell, the former head of diplomatic security, acknowledged in a deposition this month that he warned Clinton and other State Department staff against the use of personal emails.

""We also urge Department users to minimize the use of personal web email for business, as some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these actors to automatically forward copies of all composed emails to an undisclosed recipient,"" read a 2011 memo that bore his signature.

Clinton was a recipient of the memo, but Boswell could not confirm whether the secretary of state actually read it.

Boswell, who stepped down from his position in 2012, said he and other former State Department officials had spoken about Clinton's use of the private email address clintonemail.com as a ""general issue.""

""We were surprised,"" he added.

Boswell participated in a deposition this month as part of a court-ordered discovery related to Clinton’s use of an unauthorized email server during her time as secretary of state. A federal judge ruled that several Obama administration officials would have to answer conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch's questions about whether Clinton intentionally attempted to evade the Freedom of Information Act by using a nongovernment email system.

Boswell also warned Clinton against her use of Blackberry devices in the executive offices of the State Department. In a previously declassified memo to Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, Boswell said the secretary of state should discontinue her use of the device due to ""vulnerabilities and risks."" Although Clinton assured Boswell she read the internal memo and ""gets it,"" an email obtained by Judicial Watch indicates she still carried the device ""[a]gainst the advice of the security hawks.""

The debate over whether Clinton's home-based email server, which she claims was set up for convenience, remains alive today. During a hearing with Attorney General William Barr this month, Rep. Louie Gohmert accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of a pro-Clinton cover-up by not pressing the intelligence community for proof that it was not hacked by China.

Also this month, partially redacted documents were released by the FBI that were part of the bureau's ""Midyear Exam"" investigation, which looked into Clinton's mishandling of classified information on her unauthorized private email servers while serving as secretary of state. The documents put on display a sense of alarm among Clinton's staff following what they feared to be a hack of the server and glaring security oversights.

The FBI investigation into Clinton's emails came to a conclusion during the 2016 presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey publicly recommended in 2016 that no charges be brought against Clinton, who was then a candidate for president, but admonished Clinton and her colleagues for being ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information.

One of the main controversies stemming from Clinton's emails was how a technician managing the server deleted 33,000 emails. The FBI was only able to recover about 5,000 of the emails, which were released in tranches up until earlier this year as part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit. Clinton has said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,"" but the FBI found 110 emails did contain classified information.

Clinton has long blamed the FBI's handling of the investigation as a reason for her 2016 loss to President Trump."

“The president didn’t want me to leave. I may or may not go back into the administration at a later time,” Zinke told the Houston Chronicle. “I believe in the president’s vision of making sure America is strong and not held hostage. The world is a lot safer when America is strong.”

Zinke told the Chronicle he was open to returning to Washington after the 2020 elections.

The former Navy SEAL and Montana congressman announced he would leave his post at the Department of the Interior in December of last year, following a string of ethics investigations.

Zinke’s behavior spurred more than a dozen investigations into his conduct in office, including probes into whether he improperly blocked an American Indian casino project after a competitor’s lobbying and scrutiny over a land deal involving a foundation he led and a company backed by David Lesar, chairman of oilfield services company Halliburton.

Interior’s Office of Inspector General also found that Zinke violated department policies by letting his wife travel in government vehicles, but the office cleared him of potential violations related to his official travel, including flying on a jet owned by an oil executive and using a private plane on a trip that included a political fundraiser.

Zinke was dismissive of the investigations.

“There’s an allegation and the opposition demands an investigation with great fanfare,” he said. “Washington has become a city that has a lot of anger, a lot of hatred, a lot of fake news and false allegations. The two sides are trying to destroy each other rather than work together.”"

EPA's Fuzzy Math Not Helping Environment or Economy,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/29/epas_fuzzy_math_not_helping_environment_or_economy_140438.html,"There’s nothing Washington loves better than a false dichotomy. Tax or cut. Spend or slash. Regulate or deregulate. Either you’re for the former or you’re for the latter. Well, that isn’t how life really works, and -- especially when it comes to regulation -- it certainly isn’t how manufacturers think. Everyone wants clean water and clean air, everyone wants an economy that delivers growth and opportunity, and neither idea is in conflict with the other. The challenge is how do we achieve both?

The answer is not to regulate too much or regulate too little, but simply regulate smarter. This is the common-sense idea underpinning a recent policy announcement from the Environmental Protection Agency -- something that manufacturers strongly support and, if fully enacted, something that could have the greatest positive impact on the future of American manufacturing than any other EPA action in recent memory.

Recently, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler (pictured) ordered his agency to develop reforms that would increase consistency and transparency in the consideration of costs and benefits in the EPA rule-making process. This may sound arcane, but it actually matters a lot. There is hardly any trust or balance in the current cost-benefit equation. Nor is there much transparency in the assembly process for rules and regulations that it relies on. For example, when the EPA measured the benefits of its carbon-reducing rules, it used a metric that counted benefits 300 years into the future. Of the 17 rules the EPA issued between 2000 and 2013 that cost $1 billion or more, more than 97% of the benefits claimed were from reductions of a single pollutant (particulate matter), which almost necessarily meant the EPA double-counted benefits from rule to rule.

On the cost side, the EPA regularly avoids a statutory requirement to examine the impact of its regulations on small businesses, even though small firms make up the supply chain of virtually every regulated industry. It has also displayed frustrating inconsistency from rule to rule in terms of the costs it measures. For instance, the agency’s 2010 fuel economy rule measured only the costs and benefits to cars, despite the fact that the rule simultaneously triggered New Source Review permitting requirements for millions of buildings by making greenhouse gases “regulated pollutants.”

In perhaps the most egregious example, the EPA once considered setting a standard for ozone so strict that the controls needed to meet it didn’t exist. In its cost-benefit analysis, the EPA simply called these “unknown controls” and assigned them a modest cost. We measured the true cost of these standards and arrived at a different conclusion: It would have been the most expensive regulation ever.

No one wins when an agency this important is forced to rely on a system this flawed. Overcounting benefits threatens environmental action by eroding trust in what the agency says and puts out. Undercounting costs threatens manufacturers, our economy and the livelihoods of countless middle-class workers and families who obviously bear the brunt when reality eventually sets in (as it inevitability must). No one should want either of these things, and no one should have anything to fear from a serious, reliable and consistent set of standards for measuring costs and benefits into the future. Having reliable data to go on and smarter regulations based off of that data will go a long way toward getting us all closer to the better future that -- in the end -- every American wants. Greener and cleaner. Stronger and more prosperous.

The EPA has done a good job over the years cleaning up the environment, and regulations are a big part of its success. What manufacturers need now is for the agency to get those regulations right the first time. We don’t want zero regulation. We don’t want massive regulation. We just want better regulation. The way to get there is through a smarter and more consistent evaluation of the costs and benefits that they rely on, just as the EPA administrator himself recently proposed. Now, it’s up to the administrator and his team to issue rules fixing this process for good."

Pelosi uses Melania Trump’s family to slam president’s immigration plan,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Seth Wenig Ap'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pelosi-uses-melania-trumps-family-to-slam-presidents-immigration-plan,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi invoked first lady Melania Trump’s family to criticize President Trump’s immigration plan.

Pelosi said Wednesday that Trump’s merit-based immigration proposal is aimed at making “America white again.”

“I don’t know if merit counted for when his wife’s family came into the country,” Pelosi said at a Commonwealth Club of California event in San Francisco. “I don’t know. Maybe it did. God bless them if it did. But he calls that ‘chain migration,’ which he wants to get rid of.”

Trump unveiled his immigration plan earlier this month that prioritized merit-based immigration over chain migration, meaning the administration would give a higher priority to high-skilled immigrants.

The first lady’s parents became U.S. citizens in August via chain migration. Viktor and Amalija Knavs’ lawyer said the couple, who previously lived in Slovenia, was “sponsored by their daughter and then once they had the green card, they then applied for citizenship when they were eligible.” To obtain citizenship, legal permanent residents are required to live in the U.S. continuously and hold their green cards for at least five years.

The Paralympic-style competition, which will be hosted in 2020 by the Marine Corps, brings together injured, ill or wounded active-duty service members and veterans to compete each year for the honor of their branch of service.

Events in the 2019 games, which will take place in June in Tampa, Florida, include archery, cycling, shooting, sitting volleyball, swimming, track and field, wheelchair basketball, indoor rowing, powerlifting, and time trial cycling.

""When they win a medal, they win it for their team. And they don't play their national anthem. They play their service song,"" said retired Marine Maj. Gen. Juan Ayala, the director of the city's San Antonio Office of Military and Veteran Affairs.

The games can mean a great deal to wounded service members like Marine Cpl. Mathew Maddux.

Maddux, the Marines' ambassador for the 2020 games, was injured in 2017 when a malfunction in his tank caused a nuclear, biological and chemical system to overheat and combust next to him. The blast left him with burns on his face, impaired peripheral vision, vertigo problems and a prosthetic ear.

Waking up after the incident, Maddux said he knew right away life would be different. Like the Marine he is, Maddux learned to adapt and overcome, competing in the 2018 Warrior Games.

""I was the ultimate champion last year -- did all the sports,"" Maddux said. ""I got a bronze medal in the 4x100, like a relay team.""

More than physically, he says, the games helped him mentally.

""Mentally reassuring yourself that you can still go out there and be an athlete,"" Maddux said. ""Still go out there and still be in a fight.""

Ayala, who the 2015 Warrior Games when he was still in the Marines, says the competition is special.

""They're focused on the recuperative powers to make that athlete feel like he or she are back in the game, they're back in the unit, they're back in the fight,"" Ayala said.

Back in the News: EPA Scientists Opposed Foxconn Ruling,https://urbanmilwaukee.com,['Bruce Murphy'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2019/05/28/back-in-the-news-epa-scientists-opposed-foxconn-ruling/,"Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee

Newly released emails reported by bloomberg.com show that “Environmental Protection Agency scientists raised strong objections to a 2018 decision by Scott Pruitt, who was head of the agency at the time, to exempt most of southeastern Wisconsin from federal limits on smog,” the story notes.

The decision was made in May 2018, at a time when Gov. Scott Walker was running for reelection and hoping to bring thousands of Foxconn manufacturing jobs to Racine County, in an area of the state where the pollution levels already exceeded federal limits. The decision by Pruitt was hailed by the Chicago Tribune as “a political victory” for Walker that “will save Foxconn from having to make expensive improvements” in its planned manufacturing plant in order to meet federal standards for air pollution, as Urban Milwaukee reported at the time. Pruitt resigned from office just two months later after 14 different federal investigations of him were launched and Walker ended up losing to Democrat Tony Evers.

The decision by Pruitt “dramatically” reduced “the size of the areas required to crack down on smog” in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana,” the Tribune reported. “The areas removed from the list were suggested by Republican elected officials,” including Walker.

“Hundreds of emails and internal documents” were released Friday to the Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin, as part of a federal public records request, Bloomberg reported, which “show senior E.P.A. scientists complaining that conclusions in support of the decision, which could not be supported by data, were being demanded by top Trump administration officials.”

“I do not see a sound technical basis for the areas we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin,” Jennifer Liljegren, an E.P.A. physical scientist wrote to colleagues in an email, the story noted. “I will need the wordsmithing of the legal and policy experts if we are really going to do this — I am still in disbelief.”

“One of those colleagues,, an E.P.A. health scientist, replied, ‘I have a background in air pollution health effects and more specifically on acute exposures, so for me personally, this is hard to digest and support.’”

The emails show E.P.A. scientists “expressed concern about ‘intentional omissions’ in the new analyses, which had the effect of reducing the number of Wisconsin counties in violation of federal smog standards,” story reported.

“Taking snippets of information out of context and not telling the whole story is inappropriate, misleading to the public and dilutes the clarity of the technical information,”Liljegren wrote.

But Michael Abboud, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said in a statement to Bloomberg that the agency’s actions were proper. “In each holistic analysis, E.P.A. considered the relevant factors,” the statement asserted.

“Janet McCabe, who served as the E.P.A. air quality chief under former President Barack Obama, accused the Trump administration of putting politics above public health, the story reported. “These are supposed to be science-based decisions under the Clean Air Act, and yet you see career staff struggling to explain unexplainable decisions,” McCabe said.

A Tribune story following up on the emails release noted that then-Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan joined Trump officials in pushing for the Pruitt ruling.

The story suggests the ruling is likely to be thrown out by federal courts, given that the data clearly shows a violation of EPA standards. During Trump’s first two years in office, the story notes, “his administration prevailed only 6 percent of the time when its anti-regulatory decisions were challenged in the courts, according to a Brookings Institution study.”

“I’ve never seen an administration with a record this atrocious,” John Walke, an attorney at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, told the newspaper.

At time of the decision, Foxconn was still pledging to build a huge Gen 10.5 plant, which would involve a $10 billion investment and employ 13,000 workers. Since then it was scaled back to a Gen 6 plant, which experts say would require an investment of $3 billion or less and employ far fewer workers. It would also cause less pollution, though no estimates of this have been made. There is also evidence that Foxconn isn’t building a manufacturing plant at all, but simply an an assembly plant where workers will repackage LCD products build in China, as Urban Milwaukee has reported. In that case, the plant may not cause any air pollution.

The report, released Thursday by the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), said the unnamed assistant U.S. attorney self-reported to the OIG that they possessed, transported and consumed the edibles in August or September 2016 for back pain.

The attorney's spouse allegedly threatened to report the use to the Justice Department during a marital dispute because they assumed the attorney had not disclosed it on their Questionnaire for National Security Positions form, according to the OIG report.

The report stated that the attorney noted that when they submitted this form in February 2017, it erroneously said they had not used a controlled substance in the past seven years.

The Justice Department watchdog concluded the attorney violated federal and state criminal law and “lacked candor” in an interview with the OIG, during which they said their incorrect responses on the form were inadvertent. Federal and state authorities opted against any criminal prosecution.

The OIG noted that it has provided its report to the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility and to the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys “for action they deem appropriate.”

Treasury Dept.

A Treasury Department official said that even with the new thresholds, no country in recent years would have been designated. China meets only one of the thresholds, but the department used its discretion to add it to the watch list because of the size of its trade surplus.

Last week, the Commerce Department proposed a rule change that would allow the United States to expand its ability to penalize countries that manipulate their currencies.

It proposed expanding a type of remedy that is typically used to levy tariffs on products that are determined to be unfairly subsidized by foreign governments. Under the proposed rule, so-called countervailing duties could be imposed when foreign governments “subsidize” their products by weakening their currencies relative to the United States dollar, the department said.

A senior Treasury Department official said the Commerce Department proposal was a separate matter that would not affect how the Treasury executed its designations.

Although the Trump administration has complained about China’s currency practices, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said during a congressional hearing last week that the weakening of China’s currency would help minimize the impact of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump made labeling China a currency manipulator a central plank of his economic policy, promising in his “contract” with American voters that he would direct the secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator in the first 100 days of his presidency."

In an effort to uncover the next-generation of short-range Reconnaissance drones for the U.S. Army, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Army’s Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) are investing $11m to identify and prototype new capabilities with commercial manufacturers.

The six chosen companies are based in the U.S, with the notable exception of French manufacturer Parrot. The remaining five are Skydio, Altavian, Teal Drones, Vantage Robotics, and Lumenier.

The solicitation was issued in November 2018, with the funding going towards the development of prototypes that can support soldiers on the ground with a rapidly deployable scouting capability.

There are a few criteria that have been set out by the DIU and the MCoE as part of the solicitation process. These include a flight time of around 30 minutes, a range of up to three kilometres, a weight of three pounds or less, and a time from standard-issue rucksack to launch of less than 2 minutes.

It should come as no surprise that industry leader DJI is not taking part in the innovation effort. There are wider issues overshadowing this particular exploration of drone technology.

Last week CNN broke the news that DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has warned that Chinese-manufactured drones pose a “potential risk to an organization’s information.”

Plus, President Trump recently signed an executive order effectively stopping U.S. companies from using telecoms equipment provided by Chinese firm Huawei as an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China continues.

Even though DJI has the tech to provide the required tools to the US Army and has done in the past, it looks as though any dealings with a Chinese manufacturer are off the table. In fact, all commercial off-the-shelf drones were prohibited by the Department of Defense in May last year.

Parrot could well turn out to be the beneficiary. Founder and CEO Henri Seydoux said, “Parrot is proud to have been selected by the Army to work on this highly strategic project. The United States has always been a major market for the Parrot Group, whether it is for our well-known consumer range or our advanced professional offering.

“We have always been at the forefront creating advanced, easy to use, compact and reliable drone-based solutions. We also perfectly understand how small unmanned aircraft, such as the Parrot ANAFI platform, have the potential to become a key part of the defense system.

We look forward to focusing our advanced R&D on meeting the high standards set by the U.S. Army, to integrate drone efficiency in their day to day operations and support the world-leading U.S army.”

As hinted by Seydoux, the ANAFI platform has been designed to be adapted to suit a range of different commercial purposes. The recent ANAFI Thermal would appear to tick most of the U.S Army’s boxes.

Much will depend on the extra capabilities the chosen manufacturers can come up with. It’s easy to imagine a Skydio R1 with a range of new, security-focused skills built on top of its autonomy engine, for example.

US energy department tries rebranding fossil fuels,https://www.king5.com,"['Author', 'Adrianna Rodríguez', 'Published', 'Am Pdt May', 'Updated']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.king5.com/article/news/nation-world/energy-department-refers-to-fossil-fuels-as-freedom-gas-molecules-of-us-freedom/507-1cccab5b-b8d8-4033-9b27-53b1fa0006ea,"The U.S. Department of Energy announced its approval to expand the Freeport LNG Terminal in a press release Tuesday, which it estimated will support up to 3,000 engineering jobs.

But that wasn’t the most interesting part of the announcement.

In the release, the energy department referred to natural gas as “freedom gas” and “molecules of U.S. freedom.” The terms were used by U.S. Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes and Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg respectively.

Many were taken back by the colorful terminology, including 2020 presidential hopeful and Washington Governor Jay Inslee, who recalled a similar choice of words for something else.

“Remember freedom fries?” he tweeted.

The department said that the U.S. LNG export is set to double by the end of 2020."
Save The Bees: EPA Bans 12 Pesticides Harmful To Honeybees,https://www.wbur.org,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2019/05/28/honeybees-pesticides-epa,"With Meghna Chakrabarti

The EPA is pulling a dozen products containing chemicals harmful to honeybees. It's the end of a long legal battle, but not the end of the threat to bees.

From The Reading List

Bloomberg Environment: ""EPA Curbs Use of 12 Bee-Harming Pesticides"" — ""The Environmental Protection Agency has canceled registration of a dozen pesticides, from a class of chemicals known to harm bees.

""The cancellations are effective as of May 20 for 12 neonicotinoid-based products produced by Syngenta, Valent, and Bayer.

""The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act requires pesticides sold or distributed in the U.S. to be registered by the EPA.

""Under a December settlement agreement linked to an Endangered Species Act challenge by environmental groups, the companies voluntarily agreed to petition EPA to cancel 12 out of 59 products containing the active ingredients clothianidin and thiamethoxam.

""Developed as an alternative to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, neonicotinoids are chemically related to nicotine, and attack the nervous system of insects.""

Washington Post: ""The Energy 202: EPA blocks a dozen products containing pesticides thought harmful to bees"" — ""The Environmental Protection Agency is pulling from the market a dozen products containing pesticides known to be toxic to a linchpin of the U.S. food system — the honeybee.

""The agency announced Monday it has canceled the registrations of 12 pest-killing products with compounds belonging to a class of chemicals known as neonicotinoids, as part of a legal settlement.

""For years, beekeepers and wildlife conversationalists alike have voiced concern that the widespread use of neonics, as the chemicals are commonly called, is imperiling wild and domesticated bees crucial to pollinating commercial fruit, nut and vegetable crops.""

PBS NewsHour: ""Neonicotinoid pesticides are slowly killing bees"" — ""Neonicotinoid pesticides commonly found in agricultural areas kill bees and hurt their ability to reproduce, two separate large-scale studies confirmed for the first time Thursday.

""The two studies — one that examined honeybees in Canada and the other that looked at three bee species in the United Kingdom, Germany and Hungary — were the first large-scale investigations to test the popular agrochemicals influence on bees in real world settings.

""The work also turns many preconceived notions about bees and pesticides on their heads.""

"Trump EPA backs away from smog breaks for Foxconn, Indiana steel mills",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Michael Hawthorne'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-foxconn-indiana-smog-trump-epa-20190516-story.html,"When the Trump administration exempted parts of the Chicago area last year from federal limits on lung-damaging smog, it delivered a huge financial break to steel mills, chemical plants and other industries that are some of the region’s biggest polluters.

Scott Pruitt, who at the time headed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, also freed the Foxconn Technology Group from spending millions of dollars on pollution-control equipment as it builds a new electronics plant in southeast Wisconsin, just north of the Illinois border in an area with some of the region’s dirtiest air.

But faced with a legal challenge from environmental groups and a coalition of cities and states, including Chicago and Illinois, federal lawyers are having second thoughts about Pruitt’s controversial decision.

In a few densely worded paragraphs buried at the end of a 63-page document, attorneys for the EPA and Justice Department asked a federal appeals court this month for what, in legal terms, amounts to a do-over.

Administration officials aren’t admitting they did anything wrong, the lawyers contend. But they can see EPA data showing the region’s smog problems are getting worse, not better, and that polluters in four counties singled out by Pruitt for special treatment are contributing to chronically dirty air breathed by millions of people.

The court shouldn’t rule against the Trump administration, the lawyers pleaded. Rather, they said, it “could benefit from additional explanations” and the EPA could end up revising its designations.

“These federal attorneys looked at the record, relied on their professional judgment and realized there isn’t any evidence to justify Pruitt’s last-minute switcheroo,” said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, one of the nonprofit groups that sued to overturn the EPA’s smog designations in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.

By dramatically reducing the size of areas required to crack down on dirty air, Pruitt overruled the agency’s career scientists, a move that saved Foxconn and other polluters from either installing more effective pollution-control equipment, scaling back production to reduce emissions or brokering costly trading agreements with cleaner industries.

Other beneficiaries included then-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who made Foxconn the centerpiece of his 2018 re-election campaign. Walker already had wooed the company to Racine County with $3 billion in financial incentives, promises to relax state environmental laws and access to Lake Michigan water.

Walker, who ended up losing to Democrat Tony Evers in November, blamed Chicago for making the air unhealthy to breathe in Wisconsin. But an EPA staff analysis concluded Wisconsin is at least partially responsible for its own smog problems, and documents filed with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources show Foxconn will be a major new source of smog-forming pollution.

Newly released emails show EPA scientists strongly objected to Pruitt’s decision, which they said could not be supported with data despite political pressure from Trump administration officials and then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. The emails were obtained Friday by the Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin as part of a federal public records request.

“I do not see a sound technical basis for the areas we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin,” Jennifer Liljegren, an EPA scientist, wrote to colleagues in an April 11, 2018, email. “I will need the wordsmithing of the legal and policy experts if we are really going to do this — I am still in disbelief.”

One of the recipients of that email, EPA scientist Lars Perlmutt, replied, “I have a background in air pollution health effects and more specifically on acute exposures, so for me personally, this is hard to digest and support.”

Another email from Liljegren concluded that Wisconsin polluters are responsible for up to 15 percent of the smog detected by air quality monitors — enough to register violations in all of the areas exempted by Pruitt.

Smog, also known as ground-level ozone, is formed by a reaction between sunlight and pollution from car tailpipes, power plants and factories, fumes from volatile solvents and gasoline vapors. After a scientific review required every five years by the federal Clean Air Act, the Obama EPA tightened the national smog standard in 2015 to 70 parts per billion, down from the 75 ppb limit set during the Bush administration.

Average smog concentrations in the counties at issue exceeded the new federal limit during the past three years, according to monitoring data. In Racine County, for instance, smog levels peaked at 90 ppb last year and averaged 78 ppb between 2016 and 2018, even without Foxconn operating.

More perplexing is Pruitt’s reversal of the EPA staff designation for northwest suburban McHenry County.

Unlike Wisconsin officials, who under Walker insisted the state’s air was clean enough to pass muster, the Illinois EPA had repeatedly included McHenry in its lists of areas required to take additional smog-fighting measures. Monitoring data supports that decision: Smog concentrations in McHenry averaged 72 ppb between 2016 and 2018 and peaked at 77 ppb last year.

But Alec Messina, a former industry lobbyist who headed the state agency under Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, abruptly reversed course after phone conversations with Clint Woods, a top Pruitt aide."
"Homeland Security, Guatemala bust illegal immigrant smuggling cartel",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/29/homeland-security-guatemala-bust-illegal-immigrant/,"Homeland Security agents and Guatemalan authorities busted a significant smuggling organization Wednesday, arresting nine people who were involved in transporting thousands of illegal immigrants from across the globe through Latin America and into the U.S.

The bust was the first fruit of a new cooperation agreement signed this week between the U.S. and Guatemala, authorizing the two countries to pool information and resources to go after the smugglers who are fueling the illegal immigrant surge.

Authorities dubbed the operation the Merida organization, after Lidia Fausta Merida-Lopez, whom a Homeland Security official identified as the ringleader. The organization had assets of $10 million, and facilitated smuggling of people from Guatemala, elsewhere in Central America and South America, and even from terrorist-connected countries such as Somalia and Pakistan.

“They’ve moved thousands of people,” the official said. “They’re diverse, they’re connected and linked to narcotics smuggling organizations, they’re truly a transnational criminal organization.”

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan was in Guatemala on Wednesday where he is engaged in meetings with Central American governments, looking to find ways to stop the surge of their people fleeing their countries and headed north.

Earlier this week he inked the cooperation deal with Guatemala, which he said is a geographic “chokepoint” for migration from the south up through Mexico. If the U.S. can stiffen Guatemala’s enforcement, it can cut into the overall flows.

“You’ve got to come through Guatemala, so if we can create a border security situation that’s more robust on the Guatemalan border with Honduras, the Guatemalan border with El Salvador … that’s going to disrupt this cycle,” Mr. McAleenan said.

If successful, that could give the U.S. other options besides relying on Mexico, which U.S. officials say has been an iffy partner, swinging from tough talk to lax enforcement.

The agreement he reached with Guatemala commits the U.S. to helping provide better training, information sharing and support as authorities there try to take down some of the smuggling operations that are siphoning its people away. The agreement does not call for any additional financial assistance for Guatemala, the Homeland Security official said.

He said Homeland Security Investigations agents, who are part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), began looking into the Merida organization in January, and found it was moving “special interest aliens,” or people from countries outside the ones that usually make up illegal migration to the U.S.

The organization would charge up to $3,500 to smuggle a child into the U.S. and up to $12,500 for adults, depending on where in the U.S. the wanted to reach, and the mode of transportation it took to get them there.

Latin American press accounts said nine of the Merida organization’s 10 leaders were arrested in Wednesday’s operation. Some migrants being held by the organization were also arrested.

Both U.S. and Guatemalan authorities said the organization was set up like a franchise operation, with smugglers able to control different pieces of the methods and routes, and the organizers chiefly facilitating the passage among those operators.

They used word of mouth, their reputation for getting people successfully into the U.S., and sometimes social media to advertise their services.

The nine arrested Wednesday will be prosecuted in Guatemala.

Mr. McAleenan said taking out smuggling organizations will cut into the flow of people headed north.

“Without those organizations migrants can’t move out of the country,” he said

The operation comes as the border crisis remains a heated debate in Washington.

Congress left town last week without a deal on the $4.5 billion emergency spending request President Trump made to provide better care for the record numbers of illegal immigrant children and families streaming into the U.S. each month.

Most of that money is designated for Health and Human Services, which under a law passed by Congress is required to care for unaccompanied alien children (UAC) who arrive at the border. But some of the money is designated for Homeland Security, and would be used to feed and care for the families and children, and to replenish ICE’s detention budget.

Mr. McAleenan said he was “extremely concerned” that Congress hasn’t approved the money.

“The failure to act on that request is frankly unconscionable, and putting children at risk,” he said.

As for ICE, he said it will face “very stark choices” of either releasing more new border crossers, releasing criminals caught in the country’s interior, or slashing money in other accounts to fund ICE’s detention beds.

“I don’t like any of those choices. I prefer that Congress act on the request,” the acting secretary said.

Minneapolis police 'behind the ball' on years-old Department of Justice report,http://www.startribune.com,"['Libor Jany', 'Libor.Jany Startribune.Com', 'Glen Stubbe', 'Star Tribune']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-behind-the-ball-on-years-old-department-of-justice-report/510595072/,"When it comes to policy issues, there’s not much about the Minneapolis Police Department that Chuck Turchick doesn’t know.

So when it appeared that the department was slow to make federal government-recommended changes to how it handles potentially troublesome officers, Turchick, a longtime observer of the city’s police force, started asking questions. Others are doing the same.

More than four years after a Justice Department review of the department’s internal discipline process determined that Minneapolis police practices fell short, officials have yet to reveal which recommendations for improvement have been implemented.

The closest thing to a public answer came at a meeting this month of the Police Conduct Oversight Commission (PCOC), a policy-shaping civilian group whose monthly meetings Turchick regularly attends.

Turchick, who prides himself on being a persistent advocate of department reform, again urged the commission to push for answers about the report. Commissioner Laura Westphal said she asked for a status update earlier this year and was assured by Deputy Police Chief Henry Halvorson, who runs the professional standards bureau, that the department was working to implement the remaining recommendations.

“He agrees and admits that they are behind the ball on getting it properly organized and updating us on it,” said Westphal, one of a handful of commission holdovers from the administration of former Chief Janeé Harteau, who requested the yearlong study amid criticism of the department’s tactics.

Minneapolis Police Chief Janeé Harteau

“That’s the first positive sign that I’ve got since last July,” Turchick responded.

The report in question, released in early 2015 by the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP), called on the department to rethink its coaching program for officers, expand racial sensitivity training and overhaul its Early Intervention System (EIS) for flagging troubled officers and getting them help before they misbehave.

The 34-page report pointed to five key areas of improvement for the department to consider, ranging from ramping up community knowledge and trust of police oversight to addressing inconsistencies on how officers are coached.

At the time the report was released, Harteau promised a new internal data-based accountability system, replacing an old process that critics long had argued allowed bad cops to slip through the cracks.

Many of the report’s recommendations have already been implemented out of the public’s eye, department spokeswoman Sgt. Darcy Horn said via e-mail.

Harteau, who was ousted as chief in 2017 after then-officer Mohamed Noor fatally shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond, oversaw the overhaul of the EIS, which now uses metrics such as use of force, involvement in a traffic incident and sick time to evaluate officers.

After the report’s release, Harteau applauded its findings as “progressive steps we can take to enhance our community relationships and increase public trust and accountability.”

Acting on the Justice Department’s advice, the Police Department launched a two-week leadership academy for new sergeants and lieutenants, which covers topics ranging from de-escalation tactics to handling a police-involved shooting.

Additionally, the department has beefed up its community relations and communications departments, Horn said.

Still, other changes have taken longer to take hold, Horn said.

After the report’s publication, department officials pledged to establish a new EIS policy — but as of this month, Horn said, those guidelines were still taking shape. Supervisors also still don’t have direct access to information collected about their officers, but they should have it by the end of the year, she said.

Council Member Cam Gordon, who served on the communications subcommittee, says that even though current Chief Medaria Arradondo has implemented many of his predecessor’s reforms, it wouldn’t surprise him if some were either postponed or quietly abandoned. That usually happens when administrations change, he said.

“Maybe they’ve all helped to move us in the right direction slowly, but it’s hard to track what exactly happened,” he said of past reforms, adding that the OJP report only reinforced that impression. “When the chief changed, I’m not sure what kept and what didn’t.”

Imani Jaafar, who was briefly on the police conduct and oversight subcommittee, said she didn’t know whether the group’s recommendations were ever addressed, and if they were, whether that was adequately communicated to the public.

“I do think it just seemed that it was an initiative that Chief Harteau had wanted to move forward, and I haven’t really heard much about [it] at all in the last few years,” said Jaafar, director of the Office of Police Conduct Review. The city board investigates citizen complaints against Minneapolis police.

Others were less surprised by the outcome.

Longtime police critic Spike Moss said he is frustrated by the lack of federal action to enforce the changes.

“There’s no fairness, because they’re the ones who say, ‘We don’t want that investigated, we don’t want that looked at,’ ” said Moss, who was part of a 2003 federal mediation board that called for a host of reforms. “Not one office of any kind is doing something on behalf of us.”

Turchick said he has not yet heard from police officials about their plans.

In an e-mail last fall to Arradondo — on which he copied other department officials, council members and all eight PCOC commissioners — Turchick wondered “whether or how” the proposed changes have been carried out.

“In the short time I did serve on the Police Conduct and Oversight Sub-Committee, some implementation suggestions I had made were approved unanimously,” wrote Turchick, who participated in work groups involved in the report. “But I never heard what happened to those recommendations.”

Clear-cut answers have been hard to come by, Turchick said, although a department spokesman recently e-mailed him to meet to discuss his concerns about the report’s findings.

“I never get a response,” he said in a recent interview. “That is not a good way to build trust in the Police Department, and even city officials.”"
Turkey frees jailed US citizen who worked for NASA,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/turkey-frees-jailed-us-citizen-who-worked-for-nasa,"An American citizen and former NASA scientist who had been jailed in Turkey was suddenly freed Wednesday.

39-year-old Serkan Golge has been in Turkish custody since 2016 when he was arrested in the southern part of the country while on vacation. The arrest occurred in the midst of a failed coup attempt where thousands were detained on dubious evidence as suspicions swirled in the Turkish government. Golge was sentenced to five years on terrorism charges.

Golge’s wife, Kubra Golge, confirmed to the New York Times that her husband was indeed released.

“I just talked to him on the phone. He is going back to his family,” she said. “He was shocked.”

“He said ‘I am very thankful I am out of prison. I am very happy.’ And I cried,” Kubra Golge added.

Golge was accused of working with U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, whom the Turkish government alleged was the mastermind behind the failed coup attempt. The only evidence authorities had against Golge was a $1 bill they found after searching his brother’s house. Turkish prosecutors alleged that Gülen would give blessed $1 bills to his followers.

Golge’s release came just hours after a Wednesday phone call between President Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. A readout from the phone call said that the two discussed bilateral issues, including trade and tariffs. Golge was not mentioned in the readout and the White House did not confirm to the Washington Examiner that his case was discussed.

Prior to his arrest, the Turkish American Golge was a senior research scientist at NASA studying the effects of space radiation on humans in the International Space Station. He traveled from Turkey to the U.S. in 2003 and became a citizen in 2010.

Turkey released American pastor Andrew Brunson in October. He was also swept up in the 2016 wave of arrests associated with the attempted coup. Trump had made Brunson's freedom a top priority in discussions with Turkey."

"State Street Subsidiary Violated Iranian Sanctions, Treasury Says",https://www.wsj.com,"['Mengqi Sun', 'Mengqi.Sun Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-street-subsidiary-violated-iranian-sanctions-treasury-says-11559074674,"A subsidiary of State Street Corp. violated Iranian transactions and sanctions regulations, the Treasury Department said Tuesday, but the government stopped short of issuing a monetary penalty.

The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said custodian bank State Street Bank & Trust Co. violated U.S. Iranian sanctions regulations by processing payments on behalf of a person in Iran.

State Street Bank, acting as a trustee for a customer’s employee retirement plan, processed at least 45 pension payments totaling more than $11,000 to a plan participant between 2012 and 2015, OFAC said. The person was a U.S. citizen with a U.S. bank account but was residing in Iran, according to OFAC.

The bank disclosed the violations and subsequently improved its compliance program, OFAC said in explaining its decision to not impose a monetary penalty.

“We take our [anti-money-laundering] and sanctions responsibilities seriously and we have cooperated fully with OFAC throughout the process,” State Street said in a statement Tuesday. “In the four years since we reported this issue, we have made a number of enhancements to our global sanctions compliance program.”

OFAC said the bank’s internal system indicated the payment recipient’s address was in Tehran, Iran, and that the unit that oversaw payments related to the retirement plan used its own sanctions-screening filter, instead of the bank’s centralized screening system, according to the enforcement order.

The screening software raised alerts on about 45 transactions because of the Iranian address, OFAC said, and the alerts were escalated to the compliance staff for the servicing unit, rather than the bank’s specialized sanctions compliance staff. The servicing unit’s compliance staff reviewed and approved the 45 distribution payments, according to the enforcement order.

Payments from the business unit now go through the bank’s central screening system, and alerts are escalated and reviewed by the bank’s central compliance unit, OFAC said.

The enforcement comes weeks after the regulator issued guidance on expectations for sanctions compliance programs. The guidance is part of a Treasury effort aimed at improving transparency around the department’s evaluation and resolution process.
