"Trump to visit El Paso mass shooting site, in spite of Dems' warning to stay away",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-to-visit-el-paso-mass-shooting-site-as-2020-dems-warn-him-to-stay-away,"El Paso, Texas, Mayor Dee Margo told reporters on Monday that President Trump will visit the city on Wednesday, even as several prominent Democrats indirectly blamed the president for Saturday's mass shooting there -- with some warning him, in frank terms, to stay away.

News of Trump's planned appearance teed up a potentially bitter national political moment just four days after suspected gunman Patrick Crusius, 21, allegedly opened fire at a Walmart and killed 22 people while injuring more than two dozen others.

""He is president of the United States,"" Margo, a Republican, told reporters. ""So in that capacity, I will fulfill my obligations as mayor of El Paso, and hope that if we are expressing specifics that we can get him to come through for us.""

MCCONNELL SIGNALS WILLINGNESS TO BACK 'BIPARTISAN' GUN VIOLENCE SOLUTIONS

The mayor said he anticipated ""political spin"" and was “already getting the emails and the phone calls” from individuals ""with lots of time on their hands,"" but that his focus remains on his community, not politics. He added that Trump had called and was ""very gracious"" and offered any support necessary.

“We’re dealing with a tragedy of 22 people who have perished by the hateful, evil act of a white supremacist,” Margo said. “I don’t know how we deal with evil. I don’t have a textbook for dealing with it other than the Bible.

""I’m sorry. We are going to go through this,"" he continued. ""The president is coming out. I will meet with the president. I guess for people who have lots of time on their hands, I will deal with the emails and phone calls.”

The White House has not confirmed Trump's schedule, or whether he will also visit Dayton, Ohio -- where a gunman who reportedly supported the violent left-wing group Antifa, as well as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, killed nine people over the weekend. But the Federal Aviation Administration has advised pilots of a presidential visit Wednesday to both El Paso and Dayton.

Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat, told reporters that she had ""not gotten a call"" about a presidential visit as of late Monday, and didn't have more details.

VICTIMS OF EL PASO SHOOTING INCLUDED MOTHER SHIELDING SON FROM BULLETS, TEEN ABOUT TO START SOPHOMORE YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL

But both before and after Margo's announcement, several Democrats forcefully urged Trump not to visit El Paso. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, who represents the district that is home to the Walmart where Saturday’s shooting took place, lashed out at the president on Monday morning -- placing some of the blame for the weekend’s tragedy at his feet.

“The president has made my community and my people the enemy,” she told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“He has told the country that we are people to be feared, people to be hated,"" Escobar continued. ""From my perspective, he is not welcome here. He should not come here while we are in mourning.”

And Democratic presidential candidate Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, urged Margo in a televised interview to ""quietly"" tell Trump that he is not ""welcome"" in the city, because of his rhetoric on immigration.

Ryan has escalated his language in the last 24 hours, as he struggles to raise his political profile. He tweeted “Fck me” after Trump mistakenly, at one point in his televised remarks earlier in the day, said the Ohio shooting took place in Toledo and not Dayton.

For Ryan, the language appeared to be part of a deliberate approach: Earlier Monday, the longshot candidate went on CNN and tore into Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, saying, ""Mitch McConnell needs to get off his a-- and do something.” On Sunday, he tweeted: “Republicans need to get their s--- together and stop pandering to the NRA. Period.”

2020 DEMS UNLEASH PROFANE ATTACKS ON TRUMP, REPUBLICANS OVER MASS SHOOTINGS

Sanders also called out the president, saying ""I say to President Trump, please stop the racist anti-immigrant rhetoric. Stop the hatred in this country which is creating the kind of violence that we see.""

In 2017, a far-left Sanders supporter fired upon a Republican congressional baseball practice, critically wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and injuring three others before U.S. Capitol Police took him down. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said the gunman was screaming, ""This is for healthcare."" Sanders did not take responsibility for that episode.

Trump, for his part, on Monday called for reforms at the intersection of mental health and gun laws -- including so-called ""red flag laws"" to take guns from those deemed a public risk -- in the wake of the back-to-back mass shootings over the weekend, which left at least 31 people dead in total.

The Trump administration previously enacted an unprecedented ban on firearm bump stocks that enable weapons to fire with greater rapidity, like machine guns -- and the ban was recently upheld by the Supreme Court. The move came after a 2017 massacre in Las Vegas, Nevada killed 58 people.

In unequivocal terms, the president on Monday also condemned white supremacy, responding to reports that the shooter in El Paso wrote a racist manifesto ahead of the violence. The manifesto specifically said that Trump's rhetoric was not to blame for the shooting, and said the shooter's views ""predate"" Trump's presidential campaign.

However, some observers cautioned that mass shooters are increasingly using disingenuous manifestos primarily as a means to cause division and sow political discord, rather than to advance a particular agenda. Crusius became the third mass shooter this year believed to have posted to the website 8Chan, which is a haven for both ironic trolls and racists, prior to going on a shooting rampage.

""The first mistake people are making is to assume the creep meant anything he said in his manifesto,"" wrote columnist Brian Cates. ""Something new has been added into the mix in the last year and we have to recognize it: Mass shootings done for **fun** as the ultimate troll where these [shooters] write confusing manifestos and then sit back & watch the fun as both sides claim he belongs to the other.""

Cates pointed out that the Christchurch, New Zealand mass shooter's manifesto contained a mixture of left-wing and right-wing rhetoric, and by its own explicit terms, was intended to cause international political division. The purported El Paso manifesto, like the New Zealand shooter's manifesto, also espoused eco-fascist principles and lamented the destruction of the environment.

Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden falsely suggested after Trump's remarks that Monday was the first time the president had condemned white supremacy.

Later, McConnell – a Republican who has been lambasted by Democrats for refusing to allow votes on gun control legislation – said Monday he is willing to consider “bipartisan” solutions in the wake of the mass shootings, though he emphasized that he opposes gun control policies that infringe “on Americans’ constitutional rights.”

Democrats have been demanding McConnell recall Congress from its current recess, which is slated to run to the second week of September, to address the matter.

The political fight over Trump's visit came amid a series of rapid-fire developments in the investigations in both El Paso and Dayton. Crusius was booked on capital murder charges, and authorities said Sunday that he is under investigation for alleged domestic terrorism. Officials were also looking into whether hate crime charges are appropriate.

El Paso District Attorney Jaime Esparza said his office will seek the death penalty against the suspect.

""The loss of life is so great, we certainly have never seen this in our community. We are a very safe community,"" he told reporters at a news conference on Sunday. ""We pride ourselves on the fact that we're so safe, and certainly this community is rocked, shocked and saddened by what has happened here yesterday.""

DEMS DEMAND RECALL OF CONGRESS TO ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE

El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said Monday that the gunman got lost in a neighborhood before ending up at Walmart ""because, we understand, he was hungry."" Allen didn't elaborate. Crusius' hometown is the affluent Dallas suburb of Allen.

The police chief said the gun used in the shooting was legally purchased near the suspect's hometown.

In his application for a public defender on Monday, Crusius said he has been unemployed for five months, and has no income, assets or expenses. He claimed he has been living with his grandparents.

In Ohio, authorities revealed that the gunman in the Dayton rampage, 24-year-old Connor Betts, opened fire outside a bar around 1 a.m. Sunday, killing his adult sister and eight others. Police say he was fatally shot by officers within 30 seconds, and was wearing a mask, bulletproof vest, earplugs and had at least 100 rounds.

Authorities provided a dramatic video of officers rushing onto the scene and taking Betts out before he could enter another packed bar.

Police had not determined a motive for the attack as of Monday evening. Reports linked him to Antifa, and showed that he supported Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Betts was armed with an AR-15-style rifle, police said. If all of the magazines he had with him were full, which hasn't been confirmed, he would have had a maximum of 250 rounds, said Police Chief Richard Biehl.

""It is fundamentally problematic. To have that level of weaponry in a civilian environment is problematic,"" Biehl added.

Of the more than 30 people injured in Ohio, at least 14 had gunshot wounds; others were hurt as people fled, city officials said. Eleven remained hospitalized Monday, Fire Chief Jeffrey Payne said.

Still unknown is whether Betts targeted any of the victims, including his 22-year-old sister, Megan, the youngest of the dead.

""It seems to just defy believability he would shoot his own sister, but it's also hard to believe that he didn't recognize it was his sister, so we just don't know,"" Biehl said.

While the gunman was white and six of the nine killed were black, police said the speed of the rampage made any discrimination in the shooting seem unlikely.

Opinion | Trump’s China Shock,https://www.nytimes.com,['Paul Krugman'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/opinion/trumps-china-shock.html,"So why are these smallish numbers such a big deal? Mostly because we’ve learned things about the protagonists in this trade conflict, things that make a bigger, longer trade war seem a lot more likely than it did even a few days ago.

First, Trump really is a Tariff Man. Some naïve souls may still have been hoping that he would learn something from the failure of his trade policy so far. More sensible people hoped that he might do what he did with NAFTA: reach a new deal basically the same as the old deal, proclaim that it was totally different, and claim a great victory.

But no: it’s pretty clear now that he refuses to give up on his belief that trade wars are good, and easy to win; his plan is to continue the beatings until morale improves. What may have looked like temporary tariffs designed to win concessions now look like permanent features of the world economy, with the level of tariffs and the range of countries facing them likely to expand over time.

Second, China is clearly signaling that it’s not Canada or Mexico: it’s too big and too proud to submit to what it considers bullying. That slide in the renminbi wasn’t a concrete policy measure as much as a way of saying to Trump, “talk to the hand” (no doubt there’s a good Chinese expression along these lines.)

Incidentally — or maybe it’s not so incidental — while there are many valid reasons to criticize Chinese policy, currency manipulation isn’t one of them. China was a major currency manipulator 7 or 8 years ago, but these days if anything it’s supporting its currency above the level it would be at if it were freely floating."
"Cesar Sayoc, Who Mailed Pipe Bombs to Trump Critics, Is Sentenced to 20 Years",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Benjamin Weiser', 'Ali Watkins']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/nyregion/cesar-sayoc-sentencing-pipe-bombing.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

Cesar A. Sayoc Jr., the fervent supporter of President Trump who rattled the nation last fall when he sent homemade pipe bombs to former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other prominent Democrats, was sentenced on Monday to 20 years in prison .

Mr. Sayoc pleaded guilty in March to mailing 16 bombs to people he considered to be Mr. Trump’s enemies. The F.B.I. said the devices were packed with powder from fireworks, fertilizer, a pool chemical and glass fragments that would function as shrapnel, but they would not have worked as designed.

In the end, the flaws in the bombs’ design were critical to a federal judge’s decision to give Mr. Sayoc 20 years in prison rather than the life sentence prosecutors requested. The judge, Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said he had concluded that Mr. Sayoc, though no firearms expert, was capable of concocting a pipe bomb that could explode and had consciously chosen not to.

“He hated his victims,” the judge said. “He wished them no good, but he was not so lost as to wish them dead, at least not by his own hand.”"

President Donald Trump’s vow Monday to scour “the dark recesses of the internet” came as this weekend’s deadly gun violence provoked ire over fringe online platforms like 8chan, an anonymous message board that has hosted a racist manifesto linked to Saturday’s deadly shooting in El Paso, Texas.

But any effort to curb dangerous extremism online will run into a host of obstacles: The Constitution and U.S. laws protect hateful speech, and obscure sites like 8chan are relatively immune to the kinds of political pressure that Washington is increasingly bringing to bear against mainstream platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google. And the same big tech sites have made only slow progress in removing content supporting terrorist groups like ISIS, despite years of pressure from the Obama administration.

Story Continued Below

Trump promised to press forward anyway, saying in a televised address, “We must recognize that the internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds and perform demented acts."" He said he was directing the Justice Department to coordinate with government agencies and social media companies “to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike.”

These are the some of the reasons the effort won’t be easy:

1) U.S. law offers a safe harbor

The First Amendment protects even racist, misogynistic and other hateful speech. And online sites enjoy broad legal immunity through another statute — Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act — that has become a major focus of the bipartisan congressional backlash against online sites like Facebook.

Under the law, websites enjoy almost blanket immunity from liability for content their users post. Lawmakers of both parties have questioned whether Section 230 offers too much cover to tech companies that fail to police their platforms — and the 8chan link to the El Paso shooting offers an opening to further attempts to weaken, change or do away with the law.

But industry groups argue that removing the 230 clause would only worsen the proliferation of dangerous material, because the provision is what allows tech platforms, acting in good faith, to take down harmful content without opening themselves up to legal troubles.

“Section 230 empowers platforms to stop the spread of vile content from the dark corners of the Internet,” said Carl Szabo, general counsel at NetChoice, an e-commerce trade group representing Facebook, Google and Twitter. “Without Section 230, extreme speech would become more prevalent online — not less.""

Even some groups highly critical of the online industry’s efforts to crack down on extremist content are warning against dialing back the legal safeguards, which they say protects a vast swath of content aimed at countering hate speech.

“I don’t think we should be in a rush to change the law because these horrible things are happening,” said Heidi Beirich, who tracks online extremism for the Southern Poverty Law Center.

2) Fringe sites often escape scrutiny

Lawmakers and activists have all kinds of leverage against companies like Facebook and Google, which employ vast lobbying armies in Washington, sometimes vie for big government contracts and can be swayed by pressure from their shareholders and employees.

But that kind of leverage has little leeway with sites like 8chan.

8chan, whose owner resides in the Philippines, represents the self-proclaimed “Darkest Reaches of the Internet” seen as a haven for unbridled free speech and a breeding ground for domestic terrorism. It’s even more of a free-for-all site than its better-known counterpart 4chan, which developed a reputation for racist content.

Numerous reports have linked 8chan to misogynistic material, child pornography and the infamous QAnon conspiracy, which claims Trump is waging a secret war against pedophiles and so-called “deep state” actors.

That fringe quality, though, means it's harder to get such sites to remove content than it was to get big social media companies to remove videos and posts by Islamic State supporters.

“The difference is that with ISIS you’re mostly dealing with the mainstream sites of the world: YouTube, Google, and Facebook,” said Seamus Hughes, a former top staffer at the National Counterterrorism Center who now serves as deputy director of George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. “But with white nationalism, white supremacy, you’re dealing with fringe websites that aren’t part of the larger ecosystem of content moderation.”

In 2017, under pressure from Washington and after years of proclaiming the difficulties of determining what counts as terrorist content and removing it across their platforms, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube formed a group called the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism to share best practices and work together to combat violent and extremist posts. Pinterest and Dropbox later joined what Hughes calls a “coalition of the willing.”

Only more recently have lawmakers like Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, turned their attention to sites like 8chan.

“To be honest with you, most of us had never heard of that channel until a few months ago, and then you find out people have been using it for quite a while,” Thompson told POLITICO in May.

3) Even the big sites still provide gateways to radicalism

Experts on white supremacy say that while 8chan might grab headlines, some people — especially young white men — first get a taste of the ideology on popular sites like Twitter and YouTube, despite all the years of pressure for the services to stop fostering hate.

Beirich said tech industry leaders turned a blind eye to white nationalist speech on their sites until the deadly clash between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017 that prompted a public reckoning about online hatred.

“Until 2017, for 10 years, we had no idea how many young white men were radicalized into hardcore white nationalism” online, she said. “This is why we’ve been arguing hate groups should come off of these mainstream platforms for years.”

Since then, the companies have taken steps to crack down. Facebook earlier this year expanded its definition of hate speech to include white nationalist and white separatist content. But the move sparked objections from some right-wing commentators, who tied the policy to longstanding allegations that online platforms censor conservative speech. And advocacy groups warned that the policy shift could inadvertently sweep up groups looking to combat online extremism.

“When speech is censored by private parties based on the content of that speech, there's nothing stopping Facebook — or YouTube or Twitter — from using that same power to censor organizations fighting to protect abortion rights or individuals fighting against climate change tomorrow,” American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney Vera Eidelman told POLITICO earlier this year.

Fringe platforms, meanwhile, have pointed to the ongoing presence of hate speech and extremist content on top platforms to shield against criticisms. “My question is, why is the focus on 8chan? The El Paso shooter also had accounts on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter from my understanding,” read a statement posted on the Twitter account of Gab, a social network known as a hotbed for white nationalist content.

The gunman who killed more than 50 people in March at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, livestreamed that massacre on Facebook, he pointed out, “and no one called for Facebook to be shut down.”

4) Racially divisive speech can fail to trigger the necessary alarms

8chan has served repeatedly as the digital home base where suspects in mass shootings have promoted violent or racist views before carrying out their plans. In March, an account believed to belong to the Christchurch, New Zealand, gunman aired white nationalist sentiment in a manifesto posted to the platform. And in April, an individual who identified himself as the suspect in a deadly shooting near San Diego, Calif., aired racist views on the forum prior to that attack.

But Shahed Amanullah, a former senior adviser on technology to secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, said that both government and industry are less likely to view domestic expressions of racial extremism as problematic than they are with statements supporting international terrorism.

“Back when I was in the State Department, obviously people were very concerned about this behavior coming from Muslim groups, like al Qaeda, but there’s a disconnect: When it’s people who are familiar or closer to home, it doesn’t register as an existential threat, because people are just too familiar with it. There’s terrorism and there’s this thing we don’t think of as terrorism,” said Amanullah.

“But there’s no such thing as ‘domestic terrorism’ anymore because borders don’t mean anything,” he said. And the online platforms, he says, need to take homegrown white supremacist rhetoric seriously: “If you’re truly serious about keeping language off your platform that leads to violence, you need to be true to your word whether it’s Islamic extremists or white nationalists.”

Washington's failure to treat white supremacy as a serious threat can mean that online platforms don’t feel pressure to act, said Hughes, the former counterterrorism official. “Technology companies respond to the threat of regulation, and if that happens with white nationalism, you might see more action,” he said.

5) The real decision-makers — internet infrastructure companies — don’t want the responsibility

The real power brokers at the moment are the internet infrastructure companies that have the power to erase whole sites from the web, at least for a time.

On Monday, the CEO of Cloudflare — a company that helps protect websites from cyberattacks that can render them unreachable — said that he’d made the decision to pull his company’s protective services from 8chan in light of the El Paso attack. “The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths,” wrote Matthew Prince, the CEO.

Some lawmakers have pointed to those sorts of moves as useful progress. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) told POLITICO that while fringe sites like 8chan “have yet to demonstrate any willingness to limit content depicting violence, torture, racism and child pornography,” public scrutiny, and the resulting response by services such as Cloudflare, has succeeded in limiting their ability to operate.

“Our efforts should be focused on containing, counter-messaging, and delegitimizing these bastions of hate,” said Rogers, the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee.

But Prince, the Cloudflare CEO, says he dislikes wielding that power. “We continue to feel incredibly uncomfortable about playing the role of content arbiter and do not plan to exercise it often,” he wrote. “Cloudflare is not a government. While we've been successful as a company, that does not give us the political legitimacy to make determinations on what content is good and bad. Nor should it.”

Eidelman, the ACLU staff attorney, told POLITICO that “as odious and truly reprehensible as the statements in the manifesto are, I think we have to be careful about a world in which a handful of actors can drive speakers off the web at their sole discretion.”

8chan was offline for parts of Monday, but is likely to return to the web when it lines up other service providers."

DHS Official: Trump Can’t Admit ‘This Is Terrorism’,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dhs-official-on-el-paso-and-dayton-trump-cant-admit-this-is-terrorism,"After a weekend of carnage, President Trump said some things that sounded heartening. But current and former law enforcement officials say the president’s words aren’t enough—and they fear it’s all he has to offer.

Thirty-one people were killed between attacks on public places in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in the span of 12 hours this past weekend. While authorities say they have no motive yet for the Dayton attack, officials said the accused El Paso attacker wrote a manifesto justifying the mass murder of Hispanic people to stop their “invasion” of the U.S. Federal prosecutors said they’re considering domestic terrorism charges for the attacker. (Days earlier, a gunman expressing similar racist views killed three people at a food festival in California.)

“This is a clear manifestation of the political discourse that has taken place in the country over the past two years or so,” one Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told The Daily Beast. “It cannot be blamed on mental health. This is an ideology-driven hate crime. This is terrorism and the White House has trouble labeling it as such. It is very frustrating.”

In remarks Monday from the White House, the president blamed violent video games and mental health problems for the carnage. He called for the implementation of red flag laws, also known as risk protection orders, that let people petition a judge to have the guns of their friends and family taken away if they worry that person will harm others. He even went so far to say “ our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy” —something he has shied away from in the past.

The DHS official called the remarks “demoralizing,” noting the president’s effort to spread the blame around.

Despite the president’s call for reforms, current and former law enforcement officials say they aren’t satisfied. Sources say white supremacy is a significant threat to U.S. national security, and one mention in a 10-minute presidential speech won’t cut it.

“It is a good step to recognize the threat of white supremacy, but words alone cannot solve the problem,” said Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent who specialized in counterterrorism cases. “Action speaks louder than words. What kind of policy, legislations, designation, and funding is the administration willing to propose, support, and authorize in order to counter this emerging threat? This is where the rubber meets the road.”

Some officials said they put little stock in Trump’s words, worrying that the president would, as in the past, backtrack on his statements on white supremacy.

Others said Trump’s brief condemnation of the ideology meant little following his statements earlier in the day that linked the weekend’s shootings to the need for new immigration legislation—the accused El Paso shooter said immigration was destroying the country.

“I am concerned that white supremacist thought leaders will view his tweet linking immigration reform with background checks as a tacit signal that he still supports their agenda,” said John Cohen, the former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “It is mind-boggling he would blend the two issues. I don’t think there is a thorough understanding of the issues at the White House.”

Despite the concern surrounding Trump’s rhetoric on white supremacy, the intelligence community appears to be taking a new, active step in addressing the threat. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is hosting a conference on domestic terrorism with the FBI and DHS next month, according to a person familiar with the plans. An invitation to the event said the conference will scrutinize the federal government’s response to the threat in light of the recent deadly attacks by white supremacists on synagogues in Pennsylvania and California and mosques in New Zealand.

If Trump’s speech was any indication of where the White House plans to focus its efforts following the fatal shootings over the weekend, it seems white supremacy is an afterthought.

The president focused his speech on tracking individuals with mental illnesses.

“Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,” Trump said. “We must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement.”

Authorities have not offered evidence that the accused gunmen in El Paso and Dayton were mentally ill. The American Psychological Association said in response to Trump’s remarks: “Blaming mental illness for the gun violence in our country is simplistic and inaccurate and goes against the scientific evidence currently available.”

Trump went on to say that he directed the Department of Justice to work with other law enforcement agencies and social media companies to better detect people he said were mentally ill and liable to kill.

“We must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs,” Trump said.

Federal law enforcement agencies have in the past worked with DHS as well as state and local law enforcement to track people who may endanger others, including veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with criminal pasts. National Security Agency software company Beware at one point let local police departments calculate individuals’ threat levels by collecting things like arrest reports, property records, and social media postings. Meanwhile, the FBI tracks potential terrorist attacks by opening official investigations. Many of those probes have focused on Muslim terrorist suspects following 9/11 and the rise of ISIS.

The only question now, law enforcement officials say, is whether the president will order a crackdown on white supremacist violence.

“The president did what presidents should do, which is condemn bigotry and hatred,” said George Salim, a former DHS official who now works at the Anti-Defamation League. “But what’s needed is resources, strategy, and policy. And the real measure of these horrible atrocities is if the resources, strategy, and policy of the federal government matches the president’s comments today.

“How many lives need to be lost before action is accelerated and the administration works with Congress? The time is now.”"
Judge signals interest in removing Mueller report redactions,https://www.politico.com,['Darren Samuelsohn'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/05/judge-signals-interest-in-removing-mueller-report-redactions-1448331,"Monday’s court arguments represent one of the many ways former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation continues to linger even though his office shuttered earlier this spring. | Getty Images Legal Judge signals interest in removing Mueller report redactions ‘That’s what open government is all about,’ Judge Reggie Walton said during court arguments over a FOIA lawsuit against the Justice Department.

A federal judge signaled Monday he’s considering removing the Mueller report’s redactions.

During more than two hours of oral arguments in Washington, District Judge Reggie Walton appeared on several occasions to side with attorneys for BuzzFeed and the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center, which are seeking to remove the black bars covering nearly 1,000 items in former special counsel Robert Mueller’s final 448-page final report.

Walton didn’t issue an opinion from the bench on the case, which centers on a pair of consolidated lawsuits filed against the Justice Department under the Freedom of Information Act. But the judge, an appointee of President George W. Bush, sounded increasingly skeptical of the government's arguments pressing him to leave the redactions untouched.

“That’s what open government is about,” Walton said during one exchange, citing the resolution of a 2008 sex crimes case against financier Jeffrey Epstein as an example of how obfuscating the reasons behind not prosecuting high-profile people generates public distrust in the country’s criminal justice system.

Indeed, EPIC and BuzzFeed filed their lawsuit in order to uncover such information — the redacted explanation of why the special counsel didn’t bring charges against the likes of Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner. And in court Monday, their attorneys argued that disclosing these details would help resolve whether the president is right to claim the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was a “witch hunt.”

“It’s something that frankly ripped this country apart,” argued Matt Topic, an attorney for BuzzFeed, regarding the competing and often bitter partisan claims surrounding the credibility of Mueller’s investigation. “The people deserve to know as much as they possibly can.”

Monday’s court arguments represent one of the many ways the Mueller investigation continues to linger even though the special counsel’s office shuttered earlier this spring. House Judiciary Committee Democrats last month asked the chief judge of the D.C. District Court to issue an order to let them see the underlying materials the special counsel used. The Democrats said they need the information to make a decision about whether to impeach the president.

While Walton has the power to issue an opinion that goes directly to the BuzzFeed and EPIC lawsuit, he’s also weighing another incremental step the two organizations have requested. Essentially, they asked Walton to review the unredacted Mueller report to see if the exemptions the Justice Department is citing to block release of the full document actually line up with what’s allowed under the law.

Several of the judge’s questions appeared designed to understand what he’d get out of doing that kind of analysis himself. But he also made several comments over the course of the hearing suggesting where he may fall.

For example, Walton said he had “some concerns” about trying to reconcile public statements Trump and Attorney General William Barr have made about the report with the content of the report itself.

The judge pointed to Trump’s claims that Mueller found “no collusion” between his campaign and Russia and the president’s insistence that he had been exonerated from a possible obstruction of justice charge. These comments, Walton said, appeared bolstered by Barr’s description of Mueller’s findings during a DOJ news conference — before the public and media could read the document for themselves.

“It’d seem to be inconsistent with what the report itself said,” Walton said. The judge also cited a letter Mueller’s office sent to Barr questioning the attorney general’s decision to release a four-page summary of the investigation’s conclusions that “did not fully capture the context, nature and substance” of the report.

Separately on Monday, Walton raised questions about a DOJ submission defending the agency’s decision to black out large portions of the Mueller report.

“I also worked for the department,” Walton said. “Sometimes the body does what the head wants.”

Courtney Enlow, a DOJ trial attorney, defended the Mueller report redactions and insisted they all fall inside the exemptions allowed under FOIA, such as the need to keep grand jury information private and protect the government’s investigative methods. The government can also withhold information for national security purposes or to maintain people’s privacy.

Enlow argued that additional disclosures would harm several ongoing investigations Mueller handed off to other federal prosecutors. And she warned that releasing redacted information in the special counsel report could undercut longtime Trump aide Roger Stone’s ability to get a fair trial in his case that centers on lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing justice. He is set to stand trial in November.

“Nothing more is required here, your honor,” Enlow said.

Enlow also said Buzzfeed and EPIC lawyers are “speculating” as they seek to highlight potential disclosures that would come should the redactions be removed from the report, which she noted were made with help from Mueller’s team.

“This is not a singular person who was making decisions with redactions,” she said.

At the conclusion of the hearing, Walton acknowledged the likelihood that whatever he does will generate an appeal. “I’ll try to get this done as quickly as I can, so we can have this matter resolved one way or another,” he said."
US Treasury declares China ‘currency manipulator’ after Wall Street suffers worst day of 2019,https://www.rt.com,[],,,,https://www.rt.com/business/465849-treasury-china-currency-manipulator/,"Washington has escalated the trade war with Beijing by accusing China of being a currency manipulator, after a Wall Street stock wipeout due to reports of Chinese retaliation to US tariffs.

“In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past,” US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced on Monday afternoon. “The context of these actions and the implausibility of China’s market stability rationale confirm that the purpose of China’s currency devaluation is to gain an unfair competitive advantage in international trade.”

Mnuchin’s designation triggers a set of measures mandated under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, including a complaint to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The law also calls for bilateral talks to eliminate the 'unfair' practice.

President Donald Trump campaigned on the platform of labeling China a currency manipulator but has held off on doing so for the past two and a half years, preferring to escalate the trade dispute with Beijing through tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in goods the US imports from China every year.

Accusing China of walking away from the already agreed-upon trade deal, last week Trump announced new tariffs that will go into effect on September 1.

In response, the Chinese government has ordered a halt to purchases of US agricultural exports – such as soybeans. US soybean exports have already suffered from the trade war, with Trump scrambling to offset the losses by farmers, an important constituency of his going into the 2020 presidential election.

Who has the upper hand in the U.S.-China trade war?,https://www.marketwatch.com,['Charles Hankla'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/who-has-the-upper-hand-in-the-us-china-trade-war-2019-08-05,"President Donald Trump recently escalated his trade war with China, threatening to impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion of untaxed Chinese imports.

If the new tariff goes into effect in September as promised, virtually all Chinese exports to the U.S. would be subject to levies ranging from 10% to 25%. China retaliated by letting the value of its currency fall to the lowest level in more than a decade and halting all crop imports.

Many Americans like me are now wondering: Is there any end in sight?

How to win an economic war

As a scholar of trade policy, I’ve repeatedly made the point that free exchange is a positive-sum game — meaning every participating country can benefit — rather than zero-sum, as Trump seems to believe. This is why commercial disputes are certain to harm all participants.

I believe the United States could have avoided its current predicament by using the World Trade Organization’s existing dispute resolution process to address its justifiable concerns with Chinese behavior.

Still, from the perspective of a single country, starting a trade war could potentially be justified if the end result ultimately shifts the terms of trade in its favor.

Such a victory can only be achieved when the country has more bargaining leverage than its opponent — in other words when it can impose more pain on its adversary than it experiences itself.

And the longer the trade war continues, the more concessions that country will have to win in order to compensate for the damage caused.

So, after nearly 18 months of escalating disputes between the U.S. and China, where are we? Is either side winning, and can any concessions justify the economic harm that both sides have already experienced?

China’s pain

First and foremost, it has become increasingly clear that the trade war is hurting the economies of both countries. Neither will emerge from this conflict unscathed.

Unfortunately, however, the last 18 months have done little to clarify who is winning — that is, who is hurting less and can credibly hold out for longer.

Take China. Before the trade war, it was already facing a number of significant challenges, first among them how to effect a transition from its current reliance on cheap manufacturing to the production of higher value-added goods. China’s political stability is also somewhat precarious, as evidenced by recent events in Hong Kong and Xianjing, as well as Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s authoritarian crackdown.

Moreover, China’s economic growth has slowed to a 27-year low of 6.2%. And perhaps more ominously for the country, there are growing signs that foreign companies from America and elsewhere are looking outside China as they expand their sourcing, production and distribution activities.

Of course, China’s growth rate still makes it among the fastest-expanding economies in the world, so the recent slowdown can hardly be termed a crisis. And the shift away from China, limited as it is, began before the trade war, spurred on by rising prices, intellectual property theft and other issues.

Not necessarily America’s gain

The problem for the U.S. is that Americans are also increasingly feeling the pinch.

Perhaps most notably, farmers, many of whom continue to support Trump, are beginning to tire of the sacrifices they are making for his uncompromising positions. With the Chinese government threatening to retaliate if Trump follows through on the new tariffs, their willingness to go along may be even more sorely tested.

To keep agriculture on side, the Trump administration has channeled billions of dollars in subsidies to those hurt by his trade policy. But this approach also has its political costs, with more fiscally conservative backers of the president balking at the price tag.

From a broader perspective, recent studies have undercut Trump’s claim that Chinese companies are bearing the brunt of the tariff payments, showing that the bulk of costs are passed to U.S. companies and consumers. And the stock market DJIA, -2.90% is reacting very negatively to the latest Trump threats.

Read: Why U.S. stocks remain vulnerable as Trump trade tweets revive global growth jitters

It is true that the overall American economy remains strong, with expanding employment and a fast, though slowing, growth rate of 2.1% in the most recent period. But China has one more strategic advantage that could make a substantial difference: It can wait out Trump’s presidency.

If the Trump administration’s approach to trade represented a bipartisan consensus, the U.S. could keep up the pressure over the long term. Containment policy during the Cold War, in which the United States committed itself to curbing Soviet influence, represents the classic example of a consensus that was credibly maintained, in one form or another, across several administrations.

But because the tariffs are so associated with Trump’s personality, the Chinese government can afford to wait for a new president. If a Democrat wins in 2020, he or she will likely maintain a harder line on China than we saw before Trump, but will probably repudiate the current president’s penchant for punitive and precipitous tariffs.

In a sense, then, America’s negotiating credibility has become yet another casualty of its polarized politics.

In other words: No end in sight

In the final analysis, then, China may have the most to lose from the ongoing dispute. But the U.S. bargaining position is more politically vulnerable.

And the Chinese can credibly claim that buckling under American pressure would be unacceptable to their domestic audience.

Studies of shooting wars indicate that they tend to continue until events on the ground reveal which side is likely to win. The same is surely true for trade wars.

Since neither side is clearly winning or losing, we have probably not seen the end of this conflict.

"USDA science agencies’ relocation may have violated law, inspector general report says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'August At Pm', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/08/05/usda-science-agencies-relocation-may-have-violated-law-inspector-general-report-says/,"

A plan to move two Agriculture Department scientific agencies from Washington to Kansas City may have run afoul of the 2018 appropriations act, according to a report released Monday from the USDA’s Office of Inspector General.

In August 2018, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue unveiled a plan to relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees $1.7 billion in scientific grants and funding, and the Economic Research Service, a federal statistical agency that publishes influential reports on agricultural trade and rural America. Both agencies lease office space in the District.

USDA selected the Kansas City region as the new home for these agencies in June 2019, in what Perdue has billed as a cost-saving decision. About two-thirds of nearly 400 employees refused the reassignment and will lose their jobs. “This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, told The Washington Post last month.

The department has the legal authority to move the agencies, per the USDA inspector general’s investigation. But USDA also needs budgetary approval from Congress to fund the moves, the inspector general’s office said, which the department did not obtain.

In the fall, USDA awarded a $340,000 contract to the accounting firm Ernst & Young to assist with the relocation. The 2018 omnibus spending bill required USDA to receive congressional approval before spending this money. “That prior approval did not appear to have been granted,” the inspector general report says.

This expense may have also violated the Antideficiency Act, the report said, which prevents federal employees from involving the government “in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made.”

Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), who requested the inspector general’s investigation in September 2018, exhorted USDA to follow the law. “The Secretary must follow the will of Congress and refrain from moving forward with the relocation,” they said in a joint statement Monday, “until Congress approves the use of funds for those purposes as directed by the fiscal year 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act.”

In a list of recommendations in the report, the inspector general’s office advised USDA to seek congressional approval.

USDA management refused to do so. “To say the department was out of step with budgetary requirements disregards the authority given to the executive branch by the U.S. Constitution,” according to a statement provided by USDA. It continued: “Since the inspector general affirms the department has the legal authority and we do not agree with the unconstitutional budgetary provision, this case is closed.”

On Friday, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, in a keynote speech at a Republican Party gala in South Carolina, said of the attrition at the agencies: “By simply saying to people, ‘You know what, we’re going to take you outside the bubble, outside the Beltway, outside this liberal haven of Washington, D.C., and move you out in the real part of the country,' and they quit — what a wonderful way to sort of streamline government.”

The Trump administration has temporarily frozen and ordered a review of several key foreign aid funds that Congress has already approved, in a move that critics fear could lead to another attempted rollback of foreign aid.

The Office of Management and Budget sent a letter to the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development on Saturday, notifying them of the action, which took effect one minute before midnight that day.

The OMB asked the agencies for a balance sheet of foreign aid projects that have not yet been funded. Michael P. Duffey, the associate director for national security programs at OMB, wrote that no more money can be obligated from those funds until three days after OMB receives the numbers, a process that could take days if not weeks.

The letter, viewed by The Washington Post, lists eight areas that cover a variety of assistance: international organizations; peacekeeping operations and activities; international narcotics control and law enforcement; development aid; assistance for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia; economic support funding; foreign military financing programs; and global health programs.

An administration official said the funds targeted for review are above budgetary limits proposed by President Trump. They include big-ticket items like contributions to the United Nations and smaller items like solar panels in the Caribbean, schools in Uzbekistan and soccer programs in Central America.

Traditionally, a significant portion of foreign aid funding is obligated toward the end of a fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30. But this year the pot is bigger, in part because the administration has cut aid to the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and for the Palestinians.

According to people familiar with the process, the named funds could be as little as $2 billion and as much as $4 billion.

The State Department and USAID declined to comment, referring questions to OMB.

“It is incumbent on all federal agencies to properly use funds provided by Congress,” said Rachel Semmel, the OMB spokeswoman. “In an effort to ensure accountability, OMB has requested the current status of several foreign assistance accounts to identify the amount of funding that is unobligated. On behalf of American taxpayers, OMB has an obligation to ensure their money is being used wisely.”

Trump has proposed steep cuts in foreign aid in all of his budget requests, but Congress has restored the funding.

Last year, OMB asked the State Department and USAID to provide a similar balance sheet of unobligated projects just six weeks before the end of the budget year. It said money for projects considered “unnecessary” — potentially as much as $3 billion — could be returned to the Treasury, a process known as rescission

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued against the rescission championed by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, and Congress pushed against what it viewed as a backdoor attempt to get around its spending authority, so the administration dropped the proposal. The Government Accountability Office, in a decision last December, rebuked the idea of an attempted rescission so late in the budget year, saying there must be enough time for a “prudent obligation” that could take weeks or even months. This year, Pompeo was in Australia when the letter was sent and Congress was near the beginning of a recess.

No decisions have been made, and the information requested from the agencies is purely for the purpose of review. But the memory of the failed attempt to slash foreign aid last year has led some in the broader foreign aid community to be concerned that Mulvaney, who remains head of OMB and is the acting White House chief of staff, will try again.

“He’s tried again and again to take a sledgehammer to the most minuscule yet high impact part of the budget,” said Liz Schrayer, president of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a network of businesses and organizations that advocate for international development. “He keeps losing, because Congress has seen in a bipartisan fashion these cuts are reckless, and these funds are in America’s security interest. I think we’ll see that again.”

A senior Democratic aide said that it appears the administration is preparing to circumvent Congress with a rescission package and that it can expect a fight.

“Irrelevant of what the Trump administration may wish, Congress still has the power of the purse and we appropriated these funds because they are necessary to protect our interests and national security,” said the aide, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans under consideration. “We are in touch with the State Department and are demanding answers. This scheme would set the precedent for this and all future administrations to ignore spending bills and eliminate spending obligations by jamming Congress with end-of-fiscal year rescission packages.”"
"As climate reckoning arrives over agriculture, USDA’s scientists face censorship",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/climate-ipcc-usda-agriculture-emissions-science-relocation-fallout-trump-845a61311bd3/,"A government climate scientist who says the Trump administration buried a groundbreaking report he authored has left the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in protest over the “political views” top officials allegedly imposed on his work.

Politico reported Monday that Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist who worked at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) for more than 20 years, quit due to an increasingly political atmosphere at the agency. Ziska had worked on a major rice study last year, one that found rising levels of carbon dioxide could imperil the critical source of sustenance for some 600 million people globally. According to Ziska’s work, the mineral and protein content in rice, along with key vitamins, is expected to drop as greenhouse gas levels rise.

Agency scientists have accused department officials of seeking to bury that report, among others, in keeping with President Donald Trump’s stance denying and downplaying climate change. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue has similarly dismissed global warming as “weather patterns.”

USDA claims the study wasn’t publicized because of disagreement among career officials. But Ziska told Politico that the reason the study was buried is down to political ideology and the administration’s unwillingness to embrace established climate science.

“There was a sense [at USDA] that if the science agreed with the politics, then the policymakers would consider it to be ‘good science,’ and if it didn’t agree with the politics, then it was something that was flawed and needed to be done again,” he said.

The scientist’s departure coincides with a summary copy of a highly-anticipated U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on land use being leaked this week. The report emphasizes that global food production must become more sustainable in order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.

His resignation also comes as the agency is still reeling from a controversial relocation effort connected to disputes over scientific integrity.

The department is set to lose a staggering number of career officials over a deeply contested relocation plan. Perdue announced in June that staffers with USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would be asked to relocate to Kansas City, which straddles Kansas and Missouri. Over 500 staffers were given until July 15 to decide whether to relocate by September 30.

More than half of those staffers reportedly declined to move and have effectively chosen to resign — a dramatic loss of institutional knowledge and career staff who have worked with the department for decades.

USDA has argued that the move is a cost-saving effort to bring the department closer to farm country. But former USDA officials and the union representing employees have rejected that narrative. Many say it is an attempt to force out knowledgeable researchers and scientists, as well as a retaliation for the climate science work produced by some staffers at USDA.

Conversations about the link between agriculture and climate change, however, are only set to escalate. Last year, an IPCC report warned that the world had only 12 years left before crossing a dangerous threshold of global warming — one that would yield climate impacts on a scale not seen before. A leaked copy of this year’s report focuses on land use and the role of agriculture in mitigating climate change.

According to the draft, which is currently being debated in Geneva before its release later this week, cutting carbon emissions from sources like cars and power plants will only go so far. Agriculture, forestry, and other land-use practices are producing roughly a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, the report says, with cattle and rice fields in particular generating around 50% of methane emissions. That has contributed heavily to climate impacts, the draft finds, with the situation only set to worsen.

“Climate change exacerbates land degradation through increases in rainfall intensity, flooding, drought frequency and severity, heat stress, wind, sea-level rise and wave action,” the document states.

In addition to changing how people use land, the IPCC draft underscores that switching to vegetarian and vegan diets may be a critical part of staving off the worst climate impacts.

That refrain may sound familiar to some. Critics of the proposed Green New Deal — a blueprint for radically shifting the United States to net-zero emissions — have argued the climate plan will “ban cows” and deprive Americans of hamburgers. The proposal itself does not move to bar bovines from the country but it does single out agriculture as a major source of greenhouse gases and a sector in need of overhauling if the United States is to zero-out emissions. The IPCC’s findings are therefore likely to draw more attention to the climate science realities dogging agriculture.

High profile exits at USDA are also likely to fuel scrutiny of the Trump administration’s attitudes towards the sector’s relationship with climate science. And other major exits over climate change are also driving headlines. Rod Schoonover, a former senior analyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department, wrote in an op-ed last week that the White House had blocked the release of his report on climate change and national security.

“The stated reason,” Schoonover said, “was that the scientific foundation of the analysis did not comport with the administration’s position on climate change.”"

""This was a sick person, the person in Dayton was a sick person,"" Mulvaney told ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl in an interview Sunday. ""No politician is to blame for that. The person who was responsible here are the people who pulled the trigger. We need to figure out how to kind of create less of those kinds of people as a society and not trying to figure out who gets blamed going into the next election.""

Several of those killed in El Paso, which borders Mexico, were Mexican citizens, and officials said that they are examining what they called a ""manifesto"" that they believe was written by the shooter and shows a possible ""nexus"" to a hate crime. After he was arrested, the suspect told investigators he wanted to shoot as many Mexicans as possible, two law enforcement officials told ABC News.

Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico's foreign minister, said six Mexicans were killed and nine were injured and that the nation is considering legal action against whomever provided the shooter with the assault weapon.

Pressed by Karl on whether Trump was at all to blame for using words like ""invasion"" to talk about illegal immigration and saying congresswomen of color should leave the country, Mulvaney said Trump was just as saddened and angered by the shootings as others.

""There's no benefit here to trying to make this a political issue,"" said Mulvaney. ""This is a social issue.""

He labeled the gunmen in El Paso and Dayton ""crazy people"" who ""should not be able to get guns."" The Dayton gunman, who died at the scene, killed at least nine people, authorities said. Dozens were injured in each attack.

""Sick people who are intent on doing things like this should not be able to buy guns legally,"" Mulvaney said.

Rep. Veronica Escobar, whose congressional district includes El Paso, said Saturday night that while investigators must complete an investigation, the El Paso suspect's so-called ""manifesto"" suggested the shooting could have been an act of ""domestic terrorism.""

“In this country, we have a gun violence epidemic but we also have a hate epidemic,"" Escobar said in an earlier interview on ""This Week."" ""And until we confront that hate and until we confront the weak gun laws that we have we're going to keep seeing this.”

""Today's shooting in El Paso, Texas, was not only tragic, it was an act of cowardice,"" President Donald Trump tweeted overnight. ""I know that I stand with everyone in this Country to condemn today's hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people.""

After the Ohio attack, he tweeted that ""Information is rapidly being accumulated in Dayton"" and noted the law enforcement response ""was very rapid in both"" Dayton and El Paso. ""God bless the people of El Paso Texas,"" he added. ""God bless the people of Dayton, Ohio.""

In March, ABC News Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran asked the president in the Oval Office if he thought white nationalism was a rising threat around the world.

Trump replied: ""I don't really. I think it's a small group of people that have a very, very serious problem.""

Pushed by Karl about why the president has downplayed the threat of white nationalism, Mulvaney said white nationalism is not as big a threat as ""international nuclear weapons.""

""I don't believe he's downplaying it. … Look, this is not the same as international, sort of, nuclear weapons,"" Mulvaney said. ""This is a serious problem, there's no question about it. But they are sick, sick people. And the president knows that. Again, Jon, I don't think it's fair to try and lay this at the feet of the president.""

""I don't think it's at all fair to sit here and say that he doesn't think that white nationalism is bad for the nation,"" Mulvaney added. ""These are sick people. You cannot be a white supremacist and be normal in the head.""

Later on ""This Week,"" Julian Castro, a former secretary of housing and urban development who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, said said the shooter in El Paso bore responsibility, but added that ""most presidents have chosen to try to bring people together.""

""Anybody who has the ability to see and hear and understand what the president has been doing since he started his campaign in 2015 knows that division and bigotry and fanning the flames of hate has been his political strategy,"" Castro said. ""He's given license for this toxic brew of white supremacy to fester more and more in this country. And we're seeing the results of that.""

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, another 2020 Democratic candidate, issued a statement late Sunday that read, in part:

""Donald Trump said today that 'hate has no place in our country,' but he has openly fostered and preached hate from his place in the White House. I stand by my statement from last week: We can no longer allow a white nationalist in the White House. He has been fanning the flames of racial disparity and hatred for years. America deserves a leader who will work to heal us rather than widen our divides. ... President Trump’s claim that he has 'done a lot' on gun violence prevention is a boldfaced lie.""

U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Richard Blumenthal proposed antitrust legislation Friday that, if passed, could give the Justice Department’s recently launched probe into monopoly concerns among big tech companies some serious teeth if any violations come to light.

The two Democrats call it the “Monopolization Deterrence Act,” Reuters reported. This legislation would grant the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission the ability to levy civil penalties when companies break antitrust law, up to 15 percent of the company’s total U.S. revenue or 30 percent of its U.S. revenue in affected markets.

Certain companies have grown so powerful that the fear of earning an injunction for monopolization offenses no longer works as a successful deterrent, prompting the need for “serious financial consequences,” Klobuchar, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for next year’s presidential election, said in a statement about the bill on her website.

“Our legislation would empower our antitrust watchdogs with new tools to deter monopolization of market power and hold bad actors accountable,” Blumenthal said in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. “American consumers and workers are being crushed by corporate consolidation, and our outdated laws have failed to keep pace with our modern economy.”

Whether the bill specifically names Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, or any other companies involved in the Justice Department’s probe, they seem like likely targets of this legislation given its timing. Klobuchar also previously headed efforts in June to provide Congress with more details about these investigations before they launched, according to her office’s statement.

As part of its review, the Justice Department plans to analyze how these big tech companies have secured their market power and whether their practices have “reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers,” per a DOJ statement.

The move comes just weeks after the FTC hit Facebook with a $5 billion fine in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which breached roughly 87 million Facebook users’ personal data. Considering the company made $15.08 billion in revenue in this year’s first quarter alone, Democrats at the time said the commission “failed miserably” in its ruling. While privacy violations and antitrust violations are two entirely different beasts, the way this new bill specifies possible fines as a proportion of a company’s earnings could very well be in response to their dissatisfaction with how the FTC’s handled punishing the big tech company previously."
EPA submits final controversial car emissions rule to the White House,https://thehill.com,[],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456206-epa-submits-final-controversial-car-emissions-rule-to-the-white,"The White House is reviewing the final policy that would roll back Obama-era standards for vehicle emissions.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Transportation submitted the finalized Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule to the White House for review on Saturday, the second-to-last step before the controversial rule is implemented.

“Today, after reviewing hundreds of thousands of public comments and undertaking extensive scientific and economic analyses, EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) together have initiated formal interagency review for the draft SAFE Vehicles Final Rule,” the agencies said in a joint statement.

“EPA and NHTSA firmly believe that this rule will benefit all Americans by improving the U.S. fleet’s fuel economy, reducing air pollution, helping make new vehicles more affordable for all Americans and, because new vehicles are safer than ever, ultimately saving thousands of lives and reducing the number of Americans seriously injured in car crashes.” ADVERTISEMENT

The final draft of the rule submitted to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will not become public until the rule is complete.

The agencies first submitted their drafts of the vehicle emissions rules for model years 2021-2026 passenger cars and light trucks in August 2018, to immediate backlash.

Environmental groups and lawmakers across the country have criticized the rule for weakening air pollution standards for cars.

The finalization of the rule is expected to be heavily litigated, including through lawsuits threatened by a number of state attorneys general.

News of the rule’s near-imminent implementation comes shortly after California struck a deal with a handful of automakers to keep their emissions cuts in line with the regulations laid out in the Obama-era rule. California had worked hand in hand with the Obama administration to determine stringent air pollution standards for cars.

The state maintains it has the right to establish its own strong air quality standards under the Clean Air Act, and auto manufactuers have long sought one national standard for vehicles across the country.

EPA and the Department of Transportation said when the rule is finalized it will be a “win for all Americans.”"
10-year Treasury yield plunges below 1.74% after China counters US trade action,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/05/us-bonds-10-year-treasury-yield-falls-to-nearly-3-year-low.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 1.74% on Monday, its lowest level since November 2016, after China countered new U.S. tariffs, escalating the protracted trade war between globe's two biggest economies.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, used as a benchmark for mortgage and auto loan rates, fell 12 basis points to 1.735%, its lowest level since Nov. 9, 2016. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 9 basis points to 2.293%, while the rate on the 2-year Treasury dropped 12 basis points to 1.581%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

The 10-year Treasury note yield, down more than 30 basis points in August, returned less than the 3-month Treasury bill at 2.017%.

The bid for Treasurys and pivot away from stocks came after actions by China fueled a new wave of trade anxiety across global markets.

China, which has in the past tinkered with its currency to boost its exports, allowed the yuan to fall to its lowest level in more than a decade, making Chinese exports cheaper. The onshore yuan broke above 7 per U.S. dollar, drawing the online ire of President Donald Trump, who voiced his complaint on Twitter.

""China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It's called 'currency manipulation.' Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!""

Trump's criticism on Monday came less than three months after his Treasury Department decided not to label China a currency manipulator. Despite promises to label Beijing as such during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, the administration has passed on five opportunities to do so thus far.

Bloomberg News also reported that Beijing has asked state-owned companies to refrain from buying U.S. agricultural goods.

These moves came four days after Trump announced that the U.S. on Sept. 1 would impose a 10% tariff the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had eluded duties. The news pushed the S&P 500 to its worst weekly performance of the year. The S&P 500 dropped 31% last week. The Dow had its second-biggest weekly drop of 2019 last week, sliding 2.6%."
Justice considering push for new law to make mass shootings a capital crime,https://www.cnn.com,"['Evan Perez', 'Katelyn Polantz']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/05/politics/justice-new-law-mass-shootings-capital-crime/index.html,"(CNN) A new federal law specifically making mass shootings a capital crime is among the proposals being studied as Justice Department officials seek to follow President Donald Trump's order to come up with legislative fixes to tackle the spate of active shooting incidents.

Attorney General William Barr spent the weekend discussing possible legislation with the President and vice president and with other Justice and FBI officials, a source briefed on the matter said. One of the top options for legislative proposals would make mass shooters eligible for the death penalty in the same way federal law treats people who use explosives, a law enforcement official said.

Any changes would have to be passed by Congress.

Existing federal law specifies the use of weapons of mass destruction as a crime that carries the possible death penalty. But if the same suspect uses a gun instead of explosives, there's no specific federal law to address that. Instead, federal prosecutors often turn to other laws, including one addressing hate crimes, to bring charges in mass shooting incidents. Federal prosecutors also can seek charges for gun offenses or crimes against federal officials.

One complication for any new law is how to define mass shootings, in a country where there are routinely dozens of people shot in drug-related and other crimes over the course of a weekend in certain cities.

TSN, +5.10% said in its 10-Q issued Monday that it has received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice Antitrust Division on April 26, 2019 related to complaints about price manipulation. The action stems from a class-action complaint Maplevale Farms Inc. filed on Sept. 2, 2016. Additional lawsuits with similar complaints have been filed since that time while others have opted to proceed on their own. The lawsuits allege that starting in January 2008, Tyson and certain poultry subsidiaries conspired to ""fix raise, maintain and stabilize the price of broiler chickens in violation of U.S. antitrust laws"" and to manipulate the Broiler price index, the Georgia Dock. A DOJ grand jury subpoena is seeking more information about the chicken industry. Puerto Rico has also filed a civil lawsuit alleging violation of Puerto Rican antitrust laws.

CLOSE ""Send her back"" chants erupted at a Trump rally as the president criticized Rep. Ilhan Omar for her ""contempt"" for the ""hard-working Americans."" Storyful

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump proclaimed that ""hate has no place in America"" after a pair of mass shootings killed 30 people last weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

But Trump himself has been accused of stoking racial tensions.

Trump has created controversy for years with incendiary rhetoric that is often directed at people of color – from his branding of the Central Park Five as “muggers and murderers” to his peddling of the false “birther” conspiracy against then-President Barack Obama to his denigrating of a former African-American aide as a “dog"" to his attacks against four Democratic congresswomen of color.

Here are more than a dozen times when Trump has fueled racial tensions:

‘The Squad’

Trump’s attacks against four liberal Democratic congresswomen – all women of color – started Sunday with a series of tweets in which he suggested they should “go back” to their country of origin. The remarks were met with a barrage of criticism, but Trump refused to back down, saying they “hate our country” and that “if they don’t like it, let them leave.”

Three of the congresswomen – Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. – were born in the United States. The fourth, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was born in Somalia, but her family fled that country’s civil war when she was 8 years old and eventually settled in Minneapolis. She became an American citizen at age 17.

Trump continued his attack on all four, sometimes dubbed “the Squad,” during a fiery rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, drawing jeers and chants of ""send her back"" as he mentioned their names. The rally cemented the notion that Trump is using the recent controversy as a theme of his reelection campaign to draw a distinction between himself and Democrats.

Omarosa Manigault Newman

Trump furiously attacked former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, who is black, calling her “a dog” and a “crazed crying lowlife.”

Trump’s rampage last summer against his former aide came after Manigault Newman wrote a book about her White House tenure that was highly critical of the president. Manigault Newman also released a tape in which she and three other officials in Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign discussed the possibility of another tape in which Trump supposedly uses a racial slur.

Rumors about a racist tape, supposedly from outtakes of Trump's television program ""The Apprentice,"" on which Manigault Newman was a contestant, surfaced during the last month of the campaign. Manigault Newman has claimed that she has heard the tape, but no audio has publicly surfaced with Trump using the ""n"" word.

But on the tape Manigault Newman released, campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson could be heard saying, “He said it. He is embarrassed by it.""

Trump, who denies making the remark, unleashed a tirade against Newman on Twitter.

“When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out,"" the president tweeted about Manigault Newman. ""Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!""

He was referring to John Kelly, who at the time was White House chief of staff and fired Manigault Newman nine months earlier.

LeBron James and Don Lemon

Basketball star LeBron James sat down with CNN's Don Lemon for an interview last August after he cut the ribbon on his foundation's new I Promise School in his native Akron, Ohio.

James spoke at length on the intersection of sports, culture and politics. He said during the interview that Trump was ""using sports to kinda divide us, and that's something that I can't relate to.""

Not long after, the president tweeted about the interview and James, belittling the intelligence of both the basketball player and Lemon.

""Lebron (sic) James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon,"" Trump tweeted. ""He made Lebron (sic) look smart, which isn’t easy to do. I like Mike!""

Lemon didn’t mince words when he talked about the controversy for nine minutes on CNN.

""The president has called a lot of people stupid,"" Lemon said. ""Some of those people are white. But I would just like to note that referring to an African American as dumb — remember this is America — is one of the oldest canards of America’s racist past and present: that black people are of inferior intelligence.""

He continued: ""This president traffics in racism and is fueled by bullying.""

Maxine Waters

One of Trump's favorite targets has been Congresswoman Maxine Waters.

He has criticized the California Democrat's intelligence many times, saying she has an ""extraordinarily low I.Q.""

He has repeated the phrase at countless rallies and over Twitter.

""Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party,"" Trump posted on Twitter in June. ""She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!""

Charlottesville

Trump's comments after a white nationalists’ rally in Charlottesville, Va., has been dubbed by critics as one of the lowest points in his presidency.

Trump said there were ""fine people on both sides"" of the rally — both the counterprotesters and those members of the alt-right who did Nazi salutes and chants.

Trump also said ""both sides"" were to blame for the violence. A woman who was protesting against the white nationalists was killed after a car rammed into a group marching down a street.

The president's comments after the rally fluctuated from condemning the white nationalists, Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan to then again blaming both sides for what happened.

MS-13 'animals'

Trump has used the word ""animal"" many times to describe those accused of crimes, whether it's gang members or terrorists in the U.S. or abroad.

In May 2018, Trump was criticized after using the word ""animals"" to describe people crossing the border. At first, many took his comments as immigrants were animals. The White House clarified that the president was dubbing MS-13 gang members animals.

During a discussion about MS-13, Trump said: ""We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — and we’re stopping a lot of them — but we’re taking people out of the country. You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals. And we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.""

Many of the president's critics said the comments were dehumanizing and shouldn't be used no matter who it's being used to describe.

NFL players

As NFL protests picked up steam and more and more players refused to stand for the National Anthem, Trump chimed in.

""Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son-of-a-bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!'"" Trump said at a rally in 2017.

The players who took a knee were protesting police brutality and racism after a number of high-profile cases where black men had been shot and killed by police officers.

Faced with criticism, Trump did what he frequently does. He took to Twitter again.

""The NFL players are at it again – taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the National Anthem. Numerous players, from different teams, wanted to show their 'outrage' at something that most of them are unable to define,"" Trump tweeted.

Judge in Trump University case

Trump once argued that a judge involved in his Trump University court case ruled against him because of the judge's heritage.

Trump claimed it was a conflict of interest to have U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel handling his case because he is of Mexican descent. Curiel was born in the United States.

Trump said that Curiel’s heritage meant the judge doesn't like him because he wants to build a wall between the United States and Mexico.

""I have had horrible rulings, I have been treated unfairly by this judge,"" said in June 2016 during his campaign for president. ""Now this judge is of Mexican heritage, I'm building a wall.""

'Shithole' countries

During immigration talks in the Oval Office in January 2018, Trump reportedly grew frustrated, using a crude description of Haiti, El Salvador and African countries, according to a report from The Washington Post.

""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Trump reportedly told lawmakers.

The president then suggested that the U.S. try to increase immigration from countries like Norway, whose prime minister he had recently met.

Obama ‘birther’ conspiracy

Well before he became president, Trump was one of the loudest voices of the ""birther"" conspiracy.

He claimed that then-president Obama was not born in the U.S. and even went as far as claiming that he'd sent investigators to Hawaii, where Obama was born.

Even after Obama released a long-form version of his birth certificate, hoping to quell the conspiracy, Trump kept floating the idea that Obama was an illegitimate president.

He largely avoided the subject during his 2016 presidential campaign but did eventually acknowledge Obama was born in the U.S. while also falsely claiming Hillary Clinton was to blame for creating the conspiracy.

Muslim Gold Star parents

Critics, including some fellow Republicans, blasted Trump's feud with the Muslim parents of a fallen soldier.

Khizr Khan, who lost a son in the Iraq war, spoke out against Trump multiple times, most notably during the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.

Khan assailed Trump for proposals that would bar Muslim entry into the United States and may not have allowed his son into the United States had they been in place. Khan urged Trump to read the U.S. Constitution and told him ""you have sacrificed nothing.""

Responding, Trump suggested that the Clinton campaign wrote Khan's convention speech and that Khan's wife did not speak at the convention because she was forbidden.

Trump continued to tweet about the Khans, saying the story shouldn't be about him but rather ""radical Islamic terrorism and the U.S.""

""Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same — Nice!"" Trump said in another tweet.

A number of Republicans took aim at Trump with the controversy that surrounded the feud.

Then-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Trump has ""disparaged a fallen soldier’s parents"" and in the past ""has suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the United States — to say nothing of entering its service. I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump’s statement.""

Central Park Five

Trump has repeatedly disparaged a group of black and Latino men wrongly accused of assaulting a white female jogger in Central Park in 1989.

Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Korey Wise were all boys when they were convicted of raping Trisha Meili. They were then found innocent of the crime after convicted murder Matias Reyes in 2002 confessed to raping Meili, which was confirmed by DNA evidence. The city awarded the men $41 million in 2014, a decade after some of the men initially sued the city for how it handled the case.

In 1989, Trump, then a popular business mogul, spent $85,000 worth of ads published in The New York Times, The Daily News, The New York Post and New York Newsday in which he lamented crime in the city and claimed there was no more “law and order.”

'They admitted their guilt': 30 years of Trump's comments about the Central Park Five

Trump claimed the city was being ""ruled by the law of the streets, as roving bands of wild criminals roam our neighborhoods, dispensing their own vicious brand of twisted hatred on whomever they encounter.""

Trump said he hated ""these muggers and murderers.""

He has refused to back down, again calling them “muggers” on Twitter in 2013 and labeling the $41 “a disgrace.”

Around a month before the 2016 election, Trump stood by his opinion that the five men were guilty even though they have since been exonerated of the crime.

'Disgusting ... rodent infested' Baltimore

In July, Trump went after Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings on Twitter and slammed the Democrat's hometown of Baltimore, calling the majority-black city a ""disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess."" Cummings chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which has been probing Trump's finances.

In one tweet, Trump insinuated that ""billions of dollars have been pumped in"" to Baltimore over the years ""but to no avail"" and that people should ask Cummings why the money was ""stolen or wasted.""

Cummings passionately defended his hometown, saying he didn't ""have time for people who want to trash our city.""

Energy Department wants to build nuclear test reactor,https://www.latimes.com,"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-05/energy-department-wants-to-build-nuclear-test-reactor,"A new nuclear test reactor is needed as part of an effort to revamp the nation’s fading nuclear power industry by developing safer fuel and power plants, the U.S. Department of Energy said Monday.

The federal agency said it would prepare an environmental impact statement as part of the process to build the test reactor in Idaho or Tennessee by the end of 2025. Public comments on the environmental review are being taken through Sept. 4.

The Versatile Test Reactor would be the first new test reactor built in the United States in decades and give the nation a dedicated “fast-neutron-spectrum” testing capability. Such reactors are called fast reactors.

“This testing capability is essential for the United States to modernize its nuclear energy infrastructure and for developing transformational nuclear energy technologies that reduce waste generation and enhance nuclear security,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in a statement.

Americans have been wary of nuclear power since the core from Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island underwent a partial meltdown in 1979 — one of the nation’s worst nuclear accidents. That was followed by a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine exploding and burning in 1986. In 2011, an earthquake and tsunami led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan where the cores of three reactors suffered meltdowns after cooling systems failed.

Federal officials say the proposed test reactor would help create new and safer fuels, materials and reactors being developed by civilian companies in the United States.

“If this capability is not available to U.S. innovators as soon as possible, the ongoing shift of nuclear technology dominance to other international states such as China and the Russian Federation will accelerate, to the detriment of the U.S. nuclear industrial sector,” said Rita Baranwal, the Energy Department’s assistant secretary for nuclear energy.

The Energy Department had a fast reactor, the Experimental Breeder Reactor II, operating in eastern Idaho until it was shut down in 1994 as the nation turned away from nuclear power.

Edwin Lyman, senior scientist and acting director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, said fast reactors such as the proposed Versatile Test Reactor are less safe than current reactors.

Most nuclear reactors in use now are “light-water” reactors fueled by uranium and cooled with water. Lyman said the test reactor would be cooled with harder-to-control liquid sodium and likely fueled by plutonium, increasing potential nuclear terrorism risks because plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons.

“There is nothing good about these reactors,” he said. “I think there is a love of plutonium in the [Energy] Department that is irrational.”

Revamping the nation’s nuclear power is part of a strategy to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by generating carbon-free electricity with nuclear power. The strategy was initiated under the Obama administration and continuing under the Trump administration, despite Trump’s downplaying of global warming.

Reducing spent nuclear fuel, federal officials say, is also an objective of the new test reactor. The United States has no permanent repository for about 77,000 tons of radioactive spent fuel, stored mainly at the commercial nuclear power plants where they were used to produce electricity.

But Lyman said fast reactors would produce waste even more hazardous and difficult to dispose.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, at the end of December there were 98 nuclear reactors at 59 power plants producing about 20% of the nation’s energy. Most of the reactors are decades old, and many are having a tough time competing economically with other forms of energy production.

The Energy Department is considering building the test reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho or the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee.

On a related front, late last year the Energy Department restarted the Transient Test Reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory to test new nuclear fuels. That facility had been on standby since 1994."

Turning the page away from the politicization of investigations

A free society cannot stay free for long if the criminal-justice system becomes a political weapon, if that becomes our norm.

The most alarming aspect of the Trump–Russia investigation, and of the stark difference between the aggression with which it was pursued and the see-no-evil passivity of the Clinton emails caper, is the way the investigative process was used to influence political outcomes.

Advertisement

The way to right that wrong is to prevent it from becoming the new normal, not to turn the tables of abuse when power shifts from one side to the other. We can only make things worse by losing the distinction between rebuking errors in judgment and criminalizing them.

Ardent Trump supporters are growling over news that the FBI’s former director, James Comey, will not be prosecuted by the Justice Department for the mishandling of memoranda he wrote about his contacts with the president. The news has been reported by The Hill’s John Solomon and the Washington Post’s Devlin Barrett, among others.

Comey’s handling of his memos is one aspect of probes related to investigations attendant to the 2016 election, which are being conducted by Justice Department independent counsel Michael Horowitz. Indications are that Horowitz referred the memos issue to the Justice Department for possible prosecution and that, after reviewing the IG’s findings, Justice declined to pursue the matter as a criminal case.

Advertisement

That is the way things are supposed to work. The inspector general’s job is to ensure that colorable allegations of misconduct against Justice Department officials (including FBI officials) are thoroughly examined, so that all of the relevant facts are uncovered. The Justice Department then reviews the IG’s report, mindful of two imperatives that are in tension. On one hand, clear criminal misconduct must be prosecuted; otherwise we have a two-tiered justice system in which those we trust to enforce the law can violate it with impunity. On the other hand, poor judgment, while it should be censured and may be the basis for disciplinary action, must not be criminalized; otherwise, we discourage talented, honorable people from taking jobs that are all about excruciating judgment calls.

Advertisement

What happened in this instance? We don’t know yet — and that alone calls for restraint. It is no knock on Messrs. Solomon and Barrett, who are excellent reporters with good sources, to caution that we have not yet seen the IG report.

To be sure, many relevant facts are known. The Comey memos have been public for some time, the former director has testified about them in congressional hearings, and they were part of the mountain of information from which Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s staff derived their final report. Still, there is much we do not know. Past experience informs us that IG Horowitz is thorough and careful. His office has interviewed lots of witnesses and scrutinized government reports to which we do not have access. His report is not expected to be released until September. Until then, we won’t know what happened, and why. In the meantime, since I have known both Attorney General Bill Barr and former director Jim Comey for many years, I am confident about two things.

Advertisement

Advertisement

First, no one is better suited than Barr to weigh the pros and cons of prosecuting alleged government misconduct. He has prioritized the importance of resisting the politicization of law enforcement and he grasps the stakes involved. He is also a big enough boy to tune out the noise from the Trump–Comey feud: the president’s nonstop depiction of Comey as the reincarnation of Lavrentiy Beria, and the former director’s worn-thin moralizing about how “Trump eats your soul in small bites” — including Barr’s own. The attorney general is not going to authorize a prosecution in the absence of clear evidence of a serious crime.

Second, I do not believe that Jim Comey would willfully leak classified information. Unless and until someone can show me he did it, I am going to continue assuming he did not.

Advertisement

That does not mean his handling of the memos was model behavior, though. It seems to me that he played with fire.

The existence of the memos became known shortly after Comey was fired on May 9, 2017. It is only natural that they raised alarm. One would expect that if a president and an FBI director met several times, memos documenting those conversations would contain at least some classified information. Comey, moreover, brazenly acknowledged that he had orchestrated the leak of at least a portion of one memo to the New York Times. That is not normal.

Nevertheless, Comey is very smart. And you don’t have to agree with his politics or like his style to realize that he has spent much of his career protecting national security. By definition, when information is classified, that means its unauthorized disclosure could damage American national security. Might Comey mishandle classified information? Sure, it’s possible — plenty of smart, patriotic public officials have done that. But to me, it is implausible that Comey would knowingly do that, much less intentionally transmit classified intelligence to the media.

That said, the classified-information facet of this episode has been exaggerated. There were seven memos in all, totaling 15 pages. Our understanding is that Comey tried to avoid putting classified information in them, and believed he had succeeded. Yet after obtaining and accounting for all of them, the FBI designated two of them as “confidential,” the lowest level of classification. We do not know at this point (or, at least, I don’t know) whether the memo leaked to the Times — regarding the February 2017 Trump–Comey discussion of the investigation of former national-security adviser Michael Flynn — was one of the classified ones. But we can easily deduce that Comey neither intended it to be classified nor thought it was. At one point in the memo, Comey wrote, “NOTE: Because this is an unclassified document, I will be limited in how I describe what I said next.”

We know that Comey shared this memo with a friend (who is also a friend of mine, and who was his intermediary with the Times), and that he shared at least some of the memos with his lawyers (who are also friends of mine). From a classified-information standpoint, however, we are talking about a small number of documents, and it is unclear that Comey knew anything in them was classified. Even if he turned out to be wrong about that, it is highly unlikely that prosecutors could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was grossly negligent in mishandling them, much less that he willfully mishandled them.

To my mind, the issue here has never been criminal misconduct in connection with classified information. The relevant matters are the non-criminal but serious impropriety in the handling of non-public government information, and the failure to protect the confidentiality of communications as to which the president has a presumptive privilege — a privilege that subordinate executive officials are obliged to respect, regardless of whether they respect the president himself.

There is no problem with Comey’s having chosen to write the memos. Much is made of the fact that he did not trust President Trump and that he felt compelled to document their communications, even though he did not do that when he spoke with President Obama. So what? He is entitled to feel that way. He was under no duty either to write or to refrain from writing memos. As long as he recorded events fairly and honestly when he chose to report them, nothing more was required.

The problem, however, is that the former director seems to have regarded the memos as his own property, rather than the government’s. To the contrary, these were clearly accounts of government business compiled by a government official using government property on government time. The memos were not Comey’s to keep; and they were certainly not his to disseminate to the media.

Reports of non-public government business are sensitive, regardless of whether they contain classified information. Conversations between the president and top national-security officials are among the most sensitive. Top executive officers, such as the FBI director, are well aware that those communications are presumptively privileged, and that the privilege belongs to the president. The director can be cut some slack for keeping memos he wrote in his home rather than in his office — an FBI director is never off duty. But he’s got no business leaking government files of any kind to the media, and that goes double for memoranda about communications with the president — any president, end of story.

It makes no difference that, at the time of the leak, Comey was no longer the FBI director. A public official, particularly of such high rank, has continuing fiduciary duties upon leaving government service — even when the departure is against his will. Of course it was wrong for the administration to give conflicting rationales for Comey’s firing. It was also wrong for the president to goad the former director with a farcical, shades-of-Watergate tweet, suggesting there might be White House recordings of their conversations. There are many ways the former director could appropriately have responded to these provocations; leaking a government memo was not one of them.

Comey has said he was hoping to trigger the appointment of a special counsel. But he could have done that, in his new capacity as a private citizen, by arranging a press conference at which he called for the appointment of a special counsel. It would have gotten plenty of attention. Comey, a gifted public speaker, would have made a forceful presentation that would have gotten significant traction on Capitol Hill, where Democrats were already clamoring for a special counsel.

The former director’s decision to proceed by leaking to the media a government memo, documenting a sensitive but probably not classified meeting with the president, was wrong. It was the kind of behavior it is impossible to imagine that Comey, as FBI director, would abide if one of his subordinates had done it. Indeed, in Comey’s memo about the Flynn conversation, he describes speaking at length with Trump about the menace of leaks, about how they undermine the president’s capacity to do his job. He even recounts telling the president that he was “eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message.”

To leak the memo was unbecoming conduct. It is worthy of censure. That does not make it a felony.

The ongoing Justice Department and congressional inquiries into the investigations attendant to the 2016 election are wide-ranging. In assessing investigative overreach, it is vital to remember that the remedy for politicized law enforcement is not more politicized law enforcement. If officials with a commendable record of service to the country took steps they should not have taken out of lapses in judgment — including lapses driven by overwrought suspicions of impending danger to the nation — then there needs to be an accounting. We will also need to implement better oversight procedures to insure against a repetition.

That, however, does not mean crimes were committed. The president’s fans should remember that their main complaint has been that Donald Trump and his campaign were treated as suspects in heinous, traitorous crimes despite the absence of credible incriminating evidence. The investigators, too, are entitled not to be presumed guilty of crimes, even by those of us who are convinced that there were investigative irregularities.

Let’s get the facts first, and then we can decide whether laws were broken, and whether there has been misconduct worthy of prosecution. And when we decide, let’s bear in mind that a norm against criminalizing political disputes cannot be reestablished unless we commit to reestablishing it. That means keeping the political vendettas out of the investigations."

Trump judges face scrutiny over president's cases,https://thehill.com,[],08-04-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/456013-trump-judges-face-scrutiny-over-presidents-cases,"Federal judges nominated by President Trump Donald John TrumpBooker calls Trump's address on mass shootings 'bull---t soup' A plea to progressive political pundits: Stop wringing your hands GOP state lawmaker: 'Republican Party is enabling white supremacy in our country' MORE are facing a major public test as they handle cases that involve Trump personally or some of his most controversial policies.

New judges are already under pressure to carefully issue rulings as they learn the ropes of the federal judiciary. But three recently appointed district judges in D.C. — Trevor McFadden, Timothy Kelly and Carl Nichols — have found themselves and their rulings under a magnifying glass as they deal with cases involving Trump.

All three of the Trump-tapped judges have acted as their colleagues on the bench typically do, proceeding cautiously in the recent cases. And while legal experts disagreed over whether the judges are facing additional pressure over their rulings, they agreed that there is more attention on the cases, at least in the media.

“These judges realize that everybody's looking at them, and they're kind of behind the eight ball either way you look at it,” Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow in the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies Program, told The Hill.

“A decision for the administration could look like favoritism, or a decision against the administration can be taken as perhaps bending over backwards not to appear supportive of them,” he added.

In the last two weeks, McFadden and Nichols have both taken careful approaches to a lawsuit over a New York law that allows Congress to obtain the president’s state tax returns.

McFadden, who was confirmed by the Senate in October 2017, was initially assigned to the lawsuit over Trump’s New York tax returns because he was also assigned to a lawsuit over the president’s federal tax returns.

But McFadden disagreed with Trump’s personal lawyers who sought to have him also oversee the new case, ordering last week that the state tax return case be randomly reassigned to a new judge.

In his order, he highlighted the importance of adhering to rules about when cases can be considered related to avoid the appearance of judge shopping and to ensure to the public that judges are assigned to cases in an impartial manner.

Nichols, who was just confirmed by the Senate in May and is so new that his name hasn’t been added to the list of D.C. district judges on the court’s website, is now taking on the New York tax returns case in what appears to be his first-ever assignment.

He has been deliberate in his handling of an emergency motion from Trump to block Democratic lawmakers from requesting the president’s New York tax returns. After initially hearing arguments in the case, he asked the parties to try to reach an agreement themselves.

When they failed to do so, Nichols held a teleconference to get more information from those involved. And one day later, he issued an order that temporarily stops New York from handing over the returns to the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, after indicating to the parties that is how he would rule. The panel has not yet requested the returns.

Andy Grewal, a law professor at the University of Iowa, said that in the legal fights over Trump's tax returns, “it seems like both judges have been pretty cautious.”

But he said the judges’ cautious approach may have more to do with the nature of the issues before them, such as court shopping, than the fact that they are new to the bench.

Mike Stern, who served in the House Office of General Counsel from 1996 to 2004, said that the judges appear to be trying to handle lawsuits in as apolitical a manner as possible.

He said that McFadden’s actions in the tax returns case as well as one over border wall funding have been reasonable and that Nichols’s actions in the state tax return case are consistent with courts’ desire to try to not make a decision when there are disputes between different branches of government.

“If they can avoid having to make a decision, they will do that,” Stern said.

McFadden’s ruling on the tax returns case wasn’t his first high-profile case involving the president. Earlier this year, he presided over House Democrats’ lawsuit challenging the administration’s use of military funds for a border wall.

Before getting to the claims made in the lawsuit, the judge dedicated the first half of a three-hour hearing on the matter to whether he should even be allowed to oversee the proceeding. McFadden ultimately ruled that Democrats did not have standing to bring the case forward.

Kelly was first thrown into the spotlight when the White House revoked CNN correspondent Jim Acosta James (Jim) AcostaTrump judges face scrutiny over president's cases Playboy plans to appeal after reporter says his White House credentials were suspended Trump calls out Cincinnati's 'Democrat mayor' as protesters escorted out MORE's press credentials. The judge ruled against the administration in that case, ordering that the credentials be reinstated.

He also recently oversaw a lengthy hearing on a Trump policy. Kelly heard arguments for more than three hours last month on whether he should issue a temporary restraining order on a policy that would block migrants who pass through a third country from claiming asylum in the United States, with few exceptions.

Kelly, who was confirmed by the Senate in September 2017, was methodical in his line of questioning, pressing attorneys for both sides on the details of their arguments and frequently referring to documents laid out before him during the hearing.

As he wrapped up the proceeding, he noted the importance of both getting the case right and issuing a ruling quickly.

Kelly ultimately decided to not grant the temporary restraining order, in a win for the Trump administration. But that ruling was overshadowed just hours later, after San Francisco-based Judge Jon Tigar, an Obama appointee, issued a preliminary injunction against the asylum rule.

Some legal experts say that the Trump-appointed judges have been trying to be careful and are acting in ways that are consistent with common court practices.

But others who are following the legal cases closely are worried that Trump-appointed judges will go out of their way to act in ways that benefit the president.

Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who backs efforts to obtain Trump’s tax returns, said many Trump-appointed judges were nominated because of their conservative ideology. And he suggested they could feel pressure to show their loyalty to Republicans if they want to eventually be appointed to an appellate court or the Supreme Court.

“Their careers are tied in large measure to them continuing to be loyal,” he said.

But legal experts generally maintained that the judges are acting impartially and with the goal of reaching the best outcome possible.

“Speaking generally, we know that the party of the appointing president is a predictor of how judges will rule in cases, but it's not a very good predictor,” Wheeler said. “But most of the cases, it can be judged fairly cut and dry. The law is clear. The precedents are clear. There's really not much discretion to exercise.

“It's when you get to the cases in which the law is unclear, with new cases that lack a lot of precedents — that's when notions of public policy come into play,” he added.

Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law, pushed back on how much pressure the judges are under.

He argued that judges in certain circuits, such as D.C., may be more likely than those in other parts of the country to face high-profile cases during their first years. And he said that judges will rule impartially, regardless of which president appointed them to the bench.

“They’re considered judge material because they’re neutral and detached,” Blackman told The Hill."

He Has Covered Rail', 'Trucking', 'Maritime Issues Since For A Variety Of Publications Based In The U.S.', 'The U.K. John Began Business Reporting In At Broadcasting', 'Cable Magazine.

A July 31 audit conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Inspector General (EPA OIG) also confirmed that EPA staff have not been directed to work on a 2017 proposed rule that would have exempted glider trucks from stricter Phase 2 emissions requirements. That means that a 300-truck per manufacturer cap on glider kits remains in place.

Glider kits are a way for truck owners to buy a new truck with a remanufactured engine, often at a significant discount from a new truck and engine combination.

The OIG audit was conducted at the request of Republican lawmakers. Last year they questioned EPA’s testing processes at its National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which were used in a 2017 EPA study on glider truck emissions. Opponents of the study, which found air emissions from gliders to be 43 to 55 times those of trucks with modern emission controls, also argued that Volvo [CXE: VOLVB.S.IX] had influenced the findings. Volvo and other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have supported tighter emissions controls after years of investing in clean-engine technology.

Both EPA and Volvo were cleared in the OIG’s audit. “The EPA complied with standard practices and relevant policies and procedures covering objectivity and integrity in planning and conducting its testing of glider vehicles in 2017,” according to the audit.

The OIG concluded that employees within EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) had received the required testing approvals and followed normal procedures in submitting the glider testing report. “The OIG also did not identify ethics violations within the scope of our audit by a former OTAQ Center Director.”

The audit did find minor issues with how EPA exercised its “donation acceptance authority” when officials there acquired the trucks used for its study. The OIG recommended that EPA officials evaluate whether it needs to develop further guidance or policies on accepting donated property.

The audit marks the latest development in a long-running controversy over how much glider kits pollute. Because the kits can be roughly 25 percent less costly than new truck cabs, they are in high demand by independent fleet operators from manufacturers such as Crossville, Tennessee-based Fitzgerald Glider Kits.

Fitzgerald commissioned a study conducted by Tennessee Technological University (Tennessee Tech) in 2017 that found glider engines do not pollute any more than modern OEM systems. The Tennessee Tech study was then used to lobby on behalf of a measure that allows rebuilt diesel engines to be exempt from the Obama-era emissions rules.

But university faculty questioned the pro-glider kit study, in particular the relationship between Fitzgerald and the university, calling it a conflict of interest. In late 2018, Tennessee Tech acknowledged that the results of its glider kit study were inaccurate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Saturday said it welcomed news of a ceasefire in Northwest Syria - the last rebel bastion in the country - and urged for an end to attacks on civilians.

Last week Syrian media reported that the ceasefire would take place as long as rebel fighters implement the terms of a de-escalation agreement brokered last year by Russia and Turkey.

The wave of violence in northwest Syria since late April has killed more than 400 civilians and forced more than 440,000 to flee toward the Turkish border, according to the United Nations.

“The United States believes there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict, and only a political solution can ensure a stable and secure future for all Syrians,” the State Department said in a statement.

“We further believe the only viable path to a political solution is the U.N.-led political process in Geneva, including constitutional reform and U.N.-supervised elections,” the statement said.

The United States will support the work of U.N. Special Envoy Geir Pedersen and the United Nations to advance a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process that would create a permanent, peaceful, and political end to the conflict, the State Department added.

The region - including Idlib province and parts of nearby Hama - was part of the last major stronghold of armed opposition to President Bashar al-Assad, who has vowed to reclaim all of Syria.

The Department also commended efforts by Turkey and Russia to restore the cease fire they agreed in September 2018."
Should state oversee handling of coal ash? Public gets its say now,https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/local/should-state-oversee-handling-coal-ash-public-gets-its-say-now/OEF77iP1lt6ggAK0uh0KYL/,"Georgia is positioned to become the second state in the nation to assume oversight of how it disposes of its coal ash through a statewide permit program.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says a state management program, first approved in Oklahoma, puts decision-making in the hands of those who best understand local issues surrounding coal ash. But local environmentalists are concerned that state oversight could make it harder for citizens to hold utilities accountable and challenge plans that could have long-term consequences on human health and the environment.

The federal agency is holding public hearings Tuesday in Atlanta about the proposed state permit program.

Georgia is one of the top coal ash-generating states, producing more than 6 million tons of coal ash each year. Most of Georgia’s coal ash has been generated by Georgia Power at 11 coal-fired power plants stretching from Rome on the north to Brunswick on the coast.

Though the EPA treats coal ash as nonhazardous waste, it may contain arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and other heavy metals that can be toxic to humans. It can leach into the environment if the ash ponds or landfills where ash is stored come in contact with groundwater, surface water or precipitation.

>> RELATED: Georgia Power coal ash ponds leaking toxins into groundwater

The federal government began regulating the disposal of coal ash after a 2014 spill dumped 39,000 tons of toxic coal ash into a North Carolina river. A year later, federal rules required unlined ash ponds and landfills to be closed in place or excavated.

The case for state permitting

In April 2018, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division applied for a state permit program. “A permit program is used because it provides for the direct oversight, review and approval of the utilities’ monitoring, closure and cleanup activities,” said Kevin Chambers, spokesman for EPD.

After EPD determines that an application meets requirements for siting, design, and operation standards, it will post a draft online with a 30-day public comment period. EPD reviews comments and makes any necessary changes before issuing a final permit, which then goes through the same process and may be subject to judicial review. Over time, if violations of the permit are identified, EPD would follow its standard enforcement policies, Chambers said.

With federal oversight, citizens can file a lawsuit to challenge how a utility is managing coal ash. With state permits, the process is not as straightforward.

“State control tends to tip the balance of power away from citizens who want to do some of their own oversight,” said Abel Russ, senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit organization that advocates for better enforcement of environmental laws. “The opportunity for ongoing enforcement of things like failure to post data required by the permit would be harder. The legal foundation for challenging those things is harder.”

Georgia Power is in the process of closing its 29 ash ponds, with plans to excavate 19 and close 10 in place, said Aaron Mitchell, general manager of environmental affairs for Georgia Power. Some plans for closing the ponds in place would leave the coal ash in unlined ash ponds.

Environmental advocates are most concerned about in-place closures that may impact groundwater. “Georgia groundwater and surface water do not belong to Georgia Power; they belong to Georgia citizens. New evidence confirms they are grossly polluting Georgia’s environment,” said Chris Bowers, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has used legal challenges to support the environment in the region.

Under state oversight, the problems could go unchecked, they say.

Challenges to coal ash disposal plans

In a letter released Monday, the Southern Environmental Law Center asked EPD to deny Georgia Power’s permit applications for in-place closures of coal ash ponds and landfills at five plants.

The Southern Environmental Law Center created a map showing the coal ash pond closure plans at 11 Georgia Power plants across the state. On Aug. 5, the organization asked the Georgia Environmental Protection Division to deny Georgia Power’s permit applications for in-place closures at five plants. CONTRIBUTED BY SOUTHERN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW CENTER Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution

At Plant Scherer in Juliette and Plant Yates near Newnan, unlined coal ash ponds would lie within a 2-mile restricted area where unlined municipal solid waste landfills are prohibited by law, Bowers said.

At Plant Wansley near Carrollton, closure in place plans for one 343-acre pond would leave ash 80 feet deep in groundwater located on the floodplain of a former creek. Plant Hammond near Rome features a 25-acre landfill to be closed in place where decades earlier sinkholes were reported in the ground below.

And at Plant McDonough in Cobb County, a stream routed though a corrugated metal pipe would sit just 50 feet from an unlined coal ash storage area, potentially carrying coal ash pollution into the stream, the environmental group claims.

Georgia Power has said the closure plans meet the requirements of both state and federal laws. “We are being very aggressive in closing these ponds in safe ways,” said Mitchell of Georgia Power. “All of those details have been put into a package in an application for Georgia EPD to review. They are doing that now and will ask us to make changes.”

Mitchell said Georgia Power utilizes 500 groundwater monitoring wells across all of its power plants. “In limited cases, we have had detection of substances that we have been required to monitor, and we have elected on our own to go beyond the monitoring point to be sure we haven’t impacted anyone,” Mitchell said. “Based on the extensive data collected, the company has identified no risk to public health or drinking water.”

But citizens want to be sure their concerns are heard. “There should be a public process for permitting of these unlined coal ash pits,” said Rep. Mary Frances Williams, D-Marietta, who earlier this year introduced a resolution that called for liners in the ash ponds at Plant McDonough. “I think the only chance of doing anything about it is in the court of public opinion.”

Why US investors will be feasting on Treasury debt,https://finance.yahoo.com,"['Javier E. David', 'Editor Focused On Markets', 'The Economy']",08-03-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/debt-ceiling-accord-means-us-investors-will-feast-on-treasury-debt-181759249.html,"On Friday, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping budget bill that suspends the debt ceiling for two years.

The president’s signature all but guarantees the Treasury will issue a record number of bonds to cover a burgeoning budget deficit that’s projected to hit $1 trillion this year. In short, Uncle Sam will keep spending more than he takes in for the foreseeable future.

All of which begs the question of who’ll absorb the massive amounts of debt at a pace necessary to contain the government’s borrowing costs.

The short answer: Americans.

While it’s common knowledge that foreigners have been big Treasury buyers for years, that effect is declining. The slack is being picked up by their U.S. retirement and insurance funds, which are deeply invested in the bond market. These institutions are big and growing buyers of Treasuries, which see government paper as a low-risk asset.

As stock markets were walloped last year, corporate pension portfolios’ stock allocations fell last to an average of 31%, according to an annual survey by actuarial services firm Millman.

In recent years, global central bank buying of U.S. debt has waned, but a surge in domestic interest has offset that decline. According to Societe Generale, global currency reserves peaked back in 2014 at $12 trillion, and have since fallen.

Enter insurers and pensions. Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Torsten Slok recently estimated that the biggest holder of U.S. Treasuries are American pension funds, insurance companies, and a Federal Reserve that’s done trillions in bond-buying via quantitative easing.

Those investors “have generally shifted toward higher allocations of fixed income investments. This trend has surfaced as plan sponsors shifted allocations to de-risk their pension plans over the past decade,” Millman said.

Still the only game in town

The domestic debt binge recalls Japan’s “lost decade,” in which the aftermath of a burst asset bubble scared off foreign investors. In their place arose domestic institutions that consumed Japanese government bonds en masse.

At a staggering 236%, Japan’s debt to gross domestic product ratio is more than double the U.S., and Tokyo is hard-pressed to engineer sustainable growth. Still the economy has remained stable, and the yen is a popular reserve currency that’s considered one of the world’s strongest safe-havens.

So are the U.S. dollar and Treasuries, which have for decades dodged the twin bullets of a massive U.S. trade and budget imbalance.

“Treasuries are still considered a safe-haven asset,” said Eric Stein, co-director of Global Income for Eaton Vance Management, which has around $440 billion in assets under management. “No market is as deep as the Treasury market.”

In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, when the Fed went on a massive bond-buying spree, some market watchers predicted holding Treasuries would be a lot less attractive and yields would soar.

Yet the doomsday scenario of surging rates never materialized, even as major economies like China and Japan bought fewer U.S. government bonds.

The vast sea of red ink hasn’t scared U.S. bond investors, underscoring how the bond vigilantes of the past have lost their influence as enforcers of fiscal discipline.

Voracious domestic demand has largely tamed U.S. yields. On Friday, the rate on the 10-year Treasury note tumbled below 2%, near historic lows amid fears of an intensifying U.S.-China trade war. It means pension funds would be vulnerable to a sudden surge in yields.

“Will it last forever? No, but will it end anytime soon? Probably not,” Stein added.

‘We’re not Japan’

For decades, official foreign demand for American assets has funded the current account deficit that’s at the core of the U.S.’s trade war with China.

Economists have long warned the dynamic was unsustainable with an exploding federal deficit, but countries like Japan and China built massive reserves, of over $1 trillion apiece, with dollar-denominated debt.

Department of Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield announced today that Brenda Tuck has been hired as the department’s first rural development manager.

Tuck will assist rural counties and communities in competing for job-creating projects, providing technical assistance and training.

It’s an area she knows well. She previously served in economic development positions in Marengo, Dallas and Wilcox counties and has been regional workforce council liaison to the Commerce Department’s Workforce Development Division. She also spent seven years as a partner with Selma consulting firm Alford & Associates and five years in economic development at Pioneer Electric Cooperative.

Tuck said she looks forward to working with rural counties and their leaders.

“Rural communities in Alabama can benefit from having a go-to person who can connect them with the resources they need to improve their economic development prospects,” Tuck said.

Alabama in recent years has made a priority of rural economic development through several initiatives. In 2015 the state began offering incentives to qualified projects in targeted counties as a bid to spur rural job creation. The Commerce Department says about 16 projects have qualified, with about $1 billion in investments and 1,400 jobs. This year the Alabama Legislature approved increasing the number of counties eligible for enhanced incentives.

Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said Tuck’s background makes her “the ideal choice to help rural communities navigate the economic development process.”

“Brenda has extensive experience working on the front lines of economic development in rural Alabama counties, so she knows the specific challenges these areas face when it comes to competing for projects,” Canfield said."
DOJ will not prosecute Comey for leaking memos after IG referral: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-will-not-prosecute-comey-for-leaking-memos-after-ig-referral-source,"The Justice Department has decided against prosecuting former FBI Director James Comey for leaking classified information following a referral from the department’s inspector general, sources familiar with the deliberations told Fox News.

“Everyone at the DOJ involved in the decision said it wasn’t a close call,” one official said. “They all thought this could not be prosecuted.”

COMEY HEARING: EX-FBI DIRECTOR SAYS HE LEAKED MEMO TO SPUR SPECIAL COUNSEL APPOINTMENT

Comey penned memos memorializing his interactions with President Trump in the days leading up to his firing. He then passed those documents to a friend, Columbia University Law Professor Daniel Richman, who gave them to The New York Times. Comey admitted to that arrangement during congressional testimony.

After the fact, the FBI classified two of those memos as “confidential.”

DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz had referred Comey for potential prosecution as part of an internal review.

But one of the key factors leading to the DOJ declining to prosecute apparently was the fact that the two memos were labeled “confidential” after he set in motion the chain of events that led to them ending up with the press.

Richman, now serving as an attorney to Comey, told Fox News he had ""no comment"" on the prosecutorial decision on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Fox News has learned that the release of Horowitz’s report is “imminent,” according to another source familiar with the investigation.

The report related to Comey’s leaks is separate from Horowitz’s review of alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses. That report’s release is delayed, according to sources, due to the potential components of Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham’s investigation into alleged improper government surveillance.

Horowitz publicly confirmed last year that his office was investigating Comey for his handling of classified information as part of memos he shared documenting his discussions with the president.

In June 2018, during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Horowitz said he “received a referral on that from the FBI,” and was “handling that referral.”

IG CONFIRMS COMEY UNDER INVESTIGATION OVER MEMO HANDLING

“We will issue a report when the matter is complete and consistent with the law and rules,” Horowitz said at the time.

Comey last year also confirmed to Fox News that the inspector general’s office had interviewed him with regard to memos, but downplayed the questions over classified information as “frivolous”—saying the real issue was whether he complied with internal policies.

Fox News learned last year that Horowitz was looking at whether classified information was given to unauthorized sources as part of a broader review of Comey’s communications outside the bureau—including media contact.

Comey, whom Trump fired in May 2017, denied that sharing the memos with his legal team constituted a leak of classified information. Instead, he compared the process to keeping “a diary.”

“I didn’t consider it part of an FBI file,” Comey told Fox News' Bret Baier last year. “It was my personal aide-memoire…I always thought of it as mine.”

In his testimony in June 2017 before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said he made the decision to document the interactions with the president in a way that would not trigger security classification.

COMEY SAYS DOJ WATCHDOG INTERVIEWED HIM OVER HANDLING OF MEMOS

But in seven Comey memos handed over to Congress in April 2018, eight of the 15 pages had redactions under classified exceptions.

Comey, during his June 2017 testimony, said he deliberately leaked a memo from a key meeting with Trump to a friend after he was fired in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel.

“I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter—I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel,” Comey testified.

“I was worried that the media was camping at the end of my driveway, my wife and I were going away,” Comey said. “I was worried it would be like feeding seagulls at the beach if it was I who gave it to the media, so I asked my friend to.”

The New York Times published the report with Comey’s memos on May 16, 2017, revealing the contents of the memo which said the president asked him to shut down the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn in an Oval Office meeting.

EPA helps with mercury cleanup in U.P. after kids find bottle in old garage,https://www.mlive.com,"['Benjamin Raven', 'Braven Mlive.Com']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/08/epa-helps-with-mercury-cleanup-in-up-after-kids-find-bottle-in-old-garage.html,"A mercury spill in the Upper Peninsula has been reportedly contained to the site thanks to the work of federal, local and state officials.

The spill was reported back on July 28 at an abandoned garage and vacant lot in Miss City, according to local reports. Officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ontonagon County Emergency Management and Western Upper Peninsula Health Department responded to the spill.

A regional spokesperson with the EPA did not immediately return MLive’s request for an update Monday morning, Aug. 5.

WLUV-TV reports the incident was reported to local law enforcement after children found a bottle containing mercury in the abandoned garage. The outlet says the children’s home is also being monitored for mercury levels.

The Daily Mining Gazette reports the children took the mercury out and played with it for what was described as “a while.” Mike Kocher, emergency services director in Ontonagon County, told the newspaper that “they just played with it” and didn’t ingest any.

The scene itself in Mass City was reportedly cleared before the weekend, but mercury levels in the air continue to be monitored.

“This is a perfect example of how different agencies support each other during an incident,” Kocher told ABC 10 News in the U.P.

“Everything starts and ends locally but when the call goes out, we coordinate, communicate and cooperate with a variety of response organizations to bring things to a successful conclusion, with the ultimate goal always being the safety of our residents.”

In the event of a mercury spill larger than that of a thermometer break, the EPA advises everyone to leave the area, open all windows/doors to the outside, turn the temperature down, and to shut all doors to other parts of the house/structure.

The federal agency then advises -- in bold red text -- to not vacuum the spill and to call the local health department or fire department for the next steps.

“Any time one pound or more of mercury is released to the environment, it is mandatory to call the National Response Center,” the EPA writes on its website.

“The NRC hotline operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Call 800-424-8802. Note that because mercury is heavy, only two tablespoons of mercury weigh about one pound.”"
Housing Authority's Gene Bell retires: 'I’ve been the luckiest guy in the world’,https://www.citizen-times.com,"['John Boyle', 'Published A.M.

Growing up on a farm in rural Kentucky, Gene Bell learned the value — and the price — of hard physical labor.

""A lot of hogs, a lot of burley (tobacco),” Bell said, adding that tobacco in particular was labor intensive. “When I started it, you had to top it and sucker it, and then you had to cut it and put it in the barn. Then strip it, press it and take it the warehouse. There’s a whole art to it.”

To prevent nicotine poisoning, he had to wear a hat, a long-sleeved shirt and safety glasses, all in Kentucky's oppressive summer heat.

But an incident beyond tobacco harvesting really convinced Bell he needed to find a way out of the fields, most likely through higher education.

Like a lot of older men in those days, Bell's grandfather often wore a truss, a type of padded belt, to hold in hernias. One day when he was out digging post holes, the truss failed and his grandfather’s intestines poured through the hernias. Other men had to work furiously to tuck them back into his abdomen.

Bell threw up.

“I thought, ‘You don’t have to worry about me not going to college, bro,"" he said with a laugh.

Now, six decades later, Bell has retired after a 25-year career with the Housing Authority of the City of Asheville, including the past 14 as CEO. He spent 20 years before that in the business world.

Bell will continue working part-time with the authority, strictly to see through a project he views as his baby: the transformation of the 96-unit Lee Walker Heights public housing development into a 212-unit mixed-income and mixed-use neighborhood.

CLOSE After 25 years with the Housing Authority of the City of Asheville, CEO Gene Bell is retiring. Angeli Wright, awright@citizen-times.com

Bell was honored July 25 with a farewell gathering at the Arthur R. Edington Education & Career Center, a program attended by about 130 friends, family members and coworkers. Asheville Vice Mayor Gwen Wisler read a proclamation declaring the date ""Gene Bell Day,"" and Buncombe County Commissioner Amanda Edwards noted the county plans to offer a similar proclamation at the Aug. 6 Board of Commissioners meeting.

A steady stream of speakers talked about how much Bell, who has served on dozens of boards and committees, has meant to the city, public housing and to them personally. They also described him as a sometimes strict father figure who stressed accountability, a man obsessed with punctuality and efficiency who each day carried a handwritten to-do list in his pocket.

But he also has been a leader always willing to give someone a second chance or a hand up, several people said.

All about relationships

The Rev. Jim Abbott, former pastor of St. Matthias Episcopal Church and a longtime friend, said Bell simply committed himself to the community early on, and he had a knack for connecting the dots between education, poverty and jobs. Bell carved out time for community service, whether it was serving on the Asheville City Schools board or on the board of Muddy Sneakers, a program designed to get kids outdoors.

""I don't think many great things went on in this community over the last 25 years that don't have your fingerprints on them,"" Abbott said.

Shaunda Sandford, coordinator of the Housing Authority's Family Self-Sufficiency Program, talked about Bell's love of the outdoors. He took her hiking for the first time, showing her that ""black people can go hiking and enjoy it,"" she said, drawing laughter from the crowd.

Bell repeatedly said his job, as well as life, really comes down to one simple theme: respecting and caring about people.

(Photo: ANGELI WRIGHT/ASHEVILLE CITIZEN TIMES)

“I believe the most important thing in this world is relationships,” Bell said at his retirement event. ""Now, people have a lot of philosophical definitions of that, but the true meaning for your existence is relationships. You’ve got to help people. If we helped people as much as we deter people, it would be a lot easier.”

Bell said he's particularly proud of his work with the Residents Councils in the various housing developments.

Crystal Reid, president of the Residents Council for Lee Walker Heights and Klondyke Homes, said before the event that those relationships have been mutually beneficial. She lives in Klondyke and previously lived in Lee Walker.

""He’s a very neutral man and he keeps things transparent, and that’s one quality I greatly appreciate in him,"" Reid said. ""He's a very balanced man. He's not one to go toward the negative or the positive. He keeps it in the middle so everyone has a chance to say their piece.""

Relationships have always been precious to Bell, as well as tenuous at times.

Bell’s mother died when he was 11, in hindsight a harbinger of the loss of many of the people closest to Bell. He lost his first wife, Sharon, in 2015; and his daughter, Angela, who died from an aneurysm at age 40 in 2013. Bell also has a son, Shannon, 44, who is partially disabled after suffering a stroke.

While he's a little gruff on the exterior and known for his sometimes colorful language, Bell is also known for his optimism and genuinely caring about others.

At the Edington Center, Bell directly addressed the losses.

""Since I started with the housing authority — I think I can get through this — I’ve lost my daughter, my wife, my father, mother-in-law, six aunts, two uncles, eight first cousins, two mentors,” Bell said. “The reason that I can continue to go on is because when I look out here, it’s about you all. I can’t do anything about my losses, but I can damn sure do something about the people who are living.”

David Nash, who replaces Bell as CEO at HACA, said Bell was well-known for storytelling, regaling people with tales of life on the farm or his grandfather's frugality. Sometimes Bell would talk about his early career as one of the first African American managers at IBM.

""At some point I realized he wasn’t just doing this with staff, that he was doing it with the whole community — and by the whole community, I mean the African American community, the white community, the broader community of Asheville,"" Nash said. ""He didn’t care whether your name was Smith or Cecil, or whether it was Wanda or Shevonda. He could make a connection with people, he can make a connection with people. And he can really make people feel warm and welcome.""

Allison Smith, the property manager for HACA's Pisgah View Apartments, said Bell has always been ""firm and fair,"" balancing safety with livability.

""I think he's just a father figure for anyone who's walked the halls at (the Housing Authority),"" Smith said. ""He was there for everybody.""

Jovan Aiken, a maintenance technician with the Authority for about a year, said Bell helped a lot of people with jobs and ""never left anybody hanging or out to dry.""

Despite the early loss of his mother, Bell said he felt blessed to have grown up with both grandfathers within a mile. “I had a lot of love — as much as I could stand,"" he said. ""I’ve been the luckiest guy in the world.”

A business career came first

Bell graduated from Xavier University in Cincinnati with a degree in business management, then spent 20 years working for IBM, the international computer and management giant. He had upper level management stints in Lexington, Kentucky; Cincinnati;Cleveland, then at IBM headquarters in New Jersey.

Eventually, ""they asked me to move to Charlotte, and at that time it was all about money,” Bell said, noting he was the human relations manager at the time.

“I stayed two years and decided to do something different,” Bell said, adding that he was going to have to relocate once again, and he had a daughter in high school. “So I resigned and bought a construction company. I grew up doing construction work.”

In 1989, bad luck struck much of the Carolinas in the form of Hurricane Hugo, which left a trail of destruction far inland, including extensive damage to homes and other buildings in and around Charlotte.

“After Hugo, we had more business than we could take,” Bell said. “People remember when you treat them right.”

Bell had started coming to Asheville in the early 1970s and was a frequent visitor throughout the ‘70s and 80s with his first wife. In 1994, they moved to Asheville, after Bell met former HACA Director David Jones at an insurance conference. Bell had been working for the Charlotte Housing Authority for two years.

At Bell's retirement party, Jones recounted how heavily he recruited Bell.

""Boy, did I check him out,"" Jones said. ""The harder I checked, the better he looked. Not only was he a good manager and a good person, he reached out into the neighborhoods.""

Looking 'to chill a little bit'

Bell joined Asheville's Housing Authority as director of maintenance and building, but he had no intention of taking the top job.

“I came here to kind of chill a little bit,” Bell said. “I wanted to remodel the house and ride my motorcycle.”

When a boating accident claimed the life of Michael Godwin, who was expected to replaced Jones as CEO, Bell's name rose to the top as the next natural next leader. From childhood, Bell has had a strong sense of service built into his life, and he knew he could do that job — and that he should.

Bell and Jones, having done the same job for so long, truly appreciate each other's service. Bell says Jones was a fine mentor and kept his distance after leaving.

“When Dave left, I think he came to the office one time in a year, maybe two times in a year,” Bell said. “I will do the same thing. If you were ever going to follow in someone’s footsteps, he was the one. He was a gentleman and a scholar.”

Despite the demands of the job, Bell has also felt a calling to serve the community in other ways. Over the years, he has served on the Asheville City Schools board, chaired the Housing Coalition, and he now chairs the Buncombe County Planning Board. He's been on the city’s Civil Service Board, as well as holding several posts with public housing entities in the state and region.

He’s chaired the board of the Young Men’s Institute, and been involved with Buncombe County’s Capital Fund Commission, Read to Succeed and the Isaac Coleman Grant Committee. As a school board member, Bell pushed hard for the new Isaac Dickson Elementary School and Asheville Middle School.

Successes and some lingering problems, including crime

Bell is not one to tout his own accomplishments, but he is “really proud” that the housing authority went to HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration system in which all residents get a housing voucher. That’s allowed a lot of residents to live in other places than public housing units, and it gives them the freedom to move.

The program can pay up to 35 percent of their gross adjusted income. The Housing Authority now has about 3,000 vouchers and about 5,000 residents.

Bell also noted all of the HACA units — Pisgah View, Deaverview, Hillcrest, Klondyke and the Livingston Street apartments, as well as Lee Walker Heights — have been renovated or upgraded during his tenure.

Yet he'll quickly list the “great relationship with resident councils” among his top successes

He also considers surveillance cameras installation in developments to be a major help in curtailing crime, although some residents bristled at what they considered a loss of privacy. “It was tough in the beginning,” Bell allowed.

Bell said is proud the authority's ""banned"" list, typically reserved for residents who've committed serious crimes or threatened physical violence, is the smallest it's been during his tenure.

Crime remains a problem in the city's poorest neighborhoods, which include public housing developments. At a presentation to City Council in late June, Asheville Police Department Deputy Chief Jim Baumstark said gun violence — homicides, robberies and aggravated assaults — has risen 55% in three years.

Baumstark said two public housing complexes in West Asheville and one near downtown account for ""more than half of all calls for gunshot wounds, gun discharges and persons with guns."" Five of the top 10 locations from which calls originated were in and around public housing communities, police said.

Bell acknowledges crime remains a problem, but he also touches on one of his mantras, an opinion shared by other African American leaders in the city: “The problem we’ve experienced is the perpetrators of our crime are (usually) not residents of (public) housing.”

Carl Mumpower, a former Asheville City Councilman who often volunteered in public housing and worked closely with Bell, says Bell ""has carried one of the toughest leadership roles in our community with maturity, balance and courage.""

A conservative who has run for Congress and chaired Buncombe County's Republican Party, Mumpower has been critical of public housing at times, particularly the scourge of drug dealing.

""The drug and criminal culture continues to thrive in public housing,"" Mumpower said. ""That said, it was always my sense that Mr. Bell tried to find solutions and was open to any help he could get. Most of the time there wasn’t much, and that’s not a fight you can win alone.""

Looking for speed, and flat running spots

While he'll stay busy with the Lee Walker project, a $36.5 million transformation, Bell will have a much reduced work schedule. That'll leave time for his other loves, including his family, running and fast vehicles.

An avid runner, Bell has logged scores of races over the years, including a few marathons and 10K’s. Time has taken a toll, though.

“I do maybe 1-3 miles now,” Bell said. “I’m always looking for flat places to run.”

Bell and his wife, Patricia, live in a nice brick rancher in between the Livingston Heights public housing apartments and Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, a home Bell overhauled upon moving in. He’s always gotten a chuckle out of people who suggest he’s out of touch with public housing residents.

“I tell them, ‘I live a block away from public housing,’” Bell said.

While he’s not an extravagant man when it comes to clothes or perks, Bell does have one indulgence: fast vehicles. An avid motorcyclist, his pride and joy is a 790-pound 2013 Harley-Davidson Street Glide dripping with chrome.

When it comes to four wheels, it’s a 2013 Mercedes Benz AMG coupe with an enormous V8 motor and a growl like a Rottweiller on high alert. Bell bought it used, but he knows it still looks like an extravagance.

“You can’t make it logical,” he said.

The Bells have known each other for 27 years, but they just married last December.

Patricia Bell said she’s always been impressed by her husband’s ability to find the good in life.

“He never concentrates on the negatives in life,” she said while sitting in their living room. “It’s all about the good things.”

“And the people that are left,” Bell quickly adds.

At his daughter’s memorial service, Patricia Bell was moved by how Gene Bell concentrated on “nothing but the good times” they had together.

She’s less sanguine about his penchant for speed in the Mercedes.

“The first time I got in there and he stomped the gas, I thought, ‘You’re not 17 or 18 years old,’” Patricia said with a laugh.

Bell said they just completed a 2,450-mile trip up north, so he's pretty sure they're compatible.

He's equally sure he's done right by his community and coworkers over his long career.

""What I've wanted to do is what I've been able to do, and that is to help,"" Bell said.

Last year Sussex-based Quad announced it would acquire Chicago-based LSC Communications in a massive $1.4 billion deal, combining the nation’s two largest printing companies. Both are on the Inc. 1000 list, Quad at No. 608 and LSC at No. 649. (Full disclosure, Quad is the printer for BizTimes Milwaukee).

As the world has gone increasingly digital Quad has been forced to transform its business, and its industry. The company has made more than a dozen acquisitions since 2010, closed 34 printing plants and reduced its overall headcount by 10,000. Obviously, those were painful cuts to affected employees, but the printing industry clearly needed to consolidate to survive in the modern communications environment. Quad itself has evolved into more than just a printer; it’s now a marketing company that offers printing and a variety of marketing services (including data analytics and digital marketing) to its clients.

The LSC deal was Quad’s next big move. LSC has annual revenue of nearly $4 billion. LSC and Quad each has more than 50 printing facilities.

In trying to make the case for the importance of the deal, Quad and LSC said their combined revenue would drop by more than $1.5 billion by 2022 without combining or taking other actions.

But in June the U.S. Department of Justice sued the companies to block the deal. Recently, the companies agreed to walk away from the deal. Quad has to pay LSC a $45 million deal termination fee.

It’s disappointing that the companies caved so easily. They should have fought the DOJ, although Quad chairman, president and chief executive officer Joel Quadracci said waiting for an answer from the courts would cause uncertainty and erode the value of the deal.

The DOJ argued that if the deal had been approved, Quad would have dominated the magazine, catalog and book printing markets.

But Quadracci said the DOJ doesn’t understand that printers aren’t just competing with each other but with all modern communication venues, including companies like Google and Facebook, which Quad says combined have about the same amount of digital ad revenue as the revenue of the entire printing industry.

“The DOJ really indicated to us that they didn’t see that we were really competing with digital, which was the really challenging part to understand,” Quadracci said. “We’re all fighting for the same dollars; it’s just that print’s been on the losing end of it for a while… (The DOJ thinks) we’re just thinking about print as it was 20 years ago, but it isn’t 20 years ago, it’s today, it’s 2019 … It is a competitive market, but the reality is most of our competition is coming from outside the industry.”

Now Quad must focus on continuing to expand its business beyond print into data analytics and marketing. But the federal government has done the company, one of southeastern Wisconsin’s biggest employers, no favors."
Why Dave Norquist is the perfect choice for DOD's deputy secretary,https://thehill.com,[],08-04-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/455923-why-dave-norquist-is-the-perfect-choice-for-dods-deputy-secretary,"When the Senate confirmed David Norquist by voice vote, it not only demonstrated his overwhelming popularity on Capitol Hill but also, at long last, emplaced the top level of the Pentagon’s leadership after a half-year hiatus. Norquist, previously confirmed as Pentagon comptroller and chief financial officer, had been acting as deputy secretary ever since James Mattis James Norman MattisWhy Dave Norquist is the perfect choice for DOD's deputy secretary Five questions for Trump's new defense secretary on first major tour Trump taps Texas Rep.

In fact, Norquist was not even formally the acting deputy; he was “performing the duties of deputy secretary,” a weird formulation intended to comply with the terms of the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

Dave Norquist has admirers beyond Capitol Hill. Equally important are his popularity inside the Pentagon, his successful tenure as Pentagon comptroller, and his broad-based experience. Both his colleagues on the E Ring — whether in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs, and the Service department leaderships — and their staffs respected his judgment, even as he had to make difficult funding allocation decisions.

In addition, as chief financial officer and unlike any of his predecessors, myself included, he successfully oversaw the first-ever, department-wide audit, covering over $2.7 trillion in assets and $2.6 trillion in liabilities. His experience as a partner in the Kearney accounting firm, which focuses on government practice, certainly helped him in this regard. As he was the first to acknowledge, the audit was far from complete. It was by no means what is termed a “clean audit.” Nevertheless, it represented the largest audit of its kind anywhere, and for that he rightly deserved the kudos that he received.

Norquist is no mere accountant, however. He was serving as a key staffer on the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee when I hired him as my deputy. He brought with him not only a fine reputation for diligence and collegiality on the Hill, but also experience in the bowels of the Pentagon as both as a presidential management intern (as the internship program was then called) and then as an Army resource analyst. He also spent time working in the United Kingdom, and his international experience proved exceedingly valuable as he took the lead in managing budget matters arising from the occupation of Iraq.

In that latter capacity, he worked closely with not only key allies, but also the leadership of the State Department’s economics bureau — no small feat at a time when the Department of Defense (DOD) and State were at loggerheads on most issues relating to Iraq.

Norquist’s background and demeanor, therefore, will serve him exceedingly well as the Defense Department’s chief operating officer and as Secretary of Defense Mark Esper Mark EsperPrime minister says US won't deploy missiles in Australia New Pentagon chief says China's 'destabilizing behavior' is 'disturbing' Why Dave Norquist is the perfect choice for DOD's deputy secretary MORE’s stand-in when Esper is away from Washington.

And his ability to work closely and well with other departments will perhaps provide some comity to an executive branch that often has been chaotic.

Far too many vacancies remain in the Pentagon. This is an exceedingly troublesome circumstance for a department that would have to oversee wartime operations at short notice. Nevertheless, with DOD’s top two positions filled, the civilian leadership that is essential for managing the government’s largest department, both in war and in peace, at last is firmly in place.

Dov S. Zakheim is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and vice chairman of the board for the Foreign Policy Research Institute. He was under secretary of Defense (comptroller) and chief financial officer for the Department of Defense from 2001 to 2004 and a deputy under secretary of Defense from 1985 to 1987."

The children's lawyer was incensed. Her two tiny clients — one of them blind — had been in a shelter for three months, separated from their mother.

The family had traveled from Mexico to the United States, reaching Nogales, Arizona, on March 1, 2018. Officials at the border found that the mother, Nadia Pulido, had ""credible"" reasons for seeking asylum from an ex-partner who, she says, beat her and stalked her after their relationship ended.

But U.S. Customs and Border Protection still sent Pulido into an adult detention center run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She had an hour to say goodbye and try to assure her blind daughter, 6, and sobbing 3-year-old son that she'd see them in a couple of hours.

""A couple of hours turned into months. Painful months,"" Pulido recalled in an interview.

To help the children, pro bono attorney Maite Garcia turned to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. She filed a complaint with the office on June 7 of last year, explaining that Pulido's daughter was ""completely blind and requires assistance for daily living"" and would be better off with her stepfather, a U.S. citizen.

Nearly two weeks went by before the civil rights office replied.

""The issues you raise are very important to us,"" CRCL finally said in its emailed response. Then came a disclaimer: ""Please be advised that our complaint process does not provide individuals with legal rights or remedies. ... Instead, we use complaints like yours to find and address problems in DHS policy and its implementation.""

That was the last Garcia heard from the nearly 100-person office in Washington, D.C.

The tepid response from the department's civil rights office bolsters objections — not least from former staff — that the DHS watchdog is failing to stop rights abuses as they're happening inside a detention system that's expanding rapidly under the Trump administration.

The ineffectual handling of individual complaints adds to criticism that DHS leaders no longer heed recommendations from the agency's own civil rights experts.

""Put yourself in the shoes of the person who's sitting in the cell or who's separated from their parent or who's wondering where their child is,"" former CRCL staff attorney and adviser Ellen Gallagher said.

A recent whistleblower, Gallagher has accused the civil rights office of failing to investigate multiple individual complaints alleging unjustified solitary confinement of detainees in ICE custody. Gallagher is now with DHS' Office of Inspector General, a separate internal watchdog specializing in issuing reports after lengthy investigations.

""It seems to mislead the public, to invite complaints involving specific information about the individual or the family and the alleged violation, if Civil Rights and Civil Liberties had no intention of specifically investigating or resolving those individual complaints,"" Gallagher said.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has insisted that DHS has ""layers of oversight"" to correct abuses. ""We have good supervisory oversight, and we hold people accountable,"" he said during a July 9 interview on CNN in response to questions about filthy conditions in CBP holding facilities.

Gallagher's impression, however, is that the civil rights office ""was actually fairly intimidated by ICE and CBP and did not want to engage in activity that might offend either. That is an odd and even disturbing posture for an oversight authority.""

Internal CRCL log: a flood of complaints

Some CRCL staff members say that individual employees contact CBP or ICE to try to informally resolve civil rights complaints. But they can only advise agencies, they say, because their office isn't set up to halt abuses as they happen.

Cameron Quinn, chief of the civil rights office and an appointee of President Trump, declined a request for an interview. Another CRCL official responded in writing to questions, asking not to be quoted by name.

""CRCL does not have authority to remedy individual complaints but instead focuses on systemic issues"" at DHS, the official wrote. The office does have authority, however, to seek ""remedies"" for people facing disability discrimination, the official said, declining to elaborate.

""With regard to family separations,"" the official said, ""CRCL investigated the issue from a policy and process standpoint."" The civil rights office then sent its recommendations to ICE and Customs and Border Protection in a memo. CRCL declined to release the memo, calling it a ""deliberative"" document.

CRCL, the official added, still has ""open investigations"" into the separations of children under age 5, the separations of children with disabilities and standards for separating families based on parental criminal history.

The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties was created along with the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The office's mission is to advise the powerful federal department and prevent civil rights violations such as the post-Sept. 11 roundups of Muslims without due process. But some insiders say CRCL has always lacked teeth.

Last year, the civil rights office proved especially weak as complaints about due process concerns and family separations began pouring in — nearly 850 in the first half of 2018 alone, logged into a CRCL database. An independent journalist obtained a copy through a Freedom of Information Act request and then shared it with the Center for Public Integrity and NPR.

The complaints referenced more than 380 separated children 10 years old or younger, of which more than 120 children were age 5 or younger.

More than 140 complaints arrived before the Trump administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy on April 6, 2018. More than 160 cases of separation referenced in the log were carried out before that date. The zero-tolerance policy required separating families so that CBP could hold all adults for prosecution, even for a first-time misdemeanor illegal entry.

Former and current staff in the civil rights office say their colleagues were so upset by allegations in the complaints that they openly wept at desks as they reviewed the cases.

By May of last year, senior staff in the office had urged Quinn, in an internal memo, to challenge the separations. ""CRCL should express great concern over our exclusion from these critical decisions,"" which CRCL has the authority to review, the memo said. ""Deliberately harming children to deter parental behavior would require an exceedingly strong justification to pass muster as a reasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, among other concerns.""

Lawyer and former CRCL senior adviser Scott Shuchart, who resigned from the office last year, said his and other advisers' concerns were ""blown off"" by CBP and other DHS leadership in meetings.

One complaint to CRCL in January 2018 reported that CBP separated a 4-month-old infant from a Mexican father who had prior immigration violations but feared being sent back to Mexico.

Another reported that an 8-year-old said CBP officers ""kicked him and/or hit him with a shoe"" to wake him. Dozens of other complaints described children upset about their parents' uncertain whereabouts and abrupt disappearance — including a 14-year-old in CBP custody who said he was separated after a meal break and was then ""told by officers that his father would be deported.""

About 95% of all complaints logged came from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, a unit within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that's responsible for migrant-children shelters.

Former senior staff in this federal resettlement office say the volume of complaints is unprecedented. Robert Carey, ORR director during the final two years of Barack Obama's presidency, said he thinks ORR employees were trying to stop separations by filing complaints.

""You probably have a deeply traumatized, possibly hysterical child that you're trying to care for,"" Carey said. ""I'm guessing some of those cases would require ... the intervention of a therapist, particularly if you're talking about, in some instances, young children.""

HHS officials declined to make leaders in its Office of Refugee Resettlement available for an interview.

Most other complaints came from nonprofit legal aid groups — including 18 filed by the Phoenix-based Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, where Maite Garcia works.

The complaint about Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son appears on page 276 of CRCL's 366-page document.

Another Florence complaint filed on June 14 of last year appears on page 321. It raises objections to CBP's separation of a Guatemalan mother from her 17-year-old son — who is unable to hear or speak — without regard for his disability. The boy could have qualified to be ""paroled"" into the U.S., a conditional form of humanitarian release. But that never happened — and the case shows how a formal complaint can wither in the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Deaf boy's mom taken away

The story of the mother and her deaf son ""exhibits the cruelty, the chaos"" of how migrants are treated, said Elizabeth Jordan, an attorney with Denver's Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center. She represented the mother while the woman was in ICE lockup in Colorado.

On April 25 of last year, the mother and her 17-year-old deaf son approached CBP officers after crossing the Arizona border and asked to apply for asylum.

The boy and his mother now live in Florida, where they are in the process of applying for asylum. In an interview, the mother, who asked that her name not be disclosed, said she'd worked previously in the state, sending money to Guatemala to rent a room for her son and pay his tuition at a school for the deaf there. She eventually returned to Guatemala to care for her son and her own frail mother.

Three months after she got there, her mother died, and her deaf son lost his primary caregiver. He'd long been bullied in Guatemala, and thieves had robbed him at gunpoint. Mother and son both set out for the United States some months later.

""I don't do this for me. I do it for him,"" she said, ""because I'm not going to be alive for all of his life.""

After Customs and Border Protection took her and her son into custody near San Luis, Ariz., the mother said, officers ignored her pleas to keep them together rather than place them in cages segregated by age and gender. Her son, she told the officers, needed her to interpret. When she protested further that her son was mute, she said an officer answered, ""He won't need to do much talking where he's going.""

At some point, while her son was asleep, guards took her out of her cage, the mother said, and transported her to an ICE detention center pending prosecution. She said she was told ""you have to pay for what you did"" because she'd been turned away at the border the year before. She was sentenced to 30 days in an Arizona jail for reentry and then transferred to an ICE detention center in Colorado, pending deportation.

Meanwhile, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had sent her son on a long bus ride to an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter in Arizona, where his only means of communication was drawing pictures.

For more than a month, the mother pleaded in vain with detention guards, first in Arizona and then in Colorado, to arrange a video call so she could at least see and sign with her son. Medical records from the boy's time in the shelter indicate he was distraught: He struck his head against walls and cut himself with a paper clip. In an interview in Florida, interpreted by his mother, he said that to prevent him from getting out of bed one night, he was physically restrained.

""She was profoundly distressed and so worried about him,"" lawyer Jordan said of the mother. ""This is a person who has devoted her life to keeping him safe and getting the best she can for him. And then, for her to be totally unable to check in on him for weeks ...""

A round of emails between the boy's attorneys and DHS' civil rights office ultimately went nowhere.

Initially, a CRCL adviser seemed to be working on the Florence project's June 2018 complaint, arguing that the deaf boy merited humanitarian parole and that for two months the shelter hadn't ""provided him with the appropriate accommodations"" for his disability. The adviser wrote that the civil rights office was ""reviewing your concerns""; he asked for proof the boy was deaf.

In July 2018, one of the boy's lawyers emailed CRCL to write that when CBP held the boy in custody, he ""was able to understand that the agents were mocking him"" because they didn't believe he was deaf.

The lawyer further argued that CBP, ICE and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency in charge of shelters, were all in violation of disability rights because they had failed to arrange a video call between the boy and his mother.

The official from the civil rights office then replied that he was ""unable to look into [the boy's] ongoing concerns"" because the teenager had been transferred by CPB, which is within DHS' jurisdiction, to ORR, which is not.

Instead, he suggested, the civil rights office could investigate the mother's concerns because she was in ICE custody, which, like CBP and CRCL, falls under DHS. The boy's attorneys gave the civil rights official contact information for Jordan, the mother's Colorado lawyer.

By that time, Jordan had already been emailing local ICE officials repeated pleas to set up a video call. The call finally happened — nearly three months after U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers had separated the mother and her son. But it wasn't because of action by DHS' civil rights office, Jordan said. It was because DHS was by then under court order to put separated migrant family members in touch with one another by phone and then reunite them.

""In my interactions with individual CRCL officers,"" Jordan said, ""I don't get the sense that they're out to lunch or bad people. I think that they just ultimately can't get much done. I think it comes from being really hamstrung by the fact that they have to work with ICE and get ICE to concur in their recommendations and actually make changes.""

In the children's interest

Although Trump ended his zero-tolerance policy in June 2018 after a public outcry, U.S. border agents have continued to separate families due to parents' criminal records, even for minor offenses, or because of prior deportations.

Immigrant rights groups have long pressed DHS to consider the children's interests, and they've noted that family separation ""causes great harm, disrupting emotional and psychological well-being.""

For failed asylum-seeker Nadia Pulido, the groups' pressure came too late.

Pulido was born in Mexico but is a fluent English-speaker who arrived in California as an undocumented child and was raised by relatives. She could have qualified for a special visa for abandoned children, but no one sought such a visa on her behalf. When she was ""literally just young, stupid and hanging around the wrong crowd,"" she said, she was convicted of robbery and deported.

Because of that history, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and ICE chose to send her children to a shelter and keep her in detention last year while her asylum case went forward.

ICE could have released her on humanitarian parole. Instead, she was held in detention for eight months, until she lost her asylum bid. She could have appealed, but that would have meant more detention — and more time apart from her young children. In the end, Pulido agreed to be deported to Mexico.

After four months in a shelter, Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son were finally released to her husband, a U.S. citizen. Attorneys for the children and Pulido believe a federal lawsuit that led to a court order unifying migrant families was likely a factor. And they doubt their complaint to DHS' civil rights office did anything to hasten the children's release.

In Mexico, where the kids have now joined her, Pulido said she's still scared. To support her need for refuge, she presented Mexican police reports about incidents involving her ex-partner; and in her asylum application, she wrote that he assaulted her while she was pregnant and held a gun to her head.

""We were leaving Mexico to seek help in the United States,"" she said, ""to stay free of danger.""

ATLANTA - Anguished families have started planning funerals in two U.S. cities, as politicians pointed fingers and a nation numbed by gun violence wondered what might come next as the death toll from two weekend mass shootings rose to 31.

The attacks 1,300 miles apart -- at a packed shopping center in El Paso, Texas, and a popular nightlife stretch in Dayton, Ohio -- also injured dozens more.

They became the newest entries on an ever-growing list of mass shooting sites and spurred discussion on where to lay the blame.

President Donald Trump cited mental illness and video games but steered away from talk of curbing gun sales during an address to the nation Monday morning. He also announced that the federal government will work with social media companies to detect mass shootings before they happen.

Former federal prosecutor Bret Williams told Channel 2’s Richard Elliot that the Department of Justice will have to balance public safety with your constitutional rights.

Williams warns too much monitoring could create a surveillance state.

Trump condemned the weekend attacks in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, along with racism, bigotry and white supremacy.

He said the United States must do a better job reforming mental health laws so the mentally ill cannot get access to weapons.

He also wants the Department of Justice and the FBI to monitor social media for any signs of another impending attack.

[READ: What are red flag laws; would they have helped prevent the Texas, Ohio shootings?]

“I am directing the Department of Justice to work in partnership with local state and federal agencies as well as social media companies to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike,” Trump said during a morning address Monday.

Elliot took the details of the president’s plans to Williams.

“There are benefits, pros and cons. There are pitfalls. There are also upsides,” Williams said.

He told Elliot that there are obvious upsides to it.

“Who doesn’t want to catch a Columbine before it happens, an El Paso before it happens?” Williams said.

[READ: El Paso Walmart shooting: Therapy dogs comfort victims]

But he warned that a Tweet taken out of context could lead to a full-blown FBI investigation or what happens if someone talks about doing something but never has any intention of going beyond that.

He says the DIJ will have to do a delicate balancing act.

“Are you now creating a surveillance state? A surveillance society where everybody’s being watched, everybody’s being monitored, is that what you want?” Williams said.

Williams points out that the feds don’t need a warrant to monitor social media feeds. Once you post something, it’s out in the public.

Whatever the political back-and-forth, or the re-energized presence of gun control talk on the presidential campaign trail, the very real consequences of gun violence were still being bared by victims badly injured in the two states.

[READ: Dayton, Ohio, shooting victims: What we know]

In both incidents, a young white male was identified as the lone suspect. Though authorities were eyeing racism as a possible factor in Texas, where the alleged shooter has been booked on murder charges, in Ohio police said there was no indication of a similar motivation.

Police in Dayton responded in about 30 seconds early Sunday and fatally shot 24-year-old Connor Betts. While the gunman was white and six of the nine killed were black, police said the quickness of the rampage made any discrimination in the shooting seem unlikely.

In Texas, where 22 were killed, authorities said the accused shooter drove nearly 10 hours from his home in a Dallas suburb. Authorities seemed to take some solace in knowing the shooter wasn't one of their own.

"Russia probe’s price tag nearly $32 million, DOJ says",https://www.politico.com,['Darren Samuelsohn'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/02/russia-probe-price-tag-32-million-1445269,"Alex Wong/Getty Images legal Russia probe’s price tag nearly $32 million, DOJ says

Spending in the Russia investigation for the duration of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s work hit nearly $32 million, according to a government report released Friday.

That total covers all of Mueller’s receipts through the end of May, soon after he had closed his office and issued his 448-page report, which did not contain enough evidence to prove a criminal conspiracy between Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia but did show evidence suggesting the president tried to thwart the probe.

Story Continued Below

Mueller’s office alone was responsible for about $16.4 million in spending dating to its creation in the spring of 2017. But the Department of Justice has also itemized $15.3 million that accounts for spending on the Russia investigation that would have happened whether or not the special counsel’s office had been established.

By far, Mueller’s largest line-item went toward salaries and benefits: $9.7 million over the course of his nearly two-year investigation. His office also reported spending $3.1 million on rent, communications and utilities; $1.6 million on travel and personal transportation; and $902,000 on contractual services that primarily covered information technology.

Government spending on the Russia probe has been a frequent point of contention for President Trump, who in late May complained the investigation had come with a $40 million price tag.

In fact, Mueller’s spent far less than that. And that also doesn’t count what the government has taken into its coffers from Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman whose convictions and plea deal resulted in the forfeiture to the Treasury of real estate, bank accounts and a life-insurance policy.

“The cost of your investigation to the taxpayers approaches zero,” House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said last month during Mueller’s appearance before the Democratic-led panel, saying the figure recovered by the government was “as much as $42 million.” Others have estimated the figure may be much lower once the amount of money Manafort owed on his mortgages is deducted.

DOJ has released four spending statements connected with the Mueller probe — it put out one every six months — since December 2017. Friday’s report said that a final tally is expected later this year and will cover any additional administrative costs or adjustments tied to closing Mueller’s office, which at its peak employed 19 lawyers. Mueller also relied on about 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants and other professional staff.

"Potential legal troubles loom for Comey, despite evading prosecution on leaks",https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/transcript/potential-legal-troubles-loom-for-comey-despite-evading-prosecution-on-leaks,"This is a rush transcript from ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" August 2, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.

JASON CHAFFETZ, GUEST HOST: Welcome to this special edition of ""Hannity: Justice in America.""

I'm Jason Chaffetz, in tonight for Sean.

Breaking this week, we learned that fired FBI Director James Comey is in some serious hot water. According to a report from ""The Hill's"" John Solomon, Inspector General Michael Horowitz found that Comey lacked candor and leaked confidential government documents. James Comey was even recommended for prosecution but Solomon and FOX News are reporting he won't be charged, for now.

We saw a similar result a few months ago when a still unnamed FBI deputy assistant director was referred for criminal prosecution for purposely leaking sealed court documents. Yet, the Department of Justice refused to prosecute.

But while the disgraced former FBI director has escaped criminal charges for now, the Department of Justice's investigations into FISA abuse and the origins of the Russia witch hunt are still underway.

Yesterday on Twitter, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows of North Carolina pointed out, quote: As the I.G. report on Comey approaches, we are getting the sound of silence. No Comey tweets. No softball interviews. Must be tougher when you get questioned by a Department of Justice inspector general. The truth is coming. His actions will come to light, and the verdict won't be pretty.

Unsurprisingly, the always indignant James Comey responded writing, quote, I love transparency. I just wait for the facts before I talk about them. I'm confident the results of all I.G. reports will show honest, public servants work hard to protect this country from a threat this president and his enablers won't acknowledge. And, at me next time.

James Comey may want to get off of his high horse on this one because as the ranking member of the House Intel Committee pointed out, Comey could be in serious trouble. Watch this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

REP. DEVIN NUNES (D-CA): Look, I haven't disclosed who he referred criminally but I think one could guess that it's highly likely that we would name people who leaked classified information. So, they are not going to act on any of our referrals. Those have all been given to the U.S. attorney in Connecticut. My guess is the same holds true for the I.G. Everything is going to be given to the attorney in Connecticut. So if I was James Comey, I wouldn't be walking on the cornfields of Iowa yet running for president.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHAFFETZ: According to reports, one crucial piece of evidence surrounding the DOJ's investigation into FISA abuse will soon be available. That would be Bruce Ohr's 302s.

Joining us now to explain is FOX News contributor Sara Carter and the author of the upcoming book, this is going to be a good one, ""Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in Political History"", FOX News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett.

Thank you both for joining us tonight.

Gregg, I want to start with you. You are in the studio with us in New York. What troubles with me as this is now two people in a row where the inspector general has recommended criminal prosecution and the Department of Justice is not prosecuting.

GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: It's got to be frustrating for Horowitz and his team of lawyers because they presented two cases now. The first one, against a deputy assistant director to the FBI, it's a total slam-dunk case. And yet, the DOJ doesn't want to prosecute.

Now, he's got Comey who stole government documents, leaked them to the media, and to friends.

CHAFFETZ: He admitted that he leaked them.

JARRETT: He admitted it. And apparently, some of these are classified. So, that's a violation of the Espionage Act whether it's intentional or grossly negligent is what Hillary Clinton did, and I name in my book 600 individuals who did this and got prosecuted for it yet James Comey does not? I think it's a mistake.

However, I do sort of understand that if the prosecution is going to be made over all of this, you want to go with your best case and may be William Barr and the DOJ is waiting for the IG's criminal referral on FISA abuse which would include that and then we just saw on your screen, James Comey.

CHAFFETZ: Sara, James Comey is an out of the woods yet. I mean, there still is this I.G. report that more and probably, you have Durham who is pursuing things and couldn't bring up a number of charges along the way, correct?

SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Oh, absolutely. And I think it's not just frustrating to Horowitz, if we want to go back to this decision, not to prosecute Comey for leaking his classified memos. It's frustrating to the American people and I see that on Twitter. I see people responding like, is there a two tiered justice system? What's going on here?

I think we'll just need to take a deep breath. I am being very vigilant. I am being very cautious. I think Attorney General William Barr is going to do the right thing.

But I'm being mindful. And I think it's very important for the American people to do the same because John Durham is the man in charge here and he is putting together his case and he is working diligently, according to sources. But it's a very tight ship.

Nothing is leaking. We know that he's looking at all aspects of how Comey was involved in the beginning of the investigation into President Trump and Russia. He's looking at all of those machinations, everything that happened out over the very beginning of the investigation, and that's what's going to be important here.

And now that we know Judicial Watch is getting those documents, those 302s from Bruce Ohr and his interviews with the FBI agents, I think the American public will have a little more light on what was going on there and then that's I report that's coming out from Horowitz on Russia, that is going to be a big one.

CHAFFETZ: Yes, Gregg, let's talk about the 302s because the 302s are the summaries of the FBI's interviews along the way. What do we expect or what we think that these 302s could potentially tell us as they have interviews and discuss these things with Bruce Ohr?

JARRET: It's going to likely going to show that the FBI and the Department of Justice were both warned that this guy, Christopher Steele, had ponied up a document called a dossier. It was a fabrication.

He was not credible. He was not reliable. And yet, Comey and McCabe, and others stated to the FISA court that he was. They knew he wasn't.

In fact, they had fired him for leaking and lying. So, they used Bruce Ohr in an information laundering scheme. He was the conduit. They knew and that they couldn't go back to Christopher Steele that they had fired. I would break rules and regulations.

So it was a sleazy, slimy operation they used Ohr as a conduit. He would get information from Steele, feed it to his handler, his handler will give it to Peter Strzok, who would give it to McCabe, who would give it to Comey, and they were cleansing their fingerprints. They are dirty fingerprints off of the Steele dossier by using that guy, Bruce Ohr, as the conduit.

CHAFFETZ: Now, Sara, Bruce Ohr happens to be married to a person named Nellie Ohr and Fusion GPS, which I think I'd less than 20 something employees, employed this guys wife. And so, how do you see this playing out and what are the 302s from your reporting and your research going to show us about what Bruce Ohr was doing?

CARTER: Well, remember, Jason, Nellie Ohr was hired specifically for this. She was hired specifically because she's a Russia expert. Apparently, she is fluent in Russian. She was focused on the Trump campaign and any kinds of Russia contacts. So, that's what makes this so terrible.

And also the fact that Bruce Ohr really never reported that to the DOJ, even more importantly about Bruce Ohr. And I think a lot of people have them forgot about this, was that under pressure from Trey Gowdy, when he was questioning him behind closed doors, Bruce Ohr admitted that he had told people within the Department of Justice, particularly the criminal fraud division, which was then handed by Andrew Weissmann, which then became a part of the special counsel, the second -- the right-hand man, the second in charge next to Robert Mueller, all about this.

So there were three people at senior-level DOJ officials that actually knew about Bruce Ohr and his contacts with Christopher Steele, two of which would were working for the special counsel. So all of this is going to come out and Gregg is right on the money. The most important thing that those 302s, I believe, are going to reveal, is that he warned people that Christopher Steele was anti-Trump and that there was information that was not verifiable, and that this would look really bad.

And if that's the case, this is a potentially big criminal liability and problem for people in the FBI, particularly for Comey who signed off on the first FISA warrant.

CHAFFETZ: And remember, there were multiple FISA warrants going into the court and, Gregg, part of what I am really curious to see when they go through these 302s, first of all, hats off to Judicial Watch for having the legal capability and financial wherewithal to file these suits and pry open these documents and make them available. They make Congress just to look feckless. I mean, it really is.

And I'm the former chairman of the committee issuing subpoenas and they wouldn't respond to me, but Judicial Watch can go out and get this because they have the support of the court. Congress can't ever go to the court to actually get these things loosened up.

JARRETT: So, and it underscores how Christopher Wray of the FBI is sort of his twin brother of James Comey. He obstructed lawful subpoenas from people like you in Congress in order to cover up and hide incriminating information.

CHAFFETZ: Now, Sara, this took so much time because there was -- I mean, I'm sorry, but under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, we got nothing ever. There were no responses to this. It was only since Attorney General Barr came and the president said we had to release these documents and declassify them.

CARTER: That's right, Jason, because what was so difficult was this constant battle, right? This what Judicial Watch was so great at that is fighting them in the courts, because no matter which way anybody turned, the DOJ, the Department of Justice, and the FBI, were more concerned at that time about protecting themselves and their reputation and not doing what was right for the American people. And this is something that we have to come to terms with as a country.

The most important thing that we can do now, regardless of what is discovered, is to discover the truth. That's it. That's what the American people want, that's what the American people need, because we should not be a two-tiered system of justice.

CHAFFETZ: Yes.

CARTER: Where people like Hillary Clinton and others get a break and the rest of the American public have to pay a heavy price and a burden like Kristian Saucier who took pictures on board a nuclear sub and then was put in prison.

CHAFFETZ: Yes, yes.

CARTER: It's just not right.

CHAFFETZ: Well, listen --

CARTER: So I think right now, we are seeing something different.

CHAFFETZ: Gregg and Sara, thank you so much.

The first glimpse, by the way, that we are going to get to get to see when Durham is also looking at or at least I should say the next glimpse, should happen as soon as Monday when we expect the 302s from Bruce Ohr to be released. Don't you want to watch the show on Monday night when Sean will be back in the chair? I think we will have some interesting news.

But tonight, the Spygate controversy continues. Iowa's Senator Chuck Grassley, one of my favorites in the United States Senate, he says the Pentagon failed to meet his demand for documents on contracts with the FBI informant Stefan Halper. He is the shady Cambridge professor who is suspected of spying on members of the Trump campaign.

Joining us now for a reaction on this and of the news that James Comey won't be prosecuted, at least for now, are Republican Congressman Tom McClintock of California, and Andy Biggs, a congressman from Arizona.

I served with both of gentlemen in Congress while I was there and I think you both for joining us tonight.

When you got word through John Solomon's reporting and what FOX News has been able to report that James Comey would actually not be prosecuted, or held accountable for releasing and having classified information in a non- classified setting, Congressman Biggs, what was your reaction?

REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): Well, my first reaction is, this is the same thing we've seen prosecuted over and over again. In other words, he lied and he leaked classified information.

He not only lied and leaked classified information, he has admitted it, so -- that he did it for political purpose. So the culpable mental state is there. So, the elements of the crime are all obvious, so I'm banking that they think that they need to hold off on indicting Mr. Comey until the Horowitz report comes in and Mr. Durham's finishes in his investigation.

I believe that this is just a postponement of the inevitable for Mr. Comey.

CHAFFETZ: And, Congressman McClintock, when you heard the news and saw this information, what was your reaction?

REP. TOM MCCLINTOCK (R-CA): Well, it's obviously one of two things. It's either the same double standard that we've seen them play out in case after case, which are prior guests mentioned. Or, as Andy says, and I tend to agree with him, they have gotten much bigger fish to fry with James Comey and they don't want to get sidetracked into charges like this when they are much bigger issue is still afoot. And we'll find out as all of this unfolds and unravels.

CHAFFETZ: Well, and I hope that's the case. I'm kind of stuck on the fact of the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, issued a statement read on the fact that the inspector general put out this document talking about the deputy assistant director that he had unsealed -- that there was a sealed court documents and that the deputy assistant director of the FBI, we don't know the person's actual name because there are multiple people with that title, but they gave this information to a reporter and the Department of Justice had decided not to prosecute.

Congressman Biggs, how do we get to the point where there is an equal application of justice? Because I got to tell you, your ranking file person in the military or some other place or contractor who has classified information, guess what, they are going to be prosecuted and going to jail and that's the way it probably should be.

But here you have the deputy assistant director not prosecuted. I don't understand it and how is Congress going to hold the DOJ accountable for that?

BIGGS: Well, we have to hold them accountable. I mean -- but, you've seen what the people on judiciary concern. They wanted interview everybody tried to impeach President Trump, so they are not interested in this.

I am interested in this. I'll tell you why I'm interested, for the very reason you're talking about, I don't think it just ends at DOJ or with the FBI itself. I think this goes across DOD, we are saying that, that they don't want to give information either.

We are seeing a lot of agencies just choose to withhold information from Congress and Congress has got to hold people in contempt and, you know, but, right now, we are feckless.

You used the word feckless. I can't help but agree with you because you served there, Tom and I are there, I think -- I get frustrated at the stonewalling we get from the administrations that are of the same party and they redact documents and they will say it's for national security and then you've seen what I have where it becomes unredacted it was only because they were embarrassed at the corruption and the level of corruption and bureaucracy. It has nothing to do with national security. So we have to push forward on this.

CHAFFETZ: Yes, Congressman McClintock, what Andy Biggs is talking about was exactly right. I saw time after time almost on a daily basis things that were redacted because they were politically embarrassing. Not because they were actually true classifications.

But how do we get past this? How do we hold these people accountable? Because then when you do have somebody who is admitted in interviews on television saying I've leaked these documents on purpose because I wanted them to be out there in the media, where do we go from there?

MCCLINTOCK: Well, as you know, the most closely guarded secrets in the U.S. government are unclassified but embarrassing. But I think this whole thing is now unraveled to the point where it's taking on a life of its own. The facts are coming out.

I mean, the reason why Chuck Grassley is so insistent on getting the facts from the pentagon is at the same time it was giving a massive $400,000 contract to Stefan Halper, to write a report that investigative reporters are now calling of dubious value. The same time he was getting at payoff, he was spying on the Trump campaign.

So, things started to unravel. They take on a life of their own. The facts, they are true. And it will set our nation free from this whole Russian collusion nonsense and at the same time, those same facts may start putting behind bars and very high officials and our intelligence and justice agencies from the Obama administration.

The truth will out. I'm convinced of that. And as those facts come to light, they will down those responsible and hopefully, we will never see this kind of threat to our democracy again, a threat from within -- the use of the most terrifying powers that we give to our government, powers to destroy people's lives, turn for political purposes to intervene in election and to undermine the constitutionally elected president.

CHAFFETZ: Well, I'm glad these two are on top of it. These are two of our best serving in the United States Congress. So, gentlemen, I thank you.

BIGGS: Thanks, Jason.

CHAFFETZ: And as you talk about that Halper contract, let's remember, our government come out of your wallets, took more than $1 million and put it in his wallet. Congressman Grassley -- I mean, Senator Grassley, he wants to see those contracts. Senator Grassley better get those contracts because we coughed up a million dollars and he needs to see what was going on there and I think he and his staff will do a great job once he gets those documents.

Thank you again gentlemen for being here.

Coming up, why are 2020 Democrats suddenly attacking Obama? Spoiler alert, they think he's too conservative. We'll explain after the break. Don't go away.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CHAFFETZ: Welcome back to this HANNITY Special: Justice in America.

Wednesday night's Democratic debate showed just how radically liberal the Democratic party has become. Even former President Barack Obama was not liberal enough for some of the candidates. Watch this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Vice President Biden, I didn't hear your response when the issue came up of all those deportations. You are a vice president of the United States. I didn't hear whether you try to stop them or not, using your power and your influence in the White House.

JULIAN CASTRO (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If you elect me president, you're not electing me to follow. You're electing me to lead.

Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn't.

SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mr. Vice President, you can't have it both ways. You invoked President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can't do it when it's convenient and then dodge it when it's not.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHAFFETZ: Last night, President Trump brought up the bizarre debates during his massive rally in Cincinnati, Ohio. Take a look.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: I was watching the so-called debate last night.

(BOOS)

And I also watched the night before that was long, long television. And the Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama then they did attacking me, practically.

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

It's true. And this morning, that's all the fake news was talking about.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHAFFETZ: As only the president can say.

And Joe Biden who seems to be running on Obama's legacy said he was surprised by the left turning on one of their idols.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I must tell you, I was a little surprised at how much hate was coming about Barack -- about the president. I mean, I am proud to have served him and I'm out of out of the job he did. I don't think there's anything he has to apologize for and I think that, you know, it kind of surprised me, the degree of criticism.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHAFFETZ: Joining us now is American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp and former economic advisor to President Obama, Austan Goolsbee.

Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.

Austan, is the road to the White House for the Democrats paved by who can be the hardest, toughest, and most liberal against Barack Obama? Is that where we are going?

AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: I mean, I don't know what it says, but a hundred percent agree with President Trump. They were attacking Barack Obama more than they were attacking President Trump. I don't know what they were thinking, and all I can think is they were trying out different stuff.

You know, it's an early debate. They're going to try out various things, but the popularity of President Obama among Democratic voters, they should have checked their polls. I mean, that it's pretty high and they are going to get the vice president made the nomine if they continue that.

I think if the next debate or the next public thing, these people are going to be backing up just because they hear that truck. They're going to -- this was really dumb. They should not have done that.

CHAFFETZ: I agree with you. I agree with you and you agree with Donald Trump. I hope we caught all of this on tape, because we're going to run this at some point.

GOOLSBEE: Mark it down, mark this day.

CHAFFETZ: Matt, what was your read on the Democratic debate because they spent an awful lot of time beating up on Barack Obama?

MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIR: Let's get specific here for a minute. I was shocked and tweeted out after the debate that Obama has become a bit of an albatross just like the Clintons. It's kind of like going to unite the Clintons and the Obamas together, the fact that both of them aren't heralded as heroes anymore by the Democratic Party.

But specifically, calling Obama's policies of deporting illegals here who commit additional crimes, calling that racist, asking Joe Biden if he called out President Obama at the time for deporting illegals, President Obama deported more illegals than President Trump has, and they are calling that racist. He said Obamacare was immoral, didn't cover enough people. It was kind of like a poultry first step to get health care to the American people.

Obamacare is outrageously expensive and it has left millions of Americans with worst health insurance, but it's usually Republicans who were making the argument on Obamacare, not Democrats basically saying all these support for Obamacare over the course of the last decade was a mistake. So, when you look at the actual policies, criminal justice reform basically, they are saying he was, you know, immorally tough on inner-city black kids. It's amazing that this is coming from Democrats.

I think the Democrats have lost their heroes, Jason. There is not any previous president they can point to you and say this is our hero and their hero today unfortunately, are socialism and the leaders of socialism. I think it's a very sad thing for the country.

CHAFFETZ: Well, that's why Bernie Sanders right on top of the ticket, he's not even registered Democrat. He calls himself a Democratic socialist by definition.

But, Austan, I got to tell you, I voted again against -- when I was in Congress, I voted against the so-called Affordable Care Act and so did every other Republican. Democrats owned that thing --

GOOLSBEE: I remember, I remember you did.

CHAFFETZ: Yes, that was a good vote. I'm telling you, but the Democrats - -

GOOLSBEE: No, it wasn't.

CHAFFETZ: If you watch the first, you had to get back past 25 minutes just to get through the introduction but the next 20 to 25 minutes was all about how bad the Affordable Care Act is and how expensive it is.

GOOLSBEE: Yes, well, not exactly how expensive it is but they want to do more then what's in the Affordable Care Act. I mean, to disagree a bit with Matt and your vote, Jason, if you look at the Affordable Care Act in the polls now, it's got about 70 percent support among the American people and when President Trump attempted to repeal it and restore the stuff about pre-existing conditions, et cetera, that was massively unpopular and he couldn't even get his own --

CHAFFETZ: No, we got rid of the individual mandate was absolutely a necessary.

GOOLSBEE: Well, look --

(CROSSTALK)

GOOLSBEE: He was unable to get his own party to back him to vote to repeal it, and if the Democrats -- now, to some minds, in this debate, it was in all of the candidates. But there were definitely some prominent ones who were criticizing the Affordable Care Act.

(CROSSTALK)

SCHLAPP: This is important here, let me jump in here. This is very important.

Joe Biden who was the vice president, as you know, a man you served, he didn't at one point on this conversation about Obamacare, this huge argument of Obamacare, he never invoked the name Barack Obama. And he said he also agreed that it wasn't enough and they had to do much more.

Now, we were promised under Obamacare that if we spend these trillions of dollars that the American people would be covered and even though Trump was able to repeal the individual mandate, even up to that point, we all know that millions of Americans were left unprotected by the bill and it actually got worse health care, and couldn't keep their doctor or their plan.

And so, for Joe Biden to say that Obamacare didn't get it done is a major feat.

(CROSSTALK)

GOOLSBEE: According to the data from the Department of Health and Human Services, two thirds of that is not true. Two thirds of what you just said are not true.

(CROSSTALK)

SCHLAPP: No, no. That's not right.

GOOLSBEE: Millions more--

SCHLAPP: Be specific. Be specific, because you are right.

GOOLSBEE: Millions more people--

SCHLAPP: Be specific.

GOOLSBEE: Are you going to let me tell you what the Department of Health and Human Services--

SCHLAPP: Yes.

GOOLSBEE: --data show or just keep interrupting? It shows that millions--

SCHLAPP: No tell me.

GOOLSBEE: --more people got coverage than had before.

CHAFFETZ: But Austan--

GOOLSBEE: And since Donald Trump's action--

CHAFFETZ: Hold on one second.

SCHLAPP: On Medicaid.

GOOLSBEE: --millions of people are losing their insurance.

CHAFFETZ: Austan and Matt, listen--

SCHLAPP: On Medicaid.

CHAFFETZ: --the reality is, during the Democratic debate they all beat the living tar out of the Affordable Care Act and when you talk about--

GOOLSBEE: No all - no--

CHAFFETZ: And when you talk about giving illegal immigrants--

SCHLAPP: Every single one of them--

CHAFFETZ: --free healthcare--

GOOLSBEE: Not every single one of them.

SCHLAPP: Every one of them want to give illegal immigrants

GOOLSBEE: --that's not correct.

SCHLAPP: --free healthcare. That is so fundamentally totally wrong.

GOOLSBEE: They didn't really totally support that.

CHAFFETZ: All right, last question--

GOOLSBEE: They did not all support that.

CHAFFETZ: Last question. Well, we'll watched the tape back where they all raised their hands there.

GOOLSBEE: OK.

CHAFFETZ: But last question. Joe Biden, he's part of the past. He's been in Washington for 40 years. I've never met anybody who walked around said, we need more Washington, we need more bureaucracy, we need more government spending, all right. How does Joe Biden make his case at the same time they're all trying to distance themselves from Barack Obama? And it's got to be embarrassing that the President did not endorse Joe Biden.

GOOLSBEE: I agree with you. I agree with you that Joe Biden's challenge, A, is one he's got to tighten. He's got to get more disciplined. And, B, he's got to - the elections going to be about the future, so he can't just be about the past.

That said, if you look at the vote the Democratic voters who are the ones who are going to decide who's going to be the nominee, they massively support Barack Obama. So my prediction - but, A, my estimation is that's why Joe Biden is leading by a large amount.

And, B, if other candidates continue to push the line that Barack Obama is not enough, they're flying in the face of - you saw Pew Research interviewed all Americans, ""Who was the best President of their lifetime?"" Barack Obama's #1.

CHAFFETZ: Yes. I didn't vote on that poll. Matt - last word for Matt. Last word for Matt.

SCHLAPP: Yes. The reason why Joe Biden - and I found myself rooting for him, Austan. I mean, I think, I agree it's like he could be better than this, I think. But the reason why he's done so well in these polls is really an astounding support from African-American voters.

These are voters that Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and others have not been able to grab. But the question is will he continue to get the support from African-American voters. If he jumps on board like all these candidates have, the idea that we should decriminalize crossings at the border, that we should give free health care to those who come to this country illegally.

And if he keeps this policy that he's had a criminal justice reform that has been punitive in these inner cities with these young kids. And I'd say that's a real question, if you can hold on to the African-American support, I agree, he can still get this nomination. But I think that he's in a perilous course with these radical policies.

CHAFFETZ: Gentlemen, thank you so much. Austan, Matt I appreciate you joining us. Coming up on this special edition of Hannity Rush, Limbaugh weighs in on the human crisis at America's biggest most liberal cities, stay with us.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: For decades these communities have been run exclusively by Democrat politicians and it's been total one party control of the inner cities.

The Democrat record is one of neglect and corruption and decay - total decay. The Democrats have taxed and regulated jobs and opportunity out of these cities and out of existence. They've squeezed the blood out of them.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHAFFETZ: That was President Trump last night highlighting the failures of Democratic leadership in places like Baltimore. And it's not just Baltimore, liberal cities across America are grappling with rising homelessness, violent crime and a full-blown public health crisis.

Listen to Rush Limbaugh talking about the destructive Democratic agenda to Sean last night.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

RUSH LIMBAUGH, HOST, ""THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW"": They look out over this landscape, they see nothing but suffering. They don't see anybody other than in pain, victims of this victims of that. There isn't anything they talk about that involves improving life. They talk about jobs not careers.

They do not offer anybody anything uplifting and they haven't created a group of voters that even thinks uplifting. Their voter group is mired in all kinds of misery, injustice, to the point they're covering up George Washington in murals in San Francisco rather than cleaning the human feces off the streets out there.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHAFFETZ: That's right. Joining me now for reaction is Baltimore activists and GOP strategist Kimberly Klacik; along with the author of the book ""Still Winning"", Fox News Contributor and Washington Times columnist, Charlie Hurt.

Kimberly I want to go to you first. You your heart is dear and near to Baltimore. Since the president has drawn attention, particularly to Baltimore, what's been happening there in Maryland?

KIMBERLY KLACIK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, it looks to me that everyone has started to go to work. First time in a long time Congressman Elijah Cummings tweeted out a picture of him at a senior home in his district. So he's actually getting out there and talking to his constituents. Councilman President Brandon Scott proposed to do more Town Hall meetings and get out there and talk to constituents and go door-to-door.

So I saw today - I was there today and I saw a city dump trucks, I saw the city had their landscapers out there, kind of looking at the place and assessing it and trying to figure out how to start cleaning it up. So Trump, he tweets and a lot of people were upset, but guess what, he tweeted and now they're getting to work. So he should probably tweet more often.

CHAFFETZ: Charlie, as you see this situation unfolding in Baltimore what's your reaction to it?

CHARLES HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the first thing, of course, is - just the sadness how tragic it is for literally for five decades now Democrat politicians have been in charge of places like Baltimore and Detroit, where I lived and worked for a number of years. And it's their policies that are that are on display in live action every single day.

And, of course, they are peddling all kinds of false promises about trying to fix things, about lifting people up, and of course none of it comes to anything. And the net result is this this inhuman squalor, this poverty, this violent crime that nobody in America should have to endure.

Yet it rains in places like Detroit and Baltimore and Democrats just sit back and they think well you know we don't need to worry about these voters, they're never going to go to anybody else. And, of course, Republicans stupidly have ignored the problem as well, largely because they're afraid of getting involved in nasty arguments about this stuff.

But Donald Trump doesn't care. And if people are going to call in racist for calling out the squalor that Elijah Cummings has left in his district, he doesn't care. He cares more about those people. And the fact that it is absolutely inhumane that people live in these kind of conditions in a country as great as America.

CHAFFETZ: Yes. I mean, that's something that Bernie Sanders even called out when he was there. Now Kimberly when you have people highlight the plight of these major inner cities, what often times what you hear is racism, racism, racism.

How somebody who's - I'm not African-American and if I were to talk about it, how - I mean, you can't claim racism every single time we point a problem in one of these cities. How do we deal with that?

KLACIK: No, you can't. But, unfortunately, I got the same thing. And I am African-American. I feel like they have nothing else to say. They have nothing else to point to, because as far as racism you can't prove it or disprove it, right. So they always claim that. But it's not racism at all. I think it's racism when you do nothing about it.

I mean, face it, these constituents, they live in impoverished areas, so they can't donate to the campaign. They don't have an area where it's a tourist attraction. So none of these areas make money for the city, and that's what all these Democrats are about. They're about making money for themselves and it's sad.

CHAFFETZ: No, and if the only solution is more government handouts. And Charlie, one of the things that I think the Republicans have to do are offer real solutions. I applaud Donald Trump for pointing it out, OK. But now that how do we pivot and actually offer solutions in contrast to Democrats.

And I hope the President and the rest of us take the fight to these big cities in compare and contrast democratic solutions, which haven't worked over the last several decades, versus Republican solutions.

HURT: Well, I think, that - obviously, there are free market ideas. There are lot of smart, free market ideas talking about freedom and things like that I think that Republicans do have to offer to people who live in places like Baltimore and nothing of course is more important than talking about education.

But the first step, I think, Jason, is that Republicans have to stick the chest out and just say to heck with it. You can use these calumnies against us and call us racist, but actually we care, and we're going to try to offer our solutions. And just sort of bowl right on through and do their best.

But I do think it's not about racism. For Democrats it's about power. And they need these constituents, these voters, in order for these Democrats to stay in power. And if they lose those people, then the Democrats lose power and I think that's the most important part.

I wish people in Baltimore understood that if they concentrated on this and decided to do something and punish Democrats, they could actually take power away from Democrats. And would be probably be a very smart thing and it might it might kind of wise Democrats up a little bit about this. And they'll stop taking people for granted.

CHAFFETZ: Kimberly and Charlie, we appreciate it. I really do believe you have to talk about policing, you've got to talk about schools and you got to talk about the breakdown of the family.

Because if you don't talk about those three things in a very candid way, you will never ever solve this problem and I hope that discussion continues on America. Thank you both for joining us tonight.

Major breaking news on multiple fronts straight ahead on this ""Justice in America"" special. Eight more Covington kids are filing lawsuits for defamation, good for them. And Trump's big victory for rapper A$AP Rocky, you're going to - want to hear that story. I know you follow A$AP Rocky, don't - you won't admit it in public, but I know you do and you want to hear that story. Stay tuned for it.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

CHAFFETZ: Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity ""Justice in America"". You remember the Covington Catholic students slammed by the left and mainstream media for wearing MAGA hats. Well, they're not finished fighting back yet.

Jonathan Hunt is live from our West Coast newsroom with the latest in that case. Plus more details surrounding American rapper A$AP Rocky, who's been released from Swedish jail with the help of President Trump. Jonathan?

JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Jason, we'll start tonight with the Covington students, eight of them filing this libel lawsuit. They are not named, simply referred to as the quote ""Covington boys""

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HUNT: who were involved in the well-known encounter with Nathan Phillips, a Native American on the mall in Washington DC in January.

Phillips played a drum and sang as Covington student Nicholas Sandmann and his classmates gathered around. The students were criticized by some as being aggressive and described as quote ""MAGA hat wearing teens"".

Among those named in the new lawsuit is having libeled the boys, the comedian and actress Kathy Griffin; Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist, and frequent CNN contributor; Maggie Haberman, a New York Times reporter and a Senator Elizabeth Warren.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HUNT: Last week a similar lawsuit brought by Nicholas Sandmann against the Washington Post for defamation was dismissed by a federal judge.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

In that other news you mentioned, A$AP Rocky has been freed from a Swedish jail and allowed to leave the country, as a judge there considers a verdict in the assault case against the rapper and members of his entourage who were accused of beating 19 year old Mustafa Jafari in a clash in Central Stockholm seen here in video obtained by TMZ.

ASAP Rocky, real name Rakim Mayers, thanked his supporters via Instagram saying it has been a quote ""A very difficult and a humbling experience"".

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HUNT: Among those supporters, President Trump who tweeted ""Get home ASAP A$AP "", very clever. I'm sure the sounds of A$AP forever are booming around the walls of the Oval Office tonight, Jason.

CHAFFETZ: Jonathan, thank you. And it's a A$AP it's not A-S-A-P, I learned just for all of those rapper fans out there. Joining us for more reaction to tonight's top legal stories, attorney and Fox News Contributor, Emily Compagno; and criminal defense attorney, Jonna Spilbor, who both are joining us here in studio. Thanks to both.

I want to talk first about A$AP, because I got to tell you, President Trump put the full weight of the White House behind this. You have Robert O'Brien who's a special emissary there. Who actually is - actually went to Sweden and helped secure his release. But for the President to put all the weight in there and make this happen, Emily, really - it actually worked.

EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right. And I think it's an indication that he's the leader of all of us. It doesn't matter who everyone is voting for. He's still everyone's President.

I want to point out for viewers to small things. Number one, that the response by the Prosecutor General of Sweden, however, was less than, shall we say, negotiating style when he responded essentially, ""Look, no one has the power to influence or even to try not even me. So thanks, but no thanks.""

That being said, the fact that A$AP Rocky has been released prior to his August 14th decision date means that he will likely not serve any jail time even the six months that the prosecutor requested.

CHAFFETZ: And Jonna they do things different in Sweden than they do in the United States.

JONNA SPILBOR, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Yes. They do things much differently. Here these type of case this low-level brawl in the street. People would get slapped on the wrist and go have a drink afterwards. Here A$AP Rocky was locked up for a month and then all of a sudden the judge is like, ""Ah, you can go home now. You can stick a fork in this case, because it's done"".

CHAFFETZ: It is done. All right, let's go to the Covington case, because these kids are not stopping their fight. They're going to take the fight on. How is this different than the other lawsuit that they put in place that was tossed out?

COMPAGNO: Four main differences that the attorneys say. Number one, they're suing individuals, not the institutions. And under Kentucky State law this is an easier case for them to make.

Number two, the individuals that they are suing are high-profile, right. They really had argued a significant impact on that social media frenzy. And the third thing is the fact that these are the group, not individuals on the plaintiffs end. That was something that the judge mentioned in the original case.

Fourth and final thing, unlike the 250 million that the original suit was by Sandmann, these kids here are only suing for the cost of the University of Kentucky tuition, no more than $50,000 each.

CHAFFETZ: Do you think they have a better case now than they did in the first lawsuit?

SPILBOR: I think sometimes you just have to punch back. And this is probably going to be an uphill battle based on its - look, it's the same essential facts as the case that the federal judge dismissed. However, it's no fun getting sued.

So the kids are really sending a message, like, you cannot get away with making these kind of disparaging remarks to satisfy your agenda against the President of United States and use teens to do it. You can't do it. I like the message.

CHAFFETZ: I think it is the right message. Now some people apologize. Like SE Cupp, she apologized right away and said she jumped to conclusion. But these people, they never did apologize and set the record straight.

COMPAGNO: Which was a point that was underlined in this particular suit that they've filed. They said, look, every single one of these refused to retract and they included examples in contrast by those high-profile figures who did, in fact, retract and apologized for the initial statements.

CHAFFETZ: Now with Senator Warren, she hasn't issued any sort of retraction. Do you think a judge is going to look differently on a Member of Congress than they would say a celebrity or a newspaper?

SPILBOR: You know, not really. But I do think a Member of Congress is going to try to use this lawsuit to better her position in the Democratic Party. We'll see. Although, that's what really got her in trouble to begin with, so if she's smart, everybody will retract, everybody will apologize and let these kids live a life.

CHAFFETZ: No, they jump to conclusions. They went after teens without actually knowing the real story and it was so fundamentally wrong. Thank you both for joining us tonight. I really do appreciate it.
