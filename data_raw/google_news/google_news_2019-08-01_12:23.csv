Not a single person on the stage at the CNN debate discussed how he or she might increase the incomes of Americans or how to create jobs. Instead, inspired by the fleeting success of Sen. Kalama Harris of California in the first round of debates, they all came armed to take down frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden.

What a sorry spectacle it was. Poor Biden, tripping over his garbled defense of his 1994 crime bill support, his vote in favor of the Iraq war, his op-ed opposing tax breaks for childcare, and so much more. Biden was attacked by nearly every rival, each one hoping that the next day’s headlines would show that he or she had successfully skewered the former vice president.

DOUG SCHOEN: FIRST DETROIT DEMOCRATIC DEBATE’S KEY WINNERS AND LOSERS (PLUS ONE TERRIBLE TREND)

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio – polling at less than 1 percent – clearly hoped that going after Biden was his ticket to the next round of debates in September (it won’t be). De Blasio attacked Biden for the former vice president’s prior enthusiasm for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade bill and for the large number of deportations of illegal immigrants carried out by the Obama administration.

Harris followed up on her earlier confrontations with Biden by challenging him on his past support of the Hyde Amendment, which outlawed the use of federal funds for most abortions.

But at the end of the debate, de Blasio smugly assured Biden that “we believe in redemption,” as if he had the authority or stature to judge Obama’s veep, or Harris’s demand to know why it took Biden so long to change his opinion on Hyde.

The other candidates didn’t need to beat up on Biden to make him look weak; he did it to himself.

Several times Biden abruptly stopped speaking, presumably in deference to the debate moderators, but more obviously because he was worried he couldn’t successfully complete his thoughts. He frequently fumbled facts, not the least at the end when he projected the dire consequences of “eight more years of Trump.” Someone needs to remind Biden that President Trump cannot serve eight more years.

Biden also came armed with facts and history with which to take on his rivals, going after Harris on her record as California attorney general and needling Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey on his management of Newark when he was the city’s mayor.

But Biden landed only glancing blows, his delivery rumpled.

Here’s where all the candidates agree: President Trump poses an existential threat to the soul of the nation, as Biden put it, and must be evicted from the White House in the 2020 election.

Not everyone joined in the attack on Biden. Businessman Andrew Yang, who astonishingly has earned an average 1.8 percent in the polls, according to RealClear Politics – ahead of Booker and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro – stuck to selling his plan to give every adult American $1,000 per month. He said the payments would combat what he describes as the devastation of automation.

No matter the topic, Yang managed to segue back to his promise of a guaranteed income. He may be a one-trick pony, but his idea is interesting and by comparison to his competitors’ hysteria about the ills of the country, constructive.

Plus, Yang offered up one of the few clever lines of the night, proclaiming himself “the opposite of Donald Trump, an Asian who loves math.”

The night before, progressive democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had battled moderates – including former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota – on issues like “Medicare-for-all” and the Green New Deal.

The Democratic candidates debating Tuesday night were divided on whether their party could beat President Trump by embracing big “bold” new programs that would upend the economy and result in higher taxes. Though it was testy at times, their exchanges were not personal. Also, there was passion.

The second night’s discussion was quite personal, especially when the candidates spent much of their time and effort criticizing their past positions. But as a result, the discussion was mired in the past.

Warren may be a frightening zealot, but she clearly believes in her vision of the future and is willing to fight for it. Harris, Booker, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and other presidential candidates failed to offer a clear and compelling vision of how they would make life better for average Americans.

An exception was Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who says battling climate change should be the nation’s top priority. He is nowhere in the polls, and, despite voters indicating they are worried about global warming, it is unlikely he’ll be in the race much longer. Up until now, most people have not voting been voting based on this issue.

As in the first round of debates, most of the candidates took positions Wednesday that will unnerve moderate Democrats. These include decriminalizing illegal entry into the United States; “taxing the hell out of the wealthy,” as de Blasio put it; dumping private health insurance; and offering free public college tuition.

Someone, soon, is going to add up the costs of all these programs and hang it around the eventual nominee like a yoke, because that is what it will be.

Also unnerving to those Democrats who are keen to take back the White House will be the near-unanimous enthusiasm among presidential hopefuls for impeaching President Trump.

Democratic Party leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York see this impeachment as a losing political proposition. But on the debate stage Castro, Harris, Booker, and de Blasio, among others, pushed to impeach.

Here’s where all the candidates agree: President Trump poses an existential threat to the soul of the nation, as Biden put it, and must be evicted from the White House in the 2020 election.

Because the candidates know that a thriving economy is Trump’s best weapon for reelection, the topic barely came up. There was almost no discussion of the low unemployment rate, record stock prices, accelerating wages for low-income Americans, and the huge recent rise in consumer sentiment.

From the Democrats’ point of view, the less said about the nation’s prosperity and optimism the better.

Mark Mobius: US markets will go 'haywire' if Trump loses 2020 election,https://www.cnbc.com,['Yen Nee Lee'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/mark-mobius-us-markets-will-go-haywire-if-trump-loses-2020-election.html,"Stock markets in the U.S. will go ""haywire"" if President Donald Trump fails to win a second term in the White House, prominent investor Mark Mobius predicted on Thursday.

Mobius, co-founder of Mobius Capital Partners, said U.S. markets have continued to climb higher partly because of Trump's policies. The president made several moves that many considered pro-business since he took office in 2017, such as slashing corporate tax rates.

The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have gone up by more than 30% since the beginning of 2017, while the Nasdaq Composite has risen by around 45%. Such optimism in the stock markets could be disrupted if Trump loses in next year's presidential race, the investor said.

""I think the markets then will go haywire because they've been depending on Trump policies to keep on pushing the market up and also higher growth rate in the U.S.,"" Mobius told CNBC's ""Street Signs.""

He added that for now, ""it doesn't look likely"" that Trump will lose. However, sentiment in the media appeared to be ""overwhelmingly"" against the president — and that could continue to build until the election next year, he explained.

""That's why I'm a little concerned about this,"" he said."
James Comey's next reckoning is imminent — this time for leaking,https://thehill.com,[],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/455616-james-comeys-next-reckoning-is-imminent-this-time-for-leaking,"The Justice Department’s chief watchdog is preparing a damning report on James Comey James Brien ComeyChris Wray's FBI continues to cover for Team Comey's Russia shenanigans Louie Gohmert's exchange with Robert Mueller revealed an uneasy relationship Mueller testimony draws nearly 13 million viewers, less than other high-profile hearings MORE’s conduct in his final days as FBI director that likely will conclude he leaked classified information and showed a lack of candor after his own agency began looking into his feud with President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse Oversight Committee requests documents from CBP Facebook groups Young Turks host says Marianne Williamson proved why she 'deserves' to be on debate stage White House calls trade talks with China 'constructive' MORE over the Russia probe.

Prosecutors found the IG’s findings compelling but decided not to bring charges because they did not believe they had enough evidence of Comey’s intent to violate the law, according to multiple sources.

The concerns stem from the fact that one memo that Comey leaked to a friend specifically to be published by the media — as he admitted in congressional testimony — contained information classified at the lowest level of “confidential,” and that classification was made by the FBI after Comey had transmitted the information, the sources said.

Although a technical violation, the DOJ did not want to “make its first case against the Russia investigators with such thin margins and look petty and vindictive,” a source told me, explaining the DOJ’s rationale.

But Comey and others inside the FBI and the DOJ during his tenure still face legal jeopardy in ongoing probes by the IG and Barr-appointed special prosecutor John DurhamJohn DurhamHouse Republicans claim victory after Mueller hearings Robert Mueller soon may be exposed as the 'magician of omission' on Russia Justice gives Congress new details on 'spying' probe MORE. Those investigations are focused on the origins of the Russia investigation that included a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant targeting the Trump campaign at the end of the 2016 election, the source said.

“There are significant issues emerging with how the FISA was handled and other conduct in the investigation, and everyone involved remains under scrutiny,” a second source said.

Patrick Fitzgerald and Daniel Richman, two of Comey’s lawyers, and Keith Urbahn, his spokesman, did not return repeated calls and emails seeking comment.

The lack of prosecution is certain to demoralize some conservatives, who long have called for Comey’s head. But the IG report, set to be released within the next few weeks, likely will provide significant condemnations of Comey’s conduct, sources tell me.

While they cautioned that the IG’s final report won’t be complete until it gets feedback from Comey’s lawyers in the next few days, it is expected to conclude that the former FBI director improperly took with him memos that were FBI property when he was fired, transmitted classified information via an insecure email account, and shared some of the memos with his private lawyers. Some of the Comey memos were classified up to the “secret” level, but the FBI has not disclosed whether those were shared with his lawyers like the classified confidential memo was.

The memos, which mostly recount Comey’s interactions with Trump in the Russia case and include information about foreign leaders, were sensitive enough to require government officials to send a professional “scrub team” to a Comey lawyer’s office to ensure all classified information was deleted, sources previously told me.

In addition, the IG is likely to find that Comey engaged in a lack of candor when FBI agents came to retrieve the classified memos in his possession, failing to tell the interviewing agent that he had forwarded some of the sensitive memos by email, according to sources familiar with the probe.

Documents released Thursday by the FBI to the conservative group Judicial Watch support that conclusion, showing the FBI report on its meeting with Comey at his home to recover the memos made no mention that the ex-director had forwarded the memos on to others.

The revelations are likely to dent Comey’s carefully manicured image as a law-and-order FBI director who was fired for standing up to Trump.

The IG concluded in prior investigations that Comey’s firing was not driven by Trump’s fears about the Russia investigation ruining his presidency but, rather, by DOJ concerns about Comey’s performance in the Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonHours after Trump retweet, Twitter account suspended The real reason Democrats defend Baltimore Trump pick Scalia becomes 2020 target for labor unions MORE email probe. Horowitz concluded that Comey wrongly “usurped” the authority of the attorney general when, on July 5, 2016, he announced he would not seek criminal charges against Clinton for transmitting classified information — some of it top secret — on her insecure private email server.

That IG report also chided Comey for criticizing Clinton’s email practices as reckless without filing charges and for improperly announcing the reopening of the email probe in late October 2016, just a few weeks before Election Day when Clinton and Trump were locked in a tight race.

Ironically, Comey’s decision not to charge Clinton for violating the Espionage Act for mishandling classified information on her email server mirrors the same rationale that Barr’s DOJ applied in declining prosecution of him: a lack of evidence of intent.

That won’t be lost on conservatives, who almost certainly will dislike the DOJ’s Comey decision.

But the IG report, at least, reaffirms what has become painfully clear to Americans the past two years: Comey entered the FBI chief’s job with a reputation for excellence but ran a bureau that suffered from ineptitude, political shenanigans, leaking and significant human failings, all of which sharply contrast with the morality lectures he’s become famous for frequently offering since he was fired.

The US military spent $33 million on tech known to be vulnerable to Chinese cyberespionage,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1679475/dod-spent-30m-on-china-hackable-tech-from-lenovo-gopro-others/,"The US Department of Defense (DoD) purchased and used millions of dollars worth of electronics last year containing “known cybersecurity vulnerabilities” that make them particularly susceptible to Chinese government espionage. The findings are included in a recent audit (pdf) by the Pentagon’s Inspector General (IG) for DoD cyberspace operations, which warns that “missions critical to national security could be compromised” if the military does not take swift action.

Some models or brands of so-called COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) technology can allow adversaries access to communications infrastructure, command and control systems, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance networks, says the partially redacted IG report.

To that end, at least $32.8 million in COTS purchases made by the US Army and Air Force during the 2018 fiscal year were singled out for concern. The products include software, cameras, and networking equipment red-flagged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate, as well as computers that have been banned for use by State Department employees since 2006.

Repelling cyberattacks has become an increasingly worrisome problem for the military since the DoD was hit with its first significant cyberattack from China in 2003. Last year, the Chinese government hacked into a US Navy contractor’s computer network, gaining access to highly sensitive secrets about a classified undersea missile program. Also last year, a breach of DoD travel records exposed the personal information and credit card data of tens of thousands of servicemembers and civilians, although that has not been explicitly linked to Beijing, which reportedly maintains a cyberespionage force with nearly 200,000 members (pdf) spanning both the military and private sectors. What’s more, a report issued last October by the Government Accountability Office found “mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in nearly all weapon systems” developed by the US military between 2012 and 2017.

“The Chinese have already broken into my stuff,” Army acquisitions official Lt. Gen. Paul Ostrowski told attendees at an event earlier this month. “The personnel system has been broken into. This is something that has risen to the top of the concern list. Not only within the Army, but within [the Office of the Secretary of Defense].”

Unheeded warnings

As much as 80% of the DoD’s systems are off-the-shelf items, or contain components that are commercially available, says the new IG report. Yet, there is no “approved products list to prevent unsecure items from being purchased.”

In one example highlighted by the IG, the Pentagon continued to buy and use video surveillance systems manufactured by two Chinese companies, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology and Dahua Technology, for at least 16 months after the state department warned against it due to cyberespionage concerns. The DoD didn’t stop until August 2018, when Congress officially banned the federal government from doing business with the two firms.

The current items singled out as problematic by the IG include such household names as Lenovo computers, Lexmark printers, and GoPro cameras.

Lenovo

In 2006, the report notes, the State Department banned Lenovo products from its classified networks after reports that the company’s computers were being manufactured with hidden spyware and backdoors. In 2015, the DHS issued a warning about cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Lenovo devices, and in 2016 the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate warned that Lenovo hardware posed a cyberespionage risk to both classified and unclassified networks and had the potential to compromise the entire DoD supply chain.

Still, the Army purchased 195 Lenovo products last year, for around $268,000, while the Air Force acquired 1,378 Lenovo products for $1.9 million.

Plenty of warnings about Lenovo products.

Lexmark

Last year, the Army and Air Force bought more than 8,000 Lexmark printers for about $30 million. The company is owned by a consortium of Chinese firms, and has links to the country’s military, nuclear, and cyberespionage programs, points out the IG report. A US government vulnerabilities database lists 20 known cybersecurity concerns pertaining to Lexmark, such as “storing and transmitting sensitive network access credentials in plain text and allowing the execution of malicious code on the printer,” which the IG says “could allow remote attackers to use a connected Lexmark printer to conduct cyberespionage or launch a denial of service attack on a DoD network.”

GoPro

The Army and Air Force also purchased 117 GoPro cameras last year, costing $98,000. The built-in wireless and Bluetooth capabilities, which let users share video in real-time, “have vulnerabilities that could allow a remote attacker access to the stored network credentials and live video streams,” says the report. “By exploiting these vulnerabilities, a malicious actor could view the video stream, start recording, or take pictures without the user’s knowledge.”

The DoD’s response to the IG report is almost entirely redacted.

A heavily redacted response.

Next steps?

The DoD must start to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks posed by off-the-shelf technology before it is put into use, cautions the IG. However, the report points out that current DoD policy only mitigates cybersecurity risks “after purchase.”

“Despite DoD policies and the numerous organizations performing cybersecurity testing and analysis,” says the audit, “there appears to be no organization assessing the risks for COTS items DoD-wide, identifying high-risk items for further testing, or actively recommending prohibition of these high-risk items when necessary.”

It’s a serious enough problem that the IG believes a legislative fix might be the only answer.

In the meantime, says the report, “We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct an organization or group to develop a risk-based approach to prioritize COTS items for further evaluation, a process to test high-risk COTS items, and a process to prohibit the purchase and use of high-risk COTS items, when necessary, until mitigation strategies can limit the risk to an acceptable level.”"
Democrats agree to September legal arguments in effort to access secret Mueller evidence,https://www.politico.com,['Kyle Cheney'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/31/democrats-secret-mueller-evidence-1442700,"Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee say accessing Robert Mueller’s files is necessary to determine whether they will ultimately recommend articles of impeachment against the president. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO legal Democrats agree to September legal arguments in effort to access secret Mueller evidence

House Democrats weighing the impeachment of President Donald Trump have agreed to a two-month schedule of court filings with the Justice Department in an effort to obtain special counsel Robert Mueller’s grand jury material.

Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, who say accessing Mueller’s files is necessary to determine whether they will ultimately recommend articles of impeachment against Trump, agreed to the timetable, which would likely result in an October ruling. Though that’s a reasonable pace for legal argumentation, it’s sure to frustrate Democrats agitating for Trump’s impeachment, who have argued that the closer their effort gets to presidential primary season, the more impractical it becomes.

Story Continued Below

There were indications Wednesday that the Justice Department intends to oppose the Judiciary Committee’s effort to get the grand jury information. Though Democrats had pleaded with Attorney General William Barr to support their effort to access Mueller’s material, a lawyer for the Justice Department described herself as “counsel for Defendant” in a notice to the judge. A second department lawyer in the matter simply described herself as “counsel for the department.”

Under the schedule, jointly proposed by the committee and Justice Department, department lawyers would file their first brief in the matter by Sept. 13 and the Judiciary Committee would reply by Sept. 30. Justice Department officials said they expected no oral argument would be necessary in the case, but it’s up to the judge — Chief U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia Judge Beryl Howell — to decide. Howell on Wednesday agreed to the briefing schedule proposed by the committee and the department.

Democrats have not voted to formally open an impeachment inquiry against Trump but argued in their effort to obtain Mueller’s grand jury material that they don’t need to take a vote to declare an “impeachment investigation.” It was a rhetorical escalation that Republicans rejected as political theater. But it’s a distinction that Democrats made forcefully in their legal filing, suggesting that there are no formal procedures to determine when and whether the House is considered to be in an active “impeachment inquiry.”

In their filing, Judiciary Committee Democrats indicated that they intend to rely on Mueller’s grand jury material to inform their questioning of crucial witnesses in his investigation — including former White House counsel Don McGahn, who provided damaging testimony to Mueller, describing potential obstruction of justice by Trump. The committee has indicated that it intends to file a lawsuit to enforce a subpoena for McGahn’s testimony this week but has so far held off while last-minute talks continue."

Richard Neal: Why the House needs Trump’s tax returns,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Richard Neal', 'July At Pm']",07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-my-committee-needs-the-presidents-tax-returns/2019/07/31/05d4505a-b3c8-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html,"Richard E. Neal, a Democrat, represents Massachusetts’s 1st Congressional District in the House and is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

For three decades, the House of Representatives and its Ways and Means Committee have been the site of my life’s work. I never aspired to be a senator or governor or president.

Instead, I learned arcane House rules and sought a position on the Ways and Means Committee because of its tremendous potential to help my district. I have listened to my constituents on matters such as taxes, health care, international trade and Social Security, which are within the committee’s purview. Untold hours have gone into developing legislation and trying to improve, pass or defeat countless bills. That’s the job.

I’d rather hold a roundtable in Pittsfield, Mass., or cross-examine Medicare administrators than pick fights on cable news. Those arguments tend to drive people into their corners, shrinking opportunities to accomplish real results.

I’m an institutionalist. I respect Congress, for all its imperfections. As chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, I am responsible for congressional oversight of the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service’s administration of the federal tax code. The tax code gives the committee chairman the power to request taxpayer information from the IRS. The committee has exercised this power at various times in the past and has never been denied by the IRS or the Treasury Department.

In early April, I requested the president’s tax returns to fulfill a legitimate congressional oversight responsibility: Our voluntary tax-compliance system hinges on the public’s faith that our tax laws are administered fairly and without favor to those in power. The president is unique: No other American has the power to sign bills into law and direct an entire branch of government. That power, and the extent to which the IRS can audit and enforce federal tax laws against a current or future president, merits closer legislative scrutiny.

The IRS has a policy of performing mandatory audits on all sitting presidents and vice presidents. But neither Congress nor the public knows anything about the scope of those audits and whether the president can exert undue influence on the IRS to affect his or her tax treatment. If, for example, the president is already under audit at the time he or she takes office, what happens to that audit? We don’t know.

My committee will consider legislation regarding the mandatory audit program to ensure these audits are conducted fairly and without undue influence from the commander in chief. And, as part of our deliberations, we must review his tax information to better understand the audit program and propose any needed changes.

The law on this is very clear: The IRS “shall furnish ” the Ways and Means Committee with the requested tax returns. Both Democrats and Republicans have made requests for taxpayer information under 6103(f)(1) of the U.S. tax code in the past. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress is entitled to a presumption that its investigatory activities are legitimate, and, in this case, the legitimacy is self-evident. And yet, the administration has stonewalled Congress, ordering the IRS commissioner not to comply with the plain language of the law and setting up a pending legal clash.

I did not pick this fight, but I will not shirk it because it’s about something much bigger than tax forms. This is not an exercise in political retribution: I am not willing to trade the reputation of the Ways and Means Committee for cheap political gains.

The committee is a venerable part of U.S. history, having given the nation Social Security, Medicare, the entire tax code, all of our trade agreements, and numerous programs serving children and families. This committee financed America’s role in both world wars, and its antecedent paid for the Lewis and Clark expedition. I have no intention of squandering my chairmanship of this distinguished panel on petty or malevolent efforts to embarrass the current president.

But in this country, we take seriously the Magna Carta’s precept of the rule of law, not the law of rulers. I will fight with everything I have to reassert Congress’s constitutional mandate to serve as an equal branch of government. This country has thrived through the centuries because we have durable political institutions with a robust system of checks and balances.

Our political institutions won’t continue to function unless we guard them vigilantly, and my colleagues and I in the House majority are committed to doing so. It is the root of our oath to uphold the law."
EPA proposal scraps limits on coal plant waste,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455386-epa-proposal-scraps-limits-on-coal-plant-waste,"The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed scrapping restrictions on arsenic-laden waste from coal-fired power plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed lifting some regulations on coal ash, the residue left after burning coal, which is filled with hazardous substances that can leach into the water supply and cause health problems.

ADVERTISEMENT

“I can say without hesitation that this is an extremely dangerous proposal that will do lasting harm to communities near coal ash reuse sites and coal ash waste piles,” said Lisa Evans, senior counsel with Earthjustice.

Coal ash is used in a variety of ways, largely as a replacement for soil. It can be used to create level ground for construction projects or sprinkled over landfills as a protective cover.

But coal ash has been deemed responsible for contaminating water with arsenic, which is linked with some types of cancer.

The latest proposal from the EPA would eliminate restrictions from 2015 that limited coal ash use to 12,400 tons per site.

The Trump administration proposal would allow projects to use as much coal ash as they want but would have to file a demonstration that shows the project won’t cause harm if it’s close to certain features like groundwater or wetlands.

But Evans said that’s not a realistic safeguard.

“That demonstration doesn’t have to be defended to any regulatory agency or be posted for public notice or be written by any engineer or environmental professional,” Evans said. “You’ve got a fairly meaningless demo having to be created.”

The EPA said the regulations would help spur “beneficial use” — the term for new uses for what would otherwise be industry waste.

“Today the Agency is proposing sensible changes that will improve the coal ash regulations and continue to encourage appropriate beneficial use,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerEPA proposal scraps limits on coal plant waste Judge cuts Roundup cancer case payout from billion to million Automakers rebuff Trump, strike fuel efficiency deal with California MORE said in a statement. “These proposed changes will further responsible management of coal ash while protecting human health and the environment.”

The proposal includes some features that would make reporting requirements more accessible to the public, but environmentalists ultimately see the move as a bow to industry.

“Despite compelling and damning scientific evidence highlighting the harm to groundwater from coal ash, and court victories by community groups requiring the EPA to strengthen the 2015 rule, Wheeler is giving this gift to his former employers at the cost of public health,” Earthjustice and the Sierra Club said in a statement. “It is a disgrace to everything the EPA stands for, and we will do everything in our power to stop it.”"

The Interior Department inspector general wrote to members of Congress that it is now working with federal prosecutors.

""In consultation with DOJ and to avoid any interference with the criminal case, we have decided to combine the investigations,"" read the letter from acting inspector general Gail Ennis.

It said the Justice Department probe began ""last year,"" around the time when two senior Democratic lawmakers, Reps. Raul Grijalva and Elijah Cummings, requested information from the inspector general on ""many instances in which Secretary Zinke sent and received emails containing official business using his personal email account.""

In October, CNN reported that the Justice Department was investigating whether Zinke used his position for private gain.

DHS issues hacking security alert for small planes,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kris Van Cleave'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-issues-hacking-security-alert-small-planes-today-2019-07-30/,"Washington — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rare security alert Tuesday for small planes. The alert warns if a hacker gained physical access to certain small planes, they could attach a common device to its wiring. This could provide false flight data including altitude and airspeed, as well as possible access to the autopilot system, potentially leaving a pilot unable to tell whether the reading was accurate and potentially lose control of the aircraft.

""We could do basically anything the plane can do, pretty much anything the pilot could do by himself,"" said Tod Beardsley, director of research at cyber security firm Rapid7.

In a laboratory setting, researchers at Rapid7 were able to hack what's essentially a plane's electronic central nervous system, allowing them to send the erroneous commands. ""I do think it is something of a wake up call. This is something that needs to be taken seriously now rather than later, like after the disaster,"" Beardsley said.

Last year, Homeland Security researchers, who successfully hacked a 757 while it was parked, warned it's only ""a matter of time before a cybersecurity breach on an airline occurs."" DHS is now urging small plane makers to study the cyber security protections car makers added after hackers were able to exploit similar technology on the roads.

The Federal Aviation Administration tells CBS News a ""scenario that involves unrestricted physical access is unlikely"" but these findings are ""an important reminder to remain vigilant."" Rapid7 said it notified the company that built those two systems, but their findings prompted DHS to urge pilots to secure their aircraft and for manufacturers to take a look at options to better secure these systems."
Trump EPA yanks Obama-era proposal to restrict mine development in salmon-rich Bristol Bay region,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/trump-administration-scuttles-epa-proposal-to-restrict-alaska-mine-development-in-bristol-bay-region/,"The Environmental Protection Agency scuttled proposed development restrictions Tuesday on an open-pit mine in the headwaters of Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, which sustains the largest sockeye salmon runs in the world.

The move by Chris Hladick, the EPA’s Seattle-based regional administrator, is part of a broader Trump administration push to proceed with a permitting review for the Pebble Mine, a world-class deposit of gold, molybdenum and copper that — due to its sensitive location — is among the most contested mineral-development projects in Alaska history.

The proposed restrictions date to the Obama administration, and would have sharply limited the amount of wetlands and salmon streams that could have been damaged by disposal of mine wastes. The developer’s CEO — Tom Collier of Pebble Partnership — hailed the EPA action Tuesday as removing a “cloud of uncertainty” by reversing “outrageous federal government overreach.”

“The restrictions would have precluded any meaningful mineral development in the region — period,” said Collier, who credited Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy with encouraging the EPA to abandon the proposal.

The Army Corps of Engineers is now undertaking a permitting review scheduled to be completed next year. State permitting would take another few years, which could enable the mine to begin producing ore by 2026, according to Collier.

The EPA action brought a bitter response from a wide-ranging coalition of passionate opponents that includes commercial fishermen from Washington and elsewhere that join in the summer sockeye harvests, sport anglers, seafood processors, recreation companies, Native groups and environmentalists.

“This comes as we are wrapping up the second largest-recorded salmon harvest in Bristol Bay of 42 million salmon and counting, to feed not only our people but the world. Our people will continue to do whatever it takes to stop this mine,” said Alannah Hurley, executive director of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay.

Pebble was first proposed more than a decade ago, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, a longtime critic of the mine, on Tuesday accused the EPA of a “reckless action” that would threaten the Bristol Bay watershed and the fisheries and maritime economy it supports.

During the Obama administration, the EPA undertook a major review of the mine’s environmental impacts in response to a 2011 request from six Bristol Bay tribes. In 2014, the Seattle regional office used the authority vested by the Clean Water Act to propose tight restrictions that included a cap of 1,100 acres of wetlands, lakes and ponds that could be lost to development and the loss of no more than 5 miles of streams used by salmon or other seagoing fish.

“In simple terms, the infrastructure necessary to mine the Pebble deposit jeopardizes the long-term health and sustainability of the Bristol Bay ecosystem,” said the 2014 document released by the EPA’s Seattle regional office.

Northern Dynasty, the Canadian company that owns Pebble Partnership, contested the EPA’s 2014 finding in a lawsuit settled during the first year of the Trump administration, and allowed the project to proceed with federal permitting. The EPA action Tuesday rescinds the 2014 findings, which Dennis McLerran, who served as the agency’s Seattle-based regional administrator during the Obama administration, said were based on the best available science.

“What is happening now is the decision-making process is being politicized and removed from the science,” McLerran said in a Tuesday interview.

The permits likely will face legal challenges.

“I think litigation is inevitable,” said Taryn Kiekow Heimer, a senior advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposes the Pebble Mine."
Treasury yields rise after Fed dampens hopes of more rate cuts,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/us-treasury-yields-higher-after-fed-dampens-hopes-of-more-rate-cuts.html,"U.S. government debt yields rose Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in the prior session that the central bank's quarter-point cut to interest rates wasn't necessarily the beginning of a longer cycle of easier monetary policy.

Markets whipsawed amid Powell's comments as investors, who'd already factored in the 25-basis-point cut into their models, punished riskier assets after realizing that the Fed would not guarantee additional cuts before the end of 2019.

""We're thinking of it essentially as a midcycle adjustment to policy,"" Powell said following the release of the Fed's decision. ""What I said was it's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts. I didn't say it's just one or anything like that.""

""When you think about rate-cutting cycles, they go on for a long time and the committee's not seeing that,"" he added.

At around 7:29 a.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was higher at around 2.044%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also higher at around 2.542. The 2-year Treasury note yield, more representative of changes to Fed policy, held higher at 1.896%; the rate peaked around 1.96% on Wednesday.

Powell's ""press conference was not as smooth as I know they can be,"" said Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management. ""He clarified that this wasn't the beginning of a long easing cycle and that threw some reality into the market.""

Going forward, ""I think they're also going to be cognizant of global trade tensions, which was sort of the ignition of market's expectations of rate cuts,"" Pollack added. ""[Trade policy's] certainly out of their hands, but the think the Fed allowed the market to push them into these easing expectations.""

Still, the Fed's interest rate cut was the first in more than a decade, with central bank citing ""global developments"" along with ""muted inflation"" as reasons for easing. The federal funds rate target range is now 2%–2.25%.

On the data front, the latest weekly jobless claims will be released at around 8:30 a.m. ET.

The closely-watched ISM manufacturing index for July, manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for July, construction spending figures for June and the latest reading of light vehicle sales will follow later in the session."
Ratcliffe questioned intelligence community's role in Russia investigation,https://www.cnn.com,['Jeremy Herb'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/politics/ratcliffe-investigating-fbi-doj/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick to be the next director of national intelligence, which has oversight over the CIA, has pushed for the Justice Department to investigate what role the agency and the broader intelligence community played in starting the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's team and Russia.

The comments from Rep. John Ratcliffe in television appearances and closed-door interviews with Obama administration officials questioning the US intelligence community's actions during the Russia investigation show how the Texas Republican aligns with the President's skepticism of the entire Russia probe, which ultimately became special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

Ratcliffe was one of the key Republicans leading the GOP-run congressional investigation into the FBI and Justice Department's handling of the Hillary Clinton email and Trump-Russia investigations last year. Ratcliffe had a central role in interrogating FBI and Justice Department officials on how the investigation began, and it helped Ratcliffe get on the radar of the President, who often seized on developments in the congressional investigation and twice this year tweeted about Ratcliffe's Fox News interviews.

A CNN review of the Republican-led interview transcripts from their FBI investigation, as well as dozens of Ratcliffe's Fox News appearances of the past year, reveal his deep skepticism of not just the FBI and Justice Department actions in 2016, but also of the intelligence community he would lead if confirmed to succeed Dan Coats as director of national intelligence.

Ratcliffe's worldview that emerged from his role in investigating the Russia investigation will now be thoroughly examined as he heads into the confirmation process to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, particularly from Democrats who are criticizing his selection as overtly political.

While Ratcliffe didn't call for Mueller's removal or use inflammatory language like Trump -- he never called it a ""witch hunt"" or ""a hoax,"" for instance -- Ratcliffe questioned the actions of the former special counsel, argued that the beginning of the investigation had tainted his findings and accused Obama officials of potentially committing crimes. The Texas Republican criticized both President Barack Obama's CIA Director John Brennan and DNI John Clapper, his potential predecessor.

""Think about that, a dossier funded by the Democrats, peddled through the Obama intelligence community, falsely verified by the Obama Justice Department, then sold to the American people by those very same elected Democrats and willing folks in the media,"" Ratcliffe said in a March 24 interview with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo, the morning before Attorney General William Barr released his letter summarizing Mueller's findings

Trump signaled Tuesday that he expects Ratcliffe to clean house, telling reporters that he had picked Ratcliffe in order to ""rein in"" the intelligence agencies.

""I think we need somebody like that that's strong and can really rein it in,"" Trump said. ""As you've all learned, the intelligence agencies have run amok. They've run amok.""

Democrats say they will mount a fight against Ratcliffe's confirmation, and moderate Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia are voicing their opposition to the three-term Republican. ""Anyone in the intelligence (community) should not be political at all. You have to get to the most non-political, non-partisan person you can find,"" Manchin said Tuesday. ""Why bring in someone who is so toxic?""

While many Senate Republicans have said they want more information before making a judgment on Ratcliffe, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr has signaled he will back Ratcliffe's nomination, praising his experience as a US attorney and serving on the Intelligence and Homeland Security committees.

Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, who says his committee will also investigate the origins of the Russia investigation, said the intelligence community's role was a legitimate area for the Justice Department to probe.

""I think they should look at the FISA warrant. I think there's a lot of potential abuse,"" Graham said. ""I think Ratcliffe's got a worldview that I share, that he believes in a strong military, in engaging our enemies, in leading from the front not behind, so I'm OK with him.""

Ratcliffe's defenders argue he will win over his skeptics.

""I'm going to be really surprised at how many of his Democrat House colleagues that actually know him ... I'll be surprised they toe this line that he's some subjective loyalist incapable of putting his country ahead of his politics because anyone he knows him knows it's a damn lie,"" said former House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican.

Questions about the CIA

In recent weeks, Ratcliffe has endorsed Barr's investigation into the origins of the FBI's Russia probe, one in which the President has granted Barr declassification power and has instructed the intelligence community to cooperate.

""As he said, there was spying. The Obama Justice Department and intelligence community did spy on the Trump campaign. The question now that needs to be answered is, was there a predicate for that?"" Ratcliffe told Bartiromo in an April interview. ""This is why the focus needs to shift now to those folks in the intelligence community and at the Justice Department that made representations that there was probable cause, that there was evidence of collusion, when, in fact, the special counsel has found that there was none.""

Ratcliffe himself has raised questions about the role of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos -- who was interviewed by the committees in October -- in launching the Russia investigation in July 2016, which began when Australian diplomat Alexander Downer reported his conversation with Papadopoulos about Russian dirt to the FBI.

But Ratcliffe and other Republicans have raised questions about Papadopoulos and what role the CIA may have played in Downer's interactions with him.

""There's been so much focus on the FBI and the Department of Justice. But a lot of the questions that relate to the origins of this go to the CIA,"" Ratcliffe told Fox News' Martha MacCallum in June. ""It was Alexander Downer who was John Brennan's CIA counterpart at one point in time for Australia that supposedly had this random conversation with George Papadopoulos that served as the predicate.""

Investigating the Russia investigation

Gowdy helped elevate Ratcliffe into his role on the GOP-led investigation that was chaired by Gowdy and then-Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte. A handful of lawmakers were part of a task force Gowdy and Goodlatte created that took the lead on questioning witnesses, which included Ratcliffe and close Trump ally Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina.

In the role, Ratcliffe questioned multiple witnesses who appeared behind closed doors before the committee in 2018, including former FBI Director James Comey, Papadopoulos and Peter Strzok and Lisa Page , the FBI officials who exchanged anti-Trump text messages that have fueled accusations that Mueller's probe was inherently biased.

""We have learned in the course of this investigation of incredible manifest bias from people like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page,"" Ratcliffe said in one contentious exchange with Comey. ""I'm trying to determine the level of bias, if any, that Director Comey had with respect to President-elect or President Trump and why he would have violated his employment agreement to share information, classified or unclassified, with individuals who were not authorized to receive it.""

When Strzok appeared before the panels in June 2018, Ratcliffe pushed him on whether Mueller's team had asked if the texts reflected bias, a point that Republicans hammered home when he appeared publicly the following month.

""So did Special Counsel Mueller or anyone with the special counsel investigative team make any inquiry as to whether or not any bias or prejudice reflected in that text that I just referred to impacted any actions or decisions or the manner in which the evidence you gathered, that information was affected?"" Ratcliffe asked.

""So, if you're asking whether or not any -- if any of my personal beliefs ever influenced any official action, the answer to that is never,"" Strzok responded.

""I'm not asking that question,"" Ratcliffe responded. ""I'm asking you whether the special counsel or anyone with the special counsel's investigative team made inquiry to you, whether or not any bias or prejudice that would be reflected in the text 'F Trump' impacted any actions that you took, any decisions you made, any information or evidence that you gathered?""

Ratcliffe was pitched for attorney general

Ratcliffe's sharp questioning of Mueller last week may have put the Texas Republican over the edge to become Trump's choice for the director of national intelligence, but Ratcliffe was a known commodity at the White House well before the special counsel probe concluded.

Gowdy, who considers Ratcliffe a close friend and has stayed in touch after leaving Congress, helped get the Texas Republican on Trump's radar last year for a different administration job: attorney general.

Gowdy said in an interview that he tried to set up a meeting with Trump to pitch Ratcliffe for the role after Jeff Sessions was fired in November 2018, but the meeting was delayed and Barr had already been selected.

Trump still met with Gowdy, which was Gowdy's first direct interaction with the President, giving him the chance to talk up Ratcliffe as a great candidate, Gowdy said.

Gowdy wasn't the only one pitching Ratcliffe. He was also floated by Fox News' Gregg Jarrett and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz on Fox News' ""Hannity"" the day that Sessions was ousted.

""By the way, I agree with Gregg, I hope that President Trump appoints John Ratcliffe, I think he is best person to do that,"" Chaffetz said.

A Fox News regular

Ratcliffe's role on the GOP-led investigation into the FBI and Justice Department made him a Fox News regular over the past two years.

In his interviews, Ratcliffe accused the Obama administration FBI and Justice Department of abusing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act when it obtained a warrant on former Trump adviser Carter Page . He supported the release of the classified memo from then-House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes and joined the Republican calls for a second special counsel.

Ratcliffe charged the anti-Trump texts sent by Strzok, who was removed from Mueller's team over the messages, had poisoned the evidence that the special counsel might collect.

""I like the policy of extending clearances to former intelligence and law enforcement officials for the purpose of being able to provide advice and counsel to their successors, successive administrations, including the President,"" Ratcliffe told Bartiromo in August 2018. ""I agree with the privilege. I also agree with revoking the privilege when it's been abused. So, in John Brennan's case, I think it's appropriate.""

Since the special counsel's report was released, Ratcliffe has criticized House Democrats for continuing to claim evidence of collusion when Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy. But Ratcliffe was prescient nearly a year ago over the current political battle playing out in Congress -- an environment he would leave should he be confirmed as director of national intelligence.

""At the end of the day, where we are headed here is no charges for collusion or obstruction with anyone associated with the Trump campaign,"" he told Bartiromo on October 14, 2018. ""But a report from Bob Mueller outlining perhaps some questionable conduct, and we will be left arguing with our Democratic colleagues whether that rises to an impeachable offense, even if it's not criminal in nature."""
Border Patrol tried to fire him for lying about gun incident. Now he's Trump’s DHS spokesman,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-tried-to-fire-him-for-making-stuff-up-now-he-is-the-dhs-spokesman,"The top Homeland Security spokesman, brought in to serve last month by acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, is a former Border Patrol agent whom U.S. Customs and Border Protection once attempted to fire for faking a crime against himself, according to three CBP officials with first-hand knowledge of the incident and a fourth who is also aware of it.

DHS acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Media Operations Jose “Lu” Maheda was terminated by Border Patrol a year into his service during the 1990s. Since then, as one official put it, he has “failed up,” getting his job back and eventually becoming a regional Border Patrol spokesman. And now he is the top spokesman for the 240,000-person department because of his connection to McAleenan.

“The guy’s a proven liar and can’t testify in court and yet he’s a spokesman for DHS,” charged one CBP official who worked with Maheda at the time of the incident. “He is 100% a McAleenan sycophant.”

Under the 1972 Giglio v. United States decision, a witness whose integrity has been called into question cannot testify in court.

While working at the Border Patrol station in Nogales, Arizona during his first year on the job in 1996, Maheda left his loaded gun on the front seat of his work vehicle and set out on foot.

“While he was out — and unbeknownst to him — a supervisor came across the car and saw the” firearm, the official said. “He [Maheda] had failed to secure it, and it was just laying there, and that’s when the supervisor saw it and was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve got to get this out of here.’ So the supervisor pulled the gun out. When Lu got back to the vehicle, he saw the shotgun was missing and didn’t realize the supervisor had taken it. So what he did was, he bust the window out, then went back and reported the shotgun stolen.”

A second official who worked with Maheda at the time confirmed the set of events, as did a third.

“He had a longarm go missing from his Border Patrol four-wheel drive so he busted the window out and made a notification that it was stolen, when it was in fact that an agent had just played a joke on him when he left his door unlocked,” said the third person, who also worked in Tucson at the time.

“There was no squirming out of that one. They had him dead to right,” the first official said.

Another source, a union official with secondhand knowledge of the incident, said the supervisor took the gun out of the vehicle to “safeguard” it, not as a joke. Maheda “broke the window and reported it was stolen,” he said.

While DHS does not comment on specific employee personnel actions, a DHS official provided the following information.

""Over 20 years ago, we can confirm that there was an allegation and subsequent full investigation,"" the official said. ""The employee was afforded due process and since then, the employee has had an exemplary record being promoted throughout the ranks without ill effect.""

Maheda was served termination paperwork a day after the incident. He fought the termination with the help of the National Border Patrol Council and kept his job on what the union official described as a “technicality” because he was issued a termination notice on the last day of routine year-long probation period.

The third official with first-hand knowledge of the incident said the move to provide him the termination paperwork the day after may have been intentional because it gave him a way to fight the decision, since the letter should have been served immediately.

“There were all these rumors that his brother, who was a BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit) agent that was very well thought of — that somebody may have been looking out for the family with that clerical mistake,” the official said.

At the time, Border Patrol agents in their first year could be fired for any reason without being able to appeal the decision or respond to the chief patrol agent’s concerns. A union representative at the time “argued that he was technically no longer on probation because his regular shift had ended before they fired him” and therefore the probation period was technically up, and was able to get an arbitrator to agree, according to the first CBP official. Maheda was reinstated and went to work for the union.

At a certain point in his career at DHS, Maheda began to have ""direct interface"" with McAleenan, who would eventually promote him to his current position.

The third official said Maheda was reprimanded during his work for the internal Border Patrol headquarters division during the 2000s for having “abused travel all over the country basically to install flat screen TVs.”

“He got transferred out of that branch during a bottom-up review that was done by the Border Patrol headquarters staff, led by then Operations Chief Kevin Oaks,” said this source said.

""The United States Border Patrol often conducts reviews and assessments of programs and personnel assignments. During Chief Kevin Oaks’ tenure, the United States Border Patrol restructured several programs and divisions within the Headquarters element, resulting reassignments of multiple personnel and program responsibilities,"" the DHS official said.

The first official described Maheda's promotions as ""one of those things you just keep scratching your head"" over.

“The Department is proud to include a member of the United States Border Patrol within the Department’s Office of Public Affairs,"" said Andrew Meehan, Acting Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. ""Border Patrol agents have a unique and first-hand knowledge of the impact of the crisis on the southern border and continue to provide thoughtful guidance on how to communicate those challenges to the public.”"

(CNN) In another time, the President of the United States might have called an urgent press conference on Monday morning -- making sure he could command the world's attention -- and issued a stern warning that violent repression of peaceful protesters is intolerable.

After all, what we saw this weekend in Moscow and Hong Kong were alarming signs that a wave of more brutal repression is looming. The regimes in Moscow and Beijing have sent notice that they are about to crush peaceful, popular movements. This should alarm the US president and produce an urgent response.

Instead, President Donald Trump woke up Monday morning prepared to stoke racist sentiment across the United States, tweeting a new barrage of inflammatory messages against prominent African American figures in what has become a familiar pattern : racist tweets from the President, widespread condemnation by the public, doubling down by the President. Trump is making racism his trademark, spending his time energizing racists while decisively removing America from the moral high ground.

Perhaps not coincidentally, this is happening at the time when democracy activists most desperately need a show of support. They could use a strong statement from Washington telling the leaders in Russia and China that the world is watching. That their actions could have consequences. That, at the very least, their position on the global stage is teetering. That the American people stand on the side of those demanding justice.

Consider what happened in Russia, where pro-democracy activists have been protesting for the right to vote after authorities brazenly disqualified opposition candidates for an upcoming municipal election. President Vladimir Putin's approval has been sliding, discontent growing, and the largest protests in years have taken place, even though Russian law now makes it nearly impossible to obtain a protest permit.

This weekend, police sent rows of menacing riot police to break down a peaceful protest, arresting more than a thousand people in Moscow.

Most alarming is what happened to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose very life may well depend on whether the rest of the world makes it clear to the Kremlin that, if he is killed, there will be consequences.

Navalny was arrested earlier in the week after calling for a demonstration. Then, suddenly, on Sunday, he was rushed to a hospital with what the hospital called an ""acute allergic reaction."" He does not suffer from allergies. The news immediately brought to mind the fate of other Kremlin critics who have faced, shall we call it, biochemical issues.

Recall the horrific disfigurement of former Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian politician who dared to challenge Putin's preferred candidate in 2004. He narrowly escaped death after being poisoned with dioxin. He believes the Kremlin was behind the assassination attempt.

The Kremlin stands accused of poisoning other Putin critics, even exiled ones, including Alexander Litvinenko, who died from radioactive polonium poisoning blamed on Putin by a UK inquest, and Sergei Skripal and his daughter, poisoned in Salisbury, England. British authorities have accused two Russian men of carrying out the hit, saying they belong to Russian military intelligence. The men say they were simply tourists visiting Salisbury.

Other Kremlin critics have died mysterious deaths. The popular politician and Putin critic Boris Nemtsov, shot in front of the Kremlin, former ally Boris Berezovsky, who supposedly killed himself, and many, many courageous journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists counts 28 Russian journalists killed since 2000, the year Putin rose to power.

Navalny's personal doctor says he has been taken back out of the hospital into prison against her advice. She thinks he has been poisoned. Perhaps it was a warning, perhaps an attempt on his life. Navalny, back in prison on Monday, suggested he may have been poisoned while in police custody.

A well-articulated warning from Washington might just save him and others.

A warning to Beijing is just as urgent. For weeks the people of Hong Kong have waged peaceful protests against a government that is supposed to be independent of China under the ""one country, two systems"" model agreed when the territory reverted to China from the UK.

Protests started against a bill that would have allowed extradition to China, where the legal system is beholden to the Communist Party-controlled regime. The protests have been massive, bringing out as many as two million people in a territory of just seven million, underscoring how widespread and intense the distrust of China is.

Beijing has been growing impatient, and the signs are nothing short of ominous.

Last week, the spokesman for the Chinese military, Wu Qian, issued a chilling reminder that China's military forces could be quickly deployed inside Hong Kong if the territory's authorities request it. Then he described the protests in a way that made very clear Beijing is running out of patience. The protesters' behavior, Wu declared, ""is intolerable.""

That was Wednesday. On Sunday, Hong Kong police clad in riot gear launched a harsh crackdown against demonstrators. CNN's Anna Coren, in the midst of the mayhem , was visibly horrified. The protesters were completely peaceful, she said.

On Monday, China issued its sternest warning yet, accusing pro-democracy protesters of committing "" evil and criminal acts .""

One shudders to think what might come next at the hands of the regime that massacred protesters at Tiananmen Square 30 years ago.

When the tanks rolled in Tiananmen, then-President George H.W. Bush wasted no time publicly condemning the regime, as have other American presidents who spoke firmly and decisively against repression.

Sure, America has failed many times, and its own history is far from immaculate, but the words of a credible American president can help draw the moral lines. It may or may not stay the hand of a tyrant, it may or may not prevent a massacre. But at the very least it helps clarify what is and is not legitimate conduct in our time. Even if it fails to stop a catastrophe in progress, it may give second thoughts to another tinpot tyrant watching from a distance.

How tragic for America and for the world that Washington today is dominated by a President who thinks nothing matters more than his personal fate and believes inciting racist hatreds at home tops the national agenda."
Department of Energy Announces $14 Million for Fusion Energy Sciences Research,https://www.energy.gov,[],,,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-announces-14-million-fusion-energy-sciences-research,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $14 million in funding for 10 university-led research projects using the DIII-D National Fusion Facility. A major goal of the research is to develop methods of sustaining steady-state or continuous operation of fusion reactors, an essential step toward eventually making nuclear fusion a practical energy source.

“Fusion remains one of the world’s most promising potential sources of energy,” said Under Secretary for Science Paul Dabbar. “This research—aimed at achieving steady-state operation of fusion reactors—will be an important milestone on the road to sustainable energy from fusion.”

The research focuses on high-priority challenges in “magnetic confinement” of plasma (a hot mixture of ions and free electrons) on the pathway toward eventual development of a contained, self-sustaining fusion reaction. The research will be performed on the DIII-D tokamak, the largest magnetically confined plasma facility in the United States. DIII-D is a DOE Office of Science user facility in San Diego, operated by General Atomics.

Projects range from developing new means of controlling plasma instabilities, to improving diagnostics, to advancing understanding of the material erosion that takes place inside fusion reactors.

Projects were selected by competitive peer review under the DOE Funding Opportunity Announcement, “Collaborative Fusion Energy Research in The DIII-D National Program,” sponsored by the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences within DOE’s Office of Science. Total Fiscal Year 2019 funding is $6.7 million for projects lasting up to three years in duration, with outyear funding contingent on congressional appropriations.

DOJ and FBI Show No Signs of Correcting Past Untruths in Their New Attacks on Encryption,https://www.eff.org,"['Andrew Crocker', 'Nate Cardozo', 'Stephanie Lacambra', 'David Ruiz']",07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/doj-and-fbi-show-no-signs-correcting-past-untruths-their-new-attacks-encryption,"Last week, Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray chose to spend some of their time giving speeches demonizing encryption and calling for the creation of backdoors to allow the government access to encrypted data. You should not spend any of your time listening to them.

Don’t be mistaken; the threat to encryption remains high. Australia and the United Kingdom already have laws in place that can enable those governments to undermine encryption, while other countries may follow. And it’s definitely dangerous when senior U.S. law enforcement officials talk about encryption the way Barr and Wray did.

The reason to ignore these speeches is that DOJ and FBI have not proven themselves credible on this issue. Instead, they have a long track record of exaggeration and even false statements in support of their position. That should be a bar to convincing anyone—especially Congress—that government backdoors are a good idea.

Barr expressed confidence in the tech sector’s “ingenuity” to design a backdoor for law enforcement that will stand up to any unauthorized access, paying no mind to the broad technical and academic consensus in the field that this risk is unavoidable. As the prominent cryptographer and Johns Hopkins University computer science professor Matt Green pointed out on Twitter, the Attorney General made sweeping, impossible-to-support claims that digital security would be largely unaffected by introducing new backdoors. Although Barr paid the barest lip service to the benefits of encryption—two sentences in a 4,000 word speech—he ignored numerous ways encryption protects us all, including preserving not just digital but physical security for the most vulnerable users.

For all of Barr and Wray’s insistence that encryption poses a challenge to law enforcement, you might expect that that would be the one area where they’d have hard facts and statistics to back up their claims, but you’d be wrong. Both officials asserted it’s a massive problem, but they largely relied on impossible-to-fact-check stories and counterfactuals. If the problem is truly as big as they say, why can’t they provide more evidence? One answer is that prior attempts at proof just haven’t held up.

Some prime examples of the government’s false claims about encryption arose out of the 2016 legal confrontation between Apple and the FBI following the San Bernardino attack. Then-FBI Director James Comey and others portrayed the encryption on Apple devices as an unbreakable lock that stood in the way of public safety and national security. In court and in Congress, these officials said they had no means of accessing an encrypted iPhone short of compelling Apple to reengineer its operating system to bypass key security features. But a later special inquiry by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General revealed that technical divisions within the FBI were already working with an outside vendor to unlock the phone even as the government pursued its legal battle with Apple. In other words, Comey’s statements to Congress and the press about the case—as well as sworn court declarations by other FBI officials—were untrue at the time they were made.

Wray, Comey’s successor as FBI Director, has also engaged in considerable overstatement about law enforcement’s troubles with encryption. In congressional testimony and public speeches, Wray repeatedly pointed to almost 8,000 encrypted phones that he said were inaccessible to the FBI in 2017 alone. Last year, the Washington Post reported that this number was inflated due to a “programming error.” EFF filed a Freedom of Information Act request, seeking to understand the true nature of the hindrance encryption posed in these cases, but the government refused to produce any records.

But in their speeches last week, neither Barr nor Wray acknowledged the government’s failure of candor during the Apple case or its aftermath. They didn’t mention the case at all. Instead, they ask us to turn the page and trust anew. You should refuse. Let’s hope Congress does too."
Trump Pick to Oversee Federal Lands Doesn’t Want the Government to Have Any,http://nymag.com,['Matt Stieb'],07-31-2019,2019,7,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/trump-pick-to-oversee-federal-lands-doesnt-want-any.html,"A ridge in Bears Ears National Monument, which the Trump administration reduced by 201,876 acres.

With around 640 million acres in the bank, the federal government controls about 28 percent of the land in these United States, with the bulk of that lying in the West: Over half the ground in Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Alaska, and Oregon is under federal oversight. But the president’s new appointee for Bureau of Land Management, the office that oversees most of that property, isn’t too keen on the government’s role in managing land.

Earlier this week, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt made Wyoming native, attorney, and Reagan administration alum William Perry Pendley the acting director of the BLM. Since serving in the Gipper’s Energy and Interior departments, Pendley has sued Interior on behalf of an oil prospector, tried to slash protections for endangered species — including cutting laws protecting grizzly bears in national parks — and attempted to make it easier to build on federal land.

In addition to his political view on public lands — in 2016, he wrote in the National Review that “[t]he Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold” — Pendley has some personal relationships that add concerns to his nomination. The Washington Post explains:

Pendley’s legal ties, as well as his policy positions, have attracted scrutiny. Environmental groups are pressing Interior to formally recuse Pendley from any involvement in a court case in which he is still the counsel of record representing an aging businessman, Sidney Longwell and his small company Solenex.

Solenex purchased a 6,247-acre lease in northwest Montana in 1982 during the Reagan administration for about $1 an acre. Longwell wants permission to build a six-mile service road and bridge over the Two Medicine River on lands considered sacred by the Blackfeet Tribe. Interior wants to cancel the lease. He would use the road to bring in drilling rigs and other oil exploration equipment.

“The Department’s career ethics professionals are working closely with Mr. Pendley and will advise him as necessary,” an Interior official said.

Pendley has also blasted former Interior secretary Ryan Zinke for not doing enough to open up public lands to private development. In another article for the National Review published in 2017, Pendley criticized Zinke for not reducing national monuments at the rate he deemed necessary: “Instead of doing as asked [by the Trump administration], Secretary Zinke recommended decreasing the size of only four of the most blatantly illegal national monuments while leaving the boundaries of all the others standing with mollycoddle language, which will soon get stricken by environmentalists.” That Zinke reduced only two national monuments wasn’t enough: Pendley rejected that Zinke proposed to make the Badger-Two Medicine preserve in Montana a national monument, an area Solenex wanted to explore for drilling.

Earlier this week, President Trump nominated John Ratcliffe to become the new director of National Intelligence, despite Ratcliffe’s consistent doubt in the efficacy of the intelligence community’s findings on Russia. That the administration has proposed another nominee to deregulate and dismantle the department he runs should now be expected as the norm."
Reagan Calls African Delegates 'Monkeys' in 1971 Call With Nixon,https://www.usnews.com,[],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-07-31/ronald-reagan-calls-african-delegates-monkeys-in-call-with-then-president-richard-nixon,"Then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan speaks with a reporter in 1972. Tapes of Reagan's racist comments in 1971 were originally withheld by the National Archives to protect his privacy. Hulton Archive/Getty Images

On a phone call with then-President Richard Nixon, then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan can be heard disparaging ""monkeys"" from African countries.

The tapes , published in The Atlantic by Tim Naftali, the former director of Nixon's Presidential Library, reveal that Reagan, who later went to become the 40th president of the United States, called Nixon on Oct. 26, 1971 after the United Nations voted to recognize the People's Republic of China.

About six and a half minutes into the phone call, Reagan, a strong defender of Taiwan, seemingly references the way members of the Tanzanian delegation danced after the UN voted to seat the delegation from Beijing instead of Taiwan.

""Last night, I tell you, to watch that thing on television as I did,"" Reagan said to Nixon. ""To see those, those monkeys from those African Countries — damn them, they're still uncomfortable wearing shoes!""

Nixon can be heard laughing as Reagan speaks.

In another phone call later that day, Nixon discusses his conversation with Reagan with then-Secretary of State William Rogers. About 30 seconds into the call, Nixon references Reagan's words.

""As you can imagine,"" Nixon said to Rogers, ""there's [a] strong feeling that we just shouldn't, as [Reagan] said, he saw these ... cannibals on television last night, and he says, 'Christ, they weren't even wearing shoes, and here the United States is going to submit its fate to that,' and so forth and so on.""

Naftali said in The Atlantic that the conversations were recorded by Nixon and later became the responsibility of the Nixon Presidential Library, which he directed from 2007 to 2011. However, when they were released by the National Archives in 2000, Naftali alleges that Reagan's racist comments were withheld to protect the former president's privacy.

In 2018, Naftali requested Nixon's conversations with Reagan be reviewed and the Archives released the complete tapes two weeks ago."

Cook will serve as the principal deputy assistant secretary in the department’s Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, according to an email announcement sent to agency staff by James McDonnell, the assistant secretary of the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

Cook, who currently serves as the deputy assistant director for flight operations at the Federal Air Marshal Service at TSA, is slated to start his senior adviser job on Aug. 12, the email says. Cook will assume the principal deputy assistant secretary position at the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office when the official who currently holds the role leaves later this year, according to the email announcement McDonnell sent Tuesday.

In 2015, Cook and the TSA reached a settlement in a lawsuit with Sonya Labosco, a former air marshal supervisor who accused him of sexual harassment, physical assault and retaliation, North Carolina TV station Fox46 reported in October 2018. The settlement was reportedly worth six figures, the station reported, but it did not require Cook, who denied the accusations, to admit wrongdoing.

In an interview with the station, Labosco claimed that Cook had “held his hands over his erection in his pants” at a party hosted by another TSA employee in 2009 and “put his hand behind my neck and tried to kiss me on the mouth.” Cook also “said he ‘has eight inches of c― waiting on you any time you want it,’” Labosco told the station.

Labosco also alleged that Cook suggested he could help her “move up the ladder” in exchange for sexual favors and that he demoted her when she rejected his advances. Lobosco also said that Cook once “grabbed my arm, twisted it really hard, left fingerprints on my arm and tried to pull me out” of a meeting room because she didn’t leave quickly enough.

“He told me to get the f― out of the room. I better get the f― out now,” she told Fox46.

Cook denied wrongdoing after Labosco filed a federal lawsuit and a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the TSA said that it investigated Labosco’s claims but found them unsupported, Fox46 reported last year. The agency did reprimand him for cursing and said it found those actions “unacceptable.”

The EEOC, however, found that, “at a minimum, [Cook] placed his hands upon [Labosco] and grabbed her arm,” according to Fox46, which also reported that Labosco’s husband witnessed Cook’s attempt to kiss her.

A month after the claim was settled, Cook was promoted to a higher position inside the TSA, Fox46 reported. At the time, Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) called the promotion “outrageous” and said that people like Cook have “no business in our modern-day federal government.”

“TSA thoroughly investigated the allegations of physical misconduct when they were brought to its attention. TSA does not comment on personnel actions,” the agency told The Daily Beast in a statement last year.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to phone and email requests for comment.

Cook has previously served as an air marshal and a Border Patrol agent, and in various capacities across the federal government, including in Homeland Security’s counterterrorism units, according to McDonnell’s announcement email.

Latest appointee overseeing federal public lands once advocated to sell them,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455340-new-head-overseeing-federal-public-lands-once-advocated-to-sell,"The new head of the Interior Department's public lands agency once championed selling off federally-owned plots.

William Perry Pendley, a conservative lawyer from Wyoming, on Monday became the top official leading the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management--the agency that oversees 12 percent of all U.S. land.

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt quietly signed a secretarial order Monday that effectively made Pendley acting director of BLM.

The staffing shake up came after Pendley was unceremoniously moved to the post of Deputy Director of BLM Policy and Programs last week, among the agency’s highest positions.

News of the move was largely determined through a change to BLM’s organization chart posted to its website. Interior has not returned calls for comment.

Bernhardt’s secretarial order Monday called for a “temporary redelegation of authority for certain vacant non-career senate-confirmed positions.”

The positions listed, including Pendley’s, would become “acting by operation of law.”

Pendley first joined the Interior Department last week. Previously, he was the president of Wyoming based Mountain States Legal Foundation, a group that in part advocated for the selling off millions of acres of federal lands out West.

The company’s website hails its work as “a non-profit, public interest law firm, focused on defending the constitution, protecting property rights, and advancing economic liberty.”

Pendley’s name was among those flagged last year as potential replacements to former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: EPA proposes scrapping limits on coal plant waste | Appointee overseeing federal lands once advocated selling them | EPA lifts Obama-era block on controversial mine Latest appointee overseeing federal public lands once advocated to sell them Overnight Energy: Warren edges past Sanders in poll of climate-focused voters | Carbon tax shows new signs of life | Greens fuming at Trump plans for development at Bears Ears monument MORE, who left the agency in January. Multiple former Interior heads have come from the Mountain States Legal Foundation.

Pendley is the latest in a long line of acting directors at BLM. Previously Casey Hammond, the Interior Department's principal deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management, served in the post. Before that, Michael Need, deputy director of operations, served in the role for seven months in 2017.

Pendley’s appointment comes as Interior and BLM are facing heavy scrutiny for their management of public lands and their employees.

The BLM manages 245 million acres of public lands. Last week Interior sparked condemnation for submitting plans for Utah’s Bears Ears national monument that would open remaining lands for development after drastically shrinking the protection area in 2017.

The BLM in mid July also submitted plans to relocate the majority of its agency staff outside of Washington, D.C., a move critics say will weaken the voices of career employees.

Conservation groups largely derided Pendley’s post.

“William Perry Pendley is an ideological zealot whose views are deeply out of touch with the American mainstream,” said Phil Hanceford, conservation director for The Wilderness Society.

“His ascending to the top of BLM just as it is being reorganized strongly suggests the administration is positioning itself to liquidate our shared public lands.”

Chris Saeger, executive director of the Western Values Project, said the move implied Interior was looking to sell off public land, despite previous promises by the Trump administration that it was not looking to do so.

“Pendley is an outspoken advocate for the transfer of public lands to the state. Anything they’ve ever said about not selling off public lands has just been a political smokescreen to distract from their real intentions: handing over public lands to their special interest allies,” he said."

The DoD released plans for blockchain tech in its four-year roadmap on July 12, entitled “DoD Digital Modernization Strategy: DoD Information Resource Management Strategic Plan FY19–23.”

According to the report, the DoD’s research branch, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is currently engaged in at least two exploratory blockchain projects focused on cybersecurity.

First, DARPA is experimenting with blockchain in order to construct a new — or improved — communication and transaction platform. Stated intentions for this platform include communications between units and headquarters as well as between intelligence officers and the Pentagon.

Second, DARPA is attempting to create an “unhackable code” with blockchain technology, citing blockchain’s ability to gather intel on bad actors who attempt to hack into databases.

DARPA’s blockchain workshop

As reported by Cointelegraph, DARPA previously announced plans to host a two-day blockchain workshop in February. DARPA was particularly keen on examining permissionless consensus protocols. The organization also noted that there were potentially valuable use cases for blockchain in data storage, saying:

“Technologies for distributed consensus protocols have been revolutionized by their prominent role in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. These technologies have dramatic implications for the security and resilience of critical data storage and computation tasks, including for the Department of Defense.”

In December 2018, DoD officials examined how blockchain technology could help emergencies responses in disaster situations in a presentation hosted by the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support’s Continuous Process Improvement."
Corn is America’s Largest Crop in 2019,https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Tom Capehart', 'Susan Proper', 'Economic Research Service In', 'Francisco M.']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/07/29/corn-americas-largest-crop-2019,"Posted by Tom Capehart and Susan Proper, Economic Research Service in Research and Science

U.S. farmers have planted 91.7 million acres of corn in 2019.

Despite an unusually wet spring followed by an unusually cool June, America’s corn farmers planted even more than they did last year. U.S. farmers have planted 91.7 million acres of corn in 2019, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). That’s about 69 million football fields of corn and 3 percent more corn than last year, far more acres than the next largest crop, soybeans.

USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) publishes a monthly Feed Outlook report that analyzes supply and demand data to provide information on expected prices, production, exports, and feed uses for corn and other feed grains. The following is just some of the information available.

Corn farmers faced one of the most challenging planting seasons in recent memory, and while the corn did get planted, farmers planted much of it later than usual. In early July, 57 percent of the crop was reported to be in good or excellent condition, while last year 75 percent was reported good or excellent by that time. Based on the late start to the crop and the continued cool weather, USDA is forecasting slightly lower yields than last year. At present, however, USDA forecasts that corn supplies will be sufficient to meet demand because farmers have plenty of corn stored from last year’s crop. That ear of corn on the cob you may enjoy at a summer picnic is just one of many uses of corn. Here are a few more:

About a third of America’s corn crop is used for feeding cattle, hogs, and poultry in the U.S. Corn provides the “carbs” in animal feed, while soybeans provide the protein. It takes a couple of bushels of American corn to make corn-fed steak; by some estimates, a beef cow can eat a ton of corn if raised in a feedlot. Both dairy cows and beef cows also consume silage, which is fermented corn stalks and other green plants.

Just over a third of the corn crop is used to make ethanol, which serves as a renewable fuel additive to gasoline. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires that 10% of gasoline be renewable fuel, but you can find E15 (15 percent ethanol) or E85 (85 percent) ethanol in some areas, particularly in the Midwest.

The rest of the corn crop is used for human food, beverages, and industrial uses in the U.S., or exported to other countries for food or feed use. Corn has hundreds of uses. It is used to make breakfast cereal, tortilla chips, grits, canned beer, soda, cooking oil, and bio-degradable packing materials. It’s the key ingredient in the growing medium for life-saving medicines including penicillin. Corn gluten meal is used on flower beds to prevent weeds.

America’s biggest customers are Mexico, South Korea, Japan, and Columbia. U.S. white corn is particularly prized in Mexico and Columbia as a high quality food ingredient, while Japan and South Korea pay a premium for high quality, USDA-inspected feed corn for poultry and beef.

Why does corn have the most acres of any major crop in the U.S.? It can be grown in nearly every State in the U.S. Seed companies provide hybrid, organic, and bio-engineered varieties that are specially bred to be the best for different soil and weather conditions. Seed companies have developed different corn varieties for different end uses, including feed corn, sweet corn, white corn, and popcorn.

You can learn more about corn from a variety of USDA sources. ERS maintains a feed grains database with historical information on production, trade, prices, livestock feed demand, and many other data items. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) researches insect and weed pests, and new crop varieties. The World Agricultural Outlook Board, part of the Office of the Chief Economist, coordinates economic analysis from across USDA to provide monthly reports on the supply and demand of corn and other crops, while the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and ERS also publish more detailed analysis of specific issues like ethanol usage and foreign demand for feed and food corn and many other crops."
Justice OKs Nexstar-Tribune Merger with Divestitures,https://www.broadcastingcable.com,['John Eggerton'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/justice-oks-nexstar-tribune-merger-with-divestitures,"Delrahim says he has been pleased with companies' cooperation

Nexstar and Tribune have settled with the Justice Department to get their proposed $6.4 billion merger approved.

The FCC must still complete its public interest review of the merger, which goes beyond antitrust issues.

Specifically, Justice filed a civil antitrust suit against the deal in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Wednesday (July 31) , but at the same time filed the settlement that, if accepted by the court and they almost always are, would resolve the suit bcause Justice says the spin-offs remedy the competitive harms--higher retrans and spot prices--that are alleged in the complaint.

Related: More Than 120 Nexstar Stations Dark on DirecTV

The broadcasters have agreed to divest TV stations in 13 markets to get that approval, which was based in part on the assertion that without those, the combined company ""would likely charge cable and satellite companies higher retransmission consent fees to carry the combined company’s broadcast stations, resulting in higher monthly cable and satellite bills for millions of Americans,"" as well as higher spot prices in the divestiture markets.

Justice has been looking at spot prices in TV advertising, including settling with Nexstar and other broadcast groups over their sharing of competitively sensitive information. That investigation stemmed from its review of Sinclair's effort to buy the Tribune stations.

Justice has concluded for the purposes of this and other mergers in the space that cable and digital are not sufficient competitors to be included in the relevant product market, meaning it is focused on the impact of deals on the TV spot market irrespective of the other outlets, which it says are not sufficient substitutes.

Nexstar and Tribune had already told the FCC it would be spinning off stations in most of those markets anyway, but in Indianapolis it had asked to be allowed to retain Tribune's existing pair of top four stations. That ask is now moot.

“Without the required divestitures, Nexstar’s merger with Tribune threatens significant competitive harm to cable and satellite TV subscribers and small businesses,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “I am pleased, however, that we have been able to reach a resolution of the Division’s concerns, thanks in part to the parties’ commitment to engage in good faith settlement talks from the outset of our investigation.”

That was in contrast to the government's view that Sinclair had been recalcitrant in negotiations over that broadcaster's aborted attempt to purchase the Tribune stations

The settlement also resolves challenges by the attorney's general of Illinois, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

The markets are Davenport, Iowa; Des Moines, Iowa; Ft. Smith, Arkansas; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Hartford, Connecticut; Huntsville, Alabama; Indianapolis, Indiana; Memphis, Tennessee; Norfolk, Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

Nexstar will have to sell either one of its stations, or one of Tribune's, in each of those markets.

Democratic senator vows to fight Trump Interior nominee after requesting perjury investigation,https://thehill.com,[],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455519-dem-senator-vows-to-fight-trump-interior-nominee-after-requesting,"A Democratic senator is working to block a Trump nominee from serving as the top lawyer for the Department of the Interior and calling for an investigation after the nominee appeared to lie to lawmakers during his confirmation hearing about the department's public records policy.

Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenDem senator vows to fight Trump Interior nominee after requesting perjury investigation Democrats raise questions about how Ratcliffe would approach election security On The Money: Fed poised to give Trump boost with rate cut | Parties unable to reach deal in Trump tax return lawsuit | New York opens investigation into Capital One data breach MORE (D-Ore.) is requesting a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into Daniel Jorjani, currently the top lawyer at Interior who was nominated to officially take over as solicitor for the department.

“Attempts by political appointees at the Interior Department to delay, stonewall and otherwise inhibit public and Congressional oversight are totally unacceptable,” Wyden said in a statement. “I cannot allow Mr. Jorjani’s nomination to proceed. I will object to any unanimous consent agreement to consider his nomination.”

Jorjani’s confirmation hearing was already a notable one, given that he was already connected to numerous issues being internally investigated by the Interior’s Office of the Inspector General.

The man nominated to lead that office, Mark Greenblatt, testified alongside Jorjani that day.

But during the hearing, senators became annoyed by Jorjani’s responses to their questions, particularly those that inquired about a new policy at Interior that allows political appointees to review public records requested through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Jorjani told lawmakers, “I myself don’t review FOIAs or make determinations.”

That comment has already spurred a request for an investigation from one environmental group, but Wyden’s letters asked both the Interior’s watchdog and the DOJ to investigate. They argue that cannot be true given Jorjani’s role overseeing FOIAs for the department.

Wyden, who pressed Jorjani for details on how the review process for political appointees works, say documents from the department show political appointees were given power “well beyond the written policy Mr. Jorjani cited.”

Interior said they believed Jorjani would still be confirmed.

""Dan Jorjani has a solid record of honorably serving the American people,"" spokeswoman Molly Block said in a statement to The Hill. ""The U.S. Department of the Interior is the only Department who has never had a Senate confirmed lawyer under the Trump Administration. Given this fact, we’re confident the Senate will prioritize the confirmation of this highly qualified individual who has been leading transparency efforts at the Department when they return in September.""

Jorjani is not just in hot water for his comments at the hearing but also for written responses he sent afterward, which repeatedly directed Wyden to get in touch with Interior’s congressional liaison for more information.

“I cannot a recall a nominee ever coming through this committee and responding to my requests for information by telling me to go ask somebody else,” Wyden said the day Jorjani was voted out of the Senate Natural Resources Committee.

All Democrats on the committee voted against Jorjani’s nomination.

They are among those who need mental health care services more than ever -- veterans dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and other conditions. But the system that was supposed to help them has fallen behind, according to an Office of Inspector General report released last week.The report said veterans seeking outpatient mental health care at the New Mexico Veterans Affairs Health Care System, based in Albuquerque, faced longer than acceptable wait times -- in one instance as long as four months, according to the report. The OIG report also said the Albuquerque center saw high rates of clinical appointment cancellations and that staff did not make effective use of the electronic wait list system.New Mexico VA Health Services Director Andrew Welch, who oversees the hospital, said his office had been working to fix the issues before the OIS report was released July 23.""We recognize that we had some challenges with some of the scheduling things with our veterans,"" Welch said. A mental health summit held at the New Mexico Veterans Memorial in Albuquerque furthered the discussion on how to better meet the needs of veterans. Health care providers, representatives from congressional offices and nonprofit groups attended, including U.S. Navy veteran Ken O'Keefe, who served in the Vietnam War.O'Keefe said more could always be done to help veterans suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, or what he refers to as ""combat stress.""""When you send somebody to war, you don't get the same person back if you get them back at all,"" O'Keefe said.Welch said his office is working to resolve the reported issues by bringing in more staff and improving its Telemental Health program, which allows veterans to access care remotely by using technology -- a method particularly helpful for veterans who live in rural portions of the state.The VA also encourages any veterans who need to talk to someone to to call the Veterans Crisis Line at 1-800-273-8255."
"Trump's trip to his Turnberry resort cost the State Department at least $233K, review finds",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/trump-turnberry-resort-cost-state-department-oig/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department spent at least $233,732 on President Donald Trump's July 2018 trip to his Turnberry resort in Scotland, according to a letter from the department's inspector general obtained by CNN.

The July 22 letter from Inspector General Steve Linick to Democratic Sens. Tom Carper of Delaware and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland details only the costs that were paid by the State Department and not reimbursed. Among the costs were more than $42,000 in overtime, more than $111,000 in hotels, more than $28,000 in rental cars and more than $51,000 in temporary duty costs, according to the letter.

The OIG review was not able to determine how much the resort gained in profit from the visit. The State Department spent $728 on three rooms for two nights at the Trump-owned property. According to the letter, the department said they were used by the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, his wife and his chief of protocol. The department said that the Trump Turnberry's rate was ""the lowest of all the hotels being utilized for this VIP visit"" and offered ""a fair and reasonable rate to the Government,"" according to document cited in the letter.

The Hill was the first to report on Linick's letter.

The State Department OIG review was prompted by a call for investigation made by the three Democratic lawmakers shortly after the President's trip. They also requested an inquiry from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General. The department OIG did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Monday.

A man’s immigration case is in limbo as officials decide if he’ll receive an order of deportation. Marco Aviles Gutierrez was just 5 when he arrived in the U.S. “I grew up here when I was a kid, and I’ve never been to Mexico,” he said. Now 26, Gutierrez has a mental disability, relying on his family for help. “I got my mom here,"" he said. “I’ve got nobody in Mexico who can take care of me.”He’s supposed to be protected under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program for people who were brought to the country illegally as children. Now, there’s an issue. His attorney, Genevra Alberti, said his case was closed, but a new order from the U.S. attorney general reopened it and many others by saying judges can’t administratively close cases. “This case really illustrates how messed up things are right now,” Alberti said. “Now we’re stuck in this position of what do we do with this case?” Alberti said they’ve been told since judges can’t close the case, the best option is accepting a deportation order from the Department of Homeland Security but not worrying about it since Gutierrez would be protected by DACA.“There’s no sense in having this order sitting there making his life miserable, wondering what’s going to happen,” Alberti said. “I think it’s not fair,” Gutierrez said. “I might not see my family no more.”For Alberti, it’s an example of quick policy changes creating issues for both the government and immigrants.“It’s insanity is really the best way to put it because literally on a daily basis, something else seems to happen,” she said. “He may ultimately have to return to a country that he does not know.” Gutierrez and Alberti expect to learn more in a late October court hearing. Gutierrez is taking life skills classes now and has hopes of one day attending the University of Missouri - Kansas City."
EPA says cleanup of arsenic-laced Minneapolis Superfund site is mostly complete,http://www.startribune.com,"['Greg Stanley', 'Greg.Stanley Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/epa-says-cleanup-of-arsenic-laced-minneapolis-superfund-site-is-mostly-complete/513463092/,"After more than a decade of cleanup efforts and testing, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is ready to essentially shut down a Superfund site in south Minneapolis where industrial arsenic had contaminated the soil surrounding about 600 homes.

The East Phillips neighborhood site, near Hiawatha Avenue and E. 28th Street, has been on the EPA’s list of priorities under its Superfund program for years after extremely high arsenic levels were found in many of the yards surrounding an old rail line.

Remediation efforts have been almost entirely finished since 2011, when the EPA completed a $25 million project to dig up and replace most of the contaminated soil. A scheduled review conducted in April found that the soil poses no threat to humans or the environment and that it’s time to take the vast majority of the neighborhood off the priority list.

“The remedy is functioning as intended,” the review said.

The EPA plans to keep just nine properties on the cleanup list, where homeowners have refused to allow soil tests. The agency will continue conducting regular reviews until all nine are tested and remediated.

With the soil safe, there’s really no reason to keep the rest of the neighborhood on the list, said Cathy Villas-Horns, supervisor of the incident response unit for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.

1930s-1960s: Arsenic blows in from a neighboring pesticide manufacturer. 2000s: EPA scientists find high arsenic levels in local soil, begin excavating and replacing it. 2011: EPA announces most yards have been cleaned up.

“Except for those nine properties, the cleanup has been completed,” Villas-Horns said.

Regulators believe that wind carried the arsenic into the neighborhood over the course of three decades from a site where the now-defunct Reade Manufacturing Co. had been storing, producing and dumping an arsenic-based insecticide from the 1930s until the 1960s.

In the early and mid-2000s, the EPA and Agriculture Department tested the soil of more than 3,500 houses, day-care centers and parks, as well as a cemetery in the area, finding unsafe levels of arsenic in more than 600 properties. By 2011, the two agencies had spent more than $25 million, largely from federal economic stimulus money, tearing out the yards and removing at least 1 foot of topsoil in each of the contaminated properties. They poured in clean topsoil and reseeded each lawn with grass.

There were roughly 30 holdouts in 2011 — properties where owners refused to grant permission to test their lawns. Over the past eight years, the EPA has whittled that number down to the nine who continue to deny permission.

Minnesota has 25 sites on the EPA Superfund priority list, which serves as a roster of contaminated areas that are eligible for federal cleanup funding. It primarily helps EPA managers decide where to focus limited funds. The site’s removal from the Superfund list “does not in any way alter EPA’s right to take enforcement actions, as appropriate,” the agency said in a statement.

If more contaminants are found, the EPA could place the area back on the list.

The state keeps its own list of cleanup priorities for the Superfund sites in Minnesota, including the former Reade Manufacturing property itself, at 2800 Hiawatha Av. The EPA decision will not affect the state’s ongoing groundwater cleanup and monitoring efforts at that property, which is a now a business center, Villas-Horns said.

Neighbors still worry

Some residents expressed concern Wednesday about potential consequences of taking the neighborhood off the Superfund list, saying the area is far from clean.

“If anything deserved the designation of a Superfund site, this neighborhood did and still does,” said Brad Pass of the East Phillips Improvement Coalition.

Properties in the area, such as the former Roof Depot immediately west of the Reade site, are slated for redevelopment, Pass said. But the building and asphalt parking lots may have been built on top of potentially polluted soil, trapping contaminants there for years.

Once those structures are torn down, Pass said, he’s worried there may be arsenic underneath that is once again blown into the neighborhood.

“Although they have remediated certain lots, this is going to open up tremendous potential for spreading this arsenic all over the place,” Pass said."
Groups file lawsuit against Department of Interior,https://www.ktuu.com,['Dan Joling Associated Press'],,,,https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/Groups-file-lawsuit-against-Interior-Department-513465171.html,"Alaska Native and environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Interior Department, saying it has withheld information regarding its preparation for a petroleum lease sale in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday in Anchorage claims the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service did not provide public information in response to Freedom of Information Act requests.

The groups sought information on an application by a company to conduct three-dimensional seismic exploration that could disturb denning polar bears.

The groups also sought information regarding Interior Secretary David Bernhardt's order to limit time for an environmental review and department consultations with Canada over caribou.

The groups object to leases in the massive refuge.

Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said the department could not comment on pending litigation.

DOJ restricts asylum claims based on family relations,https://www.politico.com,['Ted Hesson'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/29/doj-asylum-claims-family-relations-1624028,"Attorney General William Barr said that being part of a nuclear family targeted for persecution doesn’t qualify as a “particular social group” eligible for asylum in the United States. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images immigration DOJ restricts asylum claims based on family relations

A decision issued Monday by Attorney General William Barr will restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum based on their family relations.

In a precedent-setting immigration court opinion, Barr said that simply being part of a nuclear family targeted for persecution doesn’t qualify as a “particular social group” eligible for asylum in the United States.

Story Continued Below

“The fact that a criminal group — such as a drug cartel, gang, or guerrilla force — targets a group of people does not, standing alone, transform those people into a particular social group,” the attorney general wrote.

President Donald Trump has sought to restrict access to asylum, which his administration views as a magnet that draws migrants north from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessionsissued a similar immigration court decision in June 2018 that blocked asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence, a move that drew condemnation from pro-migrant advocates. A federal judge based in Washington, D.C., blocked key parts of a policy related to the decision six months later.

Barr’s ruling will guide future decisions in the immigration courts, which are not part of the federal judiciary and fall under the purview of the Justice Department. Barr highlighted that authority in the ruling Monday, saying “the attorney general has primary responsibility for construing and applying provisions in the immigration laws.”

To receive asylum in the U.S., applicants must prove they faced persecution in their home countries based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Barr’s decision Monday will limit the ability of a familial relationship to qualify as “membership in a particular social group.“ The number of asylum seekers who could be affected each year was not immediately clear.

The attorney general issued the decision in a case that involved a deported Mexican immigrant who claimed drug cartel members had targeted him because they wanted to sell drugs in his father’s Mexico City store.

The Board of Immigration Appeals found that the man’s relationship with his father qualified as a “particular social group,” but ultimately denied the asylum request because the man could not prove he was persecuted over the relationship.

Barr found that being part of a family meets the standard for asylum only when the family is “socially distinct in the eyes of its society.”

Immigration law advocates said the decision defied the precedents of at least two federal appeals courts, which have held that targeting based on family membership can qualify an immigrant for asylum.

“The family provides ‘a prototypical example of a particular social group,’” the Richmond-based 4th Circuitwrote in 2011, quoting an earlier case from the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit.

“It's a significant declaration of power from the A.G. and one that will hopefully take a beating in court,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council said on Twitter.

The DOJ asylum move is only the latest policy change to limit asylum.

Trump announced Friday that his administration had struck a deal with Guatemala that would require asylum seekers passing through that nation to first seek protections there.

The asylum agreement came after a San Francisco-based federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump regulation that barred asylum seekers who passed through other nations en route to the southwest border.

Former State Dept. analyst says White House is 'undercutting evidence' by blocking climate change warning,https://www.cnn.com,['Devan Cole'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/30/politics/state-department-intelligence-official-white-house-climate-change/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A State Department official who quit after he says the White House blocked his written testimony on climate change from being delivered to Congress says the Trump administration is ""undercutting evidence that contradicts its policy positions.""

""I take great pride in the many positive and productive interactions I had with senior officials in my 30 months in the Trump administration,"" Rod Schoonover wrote in a New York Times op-ed published Tuesday. ""But the decision to block the written testimony is another example of a well-established pattern in the Trump administration of undercutting evidence that contradicts its policy positions.""

Last month, the White House office of Legislative Affairs blocked Schoonover, who worked as an intelligence analyst for the department, from submitting written testimony to the House Intelligence Committee that offered major warnings ""on the national security implications of climate change,"" according to a report from The Washington Post citing several senior administration officials.

The written testimony Schoonover was prepared to submit, which warned that human-caused climate change could be ""possibly catastrophic,"" according to the Post, stood in marked contrast to the generally dismissive tone President Donald Trump has taken towards climate change and to recent remarks from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Tuesday.

Update: Border personnel taking 80 migrants to hospitals daily: DHS official,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-personnel-taking-800-migrants-to-hospitals-daily-dhs-official,"Federal law enforcement assigned to the U.S.-Mexico border are transporting approximately 80 sick migrants in federal custody to hospitals for medical care each day, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, incorrectly told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tuesday morning Border Patrol agents and Office of Field Operations officers are transporting ""800"" people daily. A previous version of this story reflected Morgan's mistake.

A CBP spokeswoman who followed up with the Washington Examiner Tuesday afternoon said Morgan ""meant to say 80 people per day on average to the hospital"" after misspeaking during the hearing.

Morgan said the need for transportation, drivers, and law enforcement to stay with migrants while they are in a medical facility has affected the Department of Homeland Security agency's ability to patrol between the ports of entry.

""We are looking at $63 million dollars for continued medical assets and high risk support across the southwest border. That was included in the supplemental,"" Morgan said during a hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Tuesday.

In March, the Washington Examiner reported CBP personnel had spent more than 49,000 hours facilitating medical trips and watching patients while they are in hospitals since January. The loss of agents working in law enforcement roles is equivalent to the 2,000 hours worked by 25 Border Patrol agents in a year.

DHS has diverted $45 million in operational funds to go toward medical costs over the past five years, according to data obtained by the Washington Examiner.

As of March, the U.S. Border Patrol had diverted $9 million in operational funding in fiscal year 2019, as it has done in each of the four previous years, to instead cover medical screenings and related services for thousands of immigrants.

CBP said it had “seen an increase in the numbers of apprehended individuals requiring medical assistance,"" but Morgan did not provide an update to the total number of hospital referrals Tuesday.

U.S. Department of Education wants to stop ‘student aid fraud scheme’ where parents give up custody through dubious guardianships,https://chicago.suntimes.com,['Jul'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/7/30/20747979/department-education-stop-student-aid-fraud-scheme-parents-give-up-custody-guardianships,"Federal and state officials say they want to close loopholes that allow families to get need-based financial aid they would not otherwise receive by giving up guardianship of their college-bound children.

The move, they say, could end “potential student aid fraud” when parents turn over guardianship of their children in hopes of obtaining a tuition break.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General said the office has recommended modifying the language on federal financial aid forms following disclosure of the tactic, first reported by ProPublica Illinois on Monday. The Wall Street Journal also published a story late Monday about the issue.

“What we can tell you is that we are aware of this issue and suggested to the Federal Student Aid office (FSA) that it add clarifying language to the FSA Handbook that would help close possible avenues for this type of potential student aid fraud,” the inspector general’s spokeswoman said in a statement.

The new language would aim to ensure students involved in this kind of guardianship no longer qualify for aid if they continue to receive medical and financial support from their parents.

The Inspector General’s Office was not aware of any prosecutions to date involving “this specific type of student aid fraud scheme,” the spokeswoman added.

Officials with the Illinois attorney general’s office said Tuesday they also “have concerns” about the practice and will contact the state agency that administers a need-based grant “as we look into the matter further.”

State lawmakers also called for reforms.

ProPublica Illinois reported that dozens of suburban Chicago families, and perhaps many more, have given up legal guardianship of their teenage children to qualify for federal, state and university aid.

The parents — including lawyers, educators and a doctor — turn guardianship of their children over to relatives or friends sometimes months before they turn 18. By doing so, the children can then declare themselves financially independent and qualify for aid they would not otherwise receive.

Andy Borst, director of undergraduate admissions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said he is glad the practice has been exposed. The university first alerted the Department of Education to these cases in July 2018.

“I’m pleased that this issue has been brought to light and is being discussed widely,” Borst said. “I am hopeful that additional action can be taken to close this loophole.”

While ProPublica Illinois identified close to four dozen families in the northern suburbs of Lake County alone that filed similar petitions for guardianship, the practice appears to be more widespread. An attorney who has filed petitions in Lake County said she has also filed similar cases in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Will and McHenry counties.

ProPublica Illinois is continuing to investigate.

Illinois lawmakers on Tuesday also called for an examination of any state laws or rules that allow wealthy families to take advantage of the Illinois Monetary Award Program, or MAP, grant. Some 82,000 students were eligible for the grant last year but did not receive it because there wasn’t enough money. The grant, up to about $5,000, is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.

“It looks like theft from taxpayers and theft from students and families who legitimately deserve need-based financial aid,” said state Sen. Pat McGuire, D-Joliet, who chairs the Senate higher education committee.

McGuire said he plans to contact Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office, the Illinois attorney general’s office and the Illinois Student Assistance Commission, which administers the MAP grant, to look for ways to close any loopholes.

If that doesn’t work, he said, he will consider filing new legislation.

“It’s especially galling because the legitimate need for MAP is proven by the fact that not everyone who applies for it gets it,” McGuire said. “And even those who get it, in many cases, still are required to take out loans and work more hours per week than is advised to afford college.”

State Sen. Cristina Castro, D-Elgin, said she shared McGuire’s concerns.

“It is particularly troubling,” she said. “You think of how we’ve increased MAP funds, but we always run out.”

Castro said she was disappointed to read that one of the parents identified by ProPublica Illinois who had given up guardianship of her teenager was an assistant schools superintendent.

“That was mind-boggling,” she said. “Those are people who should and are able most of the time to pay for that education. And that’s troubling that they would go to great lengths not to.”

The students involved in these cases have gone on to be accepted at public universities and private colleges across the Midwest and as far away as California, according to their social media accounts and student newspapers.

A spokesman for the University of Missouri on Tuesday said officials have decided to pull university-based financial aid if they are able to confirm the student “misrepresented their financial situation for the sole reason to get need-based aid when they otherwise would not be eligible.”

The university’s financial aid office continues to investigate.

So far, the spokesman said, it has found “an extremely small number” of cases.
