Markets rallied on the announcement by the U.S. Trade Representative office that certain items were being removed from the new tariff list, while duties on others would be delayed until mid-December.

The short-seller Jim Chanos, who tweets under the alter ego ""Diogenes,"" hinted that Chinese President Xi Jinping may take this as a sign that the U.S. may cave with enough pressure.

""So then tell me why Xi should not continue to wait out The World's Greatest Negotiator, who keeps 'dealing' with himself?"" tweeted Chanos, founder and managing Partner of Kynikos Associates.

Some investors took Tuesday's announcement as a sign that despite the White House's claim that China would bear the brunt of tariff impacts, the trade war was indeed hurting consumers. The products in the group exempt from tariffs include cellphones, some apparel, and video games — all of which are crucial to the U.S. consumer market, especially during the holiday shopping season. Trump announced on Aug. 1 that 10% tariffs would go into effect on Sept. 1 on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had not been slapped with U.S. duties.

Trump told reporters Tuesday afternoon that he postponed tariffs for the Christmas season ""in case it had an impact on shopping"" and the delay would ""help a lot of people.""

Hedge fund manager and Hayman Capital Management founder Kyle Bass said based on the tariff de-escalation, ""it does look like President Trump has blinked."" While Trump has been vocal in the tariff fight, Bass said ""every time it makes the stock market go down a few hundred points"" the president ""backs away."""

""And all the people who are not fooled by this need to come together, go to the polls, go to the protests, do whatever you have to do. You do not negotiate with these people -- you destroy them.""

Host Joy Reid apparently realized her guest’s comment could be taken as inflammatory and quickly intervened.“The black man said ‘beat them,’ meaning in an election,” she said as Mystal added “figuratively.”

Mystal's comments came amid a renewed discussion about whether heated political rhetoric could contribute to acts of violence. Many Democrats and members of the media have claimed that Trump's words influenced the suspected gunman in this month's mass shooting in El Paso, Texas.

Mystal also argued that Trump supporters like real estate mogul Stephen Ross were just as ""complicit"" in Trump's hardline policy toward immigrants as ""the man himself.""

""The children who are orphaned on the streets of Mississippi see no moral distinction because Stephen Ross got a tax cut to look the other way while their parents were being abducted,"" said Mystal, referring to last week's immigration raids at seven food processing plants in Mississippi.

Justice Department Reassigns Warden Of Prison Where Jeffrey Epstein Died,https://www.npr.org,['Miles Parks'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/13/750884421/justice-department-reassigns-warden-of-prison-where-jeffrey-epstein-found-dead,"Justice Department Reassigns Warden Of Prison Where Jeffrey Epstein Died

The warden of the federal prison in New York City where Jeffrey Epstein was found dead has been reassigned, the Department of Justice says. Two other staffers were placed on leave.

The administrative moves took place amid official investigations into Epstein's death and following harsh official criticism of the Bureau of Prisons.

Epstein's death, the result of an apparent suicide, shows ""deficiencies in inmate protocol and has allowed the deceased to ultimately evade facing justice,"" wrote House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., in a letter to BOP.

Attorney General William Barr said Monday that investigators had already discovered ""serious irregularities"" at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, where Epstein had been housed.

The warden who was supervising the center has been reassigned to the Bureau of Prisons' Northeast Regional Office, according to the Justice Department.

The warden was not identified in the announcement and the department has not responded to a request to confirm the name of a person connected in other documents with the Metropolitan Correctional Center.

James Petrucci, who was overseeing a prison in Otisville, N.Y., will take over as acting warden, the Justice Department said.

""Additional actions may be taken as the circumstances warrant,"" a spokeswoman said.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., released a statement Tuesday calling for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold an oversight hearing about the Bureau of Prisons.

""Every day that passes without action is another day that the safety of prison staff and inmates is at grave risk,"" Durbin said.

The Justice Department also didn't identify the two prison staffers who have been reassigned as the investigations move ahead.

The president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council of Prison Locals, Eric Young, said the moves appeared standard.

""The actions taken today by the attorney general are typical to protect the integrity of investigations until any formal action, if any, is warranted.""

DOJ accuses Dems of trying to 'game the system' in 'so-called' impeachment probe,https://www.politico.com,"['Kyle Cheney', 'Andrew Desiderio']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/13/doj-congress-impeachment-probe-1460638,"Justice Department lawyers said the demand for former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify and the request for Robert Mueller’s grand jury evidence are based on “completely different factual and legal issues.” | Saul Loeb/Getty Images) congress DOJ accuses Dems of trying to 'game the system' in 'so-called' impeachment probe The Justice Department criticizes the Democrats' attempt to link the Don McGahn and Mueller grand jury cases as an attempt to search for a friendly judge.

The Justice Department on Tuesday accused House Democrats of shopping for a friendly federal judge in its effort to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify about potential obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.

In a new court filing, the Justice Department dinged the House Judiciary Committee for “attempting to game the system” by seeking to formally link its McGahn suit to a separate effort to access former special counsel Robert Mueller’s grand jury evidence.

Story Continued Below

Democrats say the cases are related because they are both connected to an ongoing “impeachment investigation” that could result in an effort to recommend Trump’s ouster. And tying the cases together could help expedite them, they argued.

But the Justice Department said House Democrats undercut their own argument for haste by waiting three months to file a lawsuit against McGahn, who refused to testify after the White House claimed he was “absolutely immune” and directed him to refuse to cooperate with Congress.

“For one thing, the committee’s desire for rapid adjudication rings hollow given that the committee waited until August to file suit over former counsel McGahn’s testimony despite being formally advised of the former counsel’s absolute immunity from compelled congressional testimony on May 20, 2019,” the filing states.

“Thus, any delay is the committee’s doing at this point.”

Judiciary Committee officials have emphasized efforts to show federal judges that they are making meaningful accommodations with the Justice Department and with McGahn directly. As recently as the week before the McGahn lawsuit was filed, the committee was deep into negotiations with McGahn that could have potentially averted the litigation.

The White House and the president’s GOP allies have repeatedly stressed the importance of the “accommodation process,” and they have criticized Democrats when they believed those efforts were cut short too quickly.

The Justice Department said the House’s true aim was to put both cases in front of D.C.’s chief federal judge Beryl Howell, who already was considering the grand jury matter, because of the perception that the appointee of former President Barack Obama might rule favorably in their case. It’s an attempt, the department argues, to manipulate longstanding requirements that cases be randomly assigned to judges to prevent judge-shopping.

Underscoring their point, Justice Department lawyers — arguing on McGahn’s behalf — said the demand for McGahn to testify and the request for Mueller’s grand jury evidence are based on “completely different factual and legal issues” and have no basis for being linked.

“[T]he two cases could not be more different,” the attorneys argued.

The Justice Department’s filing came a day after House lawyers argued in a separate filing that two of their court cases should be linked because both “seek key evidence for the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into whether to recommend articles of impeachment … based on the same underlying obstructive acts by President Trump.”

The Justice Department did not directly address the House’s assertions that it is conducting an impeachment investigation, but the filing referred to the effort as a so-called probe.

Last week, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said his panel was engaged in “formal impeachment proceedings,” a rhetorical escalation that matched what House lawyers had told federal judges in recent court filings. Nadler has also said that if the courts move quickly to address the House’s litigation, his committee could recommend articles of impeachment by the end of the year.

Democrats appear to lack the votes to open an impeachment inquiry in the traditional fashion, driven in part by Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s resistance to taking that step. Pelosi is mindful of forcing her most vulnerable caucus members to take a politically difficult vote when impeachment efforts are all but certainly doomed in the Republican-controlled Senate. She has repeatedly argued for continued litigation against and investigation of the president.

Republicans have pointed to her ambivalence as evidence that no formal inquiry has begun.

“Democrats seem to believe, when it comes to holding this president accountable, that the ends justify the means and that they shouldn’t be constrained by House procedure when our democracy is under siege,” Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, wrote in a recent op-ed. “In reality, they may do more to harm our democracy than any president ever could.”

In their own filing, Democrats argued that their authority for claiming to be in the midst of an impeachment probe stems from Jefferson’s Manual — a guide to parliamentary procedure employed by the House and Senate. The manual indicates that impeachment proceedings are launched in a variety of ways, not just through a formal vote of the House. One method is via the referral of articles of impeachment to the Judiciary Committee.

As Nadler and other Democrats note, the House referred articles of impeachment to the committee in January, and they say those articles are now officially under consideration for approval or amendment.

Democrats in recent weeks have pointed to a series of House actions they say bolster their position. In early June, the House voted to allow all committee chairs to enforce subpoenas in court — with the approval of House leaders acting on behalf of the entire chamber.

And last month, the House adopted a resolution declaring all Trump-related subpoenas and demands for information — retroactively and into the future — to have the support of the full House. Impeachment inquiry supporters say this is evidence that the House intended, however indirectly, to back impeachment proceedings without a formal vote.

Similarly, Judiciary Committee officials have noted that previous votes to authorize impeachment proceedings have been intended to empower the committee to issue subpoenas and convene depositions in an era when committees had far less authority than they do in the modern era. Now, the committee already has subpoena and deposition authority, they note.

"Only bottled water for Newark residents, EPA says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Georeen Tanner'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/epa-tells-newark-provide-bottled-water,"Just over a year ago, Newark officials declared the city's water was ""absolutely safe to drink,"" but last week environmental officials called on the city to advise residents with known or suspected lead service lines that the filters they had been provided were not reliable after elevated lead levels were discovered in two Newark homes.

For three years the New Jersey city has been mired in a crisis caused by high levels of lead in the drinking water. The water filter program meant to answer the call for safer water has failed to solve the problem.

UK BABY LOSES ALL 4 LIMBS FOLLOWING HORRIFIC SEPSIS INFECTION

Now, in a move that echoes Flint, Mich., the city is distributing bottled water.

Last fall, the city distributed water filters to residents to reduce lead levels in drinking water while it implemented new corrosion control methods.

According to the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, lead exposure is devastating. Lead serves no purpose in the human body and there is no safe level of lead in drinking water. Children are especially at risk of its deadly effects. Early exposure can have lifelong consequences, such as intellectual disabilities, the agency says.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) letter, the agency is “unable at this time to assure Newark residents that their health is fully protected when drinking tap water filtered through these devices.”

The EPA places the onus to provide bottled water to Newark residents on the city.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a joint statement with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka that he is prepared to make bottled water available to residents. He further stated that Newark is expanding the testing of filtered drinking water to more Newark homes and that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is “working with the filter manufacturer to determine the scope of the situation.”

The city handed out nearly 40,000 PUR water filters, half of which were donated by the company. In a statement, PUR said it has been “working diligently with the City of Newark to understand the situation, assist with the establishment of testing protocols for additional sampling, and help them determine next steps.” PUR says its faucet filters are “independently tested and certified by NSF International (NSF) to remove 99 percent of lead at levels up to 10 times the applicable federal and state drinking water standard of 15 parts per billion (ppb).”

Erik Olson, senior director of health programs at Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), is “troubled” by these developments. NRDC, an environmental group, sued Newark last year for failing to comply with regulations for the control of lead in drinking water.

MASSACHUSETTS MAN WITH DEADLY MOSQUITO-BORNE VIRUS IN A COMA, DAUGHTER SAYS

“Everyone in Newark deserves safe drinking water,” Olson said, in a statement. “We welcome EPA’s recent letter stating that Newark residents with lead service lines should be provided bottled water, though we do not understand why EPA does not insist on protecting other at-risk people such as those with lead plumbing and whose water tests high for lead. We also continue to be concerned about risks to residents in the eastern part of the City, the Wanaque service area.”

The bottled water distribution targets families served by the Pequannock water system with lead service lines who have received filters. Other Newark residents are served by the Wanaque water system, which was not prioritized for filters.

Newark does not know why the filters are failing, but one resident is not surprised by the turn of events.

“We’ve been telling them this for the last two years, but we were looked at as crazy,” said Debra Salters, a member of advocacy group Newark Water Coalition.

“We told [city officials] to give out bottled water and now they’re talking about they’re only giving out two cases. That’ll be gone by the end of the night,"" she said.

According to Salters, residents must show two forms of identification to collect water. She believes that complicates an already alarming situation.

“You couldn’t listen to the residents who pay your salary. You had to wait until the federal government put their foot on your neck and made you do something,” Salters said. “This is a life crisis.”

A reduction of lead levels is expected by the end of this year as stated in Murphy’s and Baraka’s statement. They are “optimistic” that the new corrosion control treatment will “prevent leaching from lead pipes.”"
Trump Administration Seeks Decertification Of Immigration Judges' Union,https://www.npr.org,['Richard Gonzales'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/12/750656176/trump-administration-seeks-decertification-of-immigration-judges-union,"Trump Administration Seeks Decertification Of Immigration Judges' Union

Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP

The Justice Department late last week moved to seek the decertification of the union representing hundreds of U.S. immigration judges, ratcheting up a simmering battle over the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies.

The department filed a petition Friday asking the Federal Labor Relations Authority to determine whether the certification of National Association of Immigration Judges as the union representing some 440 immigration judges should be revoked ""because the bargaining unit members are management officials under the statutory definition,"" according to a Justice Department spokesperson.

""This is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the DOJ to evade transparency and accountability, and undermine the decisional independence of the nation's 440 Immigration Judges,"" Judge Ashley Tabaddor, speaking in her capacity as president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said in an emailed statement. ""We are trial court judges who make decisions on the basis of case specific facts and the nation's immigration laws. We do not set policies, and we don't manage staff.""

The administration and the immigration judges union have been at loggerheads over a variety of issues, including the judges' status as employees of the Justice Department. Judges are appointed by the attorney general and they are not part of the independent judiciary. They have publicly argued for their separation from the Justice Department.

Last year, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions took the unusual step of reviewing some judicial decisions in the name of reducing the backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases clogging the courts.

Sessions also ordered judges to end the practice of temporarily removing cases from their dockets without issuing decisions, a move known as ""administrative closure.""

The Justice Department also imposed a quota system on judges, linking the number of cleared cases to their performance evaluations. The judges' union said the courts need more immigration judges, not assembly-line proceedings.

President Trump has appointed 190 immigration judges since taking office. As of June 2019, there are more than 900,000 pending cases in immigration courts, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

The move to decertify the immigration judges' union comes as no surprise to many judges.

""Clearly they want to use the judges to ramrod through cases and ramp up deportation regardless of any due process defects their policies have,"" said one judge who isn't authorized to speak for the union and requested anonymity. Without the union, judges would be effectively muzzled and unable to publicly share their views about the courts, the judge added.

This is not the first time the Justice Department has tried to decertify the immigration judges' union. The Clinton administration sought decertification, but the Federal Labor Relations Authority rejected the notion that judges are managers who make policy. But some judges are concerned that the FLRA under the Trump administration would be less sympathetic to the union.

""It's absurd that anyone would consider us managers,"" said Tabaddor, a judge based in Los Angeles. ""We don't even have the authority to order pencils."""
Shrieking heard from Jeffrey Epstein's jail cell the morning he died,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-death-shrieking-heard-jail-cell-morning-he-died-metropolitan-correctional-center/,"On the morning of Jeffrey Epstein's death there was shouting and shrieking from his jail cell, a source familiar with the situation told CBS News. Corrections officers attempted to revive him while saying ""breathe, Epstein, breathe.""

Congress is the latest to start investigating Epstein's apparent suicide over the weekend, with new reports raising questions about the federal jail where he was being held. One of Epstein's guards at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on the night he died was reportedly not a regular corrections officer.

On Monday, Attorney General William Barr criticized the detention center where the disgraced financier was held. ""We will get to the bottom of what happened and there will be accountability,"" Barr said. ""I was appalled and frankly angry to learn of the MCC's failure to adequately secure this prisoner.""



Government investigators raided the alleged sex trafficker's private island in the Virgin Islands Monday.

With Epstein gone, potential co-conspirators involved in his alleged sex-trafficking network are shifting into focus. British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is one of four women accused of recruiting underage girls for sex. She's denied those claims in the past and has not been charged with a crime. Maxwell is said to be Epstein's ex-girlfriend turned business associate. Her current location is unknown.

""She was more of a partner in his obsession, really,"" said Miami Herald reporter Julie Brown, who spent more than two years looking into Epstein's controversial 2008 plea deal. ""And there are allegations that she was involved in having sex with some of these girls as well.""



Court documents from 2011 reveal Epstein controlled several apartments in a building just blocks from his $77 million New York townhouse and allegedly housed ""underage girls from all over the world.""

Barr also issued a stern warning for anyone who may be evading justice: ""Let me assure you that this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein. Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims deserve justice and they will get it.""



CBS News has learned that Epstein's estranged brother Mark was called and he identified Epstein's body. The New York City Medical Examiner's office has performed an autopsy, but the results are still pending.

In an interview with our West Palm Beach affiliate WPEC-TV, a former Florida corrections worker said Epstein was ""treated like a celebrity"" during his 13-month stint in a county jail after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. She claims his cell was regularly left unlocked and she saw him move freely through the dormitory area — sometimes completely naked — without repercussions."
Flint mayor says her heart is with Newark as residents there line up for bottled water,https://www.mlive.com,['Ron Fonger'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2019/08/flint-mayor-says-her-heart-is-with-newark-as-residents-there-line-up-for-bottled-water.html,"FLINT, MI -- Mayor Karen Weaver, who’s dealt with Flint’s water crisis since she was elected in 2015, is offering her support to residents of Newark, New Jersey, as that city’s water emergency reaches new heights.

Newark residents lined up this week to pick up bottled water after the U.S. Environmental Protection requested that the state provide it because new testing showed filters at two of three tested homes weren’t removing lead from tap water as expected.

Not only did Flint suffer with elevated levels of lead in water across the city, it also discovered some homes with lead concentrations that were also higher than faucet filters could handle.

“I was devastated to turn on my television only to find another community in America is now relying on bottled water due to lead contamination. I immediately thought of all of the residents and how they were effected and what they must be feeling,"" Weaver said in a news release issued by the city on Tuesday, Aug. 13.

Frustrated Newark residents line up for bottled water in lead crisis Hundreds of Newark residents lined up on Monday to get free bottled water after recent tests raised questions about the effectiveness of filters used to remove lead from the water.

“It is time for this country, for Congress, for the president to act as it relates to infrastructure. We knew that Flint was not the only place facing such a crisis, we were just the most publicized, and we warned against the dangers of not dealing with failing and aging infrastructure all over the country.”

Newark has so far handed out 38,000 nationally-certified water filters to residents who have lead service lines that connect underground water mains to homes.

Newark’s most recent testing under the Lead & Copper Rule this year showed 30 percent (113 out of 370 samples) of tested sites exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per billion for lead.

Lead is not coming from Newark’s source water, officials there have said, but is flaking off lead service lines to homes.

Just last month, Flint’s Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha visited Newark, suggesting that residents only use bottled water for drinking.

Hanna-Attisha’s study of blood lead levels in Flint children led to widespread recognition of the water crisis in 2015."
DHS in a ‘Mad Scramble’ to Catch Up With Domestic Terror,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-homeland-security-is-in-a-mad-scramble-to-catch-up-with-domestic-terror,"It wasn’t that long ago that senior Department of Homeland Security officials shied away from focusing on domestic terrorism, often fearing political backlash.

The White House pushed the sprawling department to focus overwhelmingly on immigration enforcement, at the expense of just about everything else. DHS veterans told reporters that white supremacist terror was the FBI’s issue, not theirs. When a DHS analyst warned of far-right violence in 2009, congressional Republicans bellowed in protest, with a lasting chilling effect. Under the Trump administration, the department disbanded a group of intelligence analysts focused on domestic terrorism. Cybersecurity staffers got shipped to the border. In the days after the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, leading DHS minds focused on the migrant caravan. And, as NBC reported, the administration cut funding for DHS grants designed to prevent radicalization.

But as white supremacists have terrorized communities around the country, senior officials at DHS have tried to step up their work against the threat. They fought to get that counter-radicalization money back, for instance. A consensus within the department slowly began to form: DHS exists to fight terrorism—even when those terrorists are American.

Then came the El Paso shooting, which left 22 people dead in the Texas border city. That’s when, in the words of one senior DHS official, “ the dam broke.”

“There were robust conversations before El Paso,” added that official, who spoke anonymously to discuss internal talks. “Acting DHS Sec. Kevin McAleenan has been very clear that this is a top priority for the Department, as Nielsen had also previously stressed. But the conditions are different now. We will ensure the Department is doing everything possible with existing capabilities and resources, and seek more capabilities and resources as needed. And more will be needed.”

Since the shootings in El Paso and Dayton that left 31 people dead, DHS officials are working overtime to find ways to ramp up domestic terrorism prevention efforts, according to four DHS officials familiar with the situation. But it’s not easy, sources said; over the last two years, the department has maximized resources focused on border security, and it’s already strained.

“These two shootings have caused a mad scramble where they are pulling every publication and book off the shelf in an attempt to figure out what they can do to address this problem,” said one former DHS official.

Senior DHS leadership had a call on Saturday night after the El Paso shooting and then again on Sunday afternoon, after a second shooter killed 10 people in Dayton. The violence was spiraling. So McAleenan directed senior officials to start a working group to assess what DHS was doing about domestic terrorism and what more it could do immediately, according two sources familiar with the situation. The department’s advisory council is supposed to speak with McAleenan about domestic terrorism prevention this week, one of those sources said.

It’s too soon to tell if El Paso will be a turning point for DHS. But just taking a serious look at what the department is doing to fight domestic terrorism and what more it can do—that marks a significant moment, especially when many in the White House remained laser-focused on stopping the flow of immigrants.

“People are scrambling,” said a current DHS official.

And they aren’t alone. The Daily Beast reported last week that the National Counterterrorism Center, another 9/11-era counterterror institution, has also quietly amped up its work fighting domestic terror.

DHS, meanwhile, heightened its efforts last week after President Trump condemned white supremacy and domestic terrorism. For more than two years, according to current and former DHS officials, the White House has directed the department to rev up its efforts to deal with the mass flow of migrants into the country.

Now, department officials are looking to elevate the mission to prevent domestic terrorism by leveraging existing resources and surging capabilities from throughout the department, according to another senior DHS official. It’s not dissimilar to the concept the department uses in responding to a natural disaster, the official added. The number of people involved is smaller, but it draws from people all across the department. They’re also putting together an action plan looking at the growing threat from domestic terrorism, according to multiple DHS sources.

“To ensure our communities are safe, we are focusing efforts on enhancing our prevention and preparedness, and creating response assets in communities so they will be better able to mitigate risk and respond to these kinds of events when they do occur,” McAleenan said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “So far we’ve reached thousands of people in communities around the country, educating them about indicators of radicalization or mobilization to violence. Community awareness can play a major role in preventing an attack.”

But significant turnover among senior DHS leadership has complicated its efforts to help state and local law enforcement partners.

“Trying to find someone in charge at DHS overall—it’s been hard lately!” said one senior state law enforcement official who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “Since DHS has been in existence, it’s always been fairly chaotic. But this is probably the longest it’s been with so many people in acting positions.”

The department’s effort to increase its focus on domestic terrorism has left officials in DHS playing catch up. One official said some of the individuals working overtime do not have domestic terrorism experience, as most have spent their careers on international terrorism.

“That’s a bit of a challenge,” said the official.

The challenge hasn’t gone unnoticed.

“This scramble is a direct result of the fact that notwithstanding concerns raised by some in DHS over the past several years, there have been no serious planning efforts by the department to focus on [domestic terrorism],” said John Cohen, former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “That’s due in large part because of the insistence by the White House that the department first and foremost focus on immigration and border security.”

The Daily Beast reported on DHS’ decision to disband a group of domestic terror analysts just days before McAleenan took office. Soon after, the secretary directed a review of all DHS efforts to combat targeted violence and domestic terrorism, including programs funded by federal grants doled out to the department in 2017, a department spokesperson said.

“Given the proof-of-concept nature of these programs, DHS was not prepared until earlier this year to make an assessment of their efficacy,” a spokesperson for the department said, adding that McAleenan directed the department to request more funds for domestic terrorism prevention for fiscal year 2020."
States sue to block EPA's coal power plant emissions rule,https://www.cnn.com,['Gregory Wallace'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/politics/lawsuit-coal-rule-epa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A coalition of states and cities will ask a federal court to block the Trump administration's overhaul of emission regulations for coal-fired power plants.

The administration rolled out its Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, rule earlier this summer, shifting regulatory authority to states while also promoting energy independence and offering hope to the struggling US coal industry.

It replaced one of the Obama administration's hallmark plans to address climate change, the Clean Power Plan. A divided Supreme Court had blocked that rule from taking effect while challenges to its legality played out.

The Trump-led Environmental Protection Agency said the rule would not overstep the legal bounds that Republicans believe Obama's plan crossed. But the EPA itself says the rule could result in 1,400 more premature deaths by 2030 than the Obama-era plan it will replace.

Several states pledged to sue over the Trump administration plan. In the lawsuit , 22 states and seven cities will claim the rule ""disregards requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.""

Gutfeld: Trump's feud with Scaramucci shows he's the 'Al Davis of presidents',https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-scaramucci-feud-gutfeld-al-davis,"President Trump's feud with Anthony Scaramucci is the latest example of the commander-in-chief's commitment to winning at all costs, according to Greg Gutfeld.

""Donald Trump is like the Al Davis of presidents,"" Gutfeld said Monday on ""The Five,"" referring to the iconic longtime principal owner of the Oakland Raiders. ""He had a singular motto, which was 'Just win, baby' -- he didn't care how. He attracted rough, scary and weird people -- that was the entire Oakland Raiders.""

SCARAMUCCI BREAKS WITH TRUMP, SAYS GOP MAY NEED 'CHANGE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET'

Davis served as head coach-general manager of the Raiders in the 1960s and later was GM and principal owner until his death in 2011.

Of the comparison between Davis and Trump, the ""Greg Gutfeld Show"" host said he saw a similarity between the Raiders' choice of players and the individuals hired by the White House.

""You also get these weird third-stringers,"" he added, naming Scaramucci and former White House aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman -- who, post-termination, attacked Trump in a ""tell-all"" book.

""They get in under the guise of loyalty and then when it doesn't work out, they turn on you... He's like Omarosa.""

Earlier Monday, Scaramucci told CNN the president has a ""nihilistic way to his personality.""

""I think you have to consider a change at the top of the ticket when someone is acting like this,"" he told anchor John Berman.

After the televised remarks, Trump fired back on Twitter, claiming Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House director of communications in 2017, was upset at not being rehired.

""Scaramucci, who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory, is only upset that I didn’t want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be),"" Trump wrote.

""Also, I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!"""
Investors Can't Stop Talking About USDA's Bombshell Report,https://www.agriculture.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/analysis/investors-cant-stop-talking-about-usdas-bombshell-report,"Markets are sure sagging greatly after our spring rally on the horrible planting conditions.

That is interesting. Yesterday USDA’s August report cut corn/bean planted acreage another 5 million acres (mostly beans) – and the corn market went limit down!

From the market’s perspective, it rallied greatly during the difficult planting season, and when the weather cleared up, it started to drop. Realistically, the Pro Ag yield model for corn has risen 9 bushels per acre since 6/24/19, which would represent 700 to 750 mb increased production of corn. That alone is enough for the corn market to go down, and down it did go.

Even though we are still wrangling over how many acres actually were prevented from planting (USDA-FSA said 19 million acres so far), the market seems done trading that old news.

Instead, it’s trading new news (the improved crop conditions). Even in yesterday’s report, where USDA had 2 million more acres of corn than expected, it was the 3.5-bushel-per-acre yield hike that hurt the market the most. What will likely be even bigger news will be our first frost date: When will it come, and how much crop will it damage? As late as millions of acres of corn/beans were planted, even a late frost will bring some yield loss.

USDA, yesterday, took the market by surprise with another huge shift in acreage from soybeans to corn (about 3 million acres), which in August is quite late to report on. The shift is disguised in a remake of prevent-plant acres, but it is there for all to see.

Essentially, USDA is saying that farmers ‘corrected’ the market shortage of corn by simply stealing acreage from soybeans (where stocks were already plentiful). Then they also slashed demand for both corn and soybeans, mainly over the Chinese new preference to buy all their needs from South America and the FSU countries of Russia and Ukraine instead of the U.S. (Maybe we should be reviewing who we buy our Walmart goods from?)

So, the corn planted acreage estimate was 90 million acres (2 million more than expected, but down 1.7 million from July). The soybean planted acreage estimate was 76.7 million (4.3 million less than expected, and 3.3 million less than July). Planted acreage of corn and soybeans were reduced 5 million acres from the July report, but still markets were sharply lower yesterday (corn limit down).

Why was that negative?

The problem was that expectations were much worse on planted acreage – we already priced in a poor 2019 crop. Yet, the crop has improved the past few months, as reflected in USDA’s 3.5-bushel-per-acre hike in corn yields from July to 169.5 bushels per acre. Also, demand was reduced (mostly for China), and both corn and soybean exports were reduced 100 mb each along with ethanol use.

So demand is poor, and the crop is still improving. With a warm fall now in the forecast, we might even be allowed to mature a lot more of the late-planted crop than expected as well.

Weather forecasts have continued to get wetter and warmer; today we have a forecast of normal/above-normal precip and warm temps for the entire 14-day forecast. That’s a huge improvement from the cold and dry forecast last week (which could stress crops).

The central Corn Belt is forecast to have above-normal precip, with the rest of the Corn Belt near normal. Temps will be normal/above normal in the next seven days, and warm further to above normal in the eight- to 14-day forecast... perfect weather to finish a late crop year.

Temps cooled just enough in late-July and August to prevent stress during pollination, and now they’re warming as we near normal frost periods. It could hardly have been ordered any better for the Corn Belt!

Farm Service Acres

Ironically, FSA released numbers yesterday. It reported a total of 19 million acres of prevented planting, including 11.2 million of corn, 4.35 soybeans, and 2.2 million wheat. Including failed acres or PP, there were 85.8 million acres of corn reported, 74 million of soybeans, and 46.3 million of wheat. These numbers will need to be digested a bit more to reconcile with USDA’s August report, but it appears they still have too little PP corn in their numbers.

Crop Progress

The USDA's Crop Progress Report, also released yesterday, showed corn and soybean conditions the same as last week (57% corn G/E and 54% soybeans). The Pro Ag corn yield model rose 0.5 bushel per acre to 172 bushels per acre, and soybeans were down 0.13 bushel per acre to 47.66 bushels. Note that is above USDA’s 169.5-bushel corn yield, and below the 48.5-bushel-per-acre soybean yield.

Soybeans may actually have a more bullish case than corn right now.

Corn is only 7% dented (9% behind normal), and silking 90% (9% behind), and dough 39% (22% behind).

Soybeans are 82% blooming (11% behind normal) and 54% setting pods (22% behind normal).

Sorghum is 61% headed (13% behind) and 26% coloring (9% behind), with conditions down 2% to 66% rated G/E.

Winter wheat is 89% harvested (7% behind), with HRS wheat 8% harvested (22% behind). HRS conditions are 69% G/E (down 4%) vs. 75% last year at this time.

Barley is 15% harvested (24% behind), with conditions losing 2% this week to 74% G/E (down from 81% last year).

Soil moisture levels stabilized at 63% adequate/surplus, while subsoil slowed its decline to only 2% this week (now 69% adequate/surplus).

State Department's overly broad travel warnings undermine US mission,https://thehill.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/457170-state-departments-overly-broad-travel-warnings-undermine-us-mission,"BERBERA, SOMALILAND — To depart Mogadishu’s heavily-armed international airport — Somalia’s “green zone” — is an expensive prospect. Decades of lawlessness and instability in Mogadishu make insurance almost impossible. Few foreigners will pass outside the airport’s heavily fortified walls without armored cars and multiple personal security contractors. Most diplomats in Somalia (including America’s and Europe’s) are either sequestered inside the airport or remain in Kenya.

But Berbera is a different story. The main port in the northern region of Somaliland is thriving. New hotels are opening. Locals and foreigners intermingle on the beach, and both men and women gather on doorsteps and in tea houses in the evening to watch football, gossip, or shop. In Somaliland’s capital Hargeisa, money changers leave bundles of cash unattended as crime is so low. While al-Shabaab repeatedly strikes deep into Mogadishu and Kismayo, there has not been a terrorist attack in Hargeisa in more than a decade. While President Bihi’s government in Somaliland controls approximately 50,000 square miles of territory, President Farmajo in Mogadishu has secured only around 50,000 square feet, equivalent to the grounds of Villa Somalia, Somalia’s heavily-fortified White House.

According to the State Department’s travel warning, there is no difference between the two regions. “Do not travel to Somalia due to crime, terrorism, kidnapping and piracy,” it warns. It declares violent crime pernicious across regions, and continues to warn about piracy, even though Puntland’s pirates have not captured a single ship in more than two years, and Somaliland’s coast guard has never permitted piracy off its 450-mile coast.

ADVERTISEMENT

Inaccurate and imprecise State Department warnings are not limited to Somalia. The State Department’s Iraq warning neither acknowledges Iraqi Kurdistan’s decades-long security nor the dramatic drop in Baghdad violence. The United States recently got a taste of its own medicine when Uruguay issued a travel warning citing “growing indiscriminate violence, mostly for hate crimes, including racism and discrimination” as a reason to avoid travel to the United States, even as most towns and cities — let alone rural America — remain safer than ever.

Overly broad travel warnings matter. They undercut diplomacy and diminish soft power when America needs it most. They inflate insurance costs and dissuade investment. In effect, the State Department’s embrace of travel warning inaccuracy risks ceding entire countries to Russian, Chinese, Turkish, or Iranian influence as their businessmen sink roots while their American counterparts are absent.

There are other second order effects. Many universities now forbid students to study or research in areas subject to travel warnings. The irony here is that the countries where there are warnings are arguably the areas in which the United States most needs specialists.

They also breed corruption. I watched food shipments arrive in Berbera supervised by the World Food Programme. Because the UN, like the United States, does not differentiate between Somalia and Somaliland, the UN employees receive thousands of dollars of bonuses monthly due to supposed hazardous conditions which, in reality, do not exist. In short, it’s an expensive scam which costs American taxpayers. U.S. diplomats likewise receive similar danger pay and hardship bonuses, undermining the State Department’s already limited budget.

The reasons for such inaccurate warnings are complicated. Part of the problem is no security officer wants to loosen restrictions fearing that they could become a scapegoat in case of any future terrorism. This is why, more than a quarter century after the end of the Lebanese civil war, U.S. diplomatic security parameters remain largely unchanged. The Benghazi tragedy has also led the State Department to double down. Regional Security Officers feel the best way to protect staff is to hold them in gilded prisons, never mind undercutting any effectiveness.

ADVERTISEMENT

Sometimes policy interferes. Since 2015, the State Department has refused to treat Somaliland differently than Somalia so as not to reinforce its separatism. That fiction not only undermines the veracity of all State Department warnings, but also cedes Somaliland to Russia or China.

Indeed, it can be a vicious circle as overly broad warnings become reason to dissuade diplomatic visits necessary to reassess the real situation, and they can even stand in the way of Congressional delegations and oversight.

Make no mistake: It’s essential to keep America’s diplomats and Americans safe, but inaccuracy and the State Department’s penchant for playing games with warnings risks undermining the reception of legitimate warnings and undermines the broader U.S. mission.

Did Trump Brag About Crowd Sizes While Past Presidents Consoled Massacre Victims?,https://www.snopes.com,['Dan Macguill'],,,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-beto-crowds-el-paso-victims/,"In the aftermath of a spate of mass shootings in August 2019, attention turned to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tone in discussing the killings, and the wider issue of gun violence in the United States, as well as his comportment in visiting two of the cities affected, El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

Trump was criticized for smiling and offering a thumbs-up gesture while visiting an infant whose parents had been shot to death in a massacre in El Paso, and allegations that the president was using the tragedies as an opportunity to gain political capital extended to unfounded rumors that his administration had hired “fake” medical staff to pose with him at a hospital in Dayton.

On Aug. 9, the left-leaning Facebook page Occupy Democrats posted a meme that purported to highlight a stark difference in tone and decorum between Trump — who supposedly used a visit to El Paso to brag about crowd sizes and snipe at Democratic presidential candidate and former Congressman Beto O’Rourke — and his predecessors in the Oval Office — who purportedly offered words of comfort and solidarity in the aftermath of previous mass shootings.

We received multiple inquires from readers about the accuracy of the meme, which read as follows:

“Littleton, I can only say tonight that the prayers of the American people are with you.” — Bill Clinton, after Columbine. “This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech community — and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation.” — George H.W. [sic] Bush. “Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation. You are not alone.” — Barack Obama. “Crazy Beto only had like 400 people in a parking lot, they said his crowd was wonderful.” — Deplorable Trump, in El Paso.

The caption of the meme read: “SERIOUSLY, what is WRONG with Trump?!?! He REALLY said this to the El Paso victims.”

The Occupy Democrats meme was a largely accurate recounting of four post-shooting statements made by the four most recent occupants of the White House. (Strictly speaking, Trump was addressing medical staff who had treated victims of the El Paso shooting, rather than the victims themselves, and the second quotation was, apparently in error, attributed to George H.W. Bush, rather than George W. Bush.)

Despite the authenticity of the quotations, the meme presented an incomplete and rather misleading picture of Trump’s overall comportment in visiting El Paso after the August 2019 massacre there. While the president did indulge in side-sniping about a political opponent who had been fiercely critical of him (something his predecessors markedly did not do in similar circumstances), Trump did also offer words of solidarity and comfort to the victims of the August 2019 massacres, their families, and the wider communities affected by the shootings.

Clinton

The first quotation in the meme was taken from remarks Bill Clinton delivered in a White House press conference on April 20, 1999, the day of the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colorado. His speech can be read in full here, and viewed in full in the video below.

In the most relevant section, Clinton said:

“To the families who have lost their loved ones, to the parents who have lost their beloved children, to the wounded children and their families, to the people of the community of Littleton, I can only say tonight that the prayers of the American people are with you.”

﻿

Bush

The second quotation in the meme came from a speech that George W. Bush gave on April 17, 2007, during a convocation at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, the day after a student shot to death 32 people on that campus. The full text of his speech is available here, and it can be watched in full below.

In the section quoted by Occupy Democrats, Bush said:

“Laura and I have come to Blacksburg today with hearts full of sorrow. This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech community, and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation. We’ve come to express our sympathy. In this time of anguish, I hope you know that people all over this country are thinking about you and asking God to provide comfort for all who have been affected.”

Obama

The third quotation in the meme was taken from a speech Barack Obama gave during an interfaith vigil at Newtown High School on Dec. 16, 2012 — two days after a shooting massacre at nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

The speech can be read in full here, and watched in full in the video below. During the relevant section, Obama said:

“Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation. I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts. I can only hope it helps for you to know that you’re not alone in your grief. That our world, too, has been torn apart. That all across this land of ours, we have wept with you, and we’ve pulled our children tight. And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we will provide. Whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you, to ease this heavy load, we will gladly bear it. Newtown, you are not alone.”

Trump

The fourth and final quotation in the meme consisted of remarks Trump made while talking to hospital staff during a visit to University Medical Center in El Paso on Aug. 7, 2019, four days after a mass shooting at a Walmart store in that city.

Police in El Paso have linked the suspected shooter, Patrick Crusius, to a white nationalist manifesto posted online shortly before the massacre began. The author of the manifesto decried what he characterized as a “Hispanic invasion of Texas” and espoused the discredited “white genocide” theory.

Although the manifesto’s author, thought by El Paso police to be the suspected Walmart shooter, stipulated that his anti-immigrant sentiment predated the elevation of Trump to the presidency, some observers have pointed out areas of overlap between how the president talks about immigration and immigrants, and how the manifesto addressed them.

Others, including Democratic politicians and long-standing critics of the president, went further in connecting Trump to the manifesto and the El Paso shooting. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said the manifesto was so similar to Trump’s rhetoric that it “could have been written by the people that write Trump’s speeches.” O’Rourke described the massacre as “an act of terror inspired by [Trump’s] racism.”

Conventional news media were not permitted to accompany the president and first lady Melania Trump on their visits with shooting victims, families and medical staff in Dayton and El Paso on Aug. 7, but amateur footage emerged later that showed Trump addressing medical professionals at University Medical Center in El Paso.

In the short clip, the president commended the work done by hospital staff in caring for the victims of the shooting, saying “the job you’ve done is incredible,” and “it’s an honor to be with you.” Without any obvious reason or prompt, Trump then shifted to talking about a rally he had held in El Paso in February 2019 (although he mentioned “three months ago,” Trump’s most recent rally in the city was in February, six months earlier):

“I was here three months ago and we made a speech and we had a — what was the name of the arena? — that place was packed … That was some crowd, and we had twice the number outside. And then you had this crazy Beto — Beto had like 400 people in a parking lot, they said, ‘His crowd was wonderful!’ …”

Trump was referring in those remarks to a counter-protest held in response to his Feb. 11 rally at the El Paso County Coliseum. The counter-protest was led by O’Rourke and was estimated to have had between 7,000 and 15,000 attendees — considerably more than the “400 people in a parking lot” claimed by Trump.

During his rally, Trump thanked the El Paso fire department for allowing 10,000 of his supporters to enter the arena, despite the venue’s having a capacity of 6,500. In response, a spokesperson for the fire department corrected the president, insisting that no special permission had been given, and the number of attendees inside the arena was no greater than its capacity. At other times, Trump claimed that as many as 35,000 supporters had come to the rally, taking into account those outside the arena.

For an unknown reason, Trump decided to re-open that six-month-old dispute and grievance over crowd sizes and news coverage, while meeting and praising hospital staff who had treated and cared for the victims of a mass shooting. That struck some observers as grossly inappropriate, and we found no record of former Presidents Obama, Clinton or Bush having engaged in similar behavior while meeting the victims of past shootings or the medical professionals who had treated them.

However, Trump’s “crazy Beto” aside was not the extent of his remarks on the massacres in Dayton and El Paso, and the Occupy Democrats meme misled readers by cherry-picking that unscripted moment and comparing it with remarks made by previous presidents from behind a podium, during prepared speeches.

In a White House address on Aug. 5, Trump offered sentiments of solidarity and comfort to the victims of the Dayton and El Paso shootings and their families:

“The First Lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their families, and the survivors. We will stand by their side forever. We will never forget. These barbaric slaughters are an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation, and a crime against all of humanity. We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil — the cruelty, the hatred, the malice, the bloodshed, the terror. Our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents, children, husbands and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives. America weeps for the fallen.

“We are a loving nation, and our children are entitled to grow up in a just, peaceful and loving society. Together, we lock arms to shoulder the grief. We ask God in heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer, and we vow to act with urgent resolve.”

﻿

The salient difference between Trump and his three most recent predecessors was not that they gave “presidential” speeches after mass shootings, because Trump, too, gave a relatively dignified speech from the White House. The key difference, in the context of the Occupy Democrats meme, was in Trump’s comportment and behavior when he stepped away from the podium. We therefore rate the truth of this meme as “Mixture.”"
Newark hands out bottled water amid growing lead crisis following EPA rebuke,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/newark-bottled-water-epa-crisis-lead-flint-vulnerable-communities-1cdc6e5f8436/,"One of New Jersey’s major cities is offering bottled water to its residents after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) raised glaring concerns over dangerous lead content in the area’s drinking supply.

The growing crisis in Newark comes after years of resident concerns over lead in drinking water, leading many people last fall to start using water filters on their taps. That change hasn’t gone far enough, the federal government says, and now the city is facing water issues reminiscent of other areas, like Flint, Michigan.

Both cities are majority black with many residents living below the poverty line — groups that tend to suffer environmental crises disproportionately.

New Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy (D) and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) said Sunday that beginning Monday, bottled water would be available to city residents concerned about water quality.

“Access to safe drinking water is critically important to our administrations and we take health risks associated with lead in drinking water very seriously,” the officials said in a joint statement.

The move comes amid growing controversy over lead in Newark’s drinking water, a problem that stretches back several years. Some of the city’s lead service pipes are around a century old, sparking concern among public health experts. And since at least 2018, inadequate corrosion treatment at the Pequannock water plant has led to high lead levels in some residents’ tap water, breaching 15 parts per billion, the standard set by the EPA.

After downplaying the city’s water issues for over a year, Newark in October 2018 gave away 38,000 water filters to address the problem. But residents say they still have lead in their drinking water. On Friday, the EPA sent a letter to the city and state advising bottled water usage for residents in homes with lead pipes.

“[W]e are unable at this time to assure Newark residents that their heath is fully protected when drinking tap water filtered through these devices,” the EPA wrote, after testing water at two residences in Newark.

Under President Donald Trump, the EPA has repeatedly said that water issues are the country’s top environmental problem, above climate change. But Newark’s crisis reflects ongoing contamination trends across the country. And it’s not just lead that’s leaching into the water.

Toxic “forever chemicals” found in non-stick pans and many other everyday items have appeared in water around the country, including in Michigan. And in states like Iowa, agricultural runoff is polluting well water. In both instances, health and environmental advocates have argued the EPA is not doing enough to address the problem.

But the agency indicated it might assert its authority if Newark’s situation does not improve. The EPA said it “is prepared to take appropriate action” to protect public health in the city.

Contact with lead can result in growth development problems, neurological issues, and occasionally fatalities. Lead in public drinking water can be especially problematic given the universal nature of water consumption.

In Flint, a drinking water crisis that began in 2014 affected around 100,000 people after the city switched its water source. Multiple deaths are associated with lead pollution there and residents have repeatedly accused public officials of lying to them about the extent of the issue. Litigation over responsibility for Flint’s tragedy remains ongoing.

EPA data has repeatedly shown that communities of color and low-income areas disproportionately suffer from environmental problems, like air and water issues. And while Newark, like Flint, is heavily black with a high poverty rate, the city has so far worked to avoid comparing the two situations, even as Newark’s public health crisis grows.

Mayor Baraka has previously called on Trump to help Newark address its water issues. In January, Baraka told the White House the cost would likely be around $70 million. Prior to that, the city had historically argued that its water was safe to drink, despite concerns.

Now, the city is advising residents to run their taps for five minutes before using the water. Bottled water is only being distributed to certain residents who had previously received filters, although pregnant people and young children are advised to drink bottled water. Baraka has insisted that the bottled water is only a “preliminary precaution.”

But advocates argue the city still isn’t doing enough. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Newark Education Workers Caucus (NEW Caucus) sued city and state officials in 2018, arguing that systemic failures had allowed the lead contamination to occur. Both groups greeted the city’s move towards bottled water for impacted residents but expressed continued concern.

“We are deeply troubled by the City’s announcement [confirming the lead issues],” NRDC’s Senior Director of Health and Food Erik Olson said in a statement, going on to express hope that both NRDC and NEW Caucus “can work cooperatively with the City to address this serious public health crisis.”"
Cray lands $600 million contract from DOE to build El Capitan exascale supercomputer,https://www.zdnet.com,['Natalie Gagliordi'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/cray-lands-600-million-contract-from-doe-to-build-el-capitan-exascale-supercomputer/,"Supercomputer maker Cray has landed a $600 million contract to build the El Capitan exascale system in partnership with the US Department of Energy (DOE), the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). This is the third US exascale win for Cray, which is in the process of being acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $1.3 billion.

Cray is one of the leading players in supercomputing, with its systems powering three of the world's top 10 supercomputers. The company recently announced another Exascale supercomputer contract for more than $600 million for the DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Cray's architecture and interconnect technology are also part of a $500 million, 1 exaFlop supercomputer called Aurora set to arrive in 2021 at Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago.

El Capitan will be the first exascale supercomputer for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and will exclusively serve its efforts to ensure the safety, reliability and security of the nation's nuclear stockpile. The system will include Cray's new Shasta architecture, ClusterStor storage and Slingshot interconnect technology.

Cray said its updated Shasta architecture, which was also unveiled on Tuesday, fuses high performance computing with the modularity and ease-of-use of cloud computing. That so-called fusion is at the core of why HPE has sought to acquire Cray. In a nutshell, HPE wants to offer a future HPC-as-a-Service platform and ramp up its ability to sell supercomputing products to enterprise customers.

""As we enter the exascale era, modern applications are creating the need for applying supercomputing capability to a new class of digital transformation problems. What is the domain of a few national laboratories today is fast becoming a necessity for every enterprise,"" said Cray CEO Peter Ungaro. ""With our new software platform, Cray is delivering a fully featured, extensible software and tools environment that performs like a supercomputer and runs like a cloud. The same Cray technology that powers exascale systems can be delivered in a single, low-cost rack and ready to integrate into any data center environment.""

CLOSE The White House's former top lawyer, Don McGahn, defied a congressional subpoena and skipped a hearing. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department accused a House panel Tuesday of ""judge shopping"" in trying to get a favorable ruling to enforce its subpoena for Don McGahn, President Donald Trump's former White House counsel.

McGahn, a key figure in former special counsel Robert Mueller's report about Russian interference in the 2016 election, defied a subpoena in May from the House Judiciary Committee for his documents and testimony, under a request from the White House. The panel filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court to enforce the subpoena.

When the panel filed the lawsuit Aug. 7, it argued that it belonged with the same judge who will decide whether to grant Congress access to grand-jury evidence in Mueller's report.

But Chief Judge Beryl Howell, who is hearing the grand-jury case, asked for arguments about whether she should also hear the McGahn case or assign it randomly to another judge, as is customary when cases are filed.

Douglas Letter, the House counsel representing the committee, argued that the same issues will be at stake in both cases because they both deal with evidence about whether to recommend Trump's impeachment, so it makes sense for the same judge to hear them.

""The factual overlap extends to the specific types of evidence the Judiciary Committee is amassing, as well as findings the court must make regarding the committee's need for that evidence,"" Letter said in a written argument Monday.

But the Justice Department replied Tuesday that the random assignment of cases is a fundamental part of the judicial process.

""Among other purposes, that general rule guarantees fair and equal distribution of cases, avoids the appearance of favoritism in assignments, and reduces opportunities for both the appearance and the reality of parties attempting to game the system by shopping for a judge they perceive as more favorable to their cause,"" a trio of department lawyers said in a written argument.

""In an attempt to circumvent the process,"" the committee sought to have the case designated as related to the grand-jury case, the department argued.

Howell set no deadline for deciding the issue.

The lawsuit is one of several legal challenges between Congress and the White House, as lawmakers seek to investigate Trump and his administration. The committee chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., has said Trump potentially obstructed justice in trying to thwart Mueller's inquiry, as described in passages of the report involving McGahn. But Trump has argued the investigations are a partisan witch hunt with no justification.

McGahn defied the panel’s subpoena in May at the request of White House lawyers, who argued that presidential advisers have an absolute immunity from testifying before Congress. A U.S. District Court ruled in 2008 that presidential advisers weren’t entitled to absolute immunity, but the White House and Congress settled the case before an appeals decision was reached.

Nadler has dismissed absolute immunity as nonsense. Nadler has said that if the federal courts uphold the subpoena, it could open the door to information from other former White House aides.

The committee argued that the same judge should hear the grand-jury and McGahn cases because they deal with the same potentially obstructive acts by Trump. Both cases deal with whether Trump acted with ""corrupt intent,"" according to the House filing.

""McGahn is therefore a critical link connecting the two cases,"" according to the filing. ""His unique role as the most important witness to possible obstruction, and so his place in both the committee application and the complaint, reinforces the relatedness of the two matters.""

But the Justice Department said the cases ""could not be more different."" The grand-jury case deals with rules of criminal procedure in cases, while the McGahn case is a civil enforcement matter, according to the argument.

""Yet the committee offers no reasoning or authority supporting the notion that any suit of any nature seeking information for the purpose of advancing a broad 'investigation' constitutes a related case,"" the department said in its filing. ""These matters arose from different events and have different origins.""

Trump allowed McGahn to meet with investigators for 30 hours during the nearly two-year inquiry. Trump now contends any documents McGahn could provide the committee are White House property and should remain confidential.

Democrats have focused on the 10 episodes of potential obstruction of justice detailed in Mueller's report, including efforts to fire the special counsel.

Trump called McGahn at home June 17, 2017, and told him Mueller had conflicts and should be removed, according to the Mueller report. Rather than carry out the order, McGahn decided that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre, a reference to former President Richard Nixon firing prosecutors during the Watergate investigation. Trump later met with McGahn in the Oval Office and pressured him again, but McGahn refused.

McGahn later told Trump's chief of staff that the president had asked him to ""do crazy s---,"" according to the report.

But White House lawyers have argued that the House can't compel McGahn's testimony because his communications must remain confidential as a top aide to the president.

The McGahn case represents the latest in a variety of legal challenges pending between Congress and the executive branch. The Judiciary Committee held Attorney General William Barr in contempt for refusing to provide an unredacted version of Mueller's report, and the full House found Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for refusing to provide documents about a citizenship question for the census.

Other House panels have won court rulings for access to Trump's personal financial documents, but the president has appealed those rulings. The Judiciary Committee filed a lawsuit on July 26 seeking access to grand-jury evidence supporting the Mueller report, which Barr blacked out in the version he provided Congress. And the panel continues to press Trump aides and associates with subpoenas.

Watchdog report says Trump's State Department hiring freeze impacted safety,https://thehill.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457178-inspector-general-report-says-trumps-state-dept-hiring-freeze,"A 16-month hiring freeze at the State Department hurt both safety and morale within the department, according to a report released Friday by the State Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG).

The watchdog found 96 percent of embassies and consulates and 95 percent of domestic offices and bureaus said the hiring freeze ""had a somewhat negative or very negative effect on overall operations.""

A full 100 percent of bureaus and offices responding to a survey told the OIG the freeze, imposed by President Trump Donald John TrumpSecurity analyst calls Trump's language on Hong Kong protests 'inappropriate' Americans' opinions about China hit record low: survey Pentagon watchdog says it is officially reviewing billion 'war cloud' contract MORE in January 2017 and ended in May 2018, hurt employee welfare and morale. Only slightly fewer embassy and consulate respondents — 97 percent — said the same thing.

""Several bureaus charged with protecting security, health, and life safety reported to OIG that the hiring freeze had significant detrimental effects on their operations,” the report said.

For example, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security said it was unable to fully staff its command center, which is responsible for monitoring potential threats against U.S. diplomats and American citizens abroad, during the freeze, according to the report.

""DS said that even staffing the center with the minimum staff needed to operate contributed to employee burnout and fatigue and led to coverage gaps that could have significantly affected its ability to respond to overseas security crises,"" the report states.

The survey results found the hiring freeze also hurt State Department operations domestically, with the Bureau of Medical Services telling the OIG that due to staffing shortages it was less prepared to provide services for children of overseas employees with special needs or process medical clearances for staffs, and was also hindered in mental health operations such as determining suitability for law enforcement officers authorized to carry weapons."

A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that air pollution—and in particular ozone, which is increasing with climate change—makes the lung disease progress faster. If you live in a city with high ozone levels for a decade, the results are similar to smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for three decades.

Some past research has found that short spikes in air pollution can worsen lung disease in people who are already sick, and other research has linked air pollution to asthma in children. But this study was the first to look in detail at the long-term effects of air pollution on lung health in adults. “Chronic obstructive lung diseases like emphysema are collectively now one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among older adults,” says Joel Kaufman, professor of environmental and occupational health sciences and epidemiology in the University of Washington’s School of Public Health. “And the relationship between air pollution and the development of those conditions is not well understood.” More than a quarter of people who have emphysema were never smokers.

The researchers studied more than 7,000 people over 18 years in six metropolitan areas, including particularly smoggy cities like New York City and Los Angeles, looking at local air pollution levels and CT scans of the lungs of the participants. Different types of pollution—particulate matter, black carbon, nitrogen oxide, and ambient ozone—were all associated with increasing levels of emphysema in the lungs. But the link with ambient ozone was especially strong.

Climate change, unfortunately, is making ground-level ozone increase; ozone is formed when sunlight reacts with chemicals emitted from cars and other sources of pollution, and warmer temperatures make things worse. It’s another argument in favor of electric cars and buses—or boosting other alternative transportation, like biking and walking—in cities. “There’s this confluence of reasons to be working on reducing fossil fuel use,” says Kaufman. “Because both is leading to increased air quality problems and climate change. And climate change is going to lead to new air quality problems—it’s kind of all working together.”"
"Four men sentenced for child pornography, DOJ says they used bitcoin and Tor to cover their tracks",https://www.cnbc.com,['Kate Fazzini'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/doj-sentences-four-for-child-porn-used-bitcoin-tor-to-cover-tracks.html,"Four men from across the U.S. and Canada were sentenced to decades in prison for running what the Justice Department called a ""highly sophisticated"" encrypted underground network for trading child pornography.

The Justice Department said the four convicted men ran a ""global child exploitation enterprise"" called ""The Giftbox Exchange"" on the open-source Tor Network, which uses an overlay network for directing internet traffic, obfuscating the details, locations and identities of those using it.

The website was paid for through bitcoin transactions, and the men ""used other advanced technological means to thwart law enforcement efforts, including file encryption and cryptography.""

Patrick D. Falte, 29, of Franklin, Tennessee, was sentenced to 35 years in prison for engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, three counts of advertising child pornography, and three counts of distributing child pornography. Benjamin A. Faulkner, 28, of Ontario, Canada, was sentenced to 35 years in prison; Andrew R. Leslie, 24, of Middleburg, Florida, was sentenced to 30 years in prison; and Brett A. Bedusek, 35, of Cudahy, Wisconsin, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, for their roles in the scheme.

Three of the men had already been sentenced for child sex crimes, according to the DOJ.

The case was aided by the Justice Department's Project Safe Childhood, and the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation and High Technology Investigative Unit, which have been tasked with investigating crimes against children that involve the use of encrypted communications, anonymizers and other sophisticated technologies.

The FBI has increasingly called on technology companies to help break various encryption methods to help find online criminals, including sex offenders. Christopher Wray highlighted several cases at an FBI cybersecurity conference in July in which he said companies helped the bureau find and rescue abused children through their cooperation.

"Acting CBP Director: These Aren't Raids On The Undocumented, They Are Law Enforcement On Illegal Immigrants",https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/08/11/acting_cbp_director_these_arent_raids_on_undocumented_immigrants_they_are_law_enforcement_operations_on_illegal_immigrants.html,"CNN's Jake Tapper interviewed acting Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan about the Mississippi ICE raids which took place this week.



""I never said the 'raids,' as you called them, would be focused on violent criminals,"" Morgan said. ""I think words matter. These aren't raids. These are targeted law enforcement operations. And, in this case, this was a joint criminal investigation with ICE and the Department of Justice targeting worksite enforcement, meaning companies that knowingly and willfully hire illegal aliens, so that, in most cases, they can pay them reduced wages, exploit them further for their bottom line. That is what this investigation was about, a criminal investigation.""





""So it seems like undocumented workers, the dad of that little girl and the like, often bear the brunt of these raids and not the employers who hire them. Isn't it important to hold businesses responsible for this?"" CNN's Tapper asked.



Morgan replied: ""These aren't undocumented immigrants. They are illegal immigrants. They are here in this country illegally. They're obtaining jobs illegally.""



""So I think words matter,"" he repeated. ""And let's keep in mind that ICE and -- during this target enforcement operation, they took extraordinary efforts to make sure that when -- everyone that was apprehended, they had actually agents dedicated full time during the operation, that they did nothing but be prepared to reach out to schools, to reach out to day care. And every single person that they apprehended, the first question that they asked was, do you have a child? Where are they? Are they at day care or are they at school?""





TAPPER: Now, you and the president said just a few weeks ago that the pending ICE raids coming down the pike were going to be really focused on violent criminals. That is not what happened here in Mississippi. Why not?



MARK MORGAN, ACTING COMMISSIONER, U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: Well, so, first of all, I never said that the raids, as you call, were focused on violent criminals. I have never said that.



And, also, I think words matter. These aren't raids. These are targeted law enforcement operations. And, in this case, this was a joint criminal investigation with ICE and the Department of Justice targeting work site enforcement, meaning companies that knowingly and willfully hire illegal aliens, so that, in most cases, they can pay them reduced wages, exploit them further for their bottom line.



That is what this investigation was about, a criminal investigation, Jake.



TAPPER: All right, so I want to get to that in one second.



MORGAN: Sure.



TAPPER: But just to give your exact quote -- you're right, you didn't say violent.



You said -- quote -- ""Their part has always been and it will be to go after those that are criminal aliens, meaning those people that are here illegally and have committed additional crimes against American citizens.""



MORGAN: So that was my response to a question about priorities, and that ICE's priorities will always be to go after criminal aliens as a priority.



That doesn't mean they exclude all demographics. We still have to apply consequences, meaning enforce the rule of law, for those individuals that are here illegally against immigration law.



TAPPER: So it seems like undocumented workers, the dad of that little girl and the like, often bear the brunt of these raids and not the employers who hire them.



Isn't it important to hold businesses responsible for this?



Syracuse found -- university -- researchers at Syracuse University found that, from April 2018 to March 2019, the Trump administration prosecuted zero companies and only 11 individuals for employing undocumented immigrants?



Obviously, hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants have been targeted.



MORGAN: So, think about what you are saying, Jake.



So, you're saying, on one hand, that we're not doing enough, and then, when we go out and we actually do what you're saying we need to do more of, they are chastised for doing that.



(CROSSTALK)



TAPPER: Well, I'm saying, why aren't you focusing more on the companies and the business owners?



MORGAN: They -- they are.



Again, this was a joint criminal investigation between ICE and the Department of Justice, which was targeting the companies that were hiring illegal aliens.



That's exactly...



TAPPER: Are there any charges against the companies or the business owners?



MORGAN: It is a pending investigation right now. There was a criminal search warrant to go in there to collect more information, more intelligence. And that investigation is ongoing. But that is the intent of that investigation.



TAPPER: Is it important for businesses to not employ these individuals who are in this country illegally and exploit them, as you suggested?



MORGAN: Absolutely.



And -- but it is twofold. So I think the American people need to understand that is exactly what is happening. So these individuals seeking a better life first are being exploited by the cartels to come here.



TAPPER: Right.



MORGAN: Once they come in the United States, then they're further exploited by United States companies by paying them reduced wages.



But that is only the first element of this. These individuals here and the girl -- I know it is emotional. I know it is done on purpose to show a picture like that.



TAPPER: What is done on purpose?



MORGAN: But -- but -- to show the girl. Jake, listen...



TAPPER: Just the people in the wake of these raids. We interview people who are affected by them.



MORGAN: But -- but how about interview the people that -- because a majority of time in these cases, these individuals that are here illegally, they also steal identities of U.S. citizens, they get fraudulent documents, Social Security cards and et cetera.



[09:20:00]



And so it is not just a victimless crime that is going on here. First of all, they are here illegally. And then a lot of times, there is additional fraud that goes with this for them to try to get these jobs in the companies.



So I understand that the girl is upset. And I get that. But her father committed a crime. And just so the American people know also, is that girl, her mother was home, and she was reunited with her mother within a few hours that night.



TAPPER: I want to ask you, because -- because, I mean, you're talking about how this is a pending investigation into these businesses, but we see the human cost of this borne by the undocumented immigrants and their families over and over and over again.



And, like, I just gave you this statistic from Syracuse, in the last year, zero companies prosecuted, only 11 individuals prosecuted.



I mean, if you focused on the companies, wouldn't that have more of a deterring effect than going after these individuals, who are desperate?



MORGAN: So, Jake, again, I -- I -- this is the third time -- that was the intent of that investigation.



TAPPER: But I'm talking about, in the last year, only -- zero companies and 11 individuals for the last year.



MORGAN: I -- I can't speak to the Department of Justice on how many cases they have.



I'm the commissioner of CBP, so I'm not involved in those investigations.



But what I can tell you is, that is exactly what this investigation was about. And, again, let's go back to words matter. These aren't undocumented immigrants. They are illegal immigrants. They are here in this country illegally. They're obtaining jobs illegally.



So I think words matter. And let's keep in mind that ICE and -- during this target enforcement operation, they took extraordinary efforts to make sure that when -- everyone that was apprehended, they had actually agents dedicated full time during the operation, that they did nothing but be prepared to reach out to schools, to reach out to day care.



And every single person that they apprehended, the first question that they asked was, do you have a child? Where are they? Are they at day care or are they at school?



They had phone banks there for everybody to call to reach out to their loved ones and their children. Again, these agents contacted over 12 schools, and they made sure that they were -- had a full understanding of where everybody is.



And that is why over 300 of the 600-plus arrested that were reunited on humanitarian reasons, because they had kids, they had children. They were released on their own recognizance."
EPA Won't Approve Warning Labels for Glyphosate,https://www.webmd.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/news/20190812/epa-wont-approve-warning-labels-for-glyphosate,"Aug. 12, 2019 -- Warning labels for the suspected cancer-causing weed killer glyphosate (Roundup) won't be approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer says glyphosate is ""probably carcinogenic,"" which has led California to require warning labels on glyphosate products, the Associated Press reported.

However, California hasn't enforced the warning label rule because Roundup maker Monsanto last year obtained a court order blocking the warning labels until the lawsuit is resolved.

The EPA says its research shows the chemical poses no risks to public health and won't approve warning labels for glyphosate products, the AP reported.

The EPA considers labels warning glyphosate to cause cancer to ""constitute a false and misleading statement,"" which is prohibited by federal law, Michael Goodis, director of the agency's registration division in its Office of Pesticide Programs, said in letters to companies explaining the EPA's stance.

Chandra Lord, a representative for Monsanto’s parent company Bayer AG, said the EPA’s announcement “is fully consistent with the science-based conclusions reached by the agency and leading health regulators worldwide for more than four decades.”

“Glyphosate is not carcinogenic,” Lord said.

It's unusual for the EPA to tell a state it can't go beyond the federal requirements, according to Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity.

""It's a little bit sad the EPA is the biggest cheerleader and defender of glyphosate,"" Hartl told the AP. ""It's the Environmental Protection Agency, not the pesticide protection agency.""

Glyphosate-related lawsuits involving about 13,000 plaintiffs are pending against Monsanto. Juries have awarded damages in each of three cases that went to trial in California."
"Barr defends police, takes swipe at 'social justice reformer' prosecutors",https://www.theday.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.theday.com/national-politics/20190813/barr-defends-police-takes-swipe-at-social-justice-reformer-prosecutors,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General William Barr staunchly defended the work of law enforcement Monday — promising to push for new legislation to swiftly carry out the death penalty for suspects who commit mass shootings or kill police officers, while also taking aim at prosecutors who ""style themselves as 'social justice' reformers.""

Barr, who had a tough-on-crime approach in his previous stint as the nation's chief law enforcement officer in the early 1990s, lauded efforts to keep chronic offenders behind bars with long sentences. In his speech to the Fraternal Order of Police conference in New Orleans, he said that helped seriously cut down violent crime. He also said the government must have ""zero tolerance"" for suspects who resist the police and denounced protesters who threw water on New York City police a few weeks ago as ""prancing punks.""

That hardline stance, however, puts Barr at odds with today's criminal justice reformers. While the tough-on-crime thinking was common among law enforcement officials in the early 1990s — as the national violent crime rate peaked — many in the criminal justice field now favor rehabilitation instead of incarceration.

President Donald Trump has pushed efforts to overhaul the criminal justice system, often touting bipartisan legislation he signed last year that gives judges more discretion in sentencing and eases mandatory minimum sentences. At the same time, the president has been an ardent defender of police — once telling officers in a speech they shouldn't ""be too nice"" to suspects they arrest — and has a long history of advocating for the death penalty. Those positions tend to popular with the president's conservative political base.

In his speech, Barr praised federal prosecutors who have brought more cases against violent criminals and drug dealers in an effort to curb the opioid epidemic. But he added that more needs to be done, saying that most of the illegal drugs being trafficked into the U.S. are being brought in by Mexican drug organizations and other transnational gangs.

""Obviously, the head of the snake is outside the United States,"" he said. ""We must destroy these cartels.""

Barr took a hard swing at prosecutors who don't embrace the same tough-on-crime stance. He said appointing such progressive district attorneys is ""demoralizing to law enforcement and dangerous to public safety"" because they ""spend their time undercutting the police, letting criminals off the hook, and refusing to enforce the law.""

Across the U.S., some longtime prosecutors have been met by more reform-minded challengers, some of whom have vowed not to prosecute lower-level offenses, like drug possession and other misdemeanors.

""So these cities are headed back to the days of revolving door justice,"" Barr said. ""The results will be predictable. More crime; more victims.""

Barr promised that the Justice Department would propose legislation to expedite criminal cases against suspects charged in mass shootings and the killings of law enforcement officers, so they could face quick punishment, including the death penalty.

""Punishment must be swift and certain,"" Barr said.

He also said there should be more of an appreciation for the work of law enforcement officers.

""The 'thin blue line' is getting thinner,"" he added."

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 1.63%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also lower at around 2.127%.

The spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields narrowed to about only 5 basis points on Monday, near its lowest level since 2007.

""Persistently low inflation in developed economies should constrain nominal yields, and tariffs are more likely to weigh on prices via demand destruction,"" Michael Reynolds, investment strategy officer at Glenmede Trust Company. ""Overall, these factors are holding back aggregate demand for both consumer spending and business investment, culminating in lower bond yields that reflect diminished growth expectations.""

Market focus is largely attuned to simmering trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.

On Friday, President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and called into question the next round of trade talks. It comes after the U.S. president said he would impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports on September 1. China responded by halting its purchases of U.S. agricultural products.

Last week, the U.S. accused China of being a currency manipulator after Beijing allowed the yuan to dip below the 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade.

On Monday, the People's Bank of China set its daily midpoint for yuan trading — which determines the limits for its onshore movement — at 7.0211 per dollar. That was weaker than Friday's session, but stronger than market expectations.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury is set to auction $42 billion in 13-week bills and $42 billion in 26-week bills."

Focus on identity management and crypto tokens

The Department of Commerce’s listing hints at the future hire’s duties and responsibilities in general terms, revealing only that they will be tasked with research and development into potentially disruptive technologies at the department’s Information Technology Laboratory.

It notes that the candidate’s role will include a focus on the cybersecurity capabilities and requirements necessary for the successful implementation of emerging technologies.

Yet in its outline of the experience required of candidates, the listing indicates that identity management in connection with blockchain will apparently be of particular importance for the role.

Applicants should have experience with:

“National and global identity management programs and identity tokens” and in “standards and national and international standards bodies developing identity management, blockchain and identity token interoperability standards.”

The appointment is for a short-term vacancy — not to exceed one year — at a salary of up to $166,500.

Federal agencies step up blockchain activity

This April, Cointelegraph reported that the U.S. federal government is expected to raise its blockchain spending to $123.5 million by 2022 — an over 1,000% increase as compared with the $10.7 million it spent in 2017.

In June, the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration — which forms part of the Department of Commerce — reached out for feedback on blockchain policy, as officials forecast an increasing focus on the technology in coming years.

The Department of Commerce has been responding to developments in the blockchain sector since 2016."

The bureau's release called it ""an apparent suicide,"" and said the FBI is investigating. Two law enforcement sources told CNN that Epstein died by suicide.

Barr said he was ""appalled"" to learn of Epstein's death while in federal custody awaiting trial.

""I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody.

""I want people to know that if they come into the United States illegally, they're getting out. They're going to be brought out. And this serves as a very good deterrent,"" he said.

The operation was carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Wednesday and resulted in the detention of 680 illegal immigrants. Agents targeted a food processing plant in Mississippi and swarmed the facility with federal search warrants in hand.

""The execution of federal search warrants today was simply about enforcing the rule of law in our state and throughout our great country,"" U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said in a statement.

""I commend these federal agents, our state and local law enforcement partners, and our federal prosecutors for their professionalism and dedication to ensure that those who violate our laws are held accountable.""

VA moving to deliver electronic health record modernization,https://www.militarytimes.com,"['Robert Wilkie', 'Leo Shane Iii']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2019/08/13/va-moving-to-deliver-electronic-health-record-modernization/,"The Trump administration is working to deliver a win for veterans that prior administrations could not: a unified electronic health record (EHR) solution between the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The solution will give doctors instant and seamless access to veterans’ full-service health records and history. The new solution will compile data from service records so it can be accessed years later by doctors at DoD, VA, and in the private sector, providing clinicians with a full picture of veterans’ medical history and driving faster, smarter connections between military service and health outcomes.

VA, DoD tout major progress in effort to join electronic health records systems The departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs are eyeing the end of the summer for significant advances in their efforts for a new, joint electronic health record, a move that both bureaucracies have made the long-term centerpiece of medical reforms for their patients.

Republicans, Democrats, and veterans want this change, and we are on the way to realizing this dramatic improvement.

Here is how the Trump administration is working to accomplish this important goal:

First, we created the Office of Electronic Health Record Modernization (OEHRM) to oversee the transition. John H. Windom oversees OEHRM as the office’s executive director.

While at DoD, Windom led a team to acquire, test, integrate and begin deploying a new EHR solution for more than 9.6 million service members and their beneficiaries — the very system to which VA is transitioning.

Second, we made sure we understood the scope of the problem. This ambitious project is not just about synching DoD and VA records. It is about making VA health records compatible with each other — across the different systems where a veteran has received care — something that has never been done.

× Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief - a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.

The Trump administration inherited VA’s legacy EHR, the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA), a system that even today uses more than 100 different ways to collect and maintain patient records across the country. No administration has successfully created a single longitudinal health record before, but we intend to deliver this capability for veterans.

A related challenge is making sure we get VA staff up to speed with how to collect, enter and use health data under the new system. Proper education and training take time, and it is a big part of the reason why we are cascading deployment of the new EHR solution over 10 years. Caring for veterans remains our top priority, and VA is committed to supporting clinicians and care providers throughout the transition to maintain high-quality health care for veterans.

Third, we are closely aligned with DoD as it implements the same EHR solution. We work closely with DoD to capture lessons learned from their deployment and make VA’s implementation as smooth as possible.

When transitioning to a new EHR solution, many organizations struggle with change management and training, but VA is learning from DoD’s experience and ensuring it gains as many efficiencies as possible.

Fourth, we are hitting our deadlines. A data center will host all VA data and serve as the backbone of our new health record solution — and we completed it ahead of schedule.

Senators skeptical over long-term VA health records overhaul The $16-billion, 10-year plan is designed to bring VA medical records in line with Defense Department files.

We are on track to start using the new EHR solution at three VA medical centers in Washington state by April of 2020. VA will first deploy its EHR solution at Seattle, American Lake, and Mann-Grandstaff medical centers. These three were chosen as initial operating sites in alignment with DoD’s deployment schedule.

And finally, we are rolling out the new EHR solution at an achievable pace. The contract I signed to implement sweeping EHR reforms ensures uncompromised care to veterans by allowing VA to maintain legacy systems until all VA facilities have transitioned to the new EHR and provide comprehensive, on-site training and support to clinical and administrative staff.

The new EHR solution was a 10-year contract for a reason. It calls for a rolling implementation schedule through 2027, one that will move about a dozen hospitals to the new solution each year starting in 2021, along with dozens of associated VA clinics. We will be looking for and anticipate efficiencies along the way, and look forward to delivering our new solution to our veterans.

That schedule aligns with VA’s broader goal of making sure we avoid any possible risks to patient safety while we undergo this massive modernization effort.

Is there anything about VA’s EHR modernization effort that’s easy? No.

That is why we will continue to resist the pressure to rush the process and stay focused on doing it right. Neither veterans nor taxpayers want to see billions of dollars spent on another failed attempt.

They want a lasting result. That is why we are taking the time to do it right, to finish the job we started, and to fundamentally change how VA delivers veteran-focused, provider-friendly care."

The head of the Environmental Protection Agency says people in Western Pennsylvania should not worry about air pollution from Shell's cracker plant in Beaver County.See the EPA administrator's comments and the report by Action News Investigates in the video player above.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will visit the cracker plant in Monaca. Aides said he would tout the 5,000 construction jobs and 600 permanent jobs being created at the site.Earlier this year, Action News Investigates found the cracker plant will bring thousands of tons of air pollutants to a region that already has some of the nation's dirtiest air.The plant's permit calls for far higher levels of volatile organic compounds than the Clairton Coke Works, one of the biggest polluters in the region.The cracker will emit more ammonia -- another toxic chemical -- than the coke works and the Edgar Thomson Works steel plant combined.Also, the cracker plant will produce 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 488,000 cars.All that has environmental advocates worried about the health of people living near the plant, as well as downwind as far away as Pittsburgh.But EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said there is no cause for concern.""We are closely monitoring both the permit and the emissions and we're looking at the overall emissions environment of Western Pennsylvania. We want to make sure the air quality overall is positive for everyone who lives in Western Pennsylvania,"" Wheeler said.Wheeler also addressed concerns that the plastic produced at the cracker plant would worsen the growing issue of plastic pollution.""These products are being made here instead of China, India or other countries so you save on the carbon footprint of transporting the finished products from halfway around the world. So this is actually a win for the American public and it's producing the products that we use here in our own backyard,"" Wheeler said."

"Attorney General Barr 'appalled' by Epstein's apparent suicide, says inspector general and FBI investigating",https://www.cnbc.com,['Emma Newburger'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/10/there-is-nothing-to-suggest-foul-play-fbi-investigating-jeffrey-epsteins-death-by-suicide.html,"U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein (C) appears in court where he pleaded guilty to two prostitution charges in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S. July 30, 2008.

Attorney General Bill Barr said Saturday that he is ""appalled"" by Jeffrey Epstein's death, and has consulted with the Inspector General about an investigation after Epstein hanged himself and was found in his jail cell early on Saturday.

""I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody,"" Barr said.

""Mr. Epstein's death raises serious questions that must be answered. In addition to the FBI's investigation, I have consulted with the Inspector General who is opening an investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein's death.""

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed in a statement Saturday that the FBI would investigate the suicide of the financier, who is accused of sexually abusing and trafficking underage girls. There is nothing at this point to suggest foul play, a senior law enforcement official said.

The FBI normally does not investigate suicides at federal prison facilities, but officials said that given the nature of Epstein's case, an ""abundance of caution"" would be taken.

Last month, a week after being denied bail on federal sex trafficking charges, Epstein was found semi-conscious on the floor of his jail cell with marks on his neck. Prison officials were investigating that incident as a possible suicide attempt.

Epstein was in his own cell, but was not currently on suicide watch at the time of his death, people familiar with the investigation said.

Epstein was being held without bail in the jail since his arrest in early July at an airport in northern New Jersey after arriving there on his private plane on a flight from Paris. He was arrested on federal charges of sexually abusing and trafficking girls in the early 2000s.

Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, where Epstein was staying, has a suicide prevention program for inmates who are at risk of killing themselves. The suicide prevention jail cells must provide an ""unobstructed view of the inmate"" and ""may not have fixtures or architectural features that would easily allow self-injury,"" according to Bureau of Prisons policy.

Michael R. Bromwich, a former inspector general for the Department of Justice, called for an ""immediate and comprehensive DOJ Inspector General investigation to determine who is responsible"" on Saturday morning."
Former Vice President Joe Biden Trips Up With Gaffes,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-08-12/former-vice-president-joe-biden-trips-up-with-gaffes,"Joe Biden keeps stumbling over the same obstacle as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination--himself.

The party's front runner continues to make gaffes, which he has done many times during his lengthy career. This is providing new openings for critics to lambaste him as unable to clearly articulate his ideas and not suited for the presidency.

The former vice president, 76, told reporters in Iowa Saturday that he was vice president when a mass shooting occurred in February 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. that left 14 students and three educators dead. Biden said he met with students who survived while he was vice president but Biden actually left the vice presidency more than a year before the massacre. A Biden aide told Bloomberg News that the candidate was thinking of the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. that left 20 children and six staff members dead. Biden met with the Newtown survivors while he was vice president, the aide said. He met with the Parkland survivors after he left office.

Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield wrote on Twitter Sunday, ""Wouldn't it be nice to have a president who consoles Americans in their time of need so often that he sometimes mistakes the timing? But even more so, wouldn't it be nice to have a president who actually fights to prevent these tragedies?""

Biden also said Thursday night in Des Moines that ""poor kids"" are just as smart as ""white kids."" Biden told the Asian and Latino Coalition, ""We should challenge students in these schools that have Advanced Placement programs in these schools. We have this notion that somehow if you're poor, you cannot do it. Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids."" Biden paused very briefly, then added: ""Wealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids, no, I really mean it. but think how we think about it.""

Earlier Thursday, Biden garbled his remarks when he told a crowd at the Iowa State Fair that Americans ""should choose truth over facts."" He also referred to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when he meant the more recent Prime Minister Theresa May.

President Donald Trump, 73, told reporters at the White House, ""Joe Biden is not playing with a full deck. This is not somebody you can have as your president. But if he got the nomination, I'd be thrilled.""

Trump wrote on Twitter Saturday, ""Joe Biden just said, 'We believe in facts, not truth!' Does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president? We are 'playing' in a very big and complicated world. Joe doesn't have a clue!""

Biden spokeswoman Bedingfield said Trump is ""desperate to change the subject from his atrocious record of using racism to divide this country.""

Bedingfield, referring to Biden's remarks on poor children, said the candidate ""misspoke and immediately corrected himself during a refrain he often uses to make the point that all children deserve a fair shot, and children born into low-income circumstances are just as smart as those born to wealthy parents."""

Trump DHS to block more immigrants who rely on government assistance,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-dhs-to-block-more-immigrants-who-rely-on-government-assistance,"The Trump administration in October will enlarge the pool of immigrants who can be barred from entry or denied visa renewals because of their reliance on U.S. government benefits, according to a rule change published in the Federal Register.

The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services formally submitted the update to a 1999 rule on Monday. The rule further expands the definition of a ""public charge,"" a term the government uses to indicate a noncitizen has a history of receiving long-term financial or other assistance.

""Through the public charge rule, President Trump’s administration is reinforcing the ideals of our self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful here in America,"" USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli said during a press conference Monday morning.

Immigrants seeking to enter the United States for the first time as well as those seeking renewal of visas will be judged based on assistance they have accepted from the federal government for at least 12 months in any 36-month period, including cash benefits, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, most forms of Medicaid, and some housing programs, according to the new rule. The Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program and Medicaid were not previously part of the 20-year-old rule.

Applicants who apply after the Oct. 15 effective date will be judged on whether they used SNAP or Medicaid prior to then. The other listed programs will also factor into the decision because they have been among the criteria for decades.

USCIS officers will not look at whether an applicant was a recipient of emergency medical assistance; disaster relief; the National School Lunch Program; the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children; Children’s Health Insurance Program; Medicaid, if the person is under 21 years old; energy assistance; and other assistance or related entities.

In 1999 the then-Immigration and Naturalization Service implemented the policy to limit green cards, or permanent residency, to legal immigrants who received cash benefits. However, a person's request for a green card, the step prior to being able to apply for citizenship, was not affected by his or her use of healthcare or SNAP benefits.

The Department of Homeland Security rolled out the proposal in September.

Cuccinelli said the change will be relevant in the review of about 400,000 annual applications."
DC lawyer's trial to serve as test for Justice Department's foreign lobbying enforcement work,https://www.cnn.com,"['Katelyn Polantz', 'Erica Orden']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/11/politics/greg-craig-trial-justice-department-foreign-lobbying/index.html,"(CNN) One of Washington's most well-known and accomplished lawyers, the former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, goes to trial Monday in Washington in a case likely to be seen as a litmus test for the Justice Department's efforts regarding foreign lobbying.

Craig is accused of concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine after he left the Obama administration and joined the Skadden firm as a partner. According to his charges, he cut a deal in 2012 to earn $4 million from a Ukrainian client for the law firm by producing a supposedly independent report on the jailing of a political rival of the then-Ukraine president.

Craig had been caught up in the expansive federal probe of Ukrainian influence in American politics tracked by special counsel Robert Mueller and now led by the Justice Department's National Security Division and US Attorney's Office in DC.

The trial will discuss the influence efforts by Mueller defendants Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, both former Trump campaign leadership, who allegedly had tapped Craig to help with pushing a slanted report on Ukrainian politics among American media, according to court records.

The trial will also be, in many ways, a defining moment for the Justice Department's foreign lobbying enforcement efforts.

In March, the department said it would boost its pursuit of foreign influence operations, in part by appointing a prosecutor who worked on special counsel Mueller's team to lead a revamped unit intended to crack down on unregistered foreign agents.

In making the announcement, the department's national security division head, John Demers, specifically cited a settlement involving Craig's former law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, over the work at issue in Craig's trial as spurring the department's interest in enforcement regarding foreign lobbying under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, also known as FARA.

The overhauled unit at Justice now has 11 prosecutors, an increase from years prior. The Craig trial -- with its high profile witnesses and recognizable defendant -- poses a test of the Justice Department's stepped up efforts.

""Disregard for truth undermines our political discourse and it infects our policymaking. If the people don't have the facts, democracy can't work,"" US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson , who is overseeing the Craig trial and presided over the Manafort case in Washington, said about these types of alleged lobbying violations at Manafort's sentencing.

Major trials regarding foreign lobbying violations have been few since the law was enacted in the 1930s.

This year alone, there have been two foreign lobbying cases stemming from Mueller's work: the Craig case and another recent trial in Virginia, where Bijan Kian, a former lobbying partner of Michael Flynn's, was convicted for working as a foreign agent of Turkey . A judge is still considering whether prosecutors presented enough evidence at Kian's trial for the conviction to stand.

""Every law firm and lobbyist who does this stuff has woken up,"" said Andrew Herman, a defense lawyer who counsels clients on foreign lobbying registration. ""Nobody would wish what's happening to Craig on anyone. I think he will be the poster child regardless of the result.""

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the potential impact the Craig trial will have for FARA enforcement.

While coordinating with Manafort's operation, Craig also allegedly reached out to American reporters to shape news coverage of the report -- and, through it all, hadn't disclosed to the Justice Department he was working for Ukrainians, according to prosecutors. Federal law requires those who work on public relations or lobbying efforts in the US to register with the Justice Department under FARA.

Manafort and Gates both admitted to working illegally on the report on behalf of Ukrainian politicians as part of their guilty pleas in the Mueller investigation last year.

In some ways, the Craig case has already imposed significant hurdles for the Justice Department, having bounced between numerous prosecutors' offices before being charged, CNN has reported. After the investigation of Craig was opened by Mueller in 2017, the special counsel's office referred the case to the US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, which devoted significant resources to the investigation.

But that office, despite its aggressive reputation, declined to bring charges, determining that they didn't have sufficient evidence. In January of this year, the case was transferred yet again, this time to US Attorney's office for the District of Columbia.

But by the time Craig was finally charged in April by the DC office, the statute of limitations for the initial matter for which he was investigated -- failure to register as a foreign agent -- had expired.

Craig was charged at the time with two crimes: making false statements and concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine. He pleaded not guilty.

But in recent weeks, the Justice Department faced another setback: the judge threw out the charge over making false statements.

If found guilty of the remaining charge, Craig faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. It is unlikely he would have a sentence so steep, however. Craig was released on a personal recognizance bond following his arraignment in April.

Craig is the highest-profile Democrat to be indicted in connection to Mueller's work. He's so well connected in Washington that the list of people who may be mentioned or who may testify at his trial, according to court records, reads like a who's who list of power and influence inside the Beltway.

Aside from the obvious names of Mueller defendants like Manafort and Gates, jurors will be asked if they've known former congressmen like Jim Slattery, journalists like David Sanger of the New York Times, longtime Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills, lobbyist and political analyst Doug Schoen, prominent white collar lawyers like Brendan Sullivan or the Atlanta judge Clinton Deveaux. The list even includes two Kennedy family members: Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Ted Kennedy; and Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics and nephew of the former President. It's unclear if they would be mentioned or testify, either by presenting evidence or speaking about Craig's character as part of his defense.

Gates is expected to testify as a witness for the prosecution, though what he will say on the stand, especially about his interactions with Manafort, will be limited, prosecutors told the court.

Soon after the Mueller investigation began, defense lawyers in Washington realized how Mueller was spooking lawyers and lobbyists engaged in foreign work, and began pitching their advice on foreign lobbying registration to clients."
The administration said it was moving these agencies for efficiency. Now the truth comes out.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Editorial Board'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-administration-said-it-was-moving-these-agencies-for-efficiency-now-the-truth-comes-out/2019/08/10/854ccd10-b91a-11e9-b3b4-2bb69e8c4e39_story.html,"“WHAT A wonderful way to streamline government,” said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney at a gala last week, referring to the Agriculture Department’s plan to move two of its science agencies out of the D.C. area to the Kansas City region. In celebrating this controversial decision, Mr. Mulvaney laid bare the thinly veiled motivations behind uprooting researchers: not efficiency, but to drive talented workers out.

Since the relocation announcement in June, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has defended the controversial proposal, arguing that relocation will bring researchers closer to the subjects of their research and save the agency millions in employment costs and rent. But the haste and amateurishness of the process raised suspicions about true motives. And, now, Mr. Mulvaney has confirmed those suspicions by celebrating the gutting of the Economic Research Service, a federal statistics agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees grant money for agricultural research. The motivation fits with the administration’s broader hostility toward experts, science and honest data.

In June, a Politico analysis found that the Trump administration barred dozens of climate-change-related investigations from being publicized. Politico also discovered that the research service issued news releases on only two studies directly related to climate change — both of which were favorable to the meat industry.

Even if relocation were justifiable, the USDA’s handling of the process has, so far, been deplorable. The more than 500 agency employees affected by the move were given 33 days to decide between their career and the lives they had established in the District. Approximately two-thirds chose resignation over reassignment. The loss of talent and institutional knowledge creates an irreparable tear in the fabric of the agency — and an entirely foreseeable one. If the USDA’s plan was to “drain the swamp,” as Mr. Mulvaney put it, then it certainly is succeeding — if by swamp, as Post columnist Catherine Rampell wrote, they mean civil service expertise. But if the department wants to carry out its true mission of helping rural America, it should rethink this move.

Research by the USDA is vital to farmers. As economic challenges mount with the ongoing trade war with China, and as climate change poses a growing threat to farmlands worldwide, the work by the ERS and NIFA is indispensable. They not only help farmers improve efficiency and productivity but also help smooth access to international markets.

The relocation is not a done deal. The USDA’s watchdog, the Office of Inspector General, published a report this month that challenges the relocation, which is meant to be completed by Sept. 30. By acting without budgetary approval from Congress, the USDA may have violated the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Rather than waiting for a judicial rebuke, the department should cancel the relocation now."
Editorial: An EPA decision reviving Alaska’s Pebble Mine endangers Bristol Bay and a vibrant fishing economy,https://www.latimes.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-09/epa-alaska-pebble-mine-bristol-bay-salmon-trump,"Just five years ago the Environmental Protection Agency determined that a proposal to dig a massive open-pit copper and gold mine near southwest Alaska’s Bristol Bay — one of the world’s most important salmon fisheries — threatened an environmental disaster. So it issued rules to severely curtail the potential project.

What a difference an election makes. Shortly after President Trump’s appointee, Scott Pruitt, took over the EPA in 2017 he met with the chief executive of Pebble Limited Partnership, owned by Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals, and then just hours later rescinded the Obama administration directive to protect the sensitive wetland area from mining activities. Pruitt later backed off and sent the action for a fuller regulatory review — and then quit his job under a storm of criticism about ethical lapses.

But the EPA has continued Pruitt’s campaign to loosen environmental restrictions and greenlight controversial projects, and on Tuesday the agency announced that it would not use its veto authority under the Clean Water Act to block the mine. That frees the Army Corps of Engineers to decide whether or not to approve the project. (Interestingly, the Army Corps’ preliminary environmental analysis of the project was criticized as insufficient by a Seattle-based EPA official — the same one who, apparently under pressure from superiors in Washington, D.C., rescinded the Obama-era directive. Yes, it can make your head spin.)

Environmentalists, including Natural Resources Defense Council attorney Joel Reynolds, accuse the EPA of abandoning its own findings and opening the door for the Trump administration to deliver a “gift to a foreign mining corporation at the expense of Bristol Bay’s fish, aquatic resources and community.” We would add that the EPA has also abandoned common sense. Mining is an exceedingly messy endeavor which historically has ravaged landscapes and caused significant environmental degradation — just the kind of thing the EPA is supposed to protect against. The agency’s absurd decision to reverse itself and let the Pebble Mine permitting process proceed must be undone either through an unlikely reconsideration by the EPA, legal challenges, or, best yet, rejecting Trump and his cockamamie and dangerous approaches to economic development in the 2020 election .

What’s at stake in Alaska? The proposal is for an open-pit mine and support operations with a potential footprint as large as Manhattan, and a pit descending nearly three-quarters as deep as the Grand Canyon, according to an EPA analysis (which the developers have disputed). Even if it were only half that size, that is an extraordinary amount of environmental degradation at the mine site itself, which would include massive pits to hold millions of tons of mine waste and other leftovers of the mining process — much of it laden with toxic chemicals.

And the site is near two rivers that empty into Bristol Bay, which means that not only would the project destroy thousands of acres of near-pristine habitat and wetlands at the mining site, but it would also imperil the environmental health of Bristol Bay itself — something the Obama EPA recognized. As have the people of Alaska: 65% approved a measure in 2014 that gives the state Legislature veto power over future projects in the Bristol Bay watershed if it determines that the salmon fishery is at risk , a veto it ought to keep handy should federal regulators allow this mine to proceed.

There’s the friction point. Bristol Bay supports a vibrant, long-running economy based on a sustainable fishery — 14,000 jobs in a $1.5 billion-a-year economy, according to some estimates — as well as tourism and other non-extractive businesses. Allowing the mine to go forward would sacrifice the existing and more environmentally friendly economy for gold and copper extraction that could be disastrous for the environment.

The Trump administration is playing favorites here. Its affection for extractive industries has already put hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in the West in play for invasive mining leases for oil, gas, uranium and just about anything else of value the mining industry can find. And yes, many of these materials are vital to economic development, but the Trump administration has earned the nation’s skepticism over whether, in adopting policies and weighing proposed projects, it can be relied upon to shepherd our natural resources in a balanced, sustainable and sensible manner."

While music publishers, songwriters and both ASCAP and BMI are urging the U.S. Department of Justice to reform the consent decrees under which the two performance rights organizations operate, and eventually allow them to expire, music users insist that the consent decrees are vital to the music licensing landscape and without them chaos would reign.

In comments filed with the DOJ by the Radio Music Licensing Committee (RMLC), the Digital Media Association (DiMA) and the MIC Coalition -- whose members includes the former two groups as well as 12 other trade groups -- before an Aug. 9 deadline, the organizations all wonder what has changed since the DOJ concluded its last two-year long review in 2016, when it decided to keep the decrees in place.

The joint statement from the two music user groups, RMLC and DiMA, argue the 65-day comment period for this review, which has the potential to terminate or sunset the decrees, is a woefully ""insufficient amount of time to analyze the effects of such a seismic change in the industry -- much less to complete that analysis and incorporate it into public comments.""

The consent decrees, while different for ASCAP and BMI, have many of the same ingredients. They require ASCAP and BMI to grant a license to any music user that applies for one, even if the two parties can't agree on a rate; provide a forum -- the Southern District of New York Federal Court -- for the rates to be determined, if negotiations fail; require the two PROs to provide alternatives to the blanket license; prohibit them from setting up exclusive licensing agreements on behalf of songwriters so that music users and rights holders can engage in direct licensing; and require the two PROs to offer similar licenses similarly situation licensees.

The consent decrees came about because in 1940 ASCAP enjoyed the ""already extortionate rate of 5% of a station's advertising revenue; and tried to double that rate for 1941,"" the jointly authored comments from RMLC and DiMA explain, providing background. This caused ""many broadcasters"" to stop playing ASCAP music and instead rely on public domain music and BMI, which had started in 1939 and at the time had a limited catalog.

With that rate increase, the DOJ conducted an antitrust investigation and by March 1941 the consent decree had been signed with ASCAP rate at 2.25% of a radio station's rate, or less than half of what it was able to get in 1935. In order to align the two PROs, the DOJ also came up with a similar consent decree for BMI in 1941.

Consequently, ""It would be a public policy error of the highest order for the Department to seek to eliminate or materially alter those essential, pro-consumer 'rules of the road' -- at least without a replacement legal regime at the ready to substitute in and perform a similar function,"" according to the joint comments from the RMLC and DiMA. ""These are not some archaic, outdated settlements of legal disputes whose relevance has long-since dissipated. They are the cornerstones of contemporary music licensing practices in industries from over-the-air radio, to digital streaming platforms, and beyond.... The public interest would be severely harmed if they were diluted, significantly limited, or -- worse yet -- put on a path to outright elimination by the Department.""

In recent years, court rulings solidified what ingredients are entrenched in the decrees so that publishers either have to be all-in or all-out on the blanket licenses. That means they can't use the blanket license mechanisms to provide music to radio, while withdrawing digital rights from blanket licensing deals with music on-demand services in order to cut direct licenses with better rates. Or as the MIC Coalition states in its DOJ comments, ""Rights holders should be free to leave the collective licensing system entirely, but they should not be able to 'game the system' by having one foot in and one foot out.""

The DOJ says it is reviewing legacy agreements with the goal of terminating those that cover industries in which relevant circumstance have changed. While the PROs argue the music industry has changed dramatically since the consent decrees were established in 1941, music users say nothing has changed in the last three years except for the creation of the Music Modernization Act. And even that was enacted by Congress last year containing sections that ""assume the continued existence of the consent decrees,"" according to the RMLC and DiMA comments. ""They are, in short, an essential part of the legal and commercial framework that supports the sound functioning of the U.S. licensing market.""

The Music Modernization Act requires the DOJ to report to Congress if it makes any changes and to justify those changes. This ingredient was included, music users argue, so Congress could react by creating new laws for licensing, if Congressional leaders disagree with the DOJ's actions.

The music users also complain that the BMI rate court created a more onerous environment for music licensees with its September 2016 ruling for the first time on the long-disputed notion of fractional licensing rather than whole-works licensing in publishers' favor -- and that ruling was upheld on appeal in December 2017. Fractional licensing ""simply allows publishers to impose an added tax on the digital economy,"" they claim, since music users have to buy a license from each publisher to play a song, which would make the PRO efforts complementary to each other instead of competitive with one another. ""After all, nothing any of [the PROs] could license, on their own, would actually yield legal permission to play anything; a license from each of them would be required in order for any of the licenses to be at all useful,"" the two users group complain in their joint comments. ""This is the 'free market' which the music publishers seem most focused on attaining -- and it is easy to see why. It is one in which they are shielded from the pressures of competition.""

The problem of fractional licensing would be alleviated if a promised joint repertory database from ASCAP and BMI finally happens. For their part, the two PROs say the joint database project is due to be completed in another six months or so. In the meantime, the two PROs ""fail to provide licensees with complete, authoritative information about the songs they license,"" RMLC and DiMA complain. ""This serves only to increase ASCAP and BMI's leverage in negotiations.""

The music users further decry the PROs and music publishers for speaking publicly about aims to increase licensing royalty rates to music users, which the joint statement condemns, saying, ""It is textbook economics that unchecked price increases attributable to market power will ultimately harm consumers by reducing output below the competitive level."" While that may be true for some DiMA members -- including digital radio services, on-demand digital services and cable television -- it ignores that terrestrial radio and network television are free to consumers.

RMLC and DiMA argue that even with the consent decrees, the PROs continue to engage in monopolistic practices, noting ASCAP's collusion with songwriters to give the PRO exclusive rights that resulted in a $1.75 million fine from the DOJ in 2016. As well, the ASCAP rate court found evidence of coordination between two of the majors and ASCAP in 2014. In light of that kind of behavior from the PROs and major music publishers, the two music users organizations say it shows the consent decrees are still needed.

Furthermore, the music users comments suggest that they would also like to see the two unregulated U.S. PROs, SESAC and Global Music Rights, also placed under consent decrees.

""The upshot of all this is that without the consent decrees, businesses will see their PRO bills go through the roof, as they will have little ability to push back on whatever price the PROs and larger publishers demand,"" read the comments to the DOJ. ""In economic terms, ASCAP and BMI would extract monopoly rents, depressing ... the quality and variety of producers offered to consumers,"" leading to a narrow selection of product and less music consumed overall.

Finally, the music users wonder whether the DOJ is simply trying to free itself from regulating the industry in hopes that Congress will enact laws, which would in turn move the rate determinations process away from the Federal courts to the Copyright Royalty Board. If that's the goal, terminating the ASCAP and BMI rate decrees would be ineffective and counterproductive, the two music users comments state.

""To the extent the Department believes that it can force Congress to act by attaching a self- destruct timer to the decrees, that is a serious error,"" the comments state. ""Doing that will only make a legislative solution less likely, not more. The PROs and music publishers will have no incentive to come to the table to craft such a solution if they know that they will be able to fully leverage their market power by holding out for a few years.""

Given that ASCAP and BMI routinely seek to extract supracompetitive prices, even at the rate courts, ""terminating the consent decrees would thus have the effect of freeing ASCAP and BMI to commit antitrust violations on a massive scale,"" charge the two users groups. The MIC coalition adds that the consent decrees' elimination ""would be bad for music licensees everywhere. It would force many of the small businesses we represent to either stop playing music altogether or to acquiesce to substantially higher prices that would threaten the financial solvency of such businesses.""

RMLC and DiMA note the DOJ that just two years ago, following an exhaustive investigation, it had concluded ""the current system has well served music creators and music users for decades and should remain intact. Doing away with these essential guardrails for protecting competition would directly harm consumers, and create chaos in markets and the courts alike."" So, again, they pose the question: What's changed?
