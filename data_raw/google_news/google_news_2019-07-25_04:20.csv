"Fox News Poll: Trump approval up, voter ratings on economy best in decades",https://www.foxnews.com,['Dana Blanton'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-trump-approval-up-voter-ratings-on-economy-best-in-decades,"More voters rate the economy positively today than have since 2001, according to the latest Fox News Poll.

In addition, approval of the job President Trump is doing on the economy stands at 52 percent (41 percent disapprove). That’s just one-point off his high of 53 percent last summer, and up from 48-46 percent in May.

That job rating is helped, in part, by the 51 percent of voters now feeling the economy is in positive shape (excellent or good). The last time this many felt that way was almost two decades ago (59 percent, January 2001).

However, it’s unclear whether Trump can count on these ratings come election time. While 33 percent say economic conditions will get better if he is re-elected (39 percent worse), the same number, 33 percent, think it will get better if a Democrat wins the White House (36 percent worse).

In general, voters think Republicans would do a better job handling national security (+10 points) and the economy (+7). They give Democrats the advantage on race relations (+23 points), bringing the country together (+15), health care (+14), and immigration (+5). It’s mostly a draw on some issues that historically fall in the GOP column, such as on foreign policy (D+4), border security (R+3), the federal budget deficit (R+3), and taxes (even).

Despite the rosy economic views, Trump’s overall job approval remains below 50 percent: 46 percent approve, while 51 percent disapprove. Last month, it was 45-53 percent (June 2019). His best ratings, 48-47 percent, came soon after he took office (February 2017).

Here’s why his overall rating remains underwater: He receives net negative marks on border security (44 approve - 52 disapprove), immigration (41-54), international trade (40-49), Iran (39-46), North Korea (39-49), and health care (38-51).

The president’s lowest marks are on race relations (32-57 percent), where more voters disapprove than approve by 25 points. He was underwater by 22 points in October 2018 (35-57 percent).

Over half, 57 percent, don’t believe Trump respects racial minorities, including 73 percent of non-whites.

Some 34 percent think the president does respect minorities, down from 41 percent in 2017. That decline is mostly due to a 14-point drop among Republicans (68 percent now vs. 82 percent in 2017).

Majorities think that Trump went too far in tweets criticizing four minority Democratic Congresswomen, and believe telling a person of color to go back to the country they came from is a racist thing to say.

The new poll, released Wednesday, finds 63 percent think Trump’s tweets crossed the line. Far fewer, 27 percent, see them as an acceptable political attack.

Thirty-three percent of Republicans join 88 percent of Democrats in saying the tweets crossed the line. Some key electoral groups agree: 73 percent of suburban women, 68 percent of independents, and 64 percent of voters living in close counties (where Hillary Clinton and Trump were within 10 points in 2016).

A 53 percent majority of Republicans calls the tweets an acceptable political attack. GOP men (59 percent) are more likely than GOP women (48 percent) to find them acceptable.

Black voters (79 percent), Democrats (88 percent), and Democratic women in particular (91 percent) are among those most likely to believe the tweets went too far.

Overall, 56 percent think it is racist to say “go back” to a person of color, while 23 percent disagree, and 18 percent say it depends.

Most Democrats (85 percent) and blacks (76 percent), over half of independents (57 percent), and half of whites (50 percent) say the “go back” language is racist.

Among Republicans, 21 percent feel it is racist, while more than twice that number disagree (45 percent), and 30 percent say it depends.

One of the Congresswomen of the so-called “Squad” the president criticized, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), is as almost as well-known to voters nationally as long-time congressional leaders. For example, 9 percent have never heard of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, while 12 percent are unfamiliar with Ocasio-Cortez. Only three percent have never heard of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Ocasio-Cortez and Pelosi are about equally popular among Democrats: Pelosi rates more positively than negatively by 41 points and Ocasio-Cortez by 39. For comparison, McConnell receives a net positive by 9 points among Republicans.

A majority of voters has an unfavorable view of Trump: 45 percent favorable vs. 51 percent unfavorable. Among Republicans, his favorable rating hits 87 percent.

Ocasio-Cortez is underwater among all voters by 7 points (34 favorable - 41 unfavorable), driven by 68 percent of Republicans rating her negatively.

Pelosi is underwater by 11 points (39-50 percent) and McConnell by 22 (25-47 percent).

Another member of the “Squad,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), is viewed negatively by 11 points (26-37 percent), while 22 percent have never heard of her.

Pollpourri

Six in 10 voters are concerned about the treatment of migrants detained on the U.S.-Mexico border, including 31 percent who feel “extremely” concerned. Most Democrats (82 percent) are concerned, while a majority of Republicans (58 percent) is not.

Fox News Channel’s Chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports the White House announced Tuesday that between May 13 to July 11, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) arrested more than 900 people who had remained in the country despite being ordered to leave.

Voters have mixed views on the job ICE is doing: 45 percent approve, while 49 percent disapprove. The party divide is stark: 80 percent of Republicans approve, while 80 of Democrats disapprove.

Conducted July 21-23, 2019 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,004 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters."
Mueller Warns of Russian Sabotage and Rejects Trump’s ‘Witch Hunt’ Claims,https://www.nytimes.com,['Mark Mazzetti'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/us/politics/trump-mueller-testimony.html,"WASHINGTON — Robert S. Mueller III warned lawmakers on Wednesday that Russia was again trying to sabotage American democracy before next year’s presidential election, defended his investigation’s conclusions about Moscow’s sweeping interference campaign in 2016 and publicly rejected President Trump’s criticism that he had conducted a “witch hunt.”

The partisan war over Mr. Mueller’s inquiry reached a heated climax during nearly seven hours of his long-awaited testimony before two congressional committees. Lawmakers hunted for viral sound bites and tried to score political points, but Mr. Mueller consistently refused to accommodate them, returning over and over in a sometimes halting delivery to his damning and voluminous report.

Mr. Mueller remained a spectral presence in Washington over the past two years as the president and his allies subjected the special counsel and his team of lawyers to withering attacks. Speaking in detail for the first time about his conclusions produced occasionally dramatic moments in which he ventured beyond his report to offer insights about Mr. Trump’s behavior.

When asked whether Mr. Trump “wasn’t always being truthful” in his written answers to the special counsel’s questions, Mr. Mueller responded, “I would say generally.” He called Mr. Trump’s praise of WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign “problematic” and said it “gave a boost to what is and should be illegal activity.”"
Federal court blocks Trump asylum rules hours after judge ruled to keep restrictions in place,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Bradford Betz', 'Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-scores-win-over-move-to-limit-asylum-claims,"A federal judge in California on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from imposing restrictions on individuals seeking asylum in the United States, just hours after a judge in Washington had decided to let the rule stand while lawsuits play out in court.

The rule, published in the Federal Register last week, required people seeking asylum to apply first in one of the countries they cross on their way to the U.S. -- with certain exceptions. It targeted tens of thousands of Central Americans who have crossed Mexico each month trying to enter the U.S.

The rule was met quickly with a legal challenge from advocacy groups, who moved for a temporary restraining order blocking the rule. After a hearing in Washington, D.C. federal court, District Judge Timothy J. Kelly denied the motion. But hours later, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco, an Obama appointee, blocked the enforcement of the rule. His ruling took effect immediately.

LINDSEY GRAHAM CLAIMS BORDER FRAUD SO PREVALENT 'A TERRORIST COULD EASILY GET IN'

""The court recognized, as it did with the first asylum ban, that the Trump administration was attempting an unlawful end run around asylum protections enacted by Congress,"" said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt in a statement.

Melissa Crow, a senior supervising attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center called Tigar's block, ""an important victory for incredibly vulnerable individuals and families from besieged Central American countries seeking refuge in our country.""

The White House had earlier called the decision to uphold the Trump administration's rule ""a victory for Americans concerned about the crisis at our southern border,"" adding, ""Tens of thousands of migrants making opportunistic asylum claims have not only exacerbated the crisis at our southern border but also have harmed genuine asylum seekers, who are forced to wait years for relief because our system is clogged with meritless claims.""

Kelly, who was appointed to the bench by President Trump said the immigrant advocate groups who filed the lawsuit did not show that their work would be irreparably harmed if the policy moved forward.

With certain exceptions, the rule requires individuals to apply for and be denied asylum in another country in order to apply in the U.S. That means that migrants from Central American nations who travel through Mexico – who make up a significant portion of recent asylum seekers – will not be eligible for asylum in America unless they previously applied for asylum in Mexico or any other country they traversed and were turned down.

The new rule’s exceptions include certain cases of human trafficking.

The rule is meant to crack down on asylum seekers coming to the U.S. more for economic reasons than to escape persecution in their home countries. Administration officials say this could help close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win. The goal in part is to allow quicker determinations in these cases.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AIMS TO EXPAND FAST-TRACK DEPORTATIONS ACROSS US, LEGAL FIGHT EXPECTED

The policy follows the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly referred to as the ""remain in Mexico"" policy. Under that policy, asylum seekers were often told to go back to Mexico to await hearings, rather than be allowed to remain in the U.S.

Democrats railed against that policy, with 2020 hopeful Beto O'Rourke calling it ""inhumane.""

A reduction in asylum seekers would ease the burden on federal agencies currently overwhelmed by the volume of individuals seeking entry into the U.S.

Detention facilities have been notoriously stretched for resources, resulting in outcries against the government. The criticism has particularly been strong when it comes to the conditions in which migrant children have been kept.

What If They’re Not Coming for the Jews This Time?,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['David Frum', 'Staff Writer At']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/has-trump-abandoned-anti-semitism/594619/,"This special exemption poses a moral quandary for communally concerned Jews quite unlike anything in our collective experience.

Jewish collective life in America has been built on the assumption that people who espouse any form of bigotry—whether against African Americans, or gays, or the disabled—will, sooner or later (and probably sooner!), also turn upon Jews. The famous Martin Niemöller poem begins, “First, they came for the socialists”; only in the third line do they “come for the Jews.”

But what if a new generation of bigotry arose, attended by a strong, take-it-to-the-bank guarantee: This time, they are not coming for the Jews—not sooner, not later. That ancient obsession is laughably out of date. Today we have other concerns. Here’s a photograph of me posing alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He likes George Soros even less than we do!

David Frum: Trump is baiting Democrats

What if American Jews found themselves facing people who practiced a politics of incitement, but not against Jews—indeed, who found it more useful to cast themselves as allies of Jews?

Trump usually has, at most, a perfunctory word for mass shootings and hate crimes. But Trump traveled in person to pay respects to the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter. Vice President Mike Pence had led the way, personally helping to restore a desecrated Jewish cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri, early in 2017.

When Trump attacked Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, he specifically cited her record of tweets and statements about Jewish money supposedly swaying Congress in favor of Israel. Among other pieces of classic anti-Semitic language, Omar had said, “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.”

Statements like that goaded President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel to write here in The Atlantic: “No one is questioning the right of members of Congress and others to criticize Israeli policies. But Omar is crossing a line that should not be crossed in political discourse. Her remarks are not anti-Israel; they are anti-Semitic.” Her words set in motion a resolution in the House of Representatives to condemn anti-Semitic and other bigoted speech.

By contrast, the Trump administration has more than fulfilled the wishes of many American Jews on issues from moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem to condemning Palestinian incitement to countering the Iranian nuclear program. At the Department of Justice’s conference last week, Barr said:

Far too often, Jews and Jewish communities in America suffer outside the spotlight. New York City, this past year, has seen a sharp uptick in attacks on Orthodox Jews, particularly in the Crown Heights neighborhood. People are attacking Jews in the streets and vandalizing synagogues. In Massachusetts in March, vandals desecrated 59 gravestones in a Jewish cemetery, knocking over headstones and scrawling swastikas and hateful graffiti. While the tragic attacks in Pittsburgh and Poway appropriately drew national attention, these attacks and others like them in communities across the country are, sadly, less well known outside the Jewish community. But they form the daily background of concerns about security and safety that many in the Jewish community feel. As attorney general and a fellow citizen, I want to assure the Jewish community that the Department of Justice and the entire federal government stands with you and will not tolerate these attacks.

As measured by polls, the large majority of American Jews recoil from Trump and his administration. Yet if you spend time in the organized Jewish world, you have probably noticed an early but unmistakable warming to the president. The warming is most pronounced among the older, more communally committed, and more Israel-focused part of the Jewish world."
Gay couple sues State Department for denying daughter's citizenship,https://www.cnn.com,"['Rebekah Riess', 'Jay Croft']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/us/gay-couple-daughter-citizenship-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) A gay married couple in Georgia sued the US State Department on Wednesday for refusing to recognize their daughter as a citizen.

Derek Mize and Jonathan Gregg, who married in New York in 2015, had their daughter Simone Mize-Gregg via surrogacy in England in 2018, their lawyer said in a statement. Both fathers are listed on the birth certificate.

When they applied for Simone's US citizenship, the US consulate in London rejected their application, the release said. ""The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that children of married U.S. citizens born abroad are U.S. citizens from birth so long as one of their parents has lived in the U.S. at some point, but the State Department routinely denies that right to same-sex couples and their children,"" the statement says.

""The State Department's policy is not only cruel, it is unconstitutional. The government refuses to recognize Jonathan and Derek's marriage and all of Simone's rights as a U.S. citizen,"" Aaron C. Morris, one of the couple's attorneys and executive director of Immigration Equality , said.

A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it does not comment on pending litigation.

"DOJ declines to prosecute Barr, Ross over contempt vote tied to census question",https://www.foxnews.com,['Louis Casiano'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-declines-to-prosecute-barr-ross-over-contempt-vote-tied-to-census-question,"The Justice Department has declined to prosecute Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for allegedly stonewalling congressional probes into the Trump administration's efforts to place a citizenship question on the 2020 census, the agency said Wednesday.

The House last week voted mostly along party lines, 230-198, to hold Barr and Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for defying congressional subpoenas, in a largely symbolic effort. House Democrats were seeking information about Trump's efforts to add the controversial question.

Trump asserted executive privilege and told Barr and Ross not to release certain documents in response to the subpoenas from the House Oversight and Reform Committee.

BOOKER INTRODUCES BILL TO RESTRICT USE OF CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION

""The Department of Justice's longstanding position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a Wednesday letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of lying about the origin of the citizenship question. Critics of the question have suggested it was intended to discourage immigrant participation in the census, affecting the population figures that determine legislative representation.

Neither Pelosi nor House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., immediately responded to Fox News for comment Wednesday.

Rosen said the DOJ has taken the same position across several administrations. He cited a 2008 case in which the agency declined to prosecute Joshua Bolten and Harriet Miers, two high-ranking Bush administration officials who refused to testify before a panel investigating the firing of several U.S. attorneys.

TRUMP DECLARES PUSH FOR CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION NOT OVER, CALLS REPORTS ‘FAKE’

Bush directed Bolten, then the White House chief of staff, and Miers, White House counsel, not to release certain documents or to provide certain testimony related to a congressional subpoena.

The department took a similar position in 2012 when former President Barack Obama directed Attorney General Eric Holder to withhold certain documents related to the government gun-running project, dubbed Operation Fast and Furious.

In accordance with the policy, the department determined the responses by Barr and Ross to the subpoenas ""did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen said.

US: Unlicensed Bitcoin Exchange Operator Indicted by Justice Department,https://cointelegraph.com,['Max Boddy'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-unlicensed-bitcoin-exchange-operator-indicted-by-justice-department,"William Green, a 46-year-old New Jersey resident, was indicted by a federal grand jury on account of allegedly running an unlicensed money transmission service. The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the indictment in a press release on July 24.

According to the DoJ, the indictment filings and court statements indicate that Green operated a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service through the website Destination Bitcoin. As such, Green reportedly would receive money from his customers in order to convert their cash to BTC. The findings further indicated that Green had not registered with the Secretary of the United States Treasury in any capacity.

As noted in the announcement, a person is required by federal law to register any money transmitting businesses with the Secretary of the Treasury.

Sentencing

Regarding monetary quantities and compensation, the report says that Green converted over $2 million in fiat money to BTC. Moreover, the maximum penalty for Green’s alleged crime is 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

According to the DoJ, Green was charged over the same issue in a criminal complaint filed on February 28.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the State of New Jersey filed a complaint last week about purportedly unregistered securities sales within its borders. The State accused blockchain-based online marketplace Pocketinns of selling over $400,000 in securities to investors, without registering with the state’s associated bureau."
Mueller flubs on which president appointed him to prosecutor post in Massachusetts,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-flubs-on-which-president-appointed-him-to-prosecutor-post-in-massachusetts,"Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller confused which president appointed him the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts back in the 1980s during his congressional appearance Wednesday.

Answering a question during a lengthy hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Mueller said he thought President George H. W. Bush appointed him to the post in Massachusetts, but was quickly corrected by Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., who noted that Mueller was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986.

Bush appointed Mueller as United States Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division in 1990.

EX-SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER TESTIFIES TO CONGRESS -- LIVE BLOG

Stanton’s questioning was meant to emphasize Mueller’s long history in government and the respect he garnered from both Democratic and Republican presidents. The former special counsel also served as deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush and later as his FBI director – a post he continued under President Barack Obama.

Mueller’s flub on who appointed him in Massachusetts came after hours of questioning in which Mueller appeared confused or befuddled by questions or references. He was also unwilling or unable to offer crisp sound bites that could reshape already-entrenched public opinions.

He frequently gave terse, one-word answers to lawmakers' questions, even when given opportunities to crystallize allegations of obstruction of justice against the president. He referred time and again to the wording in his report or asked for questions to be repeated. He declined to read aloud hard-hitting statements in the report when prodded by Democrats to do so.

MUELLER REFUSES TO DISCUSS RUSSIA PROBE ORIGINS, STEELE DOSSIER IN TESTIMONY

Although Mueller declared at the outset that he would be limited in what he would say, the hearings nonetheless carried the extraordinary spectacle of a prosecutor discussing in public a criminal investigation he conducted into a sitting U.S. president.

Mueller, known for his taciturn nature, warned that he would not stray beyond what had already been revealed in his report. The Justice Department had instructed him to stay strictly within those parameters, giving him a formal directive to point to if he faced questions he did not want to answer.

In a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Rosen described the department's ""long-standing position"" to not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress ""for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege.""

Pelosi tweeted Tuesday that she had signed the contempt citations for Attorney General Bill Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, which were approved mainly along party lines in the House. The citations followed resistance from the Justice and Commerce departments to provide a full range of documents requested by the House Oversight Committee as part of its investigation into the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.

The move to not prosecute the twin contempt citations was widely expected, and followed a similar move by the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, which declined to pursue contempt charges referred by Congress against then-Attorney General Eric Holder.

Both agencies have maintained that they have already provided thousands of documents to the committee about the census question, and that certain documents which had been withheld were done so in line with a federal court ruling that said that many of the same documents were privileged from disclosure in civil litigation.

Mueller hearing: Live commentary (opinion),https://www.cnn.com,"['Frida Ghitis', 'Alice Stewart', 'Paul Callan', 'Joe Lockhart']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/opinions/live-news/mueller-hearing-commentary/index.html,"After listening to hours of staccato testimony from Robert Mueller, the man whose job it was to answer difficult questions, the country is left with yet another unknown: Why won’t Mueller say what he really thinks?

If he thinks Trump has committed impeachable crimes, why doesn’t he say it? If he thinks Trump did not act in a way that would warrant impeachment or indictment, why doesn’t he say it?

A reading of his lengthy report lays out a hefty but dense case for obstruction of justice, and a not-exactly-thin one for questionable links between members of the campaign and Russia. Mueller’s Congressional testimony reaffirmed everything in the report. And yet, Mueller won’t say it out loud, in public.

He has repeatedly stated that he was acting as a prosecutor. He viewed his job as gathering evidence and presenting it to a jury (Congress and the American people) so that they can reach a verdict. He didn’t want to get involved in what is not only a criminal but also a political case. Despite entreaties from Democrats and Republicans, he refused to act as judge or jury. But even prosecutors have to make decisions on indictments.

The Special Counsel has presented extensive, persuasive evidence of Trump’s culpability, but he won’t say the words.

Robert Mueller was appointed to help Americans with the urgent task of figuring out if they could trust a president who was elected after a hostile government actively backed his candidacy, a president who denied that hostile government’s interference and then sought to block the investigation into whether he or his associates committed crimes.

Mueller has offered a compelling but cloudy answer to questions about the president’s actions. For a country eager to see some resolution, he stubbornly refuses to offer with clarity his own professional judgment.

Justice Department launches antitrust probe into big tech,https://arstechnica.com,['Kate Cox'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/justice-department-launches-antitrust-probe-into-big-tech/,"The Department of Justice is launching an antitrust probe into some of the world's biggest and most influential tech companies, the agency announced Tuesday.

The department's Antitrust Division, which is responsible for reviewing and enforcing issues relating to mergers, monopolies, competition, and price-fixing, said its review would ""consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online.""

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Makan Delrahim, head of the Antitrust Division, said. “The Department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

The DOJ didn't name any names, but the list of ""market-leading online platforms"" accused of stifling competition through dishonest tactics, or simply of being too big for competitors to exist against, generally has Amazon, Facebook, and Google at the top; all three companies' stocks immediately tanked following the announcement.

Reports by several media outlets earlier this year, citing the ever-popular ""sources familiar with the matter,"" indicated the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission were planning something of a divide-and-conquer approach to tech sector regulation, with the DOJ digging into Apple and Google, and the FTC handling Amazon and Facebook.

Widespread scrutiny

The Justice Department is just the latest, not the first, body to take a hard look at what the tech sector has gotten up to in the past decade.

Congress kicked off its own probe into big tech's behavior last month, when the House Antitrust Subcommittee launched a bipartisan investigation into ""competition in digital markets."" The subcommittee chair, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) at the time called the growth of monopolies in the US economy ""one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today.""

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who is one of the party's leading candidates in the 2020 presidential primary race, in March issued a call to use existing antitrust law to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.

Traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers have also been asking regulators to update antitrust policy in order to rein in Google and Amazon, which dominate the online marketplace through what the retailers say are anticompetitive practices.

The DOJ is also lagging behind its international peers. Germany, Austria, Italy, and the European Union have all launched separate antitrust investigations into Amazon's behavior with third-party merchants on its marketplace since November, and the EU has fined Google billions of dollars four separate times in recent years for violations of European monopoly law."
US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Voices New Pessimism About Bitcoin’s Future,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Bitcoins', 'Ivan Franciscovich']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-voices-new-pessimism-about-bitcoins-future,"United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin voiced new bearish views on Bitcoin today, saying that he probably will not be talking about the number one cryptocurrency in as soon as five years. In an interview with “Squawk Box” CNBC on July 24, Mnuchin said:

“I won’t be talking about Bitcoin in 10 years, I can assure you that […] I would bet even in 5 or 6 years I’m no longer talking about Bitcoin as Treasury Secretary. I’ll have other priorities […] I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on Bitcoin.”

Mnuchin’s latest remarks follow a recent statement about how cryptocurrencies primarily exist as a vehicle for crime and speculative investment, saying, “I think to a large extent, these cryptocurrencies have been dominated by illicit activities and speculation.”

However, CEO and Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert celebrated the Treasury Secretary’s remarks, saying that they were “complete and total validation of Bitcoin.”

Money Laundering

Gay U.S. Couple Sues State Dept. for Denying Their Baby Citizenship,https://www.nytimes.com,['Sarah Mervosh'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/state-department-assisted-reproductive-citizenship.html,"The State Department’s focus on biological parentage means that if the source of the sperm and egg do not match married parents, the case can be treated as “out of wedlock,” a designation that comes with a higher bar to transmit citizenship.

Mr. Gregg, who moved to the United States to be with his husband, did not meet a five-year residency requirement. His lawyers say that requirement would not have applied if they had been treated as the married couple they are.

For two married United States citizens, “all the law requires is that one of them lived in America for at least one day,” said Aaron Morris, the executive director of Immigration Equality, which has worked on all three lawsuits.

“Marriage is so fundamental to how you define a family,” he said. “To disenfranchise a little girl of citizenship because she has two dads is invidious discrimination that has been struck down time and time again.”

The State Department declined to comment on Tuesday, citing pending litigation. In court documents, the department has argued that the policy does not discriminate and applies to opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike.

But gay couples argue that they are far more likely to be questioned about their conception methods when applying for citizenship. Immigration Equality said that it had heard from at least three dozen families in similar situations since mid-2017; by the organization’s account, most were same-sex couples.

In court documents, the State Department has said that rules for passing down citizenship for children born abroad are important for preventing fraud and ensuring that children born abroad have a sufficient connection to the United States to warrant citizenship."
Judge Rules Trump’s EPA Flouting Clean Air Act As Denver Ozone Spikes Again,https://www.westword.com,['Chase Woodruff'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.westword.com/news/judge-rules-trump-epa-flouting-clean-air-act-as-denver-ozone-spikes-again-11422270,"As ozone pollution in the Denver metro area took another turn for the worse this week, a federal judge ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency is violating clean-air laws by delaying a key decision on local air-quality standards.

In a ruling issued Monday, July 22, Judge John Kane of the U.S. District Court in Denver found that EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has “failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty” by delaying a determination regarding the metro area’s classification under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone pollution. The partial summary judgment came as a result of a lawsuit filed by environmental group WildEarth Guardians against Wheeler and the EPA earlier this year. Court filings show that the agency didn’t object to Kane’s ruling.

“This is the Trump administration’s EPA on full display,” says Jeremy Nichols, WildEarth Guardians’ climate and energy program director. “They just refuse to comply with the law. They’re willing to keep dragging their feet to the point where they get ruled against in court, because they don’t want to comply. They don’t want to have to clamp down.”

The group's lawsuit revolves around a regulatory decision that was due to be made by the EPA earlier this year. For more than a decade now, a nine-county region known as the Denver Metro/North Front Range Nonattainment Area has exceeded federal standards for ozone pollution that were set by the agency in 2008. The state faced a January 2019 deadline to bring the area's air quality into compliance, or be reclassified from ""moderate nonattainment"" to ""serious nonattainment,"" which would require regulators to impose stricter regulations on polluters. The state missed the deadline — air pollution in Denver got worse last year, not better — but the EPA's attainment determination hasn't yet been made.

""This is a simple finding that they need to make,"" says Nichols. ""It's not a complicated action. It's very clear that Colorado failed to meet the 2008 ozone air-quality standards, so this shouldn't be happening. It's a sign of how nuts the Trump administration is, and how they just refuse to take their legal duties seriously. And unfortunately, it's our clean air that suffers.""

The EPA did not respond directly to questions regarding the attainment determination and when it's expected to be made. ""EPA supports the state’s efforts to address ozone issues along the Front Range,"" EPA Region 8 spokesperson Lisa McClain-Vanderpool said in an email. ""The Agency does not comment on ongoing litigation.""

Monday's court ruling came as ozone pollution in Denver began to rise to its highest level of the year so far, reaching an eight-hour Air Quality Index of 133 on Tuesday, July 23. Parts of metro Denver reached one-hour ozone concentrations of 100 parts per billion on Monday and Tuesday, according to state air-quality data — levels that are considered “unhealthy” for all groups on the AQI scale.

High levels of ozone pollution are expected to continue along the Front Range this week. In a forecast issued this morning, officials with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment warned that ""active children and adults, and people with lung disease, such as asthma, should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion"" in the afternoon and evening, when ozone levels are typically at their daily peak.

Ground-level ozone is a so-called criteria pollutant that can cause a wide variety of negative health effects, from acute symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath to chronic conditions like asthma and emphysema. It's formed primarily by the interaction between sunlight and ""ozone precursors"" like volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. In Denver, studies have shown that the two largest sources of ozone-forming pollutants are motor vehicles and oil and gas facilities along the Front Range, both of which can account for up to 40 percent of local ozone production on a given day.

A reclassification to serious nonattainment by the EPA would force CDPHE regulators to subject those emissions sources to a higher degree of scrutiny and regulation. In March, Governor Jared Polis withdrew a state request, made by his predecessor John Hickenlooper, for an extension to meet the federal ozone standards. ""There’s more we can do to protect our air quality and health, and we should do it sooner not later,"" Polis said at the time.

Even if the extension hadn't been withdrawn, it would have expired last week. Nichols and WildEarth Guardians, along with other environmental groups, have launched a campaign to pressure the CDPHE to act now, without waiting for the Trump administration to finally tell state officials what they already know.

""Having the backing of the EPA's finding forces them to [act], but the state shouldn't have to be forced to clean up the air,"" Nichols says. ""They could start to implement more rigorous permitting; they could start to put emissions on track. They could be taking some actions now.""

DOJ tells Mueller to limit testimony to his report,https://www.politico.com,"['Eliana Johnson', 'Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/22/justice-mueller-congress-testimony-limit-1426035,"As a private citizen, former special counsel Robert Mueller is not bound by assertions of presidential privilege, but he is known as a rule follower who is unlikely to defy the administration’s directions to limit his testimony. | Alex Wong/Getty Images legal DOJ tells Mueller to limit testimony to his report The Justice Department argues that anything outside the report is covered by 'presidential privilege' that hasn’t been waived.

Justice Department officials have communicated to Robert Mueller that the department expects him to limit his congressional testimony this week to the public findings of his 448-page report, according to one current and one former U.S. official familiar with the preparations.

In extensive discussions since the former special counsel was subpoenaed on June 25 to testify, department officials have emphasized that they consider any evidence he gathered throughout the course of his investigation to be “presumptively privileged” and shielded from public disclosure.

Story Continued Below

The Justice Department is “taking the position that anything outside the written pages of the report are things about which presidential privilege hasn’t been waived,” the former U.S. official said.

The White House and the Justice Department, however, have signaled they don’t intend to place lawyers in the room during Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees on Wednesday.

Without a presence at the hearing, administration officials would have little recourse to prevent Mueller from going off-script and revealing details of his investigation that the White House considers off-limits. They are poised instead to rely on Mueller to self-police his remarks, indicating that they are confident the former special counsel will stick to carefully planned comments that mirror the already disclosed findings of his investigation.

Their stance cuts against President Donald Trump’s own protestation that Mueller shouldn’t be allowed to testify, which he reiterated on Monday. “Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple,” Trump tweeted on Monday morning.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/866/1155968404_6062886093001_6062880936001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

The president has accused Democrats of trying to conduct a “do-over” of Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election — a probe that he has falsely claimed “exonerates” him.

Mueller’s posture will likely deprive Democrats of an opportunity to get a clear answer from Mueller about whether he would have charged Trump with obstruction of justice if he were not the president, among other burning questions. Mueller said publicly after the report’s release that he adhered to a Justice Department policy prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president.

But some Democrats have said that even if Mueller simply reads from his report word for word, it would educate the American public about Trump’s attempts to thwart the Russia probe.

Jim Popkin, a spokesman for Mueller, said he was unsure whether Mueller was in contact with the Justice Department about aspects of his investigation that the administration believes would be off-limits during his testimony.

“In terms of DOJ and the Hill, there have been discussions for purposes of scheduling and clearly … to understand what the expectations are,” Popkin told POLITICO. “But they have not seen the [opening] statement. They’ve not provided the statement to either DOJ or anyone in the House.”

Popkin emphasized that Mueller’s opening statement would stay within “the four walls of the report as much as that is possible.”

Mueller has stated that his congressional testimony would not go beyond what is contained within his report.

The report “contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made,” Mueller said on May 29. “We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself. The report is my testimony.”

Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, said on his radio show Monday that he, too, believes Mueller will not speak publicly about matters outside of his report.

“I think that would be completely unethical to go beyond the report,” Sekulow said, adding that he expects Republicans — who say they are essentially seeking to cross-examine Mueller and press him on the origins of the probe — to also face roadblocks.

The Justice Department’s deference to Mueller cuts against the administration’s handling of efforts by Congress to interview former officials who were crucial witnesses in the special counsel investigation.

White House lawyers have accompanied those high-level witnesses subpoenaed by Congress, including Trump’s former communications director Hope Hicks, to their hearings, objecting to hundreds of questions lobbed at them by Democratic lawmakers on the grounds that any conversations that took place during their time in the White House are subject to presidential privilege claims. The White House has consistently pushed the idea that some current and former advisers are “absolutely immune” from answering questions about their White House tenures.

Negotiations over the scope of Mueller’s testimony have taken place under a veil of secrecy. Justice Department officials have been discussing the parameters of Mueller’s testimony with him and his team ever since the former special counsel was subpoenaed last month.

Attorney General William Barr has said publicly that Mueller is free to testify on Capitol Hill, but he has also said that he would support Mueller if he decides to skip the hearing. The Justice Department has not indicated publicly whether it will direct Mueller to limit his remarks in any way, but a spokesperson said in a cryptic statement that the department expects Mueller to keep his testimony within the bounds of the report.

“As the attorney general has said, we support special counsel Mueller if he wants to testify or if he doesn’t want to testify,” a Justice Department official said. “He has said publicly that his report is his testimony and that is our expectation. We support that approach.”

As a private citizen, Mueller is not bound by assertions of presidential privilege, but he is known as a rule-follower who is unlikely to defy the administration’s direction.

A Judiciary Committee official said the panel does not anticipate that lawmakers will spar with Mueller over matters of presidential privilege.

“[T]hese are private individuals who no longer work at the Department of Justice. And although we acknowledge that these are career department officials who give quite a bit of deference to what the department says, the department cannot order them to do anything,” the Judiciary Committee official said.

Even though Trump and his aides are projecting a hands-off approach, they’ve signaled that they expect Mueller to closely guard the voluminous evidence he gathered about the inner workings of the Trump White House.

Trump’s former counsel Emmet Flood warned the Justice Department in April that it considers any of Mueller’s evidence, other than what’s contained in the public version of his report, “presumptively privileged” and forbidden from public disclosure.

In May, Trump asserted executive privilege over the entirety of Mueller’s report and the underlying evidence as part of a bid to block the House Judiciary Committee’s access to the complete, unredacted report.

Trump invoked the broad privilege claim just minutes before the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress — a move that came after hours of exhaustive negotiations between the committee and the Justice Department over how to delay the contempt proceedings. The White House later called the committee’s demands “unlawful and reckless.”

Ethics Office Examines Allegations That Interior Dept. Officials Violated Transparency Laws,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/climate/interior-department-freedom-of-information.html,"Mr. Trump’s first appointee to head the E.P.A., Scott Pruitt, and his first appointee to head the Interior Department, Ryan Zinke, resigned last year after thousands of pages of documents released under Freedom of Information Act requests raised questions about matters such Mr. Pruitt’s alleged spending abuses, first-class travel and relationships with lobbyists, and Mr. Zinke’s efforts to secure taxpayer-funded perks for his wife.

Both men have said that the criticism of their actions was politically and personally motivated, and that they did nothing wrong.

Last year, the Interior Department implemented a new “awareness policy” regarding requests for information and public records under the Freedom of Information Act. The new policy requires career staff reviewing such requests to notify politically appointed officials if their names or email addresses appear in documents that have been designated to be released.

That policy, watchdog groups say, has allowed top officials appointed by President Trump to then withhold or delay the release of such information. “The upshot is that, in practice, the policy has morphed from a procedure that provides awareness to political appointees to one that allows political appointees to unlawfully withhold and delay documents,” said Travis Annatoyn, senior counsel at Democracy Forward, a watchdog group that has requested an Interior Department investigation into the matter.

A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, Molly Block, declined to comment and referred to the Interior Department’s website, which includes a document describing the policy. The page says the policy is intended to streamline the process of the agency’s response to increased Freedom of Information Act requests."
White House nixed DHS chief McAleenan Refugee Day border welcome for migrants,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-chief-mcaleenan-wanted-to-visit-border-and-welcome-migrants-for-refugee-day-white-house-said-no,"The White House communications team and the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary office engaged in a tense argument last month after acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan proposed traveling down to the U.S.-Mexico border on World Refugee Day to celebrate and welcome migrants, including those who entered illegally, two senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

A senior public affairs official at DHS asked the White House in early June for permission to go down to the southern border with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on June 20. One person identified the official as acting DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Andrew Meehan.

""The wildly off base proposal was met with immediate concern as not being thought through,"" one official told the Washington Examiner Monday evening.

A second official said the White House was concerned about the ""optics"" if two Cabinet officials were welcoming people who had illegally crossed into the country when President Trump has taken a hard stance against any type of illegal immigration, including against those who are seeking asylum on the southern border.

The DHS official trying to advance McAleenan's proposal refused to accept the White House's decision and ""sparred with"" several members of the White House strategic communications team, including then-director Mercedes Schlapp, over ""multiple contentious phone calls,"" the first source said. The second official said the fight lasted ""weeks.""

""The obvious glaring concern was that the border crisis was about migrants and asylums, not refugees, DHS disagreed,"" the first official wrote in a text, suggesting the the appearance would seem supportive of the people abusing the system instead of legitimate refugees.

The same official said Azar was not supportive of McAleenan's idea and was not planning to go along for the trip. The second official said Azar was on board, but added neither secretary ""understood the ramifications"" of such a trip.

The June 20 World Refugee Day celebration may not have been greenlighted but McAleenan did go to the border on that date. He flew with a Washington Post reporter on Thursday. It's not clear if Azar traveled down separately. An HHS spokeswoman would only say: ""In the past year and a half, Secretary Azar has visited numerous Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities and seen the quality of care provided to unaccompanied alien children.

DHS did not deny that McAleenan's office requested a trip on World Refugee Day and instead shared a schedule of events he took part in while on the border that day.

""On June 20, 2019, Acting Secretary McAleenan hosted the first ladies of Guatemala and Honduras for a tour of the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector,"" a DHS official wrote in an email Thursday. ""The trip included an overview of how transnational criminal and human smuggling organizations pair adult aliens with children they are not related to with the intent of posing as family units to help secure release into the U.S.""

The day after, June 21, the Washington Post published a story leaking confidential details of a nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, which five current and former senior administration officials charged to the Washington Examiner that McAleenan leaked because he did not approve of the raids and sought to sabotage them.

""This is a DHS leadership team who has been at odds with the administration from the beginning. It’s a difference of world view,"" the first official said Monday.

The DHS Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of government information in late June, which forced ICE to call off a nationwide operation, the Washington Examiner was first to report.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Constant infighting among top officials. Sudden departures of senior staffers without explanation. A leader who is disengaged and prone to falling asleep in meetings.

The Commerce Department has reached its apex of dysfunction under Wilbur Ross, according to four people with knowledge of the inner workings of the department. The 81-year-old Commerce secretary, who has for months endured whispers that he is on the outs, spends much of his time at the White House to try to retain President Donald Trump’s favor, the sources said, leaving his department adrift.

Story Continued Below

He’s hardly the only top Trump official to seek the president’s approval. But department insiders say they’ve rarely seen Commerce so rudderless — and they say Ross’ penchant for managing upward at the expense of his staff is leading to what one plugged-in observer described as “a disaster over there.”

“With our ongoing trade wars and the census looming, Commerce needs functional leadership to be effective, and right now they just don’t have it,” said Theo LeCompte, a former top Commerce official in the Obama administration who speaks often with former colleagues.

One common complaint: Ross, a successful investor before Trump tapped him as secretary of Commerce, isn’t frequently seen in the building talking to employees or rallying them to do good work.

“He’s sort of seen as kind of irrelevant. The morale is very low there because there’s not a lot of confidence in the secretary,” said a former outside adviser to Commerce who is still in touch with many employees at the department. “He’s not respected in the building.”

Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings and a former outside adviser — a departure from past practice that one source attributed to the secretary’s lack of stamina.

“Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they’re very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,” said the former outside adviser. “There’s a small window where he’s able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.”

A Commerce official disputed that criticsm, saying that Ross has frequent afternoon meetings, including “long” meetings on the census.

“Secretary Ross is a tireless worker who is the sole decision-maker at the department,"" said Commerce press secretary Kevin Manning. ""He routinely works 12-hour days and travels often, with visits to seven countries and eight states in the last three months to advance the president’s agenda.""

Yet top Commerce officials have pushed to not have Ross called to testify at congressional oversight hearings, according to two sources close to the department, because they fear he isn’t up to the task. “There’s a great deal of effort to shield him from testifying ever again,” said one of the sources.

A Commerce official disputed that and said, “He’s obviously going to have to testify again. … You can’t get through the rest of [congressional appropriations] season without testifying again.”

Ross did testify at an oversight hearing on the census for nearly seven hours in March, and emerged through the ordeal generally unscathed. But according to one person familiar with the department, the consensus among the top ranks of the administration was that it would be best to avoid a repeat appearance.

“There was a great deal of concern to not have him testify expressed from the White House,” this person said, characterizing the instructions as: “‘Don’t do this, people. Don’t do this, he’s probably not the right guy to go there.’”

Ross certainly has other reasons to avoid Congress — namely, the heated dispute between Hill Democrats and the administration over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3704/1155968404_6052147728001_6051795407001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

In April, Ross offered to send aides to testify on his behalf before a House Appropriations subcommittee, an offer the panel’s Democratic chairman, José Serrano, said showed “stunning disrespect.” Serrano’s Republican counterpart, Robert Aderholt, told Reuters that Ross refused to testify out of “concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself.”

“His relationship with the Hill has deteriorated more and more, and he’s just not interested in dealing with the Hill if he can avoid it,” said a person familiar with the department’s internal discussions.

A Commerce official noted that Ross talked to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) two weeks ago, and held a party two months ago that a number of senators attended. Another Commerce employee observed, “This administration is very hesitant to do oversight in general or to comply with oversight requests in general.”

There are public signs, however, of apparent unease with Ross as a spokesperson for the administration. At an appearance at the White House in mid-July on an announcement on abandoning the citizenship question in the census, the Commerce secretary stood next to Trump the entire time and was one of three people who didn’t speak. Attorney General Bill Barr, on the other hand, spoke at length.

Ross’ relationship with the White House and with Trump was also damaged by stories that came out in the past 18 months showing that he wasn’t as rich as he had claimed and hadn’t fully divested some stock as he had promised, according to the former outside adviser. (The Commerce official disputed that, arguing that the White House has not cared about these issues.)

Ross’s deputies, meanwhile, are coming under fire of their own as tensions rise withini the department.

Political appointees sometimes close doors right in front of career employees to keep them out of meetings, one former Commerce official in touch with former colleagues said.

Meanwhile, “it’s totally infighting among the politicals,” said another person familiar with the department. “It’s just everybody fighting everybody.” In particular, the relationship between Ross’ office and the legislative affairs team is “clearly broken,” this person said.

Charles “Kolo” Rathburn, who had been acting head of legislative affairs, “was unceremoniously let go” and abruptly left earlier in July, according to a person familiar with Commerce and the outside adviser, who said it had to do with issues of professional conduct in the workplace. Another person familiar with Commerce also confirmed his departure.

“He wasn’t allowed to clean out his office,” said one of the people. Rathburn had replaced Mike Platt, who had left in early May.

A Commerce official said Rathburn, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, is working to pass the bar exam and has an offer for a higher-paying position at a law firm if he does.

Ross Branson, who had been deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs and was Platt’s deputy, also left Commerce on Friday, according to two people familiar with his departure. He had become “collateral damage,” according to one of the people, and was told that he had to look for a new job. He starts on Monday as head of legislative affairs at the Export-Import Bank, a position that a Commerce official described as “definitely a promotion.” Branson and the Ex-Im Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

Much of the tension inside the building has centered on Earl Comstock, who shepherded Ross’ confirmation on Capitol Hill and is one of the secretary’s top lieutenants as the department's policy director.

The disarray inside Commerce is drawing an intervention from chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other White House officials, who are trying to figure out how to wrest control from Comstock, who increasingly seems to be involved in everything that happens inside the department.

“Things come to a screeching halt because he demands to be the final decision on everything whether it’s an email that goes out to the Hill or a letter to respond to X, Y and Z,” said a person familiar with Commerce.

Comstock, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, has also been at the center of many of the spectrum battles between the Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Transportation, Education, Commerce and NASA and NOAA, according to an administration official. He has “literally been seeding bad intel and bad information to get other people agitated,” said the official.

He also tried to scuttle a joint White House-FCC summit on 5G, the wireless technology, in April by “calling everyone he could 24 hours before the event trying to get it to be canceled,” this person said. Comstock clashed in particular with former National Telecommunications and Information Administration chief David Redl, who left his post abruptly in May.

Critics of Ross’ leadership at Commerce also have a new target of concern: chief of staff Michael Walsh, who is described by some as inexperienced on policy and difficult to work with.

Walsh didn’t respond to a request for comment, but the Commerce official said that he has good relationships throughout the administration and on the Hill and visits the White House frequently. A second person familiar with Commerce also claimed, “People want his job so they’re spreading bad stuff on him.”

The chaos inside the department has had consequences for some employees.

“There’s great frustration among people who really want to use their skills and talents to help this country and are being marginalized by a White House who doesn’t need to ask any questions because it already thinks it has the answers,” said Roger Fisk, a Commerce official in the Obama administration. “All of that expertise is just lying dormant hiding in plain sight.""

"The Justice Department’s new Big Tech investigation was announced with unusual fanfare, and some antitrust experts say it might not herald as big of a crackdown as it seems",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Troy Wolverton'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-unusual-antitrust-announcement-could-be-good-for-big-tech-2019-7,"The US Department of Justice's surprise press release Tuesday of its Big Tech investigation was designed to send a signal to a lot of groups — but tech companies were not really one of them.

The announcement was an unusually public performance by a federal regulator which typically prizes confidentiality in such matters. That's because it was basically a notice, intended particularly to a key figure in Congress, that the Justice Department will now be spearheading the antitrust investigations into the big tech companies, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington D.C. with decades of experience working for and with competition regulators officials there.

For tech companies, the DOJs' announcement was if anything, a subtle indication that the government may not come down as hard on them as it might seem, he said.

""This is good news for the companies,"" Balto said.

That may seem a bit ironic, given the substance of the announcement. In its statement, the Justice Department said it would review the market power of the ""leading online platforms"" to see if they have thwarted competition or harmed consumers. The agency vowed to ""seek redress"" if it found violations, essentially threatening to sue the companies.

Read this: The Department of Justice just launched a broad probe into whether big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and others illegally harm competition

The announcement came as something of a surprise. Numerous reports have indicated that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission were starting to look into the competitive practices of the big tech companies. But the agencies had declined to comment on the record for those reports. In fact, federal enforcement agencies rarely acknowledge ongoing investigations into particular people or companies.

The agency is likely responding to political pressure

Unusual as it was, the Justice Department's move didn't come out of nowhere. Political figures on the left and right, including senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and President Donald Trump, have been calling for increased scrutiny of the market power of the big tech companies and even, in many cases, for breaking them up.

""There is enormous political pressure on the agencies in Washington to be seen as doing something about big tech,"" said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan's law school who focuses on antitrust issues. He continued: ""This is their way of responding to the political pressure.""

But Balto thinks there something more going on. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC and the Justice Department had divvied up oversight over the tech giants. Under the agreement, the FTC was to get authority over Facebook and Amazon, while the Department of Justice would oversee Apple and Google parent Alphabet.

The problem with that arrangement was that Mike Lee, who serves as chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights, objected to it, Balto noted. In an opinion piece published by the Washington Examiner last month, Lee lambasted the idea that the agencies would split oversight duties over the big tech companies. The two agencies risked duplicating efforts and causing a divergence in enforcement, he said.

""These investigations will clearly cover much of the same ground,"" Lee said in his op-ed. ""Splitting antitrust investigations of these firms between two agencies,"" he continued, ""is just analytically inefficient.""

The Justice Department is saying it's in charge

Lee's subcommittee was scheduled to hold a hearing on Tuesday with top antitrust regulators in the Trump administration at which he was expected to question them over the decision to split up oversight of the tech companies. That hearing ended up being postponed, but, in Balto's view, the Justice Department's announcement was its way of responding to Lee's concerns by staking out its turf.

""This is really the (Justice Department) saying, 'thank you, it's my football, and I plan to play with it,'"" he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Justice Department's review would not pre-empt the investigations already underway by the FTC into the companies under its purview.

Balto says that while the Justice Department may leave some issues to the FTC, Tuesday's announcement indicates that the DOJ is laying claim to all inquiries involving online platform and marketplace issues — the core of the antitrust charges made against the big tech companies. Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have raised concerns about how those companies use their control over their platforms and marketplaces to give their own products and services a leg up over rivals.

""These issues are incredibly complex, time consuming, and really difficult, and to have two agencies looking at the same conduct really didn't make sense,"" Balto said.

Lee's office did not respond to calls or an email seeking comment. Likewise, the Justice Department did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The move could be good news for the tech giants

The news that the Justice Department was opening up its review was seen as a negative sign on Wall Street Tuesday. The big four companies' stock prices all fell following the announcement.

But having the Justice Department take point on antitrust review is actually a good thing for the tech companies, Balto said. The Department of Justice hasn't filed a major suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act since the Microsoft case two decades ago. And the agency actually has fewer legal options when it comes to policing competition than does the FTC, he said.

""I don't think anybody's going to lose any more sleep that this is all with the Justice Department,"" Balto said. ""If anything, they'll feel more comfortable in their legal position.""

For his part, Crane is dubious that anything much will come of the investigations in the near future, regardless of which agency is leading the charge. When it comes to antitrust enforcement, the FTC's track record is not much better than the Department of Justice in recent decades, despite theoretically having enhanced enforcement powers, he said.

The courts have made it difficult for regulators to win antitrust cases, and even when such cases are successful, they tend to take many years to play out. Because of that, there's little chance the big tech companies will be broken up anytime soon, despite the political pressure on them, he said.

""The kind of blockbuster, 'let's break them up' case that is being trumpeted politically, I just don't see that being in the offing,"" Crane said.

Former DHS director objected to paying governor's staffer,https://www.kcrg.com,['Associated Press'],,,,https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Former-DHS-director-objected-to-paying-governors-staffer-513155621.html,"A former state executive unexpectedly asked to resign by the governor last month says he had objected to the governor's request that he continue paying the salary of a woman moving from his department to the governor's office.

Jerry Foxhoven, who gained national attention last week after The Associated Press reported on his admiration for the late rapper Tupac Shakur, says he declined to approve paying the salary of Elizabeth Matney. She left DHS on May 17 to accept a job as Reynolds' adviser on health policy.

Documents obtained by the AP show a memorandum of understanding between the governor's office and DHS was signed on June 19, two days after Jerry Foxhoven was asked to resign. His name appears on the document but is crossed out and replaced by Gerd Clabaugh, the interim director named by Reynolds to replace Foxhoven. Clabaugh signed it.

Foxhoven was asked to resign on June 17. He declined to specify it was the reason for his departure but confirmed Wednesday he objected to paying Matney out of DHS funds. saying Reynolds received additional funding from lawmakers for the position."
USDA rule could affect 3.1M food stamp recipients,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/usda-rule-affect-31m-food-stamp-recipients-64508284,"About 3.1 million people would lose food stamp benefits under the Trump administration's proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program.

The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the rule would close ""a loophole"" that enables people receiving only minimal benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to be eligible automatically for food stamps without undergoing further checks on their income or assets.

""For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance.

USDA estimates that 1.7 million households — 3.1 million people — ""will not otherwise meet SNAP's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule."" That would result in a net savings of about $9.4 billion over five years.

An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the impact, saying it ""may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.""

Democrats in Congress were quick to condemn the proposal.

House Speaker Nancy Pelsoi said it was ""the administration's latest act of staggering callousness"" while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he would ""fight to make sure these cuts never become a reality.""

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said the administration was trying anew to circumvent Congress and that the effect would be to ""take food away from families, prevent children from getting school meals, and make it harder for states to administer food assistance.""

Congress has rejected previous, similar attempts to change the expanded automatic eligibility provisions, most recently during the farm bill debate in 2018.

Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the proposal could discourage working families with incomes close to the maximum for SNAP participation from seeking more work out of fear that the added wages could make them ineligible for the program.

""The proposed rule would weaken SNAP's role in supporting work while making it harder for families that struggle to get by on low wages to meet their basic needs,"" he said.

About 36 million people participated in SNAP in April 2019, down from more than 38 million a year earlier.

Under current law, states may automatically make people eligible for food stamps, if they meet income and other requirements for TANF. USDA says 43 states have expanded that to include households that it says ""barely participate"" in TANF. The provision is called ""expanded categorical eligibility.""

USDA said the policy has resulted in people receiving food stamps who don't need it and wouldn't qualify under regular program rules.

Ellen Vollinger, legal director of the Food Research & Action Center, said the proposal was troubling and that the government should ""put attention on how to help more people, not undercut supports for them and make their struggle against hunger even harder.""

She said the department didn't seem to address a resulting loss of school meals, which she said the Congressional Budget Office included in its analyses of previous, similar proposals. ""It's another hit on hunger,"" she said.

Under the proposal, to qualify for automatic eligibility, people would have to get at least $50 a month in benefits from TANF for a minimum of six months.

Perdue said the change is necessary for ""preventing abuse of a critical safety net system so those who need food assistance the most are the only ones who receive it.""

The rule, expected to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, is open for public comment for 60 days.

State AGs say EPA violated law with fuel efficiency rollback,https://thehill.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/454591-state-ags-say-epa-violated-law-with-fuel-efficiency-rollback,"Several state attorneys general said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) violated the law by informing them as it planned to scale back fuel efficiency requirements for vehicles.

The attorneys say an executive order from the Clinton administration requires the agency to consult with states before proposing standards that would freeze Obama-era fuel requirements for new vehicles.

“The Trump Administration is not only paving the way for polluters, it is doing so illegally. For decades, states have stepped up to protect our planet with cost-saving, pollution-fighting clean car regulations. Trump’s Administration wants to overturn these standards, and failed to follow basic accountability measures in proposing new rules,” New York Attorney General Leticia James said in a statement.

Some states have opposed to the Trump administration's fuel economy rollback because it would prevent them from adopting the stricter fuel efficiency standards currently allowed in California.

New York, along with 11 other states, say they discovered through a Freedom of Information Act request that the agency was discussing the rollback long before they were alerted and asked EPA to open the rule back up for comment.

“The FOIA responses now confirm that the agencies have not complied with the Executive Order. The agencies should accept this supplemental comment into their rulemaking dockets because the delay in submitting the comment is attributable entirely to the agencies’ late responses to the FOIA requests,” the states said in a letter to EPA.

An EPA spokesperson said the agency would respond to the letter through the proper channels.

“As the Administration has long stated, we are pursuing one national standard to provide safe, affordable vehicles for consumers while also improving environmental outcomes,"" the agency said in an email to The Hill.

The letter was signed by Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington in addition to New York."
State Department: Europeans ‘making a real mistake’ by delaying Maduro sanctions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/state-department-europeans-making-a-real-mistake-by-delaying-maduro-sanctions,"Leading European allies are undermining negotiations to oust Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro because of their hesitance to impose sanctions on the regime, according to a top U.S. official.

“Many of the Europeans are making a real mistake here, because many of them take the position, while these negotiations are ongoing, we shouldn’t do sanctions,” Elliott Abrams, the State Department’s special representative for the Venezuela crisis, said Wednesday. “And this is exactly wrong, because while they are ongoing, if you want them to succeed, you need to increase the pressure on the regime to compromise.”

Maduro’s envoys have been meeting in Barbados with representatives of top opposition lawmaker Juan Guaidó, whom President Trump and other western powers recognized as the legitimate interim president in January. The U.S. is not a direct party to the talks, which have been mediated by Norway, but the administration has been trying to rally international pressure against the regime while offering amnesty if Maduro steps aside peacefully.

“The United States is not in this for some kind of vengeance,” Abrams said during a discussion at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank with close ties to the administration. “We are attempting to help Venezuelans recover their democracy.”

Guaidó’s team is using the Barbados talks to push for Maduro to step aside and permit free elections to form a new government, the lawmaker’s envoy in Washington confirmed, while endorsing Abrams’ criticism of the European allies.

“We need to increase that pressure from the European countries,” Ambassador Carlos Vecchio said at the forum. “In a certain way, they have been bypassing the sanctions from the U.S. using Europe and we need to close that door.”

Most European Union countries recognize Guaidó, but a handful of nations have thwarted a consensus to crack down on Maduro. The opposition leader’s position has strengthened in recent weeks, however. Greece cut ties with Maduro earlier this month, after a center-right coalition defeated the left-wing leadership that had refused to recognize Guaidó. Maduro was also weakened by a report from the United Nations’ top human rights watchdog, Michelle Bachelet, who confirmed that regime “registered 5,287 killings, purportedly for ‘resistance to authority’” in 2018.

That report “had a real impact on Western Europe,” according to Abrams, who thinks his efforts to convince holdouts such as Italy to back new sanctions might soon bear fruit.

“I hope they do a robust list of individuals involved in human rights violations,” he said. ""We’d also like to see them [impose] travel restrictions, because a lot of the ill-gotten stolen funds of the Venezuelan people are being spent living the high life in Europe, and they should stop that.”

Abrams emphasized that these sanctions should be perceived as part of an effort to convince Maduro to step aside peacefully in exchange for the amnesty offer, even if that deal seems unsatisfying in light of the regime’s apparent crimes.

“If you look at every Latin American transition to democracy that I can think of in the last 30-40 years, there is a negotiation, and there is a kind of transitional justice that isn’t really justice,” he said. “There is always some kind of compromise in which there is no perfect justice because country after country chooses peace, democracy, development over justice, frankly. It’s a compromise. And I think that that will happen in Venezuela."""
"Military starts task force after spreading toxic ""forever chemicals""",https://thehill.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/454577-military-starts-task-force-after-spreading-toxic-forever-chemicals,"Secretary Mark Esper Mark EsperWarren spars with Trump's top Defense nominee over ethics Navy secretary takes over as acting Pentagon chief after Esper formally nominated The Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes MORE created a task force to review the military’s obligation in cleaning up contamination of cancer-linked “forever chemicals” in his first act at the helm of the Department of Defense.

A class of chemicals abbreviated as PFAS are used in non-stick products ranging from teflon pans to raincoats, but the heavy use of PFAS-laden firefighting foam by military has contributed to water contamination across the country. PFAS’s persistence in the environment has earned it the “forever chemical” nickname.

“The Department is committed to taking a strong and proactive stance to address the effects arising out of any releases of these substances from all defense activities including the National Guard and Reserves. We must approach the problem in an aggressive and holistic way, ensuring a coordinated DOD-wide approach to the issue,” Esper wrote in a memo establishing the taskforce.

Esper was sworn in as Secretary of Defense late Tuesday night.

There are at least 400 military sites with PFAS contamination, and the chemical has often spread to the water supply of nearby communities. The cleanup tab is estimated to be $2 billion.

But the military has come under heavy criticism for it’s response to PFAS, including accusations the agency pushed the Environmental Protection Agency to weaken its proposed regulations on PFAS--a move likely to save the military a substantive amount of money.

The Air Force has already had to divert $66 million designated for other purposes to cover cleanup costs tied to PFAS.

The military’s new PFAS task force would be responsible for devising PFAS cleanup standards, finding an alternative firefighting foam without PFAS, and addressing “Public/Congress perceptions of DoD's efforts.”

Esper gave the task force six months to report back.

Lawmakers have been putting increasing pressure on the military to take greater responsibility for cleanup, including adding several measures to both the House and Senate versions of the defense policy bill that require DOD to work with states to clean up the contamination.

Those bills include the requirement to phase out use of PFAS firefighting foam, hence Esper’s directive to find a replacement.

“I’m encouraged that this is one of the first actions Secretary Esper is taking as Defense Secretary. PFAS contamination exposure and contamination needs to be taken seriously and must be addressed.

Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/brooklyn-man-accused-of-immigration-fraud-submitting-hundreds-of-faked-applications-doj,"A New York City man was arrested Tuesday for allegedly running an immigration fraud scheme that involved filing over 1,800 fake immigration applications over the past four years, according to a press release from the Department of Justice’s office in Vermont.

Brooklyn resident Arleigh Louison, 53, was arrested by Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents who executed a federal search warrant at his office, the press release said.

Louison’s arrest comes less than a week after a federal grand jury returned a 12-count indictment, charging him with presenting false adjustment of status petitions to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Service Center in St. Albans, Vt.

The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Vermont, which conducted the probe, said Louison made false statements in connection with Form I-360 petitions for status adjustments under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a law that enables immigrants to become lawful permanent residents (LPRs) of the U.S. if they were abused by a relative who is a U.S. citizen or LPR.

Louison allegedly submitted false information in the VAWA petitions so petitioners could secure work authorization permits. Last week’s indictment charged that the petitioners – who paid Louison for his services – were not abused as described in the petitions and never discussed abuse with Louison.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general will investigate allegations that William L. Wehrum, the agency’s former air quality chief, violated ethics rules when he met with former clients from his days as a lawyer and lobbyist for the oil, gas and coal industries.

The inquiry will look into whether Mr. Wehrum’s efforts at the E.P.A. to weaken climate change and air pollution standards improperly benefited those former clients, a congressional aide said .

At issue are Mr. Wehrum’s ties to the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a coalition of utilities and trade groups that lobbies on behalf of coal-fired power plants, which he represented as a lawyer at his former firm, Hunton & Williams.

That relationship first drew scrutiny last year after Politico reported that the 25 power companies and six trade groups that make up the coalition paid the firm more than $8 million in 2017 just before President Trump appointed Mr. Wehrum.

USDA proposes crackdown on food stamps,https://www.wilx.com,['Kylie Khan'],,,,https://www.wilx.com/content/news/USDA-proposal-could--513154071.html,"A lot of struggling families are at risk of losing their SNAP benefits.

Pixabay / MGN

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced a new plan to eliminate automatic enrollment for those who are already part of other programs.

Right now, most states including Michigan, allow those who are part of some welfare programs to automatically enroll in the SNAP program.

The change could impact more than three million Americans.

""Any time there is limitations on the eligibility for the SNAP program, more people are removed from the program and then in need of food, and then they come to food pantries in our network,"" said Kait Skwir with the Food Bank Council of Michigan.

Because the information is so new, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services doesn't have a number for how many people will be affected.

A spokesperson says it would likely be a small percent of the one million Michiganders in the program.

""These are people with incomes that are very close to the poverty threshold, and so their ability to save and move toward self-sufficiency is dramatically impacted by losing a benefit like food assistance,"" said Skwir.

The Michigan League for Public Policy, a nonpartisan group, says the change could also impact the economy.

""They're not buying things on Amazon. They're not paying off old credit card debt. What they're doing with those federal dollars is they are buying food from a local grocery store,"" said Peter Ruark with the Michigan League for Public Policy.

USDA officials say this will close a ""loophole"" that allows people to abuse the system.

In Michigan, that's about .3% of recipients, according to MDHHS.

""I don't think I would call this a loophole. We do have programs in place to find fraud when there's any fraud occurring with the food assistance program or other programs,"" said Bob Wheaton with MDHHS.

MDHHS Director Robert Gordon said, “Instead of supporting work, this proposal punishes full-time earners. Instead of targeting fraud and abuse, this proposal goes after families playing by all the rules. It is a radical break from a long-standing, bipartisan approach to food assistance.”

The Trump administration says this plan would save $2.5 billion.

Our aim was to directly estimate the health and longevity impacts of current PM 2.5 concentrations and the benefits of reductions from 1999 to 2015, nationally and at county level, for the entire contemporary population of the contiguous United States. Methods and findings We used vital registration and population data with information on sex, age, cause of death, and county of residence. We used four Bayesian spatiotemporal models, with different adjustments for other determinants of mortality, to directly estimate mortality and life expectancy loss due to current PM 2.5 pollution and the benefits of reductions since 1999, nationally and by county. The covariates included in the adjusted models were per capita income; percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, who are of Black or African American race, who have graduated from high school, who live in urban areas, and who are unemployed; cumulative smoking; and mean temperature and relative humidity. In the main model, which adjusted for these covariates and for unobserved county characteristics through the use of county-specific random intercepts, PM 2.5 pollution in excess of the lowest observed concentration (2.8 μg/m3) was responsible for an estimated 15,612 deaths (95% credible interval 13,248–17,945) in females and 14,757 deaths (12,617–16,919) in males. These deaths would lower national life expectancy by an estimated 0.15 years (0.13–0.17) for women and 0.13 years (0.11–0.15) for men. The life expectancy loss due to PM 2.5 was largest around Los Angeles and in some southern states such as Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Alabama. At any PM 2.5 concentration, life expectancy loss was, on average, larger in counties with lower income and higher poverty rate than in wealthier counties. Reductions in PM 2.5 since 1999 have lowered mortality in all but 14 counties where PM 2.5 increased slightly. The main limitation of our study, similar to other observational studies, is that it is not guaranteed for the observed associations to be causal. We did not have annual county-level data on other important determinants of mortality, such as healthcare access and quality and diet, but these factors were adjusted for with use of county-specific random intercepts. Conclusions According to our estimates, recent reductions in particulate matter pollution in the USA have resulted in public health benefits. Nonetheless, we estimate that current concentrations are associated with mortality impacts and loss of life expectancy, with larger impacts in counties with lower income and higher poverty rate.

Introduction Clean air policies and innovations in automotive, power generation, and industrial technologies have substantially improved air quality in the United States of America and other high-income countries [1]. These efforts were largely motivated by the evidence on the health hazards of air pollutants, especially fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) [2–7]. Nonetheless, in 2015, nearly 9% of the US population lived in counties with PM 2.5 concentrations above the WHO Air Quality Guideline of 10 μg/m3 [8], and another 89% in counties with concentrations of 5–10 μg/m3 (Fig 1). Recent epidemiological cohorts have observed adverse health impacts of PM 2.5 even at these relatively low concentrations [6,9–12]. These findings indicate that further reducing PM 2.5 is likely to lower mortality, especially from cardiorespiratory diseases, and increase longevity, as did the late 20th-century reductions [1]. Despite this evidence, there is not only resistance to more stringent control of PM 2.5 but also attempts to roll back current standards [13–19]. PPT PowerPoint slide

PM 2.5 , fine particulate matter. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002856.g001 Evidence-based air pollution regulations and policies require quantitative estimates of the health effects of air pollution in the low-concentration range for the contemporary US population, both in terms of deaths averted as a result of past reductions and those avertable if current concentrations are further reduced [20]. Previous estimates of the mortality burden of air pollution mostly extrapolated risk coefficients from epidemiological cohorts to the contemporary US population (see Methods) [21–24]. The only direct analyses of longevity loss due to air pollution focused on a subset of metropolitan areas [1,25], largely before concentrations were at their current relatively low levels, which are the subject of policy debate. Therefore, the fundamental questions of the benefits of current regulations and of further lowering concentrations for preventing deaths and increasing longevity have not been directly answered. In this study, we used publicly available data to directly estimate the number of deaths, by age group and sex, and loss of life expectancy due to current PM 2.5 concentrations in the entire contiguous USA (i.e., excluding Alaska and Hawaii), as well as the benefits of reductions since 1999. We present estimates of averted and avertable deaths and improved longevity nationally as well as at the small-area (county) level, which shows where the current death toll of air pollution is largest and where the health benefits of past controls have been greatest.

Methods Study design Our aim was to quantify, nationally as well as at the small-area (county) level, the current mortality burden of PM 2.5 pollution and the averted mortality as a result of recent PM 2.5 reductions. The most common source of information on the health effects of air pollution exposure is from prospective cohort studies [2–7,10,12]. By design, prospective cohort studies provide information on the risk associated with PM 2.5 in a specific group of participants after a follow-up period, during which other determinants of population health also change. Therefore, estimates of excess mortality and loss of life expectancy due to air pollution in the contemporary population through application of risk estimates from prospective cohorts [6,21] implicitly assume that the magnitude of risk associated with PM 2.5 in the prospective cohort participants is the same as the contemporary general population. A direct approach for measuring the mortality burden of air pollution is to analyse the association of death rates with PM 2.5 concentration across a large number of small-area units, such as counties, appropriately adjusting for other determinants of mortality [1,25–28]. Here, we used four Bayesian spatiotemporal models, with different degrees of adjustment for county characteristics that may also affect mortality, to directly estimate the mortality risk associated with PM 2.5 in US counties from 1999 to 2015. We then used these associations to calculate excess deaths and life expectancy loss associated with current PM 2.5 concentrations, as well as the benefits of reductions since 1999, for all counties in the contiguous USA. The study did not have a protocol or prespecified analysis plan. We began the analysis in 1999 for two reasons: First, reliable data on PM 2.5 throughout the USA became available in 1999, when the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set up the Federal Method network of PM 2.5 monitors [29]. Second, the USA switched from the ninth revision to the tenth revision of the International Classification of Disease (ICD) system in 1999 [30]. Therefore, the post-1999 data use a consistent system of the assignment of the medical cause of death. Data sources We used data on deaths by sex, age, underlying cause of death, and county of residence from vital registration through the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/dvs_data_release.htm) and on population from the NCHS bridged-race data set (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race.htm) from 1999 to 2015. From 1999 to 2015, there were a total of 41.9 million deaths in the contiguous USA; 18.4 million of these deaths were from cardiorespiratory diseases (ICD-10 codes beginning with I and J), for which there is strong evidence of an association with air pollution. Annual average PM 2.5 concentrations were from an integrated geographic regression model detailed elsewhere [31]. In summary, the modelling of PM 2.5 involved the application of a universal kriging approach to monitoring data and hundreds of geographic variables. The number of monitors that informed the estimates ranged from 599 in 1999 to 1,114 in 2002. There were more than 750 monitors for every year from 2000 to 2015. The variables in the model include population, elevation, vegetation, imperviousness, distance to traffic and other emission sources (for example, roads and intersections, railroad, airport, port, large point sources, etc.), and land use and cover (for example, forestland, rangeland, water, urban or built-up land divided into residential, commercial, etc.). The model also included satellite-derived estimates of particle pollution based on optical depth. The satellite-driven estimates help inform large-scale variability due to meteorological factors and regional sources, whereas the emissions and land use and land cover variables inform more localised concentration variability. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation by leaving out some of the monitoring data from the model, which are then compared with model prediction. Annual PM 2.5 concentrations were predicted for all years from 1999 to 2015 at all 2010 census block centroids in the contiguous USA and were aggregated by population-weighting to county level. The PM 2.5 concentrations can be downloaded freely through https://www.caces.us/data. We also gathered publicly available data on other county characteristics that may affect mortality: Per capita income ($), adjusted for inflation using the year 2000 as a baseline, from the CA1 data set from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (https://apps.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm) (used as log-transformed).

Percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, from the US Census Bureau’s Small-Area Income and Poverty Estimates data set (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/data/datasets.All.html).

Percentage of population who are of Black or African American race, through the NCHS bridged-race data set (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race.htm).

Education, measured as percentage of population above the age of 25 years who have a high-school diploma or above, from the US Department of Agriculture (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/download-data/). The data set contained US Decennial Census data for 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 and American Community Survey 5-year estimates for the period 2011 to 2015. We linearly interpolated between 1990 and 2000 data to estimate the percentage of the population who had graduated from high school for 1999. We similarly estimated values for each county for years from 2001 to 2010 by linearly interpolating between 2000 and 2011 data.

Unemployment, measured as percentage of population who are unemployed, calculated by dividing the number of people who are unemployed—available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/lau/)—by total county population.

Urbanicity, measured as percentage of population who live in urban areas, from the US Census Bureau’s decennial census data for 2000 and 2010 (https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml). We linearly interpolated between 2000 and 2010 data to estimate the percentage of population living in urban areas for 2001 to 2009. We used data from the year 2000 for 1999, and those from 2010 for 2011 to 2015.

Cumulative smoking, proxied by log-transformed age-standardised lung cancer death rates as in previous population-based analyses [1,32–34]. We calculated lung cancer death rates using the abovementioned deaths on lung cancer (ICD 10 codes C33 and C34) and population. We used lung cancer death rates because when smoking prevalence or intensity change, it is a better measure of the mortality risk than current levels [33]. Further, there are data on lung cancer death rates, but not on smoking prevalence, for every county and analysis year.

Temperature and relative humidity, from ERA-Interim (https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim-full-daily/levtype=sfc/), which combines predictions from a physical model with in situ and satellite measurements [35]. We used gridded 4-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate yearly temperature and relative humidity values by county throughout the analysis period. Units of analysis In 2015, there were 3,108 counties in the contiguous USA. Over time, some counties were merged or split to create new counties. To avoid inconsistent analysis units over time, such counties were combined for the entire analysis period in order to have an unambiguously consistent set of analysis units. This resulted in 3,082 nonoverlapping county units in the contiguous USA with consistent boundaries for the entire analysis period. The populations of these 3,082 counties from 1999 to 2015 ranged from 55 to 10,112,255. In small counties, some age groups had zero population in some years, which makes it impossible to calculate death rates. To avoid zero populations, we recursively merged counties with sex-specific populations smaller than 25,000 in any year with their neighbours until the populations in all sex-year combinations surpassed 25,000 in the newly formed county units. We merged counties without crossing state boundaries or combining urban and rural counties. We determined the urbanicity of each county from the NCHS’s Urban–Rural Classification Scheme for Counties in 2006 (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm), which divides counties into six categories—large central metro, large fringe metro, medium metro, small metro, micropolitan, and noncore—based on their population and overlap with metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas. We considered counties categorised under the first four as urban counties and the last two as rural counties. Using this algorithm, we created a total of 1,339 county units that covered the entire contiguous USA that were used for statistical analyses described below. PM 2.5 concentrations for each of the constituent counties were population-weighted up to the level of the newly formed county units. The median absolute difference in PM 2.5 concentration between the merged counties and their constituents from 1999 to 2015 was 0.28 μg/m3. The sociodemographic, environmental, and mortality characteristics of the merged counties are summarised in Table 1. PPT PowerPoint slide

The four models had similar structures but differed in the extent of adjustment for county characteristics that may also influence mortality, as described below and shown in Table 2.

Models used for relating county death rates to PM 2.5 concentrations. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002856.t002 In all four models, log-transformed death rates were modelled as a sum of components that depend on time and air pollution, with some models also including terms for other time-varying county characteristics. In this specification, the coefficient of the PM 2.5 term represents the logarithm of the proportional change in death rate for each unit additional PM 2.5 concentration, akin to proportional hazard models used in analyses of prospective cohorts. All models contained terms to capture the overall level and rate of change of mortality, with α 0 as the common intercept for log-transformed death rates and β 0 the common time slope. Nonlinear trends were captured by a first-order random walk ν year [36]. All models also included a term that relates log-transformed death rate to county PM 2.5 concentration, with the coefficient γ representing the logarithm of the rate ratio per 1 μg/m3 higher concentration. ε county−year is an overdispersion term that captures the variation unaccounted for by other terms in the model and is modelled as . The Unadjusted model had no adjustments for county-level characteristics and quantifies the observed association of county-level death rates with their PM 2.5 concentrations. The Covariate model adjusted for nine time-varying county-level covariates X i−county−year (i = 1…9) (per capita income; percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, who are of Black or African American race, who have graduated from high school, who live in urban areas, and who are unemployed; a proxy for cumulative smoking; and mean temperature and relative humidity) with associated covariate-specific slopes, θ i . This model is analogous to the approach used by cohort studies, which typically adjust for baseline characteristics. The Covariate-and-county model largely removed systematic variations in death rates and PM 2.5 concentration across counties through the use of county-specific random intercepts (α county ), hence implicitly adjusted for unobserved characteristics that systematically lead to higher or lower pollution and mortality in each county. In this model, the mortality effects of air pollution are mainly inferred through differential changes over time in death rates and PM 2.5 concentrations across counties, similar to the difference-in-difference model used in econometric analyses [1,25]. The Restrictive model included both county-specific random intercepts and random slopes (β county ), hence also implicitly adjusted for (linear) differential change in death rates and PM 2.5 concentrations across counties and relates changes in PM 2.5 concentration to changes in death rates after removing linear trends in mortality and pollution. By design, this model leaves limited spatial or temporal variation in death rates and estimates association with PM 2.5 based only on the mortality residual not explained by linear trends. We included the Restrictive model because not only might level of mortality in a county be affected by unobserved/unmeasured factors, but so might its trend. All county-specific random intercepts and slopes were modelled using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure that (empirically) allows for death rates to be more similar across neighbouring counties than those that are further away. We fitted the models using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), using the R-INLA software, which offers orders of magnitude of computational efficiency improvement in Bayesian inference compared to traditional MCMC for latent Gaussian models. As in previous work [37], weakly informative hyperpriors of logGamma(1, 0.001) were specified on the logarithm of the precisions of the random effects so that the parameter estimates were data driven. Computer code for the models is available through http://www.globalenvhealth.org/. Each model was applied to county-level cardiorespiratory death rates separately by sex and age group (5-year age groups from birth to 85 years and 85 years and older) because death rates vary by age group and sex, as might their associations with air pollution [38]. From each model, we estimated age-specific proportional increases in death rates (i.e., rate ratios) for each 1 μg/m3 of PM 2.5 (the rate ratios are the exponential of the coefficients of PM 2.5 ). We used the rate ratios from these models to calculate how many cardiorespiratory deaths in each five-year age group would be averted if PM 2.5 concentration in each county were the same as the lowest observed concentration (2.8 μg/m3, in Apache, Arizona). This value is similar to the 2.5–3.5 μg/m3 concentration used by the US EPA as a policy-relevant background level [39]. We conducted a similar analysis to calculate the number of averted deaths and life expectancy gain as a result of PM 2.5 reductions achieved from 1999 to 2015 by calculating the difference in the actual number of deaths in 1999 and those expected if PM 2.5 concentration in each county had been at its 2015 level. In all scenarios, national estimates were obtained by summing the number of averted deaths in each age group across counties. We used a lifetable to convert the estimated reduction in death rates that would be expected from lower concentrations to gain in life expectancy [32,40] at the county as well as national level. Specifically, we used the observed age-specific death rates to calculate life expectancy for each county or merged county unit, using standard lifetable techniques [40]. We calculated life expectancy under the counterfactual scenario of alternative PM 2.5 concentration by subtracting the number of deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases in each age group if PM 2.5 concentrations were at their alternative level from the observed number of deaths [32]. The difference between the observed and counterfactual life expectancy measures the contribution of PM 2.5 pollution to life expectancy loss. In calculating life expectancies, we used the Kannisto–Thatcher method to expand the terminal (85 years and older) age group of the life table [41]. We report national and county results using the Covariate-and-county model as our main results because it fully adjusts for county characteristics through inclusion of covariates and random intercepts without being overly restrictive. To understand the impact of adjustments on our results, we compare national results from the Covariate-and-county model with those of the other three models. Finally, we tested whether, after accounting for differences in PM 2.5 concentration, life expectancy loss depends on county sociodemographic characteristics including per capita income, percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, percentage who are of Black or African American race, and percentage who have graduated from high school. For this purpose, we used a regression with life expectancy loss in 2015 estimated from the Covariate-and-county model as the dependent variable and PM 2.5 concentration exceeding observed minimum of 2.8 μg/m3 and quintiles of each sociodemographic characteristic as independent variables. We report the difference between the first and fifth quintiles in Results.

Discussion In this direct national analysis of mortality and life expectancy loss due to PM 2.5 pollution, we estimate that current air pollution concentrations, which are relatively low by historical standards and mostly below the current national ambient air quality standard, are associated with a significant health burden after any reasonable control for other local determinants of mortality. The loss of longevity is larger in poorer counties, contributing to nationwide health inequalities. We also find that reductions in air pollution since 1999 have contributed to the longevity gains in the US population, with larger benefits especially in California and some southern states such as Alabama and Georgia, where PM 2.5 declined more than the national average. Two previous direct analyses of longevity loss due to air pollution in the USA focused on a subset of metro areas [1,25], largely before the current low concentrations were achieved, and hence are not directly comparable to our results. One study, using data from approximately 1980 to approximately 2000 from 211 counties in 51 metropolitan areas [1], found a life expectancy effect that was between the estimated effects of our Covariate-and-county and Covariate models. The other, using data from 2000 to 2007 in 545 counties, found a life expectancy effect similar to our Covariate-and-county model [25]. Neither study reported national or county-level life expectancy loss due to current pollution levels. Indirect estimate of life expectancy loss due to PM 2.5 in the USA, with use of pooled hazard ratios from prospective cohort studies, is 0.38 years [24], which is midway between the estimates from our Covariate-and-county and Covariate models. The main strength of our study is making direct estimates of the effects of PM 2.5 pollution on death rates of the contemporary US population, nationally and for all counties or clusters of small counties. We further stratified our results by county sociodemographic characteristics, which reveals the role of air pollution on life expectancy inequalities. We present results using a range of model specifications, which shows how different adjustments for time-varying county-level determinants of mortality influence the estimated effect of air pollution. Finally, and importantly, the data used in our analysis are publicly available, as is the computer code for our statistical models, making our analysis fully transparent and replicable by others. Our analysis also meets the recent requirement of being based on publicly available data sets [16,43]. The main limitation of our study, similar to other observational studies, is that it is not guaranteed for the observed associations to be causal. We did not have annual county-level data on other important determinants of mortality, such as healthcare access and quality and diet. These factors are nonetheless implicitly adjusted for in our Covariate-and-county model. In particular, air pollution is a mixture of different pollutants. Of these, PM 2.5 pollution has been consistently, independently, and coherently related to various diseases affected by air pollution [4,5,44,45]. Nonetheless, other pollutants, which may be partially correlated with PM 2.5 , may also have an effect. For example, the correlation coefficient between PM 2.5 and ozone was 0.55 and between PM 2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) 0.50 across all county-years in our analysis. Adjustment for ozone in the Covariate-and-county model led to slightly larger rate ratios for PM 2.5 , while adjustment for NO 2 dampened the rate ratios, as also seen in an analysis of the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort [38]. However, according to the US EPA Integrated Science Assessment, current evidence is considered suggestive but not sufficient for a causal association between NO 2 and cardiovascular mortality [46]; for ozone, the evidence was evaluated as suggestive for total mortality but as limited for cardiovascular mortality [47]. As described in the analysis of the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort, the impacts of these adjustments may be due to collinearity. Alternatively, it may be the case that some of the spatial variation in particle pollution that was not captured by the integrated geographic regression model is represented by ozone (typically aged or secondary, regional particle pollution) and/or NO 2 (fresh and local particle pollution) [38], even if neither is directly related to cardiovascular mortality. For these reasons, ‘the results of the multi-pollutant models should be interpreted with caution’ [38]. Because the hazardous effects of smoking depend not only on current cigarette use but also on past smoking behaviour, including age at smoking initiation, duration of smoking, and number of cigarettes smoked per day, we used lung cancer death rate as the proxy for the cumulative hazards of smoking in a population. Although lung cancer death rate is a robust proxy for the cumulative hazards of smoking [33,34], it is also affected by air pollution, albeit to a much smaller degree than smoking, and hence its use to control for smoking leads to somewhat conservative estimates of the effect of air pollution. Finally, the modelled PM 2.5 concentrations may have some error, which typically lowers the estimated effect of air pollution towards the null. In summary, public health policy and regulatory efforts in the USA have spurred technological innovations and contributed to reduced air pollution. Although the health benefits of large pollution reductions in major metropolitan areas in the twentieth century [1] are widely acknowledged, there is policy resistance to actions that would further lower the concentration of pollutants such as PM 2.5 , most recently through requirements that constrain the evaluation of health effects of air pollution to publicly available data sets [16,43]. Our direct national analysis of the mortality burden of PM 2.5 pollution, using publicly available data and with a range of analytical models, indicate that current PM 2.5 pollution continues to contribute to mortality and loss of longevity in the USA, with larger harms in poorer counties. Our results suggest that further lowering PM 2.5 pollution is likely to benefit the health of the entire US population, and lower health inequalities.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Utah attorney general’s office has failed to turn over documents for a federal probe into allegations that state officials lied about budget cuts during the Great Recession to get federal grants, the U.S. Department of Justice said.

The department has asked a federal court to compel the state to comply with subpoenas from its inspector general’s office, The Salt Lake Tribune reported Tuesday.

The state “has failed to produce a single document” despite numerous requests since April to state Attorney General Sean Reyes’ office, the DOJ said in its court filing.

It also claims the state has not given a reason for the noncompliance.

Reyes’ office disputes the claims, noting in a statement that it is limited on what it can say because of a secrecy order.

Utah has cooperated to the “maximum extent allowable under legal and ethical rules and has been following strict orders of this court not to disclose anything publicly,” Reyes’ office said.

The allegations involved a prior administration, Reyes’ office said. The state agencies involved “will provide defenses of their conduct at the appropriate time when instructed by the court,” it said.

The DOJ is investigating if state officials falsely represented that budget cuts eliminated state jobs so they could obtain grants to restore those jobs from 2009 to 2013. Grants were awarded to the attorney general’s office, state courts administration, Juvenile Justice Services and the state Department of Public Safety.

The DOJ has requested documents and communications on job creation and replacement, personnel records for grant-funded workers, and information about employee transferring practices.

"DOJ Probing Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon",https://www.investopedia.com,['Mark Kolakowski'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.investopedia.com/doj-antitrust-probe-of-big-tech-4694494,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced that it is ""reviewing the practices of market-leading online platforms,"" with a view towards determining whether they have ""reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers."" The DOJ press release indicates that they are responding to ""widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online.""

Goal of the Review

The goal of this review is to ""assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace...and to ensure that Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want.""

Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division provided this quote for the press release: ""Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.""

The DOJ says that it will ""seek redress"" for any violations of law, without offering any further specifics.

Likely Targets

The DOJ press release does not mention specific companies, but its language suggests that the key targets of this review are likely to be among the mega cap FAANG members. Facebook Inc. (FB) is the leader in social media, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is the preeminent online retailer, and the Google division of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is by far the dominant search engine. Apple Inc. (AAPL), meanwhile, has been mentioned in various press reports as another likely target.

Double Trouble

The DOJ already has been partnering with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in reviewing competitive practices in the tech industry, with an eye towards possible antitrust violations, per an earlier report in Barron's. According to that article, the FTC is taking the lead on Amazon.com and Facebook, while the DOJ leads on Apple and Alphabet.

However, the current announcement from the DOJ seems to be ratcheting up the pressure on the tech giants, The Wall Street Journal reports. It now seems possible that a given company may face antitrust actions launched by both the DOJ and the FTC, greatly increasing the potential penalties. Meanwhile, executives from these same tech giants testified last week before a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee on antitrust matters.

Calls For Breakup

All four FAANG members mentioned above have been under fire from various quarters for allegedly monopolistic practices. In a recent ""private presentation"" to the DOJ, critics of Facebook, including some academics, reportedly argued that the company should be broken up, per the Journal. Google and Amazon also have faced calls for breakup at various times in recent years, from various constituencies."
Department of Labor Opinion: Driver Sleeper Berth Off-Duty Time Need Not Be Compensated,https://www.ttnews.com,"['Eric Miller', 'Staff Reporter']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.ttnews.com/articles/department-labor-opinion-driver-sleeper-berth-duty-time-need-not-be-compensated,"[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]

The U.S. Department of Labor has clarified that the time drivers spend in sleeper berths does not count as compensable time, unless they are actually performing work or are on call.

The decision was outlined in an opinion letter, written July 22 by DOL Wage and Hour Division Administrator Cheryl Stanton, based on the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

She said that past guidance by the department’s Wage and Hour Division has been “unnecessarily burdensome for employers.”

Stanton

Stanton wrote that her opinion “adopts a straightforward reading of the plain language under which the time drivers are relieved of all duties and permitted to sleep in a sleeper berth is presumptively non-duty sleeping time and non-working time when the employer permits the employee to sleep in adequate facilities.”

The presumption that nonworking time in which the employee is relieved of all duties is not compensable holds true regardless of whether the truck is moving or stationary, Stanton said.

American Trucking Associations said the opinion will help the industry better understand its compliance obligations prospectively, rather than settling such matters only after the fact through “costly and wasteful litigation.”

“ATA commends Acting Secretary [Patrick] Pizzella and Administrator Stanton for adopting a straightforward, plain-language reading of the law, rather than the burdensome alternative interpretation embraced by those outlier decisions,” Chris Spear, the federation’s president, said July 22.

“This opinion, which is consistent with decades-old DOL regulations, the weight of judicial authority, and the long understanding of the trucking industry, clears up confusion created by two recent court decisions that called the compensability of sleeper berth time into question.”

Spear was referring to previous court decisions by federal district judges in Arkansas and Arizona that truck drivers are entitled to compensation for time in the sleeper berth. However, those decisions were preceded by two federal cases that resulted in legal rulings more favorable for carriers, including one that was affirmed by an appeals court.

Pianka

“This isn’t a regulation. This is just agency guidance,” added Richard Pianka, ATA’s deputy general counsel. “This is DOL’s view of what the law means.”

However, Pianka told Transport Topics the opinion can be expected to be very influential in court challenges on driver sleeper-berth pay issues.

“A court does not have to give this dispositive weight,” Pianka said. “But they will give it serious consideration and they will not reject it out of hand.”

Pianka continued, “We’re hoping that this opinion letter will clear up the confusion and keep outliers confined, as opposed to spreading further, and that this wave of class-action liability will simmer down.”

Andy Scott, an attorney with Atlanta law firm Fisher & Phillips LLP, who does work for trucking companies, said these cases were just starting to gather strength.

“This new opinion is going to nip that trend in the bud,” he said. “It will probably make it easier to win the cases that are currently underway.”"
Democrats press Trump Treasury picks on donor disclosure guidelines,https://thehill.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/454563-dems-press-treasury-nominees-on-guidance-reducing-donor-disclosure,"Democratic senators at a hearing on Wednesday pressed Treasury Department nominees on guidance the department issued last year reducing donor disclosure requirement for certain tax-exempt groups.

The Finance Committee held a hearing on four nominations to Treasury and tax court positions. These included the nominations of Brent McIntosh, the current Treasury general counsel, to be a Treasury undersecretary, and Brian Callanan, the current Treasury deputy general counsel, to succeed McIntosh as general counsel.

Democrats focused many of their questions to McIntosh and Callanan on the process Treasury undertook before issuing the donor disclosure guidance.

Under the guidance, which Treasury issued with the IRS, certain tax-exempt groups — including social-welfare organizations such as the National Rifle Association and the American Civil Liberties Union — will no longer be required to report the names and addresses of major donors on annual forms.

Republicans have said the guidance is important in order to protect taxpayers’ privacy and First Amendment rights. But Democrats have long taken issue with the guidance, which they say could make it easier for foreign government and “dark money” groups to influence U.S. elections. Last year, the Senate approved a resolution to overturn the guidance, though the House did not take it up.

Hassan noted that two states, Montana and New Jersey, have challenged the guidance in court because there wasn’t a public notice and comment period. She argued that the guidance could make it harder for the government to go after pharmaceutical companies who funded nonprofits that provided fraudulent information about drug addiction.

“In effect, the Treasury has hamstrung law enforcement’s ability to follow the money and hold pharma accountable for fraud,” she said.

McIntosh said the IRS made the decision to issue the guidance without a notice and comment period. He said he was aware that the guidance was going to be issued but he didn’t decide that the guidance wouldn’t come in the form of a regulation.

McIntosh also said he thinks there is a “long tradition” of the IRS relieving reporting requirements without notice and comment.

Callanan said that other units at Treasury and the IRS first analyzed the guidance action, and that he reviewed their analysis and “was comfortable with the substantive and procedural legal considerations, that it was within the statutory authority.”

Callanan said that FinCEN generally doesn’t make use of tax-return information, and that the legal path for FinCEN to access such information is “exceedingly narrow.” He said that he didn’t know if FinCEN was consulted but would look into it.

Callanan also said, in response to a letter Wyden and Casey sent to the IRS earlier this month, that lawyers for the IRS’s criminal tax function were consulted.

Ron Johnson Ronald (Ron) Harold JohnsonGOP leaders struggle to contain conservative anger over budget deal Mystery surrounds elusive sanctions on Russia Trump may intervene in Pentagon cloud-computing contract: report MORE (R-Wis.).

Wyden said he has “deep concerns” about McIntosh and Callanan’s nominations because of their roles at Treasury when the donor guidance was issued and because of their involvement in Treasury’s rejection of House Democrats’ request for President Trump Donald John Trump Ocasio-Cortez about as well known as top Democrats: poll Protestor yelling about Trump Tower meeting thrown out of Mueller hearing Chris Wallace: 'This has been a disaster for the Democrats' and 'for the reputation of Robert Mueller' MORE’s tax returns.

Wyden had put a hold on the nominations in June, because he found Treasury’s responses to his questions about the handling of the tax return request unsatisfactory. Last week, Wyden announced that he would let the nominations move forward, after Treasury provided information that the senator said confirmed that the department’s actions are “unprecedented.”

“Mr. McIntosh and Mr. Callanan are currently the top lawyers at the Treasury Department,” Wyden said. “It has appeared that Treasury’s leadership is more interested in protecting Donald Trump and party interests than guaranteeing the department follows the law. So in my judgment, that’s not the kind of conduct that gets you a promotion.”"
