‘We’re All Tired of Being Called Racists’,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Elaina Plott'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/08/trump-supporters-called-racists/595333/,"Read: Two nights, two very different ways of talking about race

“It’s sad,” he continued, “that using ‘racism’ has become the easy button of left-wing politics. All right? Because guess what? It still is an issue … But by making a mockery of it by saying every time you can’t win a fight—‘Oh! We’re just gonna push the button! It’s racist’—you hurt those that are actually afflicted by it. People hear it, they roll their eyes, and they walk on. And that’s a disgrace, and that’s what you’ve been given in the identity politics of the left.”

The crowd erupted in jeers and boos. It was a segment of Jr.’s speech that in many ways echoed that of a speaker who’d appeared before him, Brandon Straka, a gay Trump supporter who founded the WalkAway movement to encourage people to leave the Democratic Party. “Insinuations of bigotry and racism,” Straka claimed, were “divisive tactics” used by the “liberal media to control minorities in this country.” “This is a president who serves minorities,” he said, “because he loves minorities.”

As speakers mounted their defenses of the president, it seemed apparent that supporters were cheering them on as a means of affirming not just Trump, but also themselves. Because to accuse a politician of holding virulent racist beliefs is also, if only implicitly, to condemn his or her voters of harboring those same tendencies.

And that’s what the rally-goers I spoke to last night seemed most nonplussed by—not so much that Trump had been roundly condemned in recent days as a racist, or a bigot, but that they, by virtue of association, had been as well. But rather than distancing them from Trump, the accusations have only seemed to strengthen their support of this president. To back down, they suggested, would be to bow down to the scourge of political correctness.

“We’re all tired of being called racists,” a 74-year-old bespectacled white man named Richard Haines told me. “You open your mouth, you’re a racist. My daughter is a liberal, and she’s [using the word] all the time. We don’t talk politics; we can’t—all the time she always accuses me of hate.”

Haines, who told me he had just returned to the United States from Thailand, where he had done missionary work for 15 years with impoverished children, said that he knew what real racism looked like—that his father was a “bigot” who “didn’t like black people.”

“Donald is not racist, you know?” Haines said. “He makes a statement, and they take the words out of context and try to twist everything so that he’s a racist. And I think it’s gonna backfire.”

Before the rally began, I sat down on the floor of the arena with two women—Roseanna, 50, and Amy, 48—who felt similarly. (Neither woman was comfortable providing her last name for this story.) Roseanna, who wore a red T-shirt, white shorts, and a MAGA hat adorned with multiple buttons, including one featuring the likeness of Hillary Clinton behind bars, had driven an hour and a half from Lexington, Kentucky. She defended Trump’s statements about Baltimore. “He didn’t say nothing about the color of somebody’s skin,” Roseanna said, yet it seemed like everyone was “wishing him toward ‘He’s a bigot.’



“I’m sick to death of it. I have 13 grandchildren—13,” she continued. “Four of them are biracial, black and white; another two of them are black and white; and another two of them are Singapore and white. You think I’m a racist? I go and I give them kids kisses like nobody’s business.”"
Fact check: Trump makes more than 20 false claims at Cincinnati rally,https://www.cnn.com,"['Daniel Dale', 'Tara Subramaniam', 'Holmes Lybrand']",08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/02/politics/donald-trump-cincinnati-rally-fact-check/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's rally speech in Cincinnati on Thursday was littered with false claims -- several of them egregious, several of them trivial, and most of them repeated from previous remarks.

By our count, Trump made more than 20 false or misleading claims during his 79-minute address.

Here's our fact check of each one.

Wind turbines

""The previous administration, they liked windmills. You know windmills: if a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless.""

Facts First: While some homes might fall in value when turbines are erected close by, studies in the US have While some homes might fall in value when turbines are erected close by, studies in the US have not found that homes generally become anywhere close to ""practically worthless"" in such cases -- and some have found no significant decline at all.

A 2016 study published in the Journal of Real Estate Research, for example, analyzed ""more than 122,000 home sales, between 1998 and 2012, that occurred near (within 10 miles) 41 turbines in densely populated Massachusetts communities."" The study found ""no unique impact on the rate of home sales near wind turbines.""

Lottery system

""We're replacing random migration and we're replacing the lottery system. How about the lottery system? How about lotteries? This was Chuck Schumer: you put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in the basket. And you pick people out of the lottery. 'Well, let's see, this one's a murderer. This one robbed four banks, this one ... I'd better, not say ... this one, another murderer, ladies and gentlemen, another murderer.""

Facts First: Almost everything Trump said here was inaccurate. Foreign countries don't enter people into the green card lottery conducted by the State Department, let alone deliberately enter their criminals and problem citizens. Individuals enter on their own because they want to immigrate.

The people whose names are selected are subjected to an extensive vetting process that includes a criminal background check.

Open borders

""The greatest betrayal committed by the Democrats is their support for open borders. And these open borders would overwhelm schools and hospitals, drain public services and flood communities with poisonous drugs.""

Facts First: This is misleading. Some Democrats, including presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Julián Castro, have advocated a significant loosening of immigration law, including a decriminalization of the act of illegally crossing the border. But none of them have proposed literally opening the border to unrestricted migration.

During the Trump era, Democrats have voted for billions of dollars worth of border fencing and other border security measures. In 2018, Democratic leaders offered Trump $25 billion for border security in exchange for a path to citizenship for the ""DREAMers,"" young undocumented immigrants brought to the US illegally as children. The bill was ultimately rejected in the Senate following severe opposition from the White House.

Preexisting conditions

""...We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always.""

Facts First: This claim is undercut by Trump's actions and those of congressional Republicans during his presidency.

We usually don't fact-check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. Trump's administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with preexisting conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to get all of Obamacare declared void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with preexisting conditions if the suit succeeds.

Veterans Choice

""We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. They've been trying to pass VA Choice for four decades. They couldn't get it done, we got it done, we got it.""

Facts First: Trump did not get the Veterans Choice program passed, nor had there been an unsuccessful 40-year effort to get it passed. The program was Trump did not get the Veterans Choice program passed, nor had there been an unsuccessful 40-year effort to get it passed. The program was signed into law by Obama in 2014.



In 2018, Trump signed the VA MISSION Act, which expanded and changed the Choice program.

What Veterans Choice does

Trump contrasted the Choice program with the previous situation, in which he noted that veterans had to wait for health care for ""three, four, five, six days, for three weeks, for five weeks.""

Trump suggested that this is no longer the case, saying that he had the idea to ""let them go outside, go to a private doctor. We'll pay the bill, they'll be fixed up all perfect and they can do it immediately.'""

Facts First: Neither the Obama version nor the Trump version of this program allows veterans to avoid waiting days or weeks to see a VA doctor. At present, most veterans can only get reimbursed for private care if they are facing waits of more than 20 days at the VA.

Under the current version of the program, there is an exception to the 20-day rule for people who live more than a 30-minute drive from a VA facility. But people who live within a 30-minute zone are still forced to stay within the VA system if they are facing waits of just under three weeks.

As we noted in the previous fact check, the program was not Trump's idea. It was created in 2014 under Obama.

2016

""I say it all the time: never happened before. There's never been a movement like this. They've had movements, they never went -- they won a state, they did well in a state. We won 32 states, there's never been anything like it.""

Facts First: This is false. Trump won 30 states, not 32. Also, this was far from a historic number: Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1984 This is false. Trump won 30 states, not 32. Also, this was far from a historic number: Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1984 both won 49 states; James Monroe won every state in the uncontested election of 1820.

""There have been 45 presidential elections in which the winning candidate won a larger share of the electoral vote,"" the New York Times reported

Court hearings

""It's time for Democrats to end sanctuary cities, end catch and release. You know what you do: you catch 'em and then you release 'em and you say: 'Would you please report back in four years from now?' But only 2% come back.

Facts First: While it's unclear what subset of migrants Trump is referring to, the While it's unclear what subset of migrants Trump is referring to, the majority of migrants appear in court.

In 2017, 89% of asylum seekers appeared in court to receive a decision on their case. Among all kinds of migrants, 72% appeared in court.

Ohio 2016

""We ended up winning Ohio by close to nine points, which is unheard of...""

Facts First: Trump exaggerated very slightly. He Trump exaggerated very slightly. He won 51.7% to 43.6%, a margin of just over eight points. That was the biggest margin in Ohio since George H.W. Bush's 11-point win in 1988, but not an unprecedented margin for the state.

Employment

""One hundred and twenty three thousand more Ohio workers are employed today than when I was elected.""

Facts First: Not quite, at least as of the most recent Not quite, at least as of the most recent jobs numbers for June. As of then, the increase from the month of Trump's election was 77,600 people.

In June, there were 5,637,900 total (non-farm) employed people in Ohio; in November 2016, it was 5,560,300 employed people.

""We need good people. We're down to 3.5% unemployment.""

Facts First: The The unemployment rate for June was 3.7%. The rate for July, released the morning after the rally, was unchanged, holding at 3.7%.

The rate has not hit 3.5% at any point in Trump's presidency. It was 3.6% in April and May. So Trump was close, but this is not a figure that is usually rounded to the nearest half-point.

""Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century.""

Facts First: This is close to true, but as he often does when the facts are on his side, Trump is exaggerating.

The unemployment rate over this spring and summer -- 3.7% in June, 3.6% in each of May and April -- has been the lowest since December 1969, slightly less than 50 years ago.

We might be inclined to ignore this one if it seemed like a one-time slip, but it was not. Trump, a serial exaggerator, habitually turns ""almost"" into ""over"" and ""more than.""

Judicial appointments

Trump said of vacancies on federal courts: ""And I came in, I had one hundred and forty eight openings. I said -- you're supposed to have none. I said 'How many do we have?' 'One hundred and forty eight.' I said, 'You've got to be kidding.'""

Facts First: Trump did not enter office with 148 judicial vacancies, and it is not normal for incoming presidents to be told they have ""none.""

Like Trump, his predecessors entered office with dozens of vacancies. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on Jan. 1, 2017, just before Trump took office; 53 vacancies on Jan. 1, 2009, just before Barack Obama took office; 80 vacancies on Jan. 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on Jan. 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office. So Trump had the most judges to appoint since Clinton, but, clearly, other presidents also had appointing to do.

Drug prices

""Last year was the first time in 51 years that drug pricing for prescription drugs actually came down.""

Facts First: This was a slight exaggeration. Prescription drug prices declined last year for the first time in 46 years, according to one of several measures.

The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between December 2017 and December 2018, the first calendar-year decline since 1972. As the Washington Post pointed out in its own recent fact check, some experts say that the Consumer Price Index is a flawed measure of trends in drug prices, since it doesn't include rebates that drug companies pay to insurers.

The IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science, which studies drug prices, found that ""net drug prices in the United States increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018."" Trump can reasonably cite the Consumer Price Index. He was just off on the number of years.

Obama and energy

""The previous administration tried to shut down American energy...""

Facts First: This is false. Obama did encourage the use of renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels, but he didn't try to ""shut down"" fossil fuel production -- which increased significantly during his tenure.

For example, field production of crude oil increased in each of Obama's first seven years in office before declining in his last year, reversing a steady decline that had begun in the mid-1980s. CNN reported in 2015 : ""The greatest oil boom in this nation's history has occurred during the tenure of self-proclaimed environmentalist Barack Obama.""

Obama also presided over a significant increase in natural gas production, which hit a record high in 2015 before declining in 2016.

In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama called for the US to go ""all in on clean energy,"" but he immediately added, ""Now, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence. We need to encourage that. And that's why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. That's got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan.""

Coal

Trump said the Obama administration tried to end the use of ""American, clean, beautiful coal.""

Facts First: Obama did try to Obama did try to reduce the use of coal -- but nothing about coal is ""clean.""

""Clean coal"" is an industry term for particular technologies that attempt to reduce the many environmental harms caused by coal, a particularly dirty source of power. The term is not meant to be used to broadly describe coal itself, though that is what Trump generally does.

Iran

""To protect America's security I withdrew the United States from the horrible Iran nuclear deal, a horrible stupid deal. We gave Iran $150 billion."" Trump went on to claim that the US also gave Iran $1.8 billion ""in cash.""

Facts First: The second figure is roughly correct, but the first is exaggerated.

The Iran nuclear deal allowed the country to access tens of billions in its own assets that had been frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions; experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion.

Trump did not invent the $150 billion figure out of thin air: Obama himself mused in a 2015 interview about Iran having ""$150 billion parked outside the country."" But experts on Iran policy, and Obama's own administration, said that the quantity of assets the agreement actually made available to Iran was much lower.

In 2015, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew put the number at $56 billion. PolitiFact reported that Garbis Iradian, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, put it at about $60 billion.

Adam Szubin, a senior Treasury Department official, testified to Congress in 2015 that the ""usable liquid assets"" would total ""a little more than $50 billion."" The rest of Iran's foreign assets, he said, were either tied up in ""illiquid"" projects ""that cannot be monetized quickly, if at all, or are composed of outstanding loans to Iranian entities that cannot repay them.""

As Trump regularly notes, the Obama administration did send Iran $1.7 billion to settle a decades-old dispute over a purchase of US military goods Iran made before its government was overthrown in the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The administration also used the timing of when this cash payment was delivered as leverage against Iran to release several American prisoners.

Manufacturing

While criticizing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement from which he withdrew the US, Trump claimed that Obama had said ""you can't produce manufacturing jobs anymore in the United States.""

Facts First: Obama didn't say you can't produce manufacturing jobs in the United States. At a Obama didn't say you can't produce manufacturing jobs in the United States. At a town hall event on PBS in 2016, he said some manufacturing jobs were gone for good, often due to automation, but he boasted of how many were being created, and his administration's investment in new technologies to attempt to create new manufacturing sectors.

Obama mocked Trump for not specifying how he would bring back the jobs that had been lost to other countries. But Obama was not saying that it was impossible to produce manufacturing jobs at all. He said: ""Well, in fact, we've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than any time since the 1990s. That's a fact. And you know, if you look at just the auto industry as an example, they've had record sales and they've hired back more people over the last five years than they have for a very long, long time. We actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history.""

Florida

""So we have a great governor in the state of Florida. Ron DeSantis. Calls me up -- doing a great job, Ron DeSantis. He was at three and he went to 70. That's a pretty good increase.""

Facts First: DeSantis did experience a spike in support after Trump endorsed him, but he never came close to 70% in the polls. He won the Republican primary with 56.5% of the vote.

We also could not find any public polls in which DeSantis was as low as 3%, though he was indeed polling poorly before Trump expressed support for him in December 2017 and before Trump issued a ""full"" endorsement in June 2018. He was at 17% in a Fox News poll just before the endorsement.

Tariffs

""And don't let them tell you -- the fact is, China devalues their currency. They pour money into their system, they pour it in and because they do that you're not paying for those tariffs, China's paying for those tariffs.""

Facts First: American importers make the actual tariff payments, and economic studies have found that Americans, not people and companies in China, have borne most of the cost.

A March paper from economists at Columbia, Princeton and the New York Federal Reserve found that the ""full incidence"" of Trump's tariffs have fallen on domestic companies and consumers -- costing them $3 billion a month by the end of 2018. The paper also found that the tariffs led to a reduction in US income, by $1.4 billion a month.

separate academic paper also found that the tariffs led to higher consumer prices. It estimated that the tariffs will result in a $7.8 billion per year decline in income.

A Chinese supplier might take on some of the burden of the tariff by reducing its prices to maintain a market in the United States, but these studies show that the burden heavily falls on US consumers and companies.

The White House's Economic Report of the President also acknowledged that American consumers do pay some of the cost of these tariffs. Domestic producers, according to the report, benefit from price increases from the tariffs, but ""offsetting these benefits are the costs paid by consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced consumption.""

The Wall

""We're building the wall faster and better than ever.""

Facts First: Nothing resembling the wall Trump campaigned on has been built at any speed. Zero additional miles of border barriers had been erected as of mid-June.

About 50 miles have been built over his two-and-a-half years in office, but all of them are replacement barriers rather than additional miles.

According to Customs and Border Protection, 47 miles ""of new border barriers in place of dilapidated design"" had been completed as of June 14. The Washington Examiner reported July 20 that the total was up to 51 miles of such replacement barriers, but that no additional miles had been built. (Customs and Border Protection did not respond to our request for updated information in the wake of the Examiner story.)

Trump has started arguing since this spring that replacement fencing should be counted by the media as his ""wall,"" since he is replacing ineffective old barriers with effective modern ones. This is subjective, but we think it's fair to focus on the new barriers he promised during his campaign.

Right to Try

""They had no hope. For 44 years, they've been trying to get Right to Try ... I got it approved and it wasn't easy.""

Facts First: There had not been a 44-year push for a federal Right to Try law, experts said.

The law tries to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access experimental medications that have not received FDA approval for widespread use. Similar laws have been passed at the state level only since 2014, after the Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank, began pushing for them.

""I have no idea what 'they've been trying to get' for 44 years. The Right to Try law was a creation of the Goldwater Institute, and it first became state law in 2014 (in Colorado), relatively soon after it was first conceived of,"" said Alison Bateman-House, assistant professor of medical ethics at New York University's Langone Health.

Before Right to Try

Trump said that, before the Right to Try program came into effect, terminally ill patients ""couldn't get medicine."" He said, ""They couldn't get anything -- they'd travel to Asia, if they had money. They'd travel to Europe, they'd travel all over the world hoping for a cure. If they had no money, they'd just go home, they'd die. They had no hope.""

Facts First: It is not true that terminally ill patients ""couldn't get anything"" or would simply have to go home and die until Trump signed the Right to Try law in 2018. Prior to the law, patients did have to ask the federal government for permission to access experimental medications -- but the government almost always said yes."
Democrats reach impeachment milestone Nancy Pelosi can't ignore,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/02/politics/impeachment-half-of-democrats/index.html,"It's also -- in its own way -- largely meaningless.

The milestone is that 118 House Democrats -- half their caucus there -- have called for the start of an official impeachment inquiry into Trump, a significant number of legislators, who include the far left of the party but also some members who flipped GOP districts last fall and even a few allies of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

It's clear that the momentum of the party is toward impeachment even if party leaders like Pelosi, who recalls firsthand backlash to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and insists on a methodical step-by-step process focused on obstruction of justice.

But even at more than 50% of the Democratic caucus, that's still less than a third of the full House, not to mention Democrats control only half the Legislative Branch. That math is not lost on Pelosi, who once told David Axelrod's ""The Axe Files"" podcast that among the chief political lessons she learned from her father -- Baltimore mayor and Democratic ward leader Thomas D'Alesandro -- was ""I learned how to count.""

This growing public support of Democratic lawmakers demonstrates how far they've come since last year, when it was just a few actively pursuing it in part because Democrats were waiting to see what was in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election interference.

While Mueller did not overtly call for impeachment or recommend charges against Trump or his aides, many Democrats increasingly argue that the 10 instances for which Mueller presented evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump are enough to pursue impeaching him -- though it's not clear when or if the rest of the party will ever agree.

Pressure on Pelosi

One of the reasons the number behind the impeachment inquiry movement is significant is in part the fact how Democratic leaders -- including Pelosi -- have cited the size of bloc as a reason not to proceed.

Back on June 11, CNN's Manu Raju asked Pelosi how she'd react if a majority of the caucus supported an impeachment inquiry.

JUST WATCHED Pelosi tells CNN: impeachment inquiry 'not off the table' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pelosi tells CNN: impeachment inquiry 'not off the table' 01:55

""It's not even close in our caucus,"" she told him back then.

""But eventually?"" he followed up.

""Nothing is as divisive in our country, in my view, than impeachment,"" she ultimately said, after pointing out that Democrats were pursuing testimony from Trump officials by attempting to pursue enforcement of their subpoenas in court.

On Friday, Pelosi repeated her previous comments focusing on her party's investigations of the Trump administration and saying ""Democrats in the Congress continue to legislate, investigate and litigate.""

""In America, no one is above the law,"" Pelosi said in a statement that outlined Democrats' efforts. ""The President will be held accountable.""

Reaching this half-margin threshold will certainly amplify pressure on Pelosi to bless the effort and put her political weight behind it. She has claimed to not be opposed to impeachment, but she certainly hasn't been helping it along. And she's pointed out the political risk in impeaching Trump when there is essentially zero chance a Republican-controlled Senate would vote to remove him from office. From that perspective, impeachment would be a political exercise.

That doesn't matter to a lot of Democrats, particularly younger progressives, who say that pursuing impeachment and calling out Trump for alleged wrongdoing is a moral obligation.

JUST WATCHED Analyst on impeachment: Dems are speaking the magic words Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Analyst on impeachment: Dems are speaking the magic words 05:17

What's also not clear is if Trump administration officials who have refused to take part in congressional oversight will participate in hearings specifically geared toward impeaching their boss. (Spoiler alert: they probably won't).

A milestone that's also meaningless

For all the importance of 118 Democrats supporting impeachment, it is also meaningless.

For starters, 118 is a lot fewer than 218, which is the number of votes needed to actually impeach the President if Democrats do go forward with an impeachment inquiry and do find evidence he committed the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" the Constitution requires for impeachment.

And support for an impeachment inquiry does not equal support for articles of impeachment. Rep. Al Green of Texas has routinely tried to get the House to vote on actual articles of impeachment. The House soundly rejected his attempt to impeach Trump for bigotry and racism rather than obstruction of justice in July, and 95 Democrats supported the proposal

If Democrats do pursue impeachment, they will be flying somewhat in the face of public opinion if they move toward impeaching Trump. A majority of Americans -- 54% -- opposed impeachment when CNN and SSRS asked the question in a June poll. But a strong majority of Democrats -- 76% -- supported it.

An inquiry that's already happening

Another complicating factor: Starting an impeachment inquiry actually doesn't require any specific number of Democrats or lawmakers.

Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, is one of the latest Democrats to publicly call for an impeachment inquiry -- number 116 by CNN's count -- but he also said that Democrats' many investigations of Trump essentially add up to the fact that an inquiry is already occurring.

In a piece for the Sun-Sentinel , Deutch noted that Trump claimed victory after Mueller's testimony before Congress, which Deutch admitted was not a ""summer blockbuster,"" but which he said confirmed conclusions of Mueller's report, including evidence of obstruction of justice by the President.

""Sorry, Mr. President, the question is no longer whether the House should vote to proceed with a formal impeachment inquiry. The inquiry has already begun,"" he wrote, noting the committee can refer articles of impeachment to the full House at any time.

""No additional step is required,"" Deutch later added. ""No magic words need to be uttered on the House floor. No vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry is necessary.""

But Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, said that courts might look differently at compelling administration officials to testify or turn over documents if House Democrats are officially pursuing impeachment.

""But the House is also undercutting itself by a failure to commit to what it's doing,"" Honig said, adding ""The more formal and concrete the House's inquiry is, the better argument they have in court.""

Impeachment and the 2020 election

And the impeachment conversation is not just happening on Capitol Hill.

For Democrats running for President, the subject rarely comes up on the campaign trail from voters, as New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin recently wrote . But those 2020 hopefuls expressed both sides of the impeachment question during CNN's Democratic presidential debate in Detroit.

Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado said impeachment would ultimately be fruitless if the Senate acquitted Trump and he would be able to argue vindication.

""President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress,"" Bennett cautioned.

Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro shot back that the opposite would be true.

""The Mueller report clearly details that he deserves it,"" Castro said, noting the 10 examples of possible obstruction of justice examined by the report. ""And what's going to happen in the fall of next year, of 2020, if they don't impeach him, is he's going to say, 'You see. You see. The Democrats didn't go after me on impeachment. And you know why? Because I didn't do anything wrong.""

This story has been updated with additional developments Friday."
Defense secretary to review $10 billion cloud computing deal,https://www.cnn.com,"['Michael Warren', 'Alex Rogers']",08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/politics/esper-pentagon-cloud-contract/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Pentagon said on Thursday that a highly sought-after cloud computing contract will not be awarded until Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has completed his examination of it.

The $10 billion, 10-year contract, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), has come under recent scrutiny from President Donald Trump, who has expressed concerns over the fairness of what has been a contentious bidding process among a handful of large tech companies.

Amazon has been widely seen as the front-runner to win the contract. Microsoft is the other finalist. The contract could be awarded as early as August 23.

The announcement from the Pentagon comes less than a week after CNN exclusively reported that Trump had seen and been briefed on a document alleging a large conspiracy to award Amazon the contract. The one-page document was produced by an executive at Oracle, which had also competed for the contract. It's unclear how the document made it to the White House.

The document contains a flow chart titled ""A Conspiracy to Create a Ten Year DoD Cloud Monopoly,"" and provides a visual representation of a narrative that Oracle has been pushing for months -- that a web of individuals inside and outside the Defense Department were greasing the wheels for Amazon to win the contract.

The JEDI contract has been the subject of an intense lobbying effort by Oracle, which has been trying to scuttle Amazon's bid for months. Oracle's own bid did not make it to the final stage . The company also launched a failed legal challenge of Amazon's bid.

While it's unclear how Oracle's document made it to the White House, it seems to have played into the President's well-known animosity toward the online retail giant and its founder, Jeff Bezos.

Thursday's announcement raises questions about whether there is now political influence on a bidding process that up until now the Pentagon has insisted has followed all proper protocols.

Many of the implied and explicit allegations involving Amazon have been addressed by an internal Pentagon investigation or in Oracle's lawsuit in federal court. Neither have determined them to be problematic.

In recent weeks, the President has indicated he has concerns over the JEDI contract, and that the administration will be reviewing the matter. The decision to revisit the contract, however, ultimately lies with Esper, the newly-confirmed secretary of defense.

When asked by a reporter about the contract during a July 18 appearance in the Oval Office with the prime minister of the Netherlands, Trump said, he'd been getting ""tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon,"" including from Microsoft, Oracle and IBM.

""Great companies are complaining about it,"" Trump said . ""So we're going to take a look at it. We'll take a very strong look at it.""

On July 22, Trump retweeted a Fox News segment criticizing the JEDI contract as ""The Bezos Bailout."" It's not clear if the President had already seen the Oracle document by then.

Days after Trump's public statements, Esper also mentioned reexamining the contract. ""I've heard from everybody about JEDI Cloud, that's one of the things I'm going to take a hard look at,"" Esper told reporters at the Pentagon on July 24.

Recently, some Republicans on Capitol Hill have also been lobbying the Pentagon and the White House to revisit the contract, pushing forward similar questions raised by Oracle about the contract's fairness.

Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Marco Rubio of Florida have written separate letters to the Pentagon raising concerns about moving ahead with the contract. Trump even discussed JEDI with Johnson on an Air Force One flight to Wisconsin in July, according to the senator's office.

Trump also called Rubio last month to share his concerns about the contract, according to a Rubio spokesperson. Trump gave the indication that he may get involved in preventing the awarding of the contract if necessary.

In a statement Thursday, Rubio said he was ""pleased"" that Esper is reviewing the contract. A Rubio spokesperson tells CNN the Florida senator's staff worked with the defense secretary's office on the issue before the announcement.

On July 23, a dozen Republican House lawmakers sent Trump a letter urging him to delay awarding the JEDI contract. The letter states that awarding the contract would be ""premature"" because the Pentagon's Office of Inspector General ""is still investigating potential conflicts of interest by DoD employees in awarding the JEDI contract.""

Womack told CNN last week he had questions about whether there were conflicts of interest involving Amazon and the Pentagon.

""Given the many shortcomings of the JEDI procurement process, I fully support Secretary Esper's decision to review the program,"" Womack said in a statement Thursday.

But other Republican members have urged the administration to award the contract soon. A July 18 letter to Trump signed by four GOP members of the House Armed Services committee, including ranking member Rep. Mac Thornberry, stated that ""further delays will only damage our security and increase the costs of the contract."""
"Veterans can receive VA services at MedExpress, urgent care facilities",https://triblive.com,['Megan Tomasic'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://triblive.com/local/regional/veterans-can-receive-va-services-at-medexpress-urgent-care-facilities/,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.

Urgent care services are now offered to veterans through Veteran Affairs urgent care clinics.

The program, which started June 6, offers services to those suffering from the flu, minor burns or skin infections at locations like MedExpress, UPMC Urgent Care and MinuteClinic, located inside CVS stores.

Retail locations include a walk-in health clinic within a retail business. These locations can help treat uncomplicated illnesses like a sore throat or earache. At urgent locations, officials can diagnose or treat illnesses or injury for people seeking immediate medical attention for non life-threatening illnesses or injuries.

“The new urgent care benefit is not a substitute for emergency care for life-threatening conditions,” Dr. Ali Sonel, VA Pittsburgh chief of staff, said in a news release. “Veterans experiencing a medical emergency should call 911 or visit their nearest emergency department.”

In order to receive the benefits, veterans must have received health care services from the VA in the last 24 months. Veterans may be required to pay a $30 copay. Those wanting to stay with VA providers can call 412-822-2222 for in-person or video appointments.

Those searching for a clinic can visit vaurgentcarelocator.triwest.com/Locator/Care or call 1-833-483-8669.

No one was arrested during the raid, in which evidence collection teams visited the housing authority’s headquarters on Alonzo Watson Drive about 1 p.m. with a police officer and United States government trucks.

The agency, which runs nine low-income housing facilities in South Bend and is financed by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been beleaguered by complaints of financial mismanagement for much of the decade.

Such concerns prompted Mr. Buttigieg to replace all six commissioners on the housing authority’s board in 2015."

The Federal Reserve took steps toward easing monetary policy on Wednesday, but the Treasury Department, no longer constrained by the debt ceiling, is poised to perhaps tighten financial conditions through its upcoming funding actions.

On Monday, the Treasury Department announced an aggressive plan to build up its cash balances. The Treasury is slated to borrow an additional $433 billion during the quarter that runs from July to September, with a stated ending balance of $350 billion.

In comparison, the Treasury borrowed just $40 billion from April to June.

The large increase in debt issuance has the potential to partially offset the monetary easing just announced by the Fed. As the Treasury floods the market with new debt to rebuild its cash reserves, the new supply could have the effect of driving down prices and driving up yields of Treasurys and other market-determined interest rates."
Joe diGenova: Barr's Comey decision was the right call. But this is just the beginning,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Digenova', 'Joseph Digenova Was Us Attorney For The District Of Columbia', 'An Independent Counsel.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/joe-digenova-barr-james-comey-leaks-decision,"The decision not to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey over his deliberate leaks to the media isn’t a sign of weakness or lack of will, but of the professionalism and well-reasoned restraint of President Trump’s Department of Justice.

Attorney General Bill Barr’s number one goal since taking the helm at the DOJ has been to restore the impartial and professional ethos that has characterized that agency for more than 200 years.

He is working diligently to cleanse it of the stain of politically driven vindictiveness that Obama-era officials created by grossly mishandling the Clinton email investigation, and then, even more egregiously, orchestrating the series of events that led to the Russiagate witch hunt.

ROBERT MUELLER'S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BY THE NUMBERS

Before this “investigation of the investigators” is over, there will undoubtedly be many cases of misconduct that warrant criminal prosecution. Comey’s, however, was not one of them.

What Comey did -- release private memos made in the course of his employment as FBI director to politically damage the president of the United States, who had just fired him for unrelated misconduct -- was absolutely outrageous, and totally unbecoming of the leader of this country’s premier criminal investigatory agency. It speaks volumes about Comey’s corrupt character and further illustrates why both President Trump and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that Comey was no longer fit to serve in that role.

Attorney General Barr made the right call. This would have been the first major charging decision of this investigation, which is not the time to go all in on a “maybe” case. To do so would create exactly the appearance of political vindictiveness and retributivist prosecution he is working so hard to dispel.

In this case, however, even that deplorable conduct did not rise to the level that was possible to prosecute criminally. The career prosecutors assigned to the case told Fox News that this “wasn’t a close call,” and I can see why. The confidential nature of the memos was too ambiguous. The intent element was too hard to prove.

Attorney General Barr made the right call. This would have been the first major charging decision of this investigation, which is not the time to go all in on a “maybe” case. To do so would create exactly the appearance of political vindictiveness and retributivist prosecution he is working so hard to dispel.

That does not mean, as some are now claiming, that the decision not to prosecute in this particular case is a vindication of Comey, a defeat for the president, or an end to the inquiry surrounding these leaks.

The quest for truth is far more important than the pursuit of retribution against an already-disgraced FBI official whose behavior in office was unbecoming of any public official. There are many of us who want to see James Comey before a jury or in a jail cell, but like Attorney General Barr, I’m more interested in seeing a full and complete accounting of the malfeasance that took place at the DOJ during and after the 2016 presidential campaign.

The release of a pending report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz is, by all accounts, imminent. The product of more than 16 months of investigation, that report will cover far more devious schemes than Comey’s leaking -- Horowitz is finally going to reveal the truth about the dishonest handling of FISA spy-warrant applications against Trump associates.

Horowitz, like Barr, is a true professional. His intrepid work revealed to the world the whole picture of Comey’s number two, Andy McCabe, whose own improper leaks to the media got him fired just days before he would have been eligible for a government pension. It was his extensive investigation through which we learned the full extent of FBI Agent Peter Strzok and DOJ lawyer Lisa Page’s anti-Trump text exchanges that disqualified Strzok from further participation in Special Counsel Mueller’s probe.

The investigation of the investigators is only just now coming into focus. We already know there was wrongdoing throughout the Obama DOJ, and that it continued among the holdovers from that era after the 2016 election -- and we know that it fueled the most pernicious conspiracy theory in modern American history. Some of that wrongdoing may well be prosecutable.

If and when such cases arise, the president’s supporters will be glad that Attorney General Barr and his team exercised such restraint in the Comey case. The American people will now be assured that any prosecutions that do go forward will be well-founded, readily provable, and completely devoid of the taint of politics.

We can all now appreciate a return to integrity at the DOJ. The American people deserve nothing less.

Top State Department adviser fired over 'abusive' management style,https://www.politico.com,"['Nahal Toosi', 'Eliana Johnson']",08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/02/top-state-department-adviser-fired-1444894,"Kiron Skinner, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was fired this week over what some described as her ""abusive"" management style. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images foreign policy Top State Department adviser fired over 'abusive' management style Kiron Skinner, the director of the Policy Planning Staff, was told on Thursday that she was being dismissed.

A senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was fired this week over what officials described as her “abusive” management style, including making homophobic remarks and accusing people of having affairs, according to two people.

Kiron Skinner, the director of Policy Planning, was told Thursday that she was being dismissed, a Trump administration official said. A senior State Department official also confirmed the firing, saying that several members of Skinner’s staff had threatened to quit if she wasn’t removed.

Story Continued Below

Two other State Department officials said Skinner acted unprofessionally in multiple ways, including yelling in public spaces and using homophobic language. She retaliated against employees by kicking them out of their offices and even alleged that some people were having affairs, the two officials said.

“It was an abuse of authority,” one of them said.

Skinner did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.

One of the few prominent African American members of the Trump administration before leaving this week, Skinner is close to a number of conservative luminaries, such as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

She hails from an academic background, and was brought in to help the State Department think in long-term, strategic ways about foreign policy. But she’s also long had a reputation for having sharp elbows — many of her past associates, especially in academia, flat out refuse to talk about her.

Pompeo hired Skinner to head the Policy Planning Staff almost a year ago, describing her as “a national security powerhouse” and “a one-woman, strategic thinking tour de force” in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. “I’m confident that she will enhance our influence overseas, protect the American people, and promote our prosperity,” he said.

She succeeded Brian Hook, who now serves as the special envoy for Iran issues.

Under Hook and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Policy Planning was unusually active, participating in day-to-day policymaking and almost functioning as a mini-State Department. The set-up infuriated other bureaus in the department, who felt their ideas were ignored.

When Pompeo took as secretary of State, he decided that Policy Planning — also known as S/P in department lingo — should revert to its more traditional role of acting as an in-house think tank with long-term ideas and strategies.

Skinner appeared on board with that, and her staffers — some of whom she recruited from academia — spent much of their time churning out white papers and other documents on major geopolitical issues.

She kept a tight rein on the S/P crew, warning them in particular to avoid the media.

But, according to State Department officials, she also was such a poor manager that almost a third of the 20-plus member staff quit or moved to other positions during her time at the helm. Another five people recently threatened to leave if she wasn’t ousted, the officials said.

It’s unclear how much influence Skinner has on Pompeo, who is traveling in Asia this week.

The secretary of State has surrounded himself with several advisers, including well-respected career diplomats, who vie for his attention. There’s also Hook, several other special envoys who deal with specific hot-button issues, and Mary Kissel, a former Wall Street Journal opinion writer who advises Pompeo on policy and messaging.

Skinner was recently tasked with coordinating the work of a special panel Pompeo established to re-examine the basics of human rights policy. The panel, called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, has drawn fierce criticism from human rights activists who fear its aims are to undercut gains made by women and LGBTQ people.

A second Trump administration official who knows Skinner told POLITICO earlier this year that Skinner “believes very strongly in what [President Donald Trump] is trying to do on foreign policy — a resource-constrained, realist approach to the world.”

Skinner is particularly interested in China. Earlier this year, she drew public criticism after describing China as a civilizational threat to the United States, and claiming — erroneously — that it was the first non-Caucasian challenger.

Critics decried her framing of the Chinese challenge as unhelpful, while noting that Japan was once a major competitor to the West. Supporters insist she merely had a rare stumble in her speaking, pointing out that she’s known for being especially erudite, including in the classroom.

“She engages incredibly well. She cares about her students,” said Ken Weinstein, president of the Hudson Institute, who met Skinner while in graduate school at Harvard University.

Weinstein, in an interview several weeks ago, said Skinner stood out at Harvard for more than just her ethnic background and political views.

“She’s also been someone who’s always argued that our elites are too self-referential, too small — she’s always made the case for diversity,” Weinstein said.

According to her bio page at Carnegie Mellon University, where she's long held a post, Skinner earned graduate degrees from Harvard and undergraduate degrees from Spelman College and Sacramento City College.

She gained celebrity status in conservative circles early on in her academic career for her books on Ronald Reagan. One in particular, “Reagan: In His Own Hand,” was based on handwritten notes of the former president that Skinner found during archival research.

The book gave voice to those who have long argued that Reagan had a far more active, intellectual mind — one that grappled with a range of domestic and foreign policies — than he’s given credit for.

One of Skinner’s supporters has been Kay Coles James, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. The two became close friends years ago after James saw Skinner interviewed on C-SPAN and reached out to her.

James said in an interview earlier this year that Skinner is a “workaholic” and that “nothing excites her more than research, writing and speaking.” James waved off Skinner’s reputation as headstrong and sharp-elbowed.

“As a fellow African American female conservative Republican that’s sort of an occupational hazard,” James said at the time. “When a male does exactly the same thing it’s viewed as someone who stands his ground. We are viewed as witches with capital Bs.”"

The children's lawyer was incensed. Her two tiny clients — one of them blind — had been in a shelter for three months, separated from their mother.

The family had traveled from Mexico to the United States, reaching Nogales, Arizona, on March 1, 2018. Officials at the border found that the mother, Nadia Pulido, had ""credible"" reasons for seeking asylum from an ex-partner who, she says, beat her and stalked her after their relationship ended.

But U.S. Customs and Border Protection still sent Pulido into an adult detention center run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She had an hour to say goodbye and try to assure her blind daughter, 6, and sobbing 3-year-old son that she'd see them in a couple of hours.

""A couple of hours turned into months. Painful months,"" Pulido recalled in an interview.

To help the children, pro bono attorney Maite Garcia turned to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. She filed a complaint with the office on June 7 of last year, explaining that Pulido's daughter was ""completely blind and requires assistance for daily living"" and would be better off with her stepfather, a U.S. citizen.

Nearly two weeks went by before the civil rights office replied.

""The issues you raise are very important to us,"" CRCL finally said in its emailed response. Then came a disclaimer: ""Please be advised that our complaint process does not provide individuals with legal rights or remedies. ... Instead, we use complaints like yours to find and address problems in DHS policy and its implementation.""

That was the last Garcia heard from the nearly 100-person office in Washington, D.C.

The tepid response from the department's civil rights office bolsters objections — not least from former staff — that the DHS watchdog is failing to stop rights abuses as they're happening inside a detention system that's expanding rapidly under the Trump administration.

The ineffectual handling of individual complaints adds to criticism that DHS leaders no longer heed recommendations from the agency's own civil rights experts.

""Put yourself in the shoes of the person who's sitting in the cell or who's separated from their parent or who's wondering where their child is,"" former CRCL staff attorney and adviser Ellen Gallagher said.

A recent whistleblower, Gallagher has accused the civil rights office of failing to investigate multiple individual complaints alleging unjustified solitary confinement of detainees in ICE custody. Gallagher is now with DHS' Office of Inspector General, a separate internal watchdog specializing in issuing reports after lengthy investigations.

""It seems to mislead the public, to invite complaints involving specific information about the individual or the family and the alleged violation, if Civil Rights and Civil Liberties had no intention of specifically investigating or resolving those individual complaints,"" Gallagher said.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has insisted that DHS has ""layers of oversight"" to correct abuses. ""We have good supervisory oversight, and we hold people accountable,"" he said during a July 9 interview on CNN in response to questions about filthy conditions in CBP holding facilities.

Gallagher's impression, however, is that the civil rights office ""was actually fairly intimidated by ICE and CBP and did not want to engage in activity that might offend either. That is an odd and even disturbing posture for an oversight authority.""

Internal CRCL log: a flood of complaints

Some CRCL staff members say that individual employees contact CBP or ICE to try to informally resolve civil rights complaints. But they can only advise agencies, they say, because their office isn't set up to halt abuses as they happen.

Cameron Quinn, chief of the civil rights office and an appointee of President Trump, declined a request for an interview. Another CRCL official responded in writing to questions, asking not to be quoted by name.

""CRCL does not have authority to remedy individual complaints but instead focuses on systemic issues"" at DHS, the official wrote. The office does have authority, however, to seek ""remedies"" for people facing disability discrimination, the official said, declining to elaborate.

""With regard to family separations,"" the official said, ""CRCL investigated the issue from a policy and process standpoint."" The civil rights office then sent its recommendations to ICE and Customs and Border Protection in a memo. CRCL declined to release the memo, calling it a ""deliberative"" document.

CRCL, the official added, still has ""open investigations"" into the separations of children under age 5, the separations of children with disabilities and standards for separating families based on parental criminal history.

The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties was created along with the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The office's mission is to advise the powerful federal department and prevent civil rights violations such as the post-Sept. 11 roundups of Muslims without due process. But some insiders say CRCL has always lacked teeth.

Last year, the civil rights office proved especially weak as complaints about due process concerns and family separations began pouring in — nearly 850 in the first half of 2018 alone, logged into a CRCL database. An independent journalist obtained a copy through a Freedom of Information Act request and then shared it with the Center for Public Integrity and NPR.

The complaints referenced more than 380 separated children 10 years old or younger, of which more than 120 children were age 5 or younger.

More than 140 complaints arrived before the Trump administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy on April 6, 2018. More than 160 cases of separation referenced in the log were carried out before that date. The zero-tolerance policy required separating families so that CBP could hold all adults for prosecution, even for a first-time misdemeanor illegal entry.

Former and current staff in the civil rights office say their colleagues were so upset by allegations in the complaints that they openly wept at desks as they reviewed the cases.

By May of last year, senior staff in the office had urged Quinn, in an internal memo, to challenge the separations. ""CRCL should express great concern over our exclusion from these critical decisions,"" which CRCL has the authority to review, the memo said. ""Deliberately harming children to deter parental behavior would require an exceedingly strong justification to pass muster as a reasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, among other concerns.""

Lawyer and former CRCL senior adviser Scott Shuchart, who resigned from the office last year, said his and other advisers' concerns were ""blown off"" by CBP and other DHS leadership in meetings.

One complaint to CRCL in January 2018 reported that CBP separated a 4-month-old infant from a Mexican father who had prior immigration violations but feared being sent back to Mexico.

Another reported that an 8-year-old said CBP officers ""kicked him and/or hit him with a shoe"" to wake him. Dozens of other complaints described children upset about their parents' uncertain whereabouts and abrupt disappearance — including a 14-year-old in CBP custody who said he was separated after a meal break and was then ""told by officers that his father would be deported.""

About 95% of all complaints logged came from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, a unit within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that's responsible for migrant-children shelters.

Former senior staff in this federal resettlement office say the volume of complaints is unprecedented. Robert Carey, ORR director during the final two years of Barack Obama's presidency, said he thinks ORR employees were trying to stop separations by filing complaints.

""You probably have a deeply traumatized, possibly hysterical child that you're trying to care for,"" Carey said. ""I'm guessing some of those cases would require ... the intervention of a therapist, particularly if you're talking about, in some instances, young children.""

HHS officials declined to make leaders in its Office of Refugee Resettlement available for an interview.

Most other complaints came from nonprofit legal aid groups — including 18 filed by the Phoenix-based Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, where Maite Garcia works.

The complaint about Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son appears on page 276 of CRCL's 366-page document.

Another Florence complaint filed on June 14 of last year appears on page 321. It raises objections to CBP's separation of a Guatemalan mother from her 17-year-old son — who is unable to hear or speak — without regard for his disability. The boy could have qualified to be ""paroled"" into the U.S., a conditional form of humanitarian release. But that never happened — and the case shows how a formal complaint can wither in the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Deaf boy's mom taken away

The story of the mother and her deaf son ""exhibits the cruelty, the chaos"" of how migrants are treated, said Elizabeth Jordan, an attorney with Denver's Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center. She represented the mother while the woman was in ICE lockup in Colorado.

On April 25 of last year, the mother and her 17-year-old deaf son approached CBP officers after crossing the Arizona border and asked to apply for asylum.

The boy and his mother now live in Florida, where they are in the process of applying for asylum. In an interview, the mother, who asked that her name not be disclosed, said she'd worked previously in the state, sending money to Guatemala to rent a room for her son and pay his tuition at a school for the deaf there. She eventually returned to Guatemala to care for her son and her own frail mother.

Three months after she got there, her mother died, and her deaf son lost his primary caregiver. He'd long been bullied in Guatemala, and thieves had robbed him at gunpoint. Mother and son both set out for the United States some months later.

""I don't do this for me. I do it for him,"" she said, ""because I'm not going to be alive for all of his life.""

After Customs and Border Protection took her and her son into custody near San Luis, Ariz., the mother said, officers ignored her pleas to keep them together rather than place them in cages segregated by age and gender. Her son, she told the officers, needed her to interpret. When she protested further that her son was mute, she said an officer answered, ""He won't need to do much talking where he's going.""

At some point, while her son was asleep, guards took her out of her cage, the mother said, and transported her to an ICE detention center pending prosecution. She said she was told ""you have to pay for what you did"" because she'd been turned away at the border the year before. She was sentenced to 30 days in an Arizona jail for reentry and then transferred to an ICE detention center in Colorado, pending deportation.

Meanwhile, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had sent her son on a long bus ride to an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter in Arizona, where his only means of communication was drawing pictures.

For more than a month, the mother pleaded in vain with detention guards, first in Arizona and then in Colorado, to arrange a video call so she could at least see and sign with her son. Medical records from the boy's time in the shelter indicate he was distraught: He struck his head against walls and cut himself with a paper clip. In an interview in Florida, interpreted by his mother, he said that to prevent him from getting out of bed one night, he was physically restrained.

""She was profoundly distressed and so worried about him,"" lawyer Jordan said of the mother. ""This is a person who has devoted her life to keeping him safe and getting the best she can for him. And then, for her to be totally unable to check in on him for weeks ...""

A round of emails between the boy's attorneys and DHS' civil rights office ultimately went nowhere.

Initially, a CRCL adviser seemed to be working on the Florence project's June 2018 complaint, arguing that the deaf boy merited humanitarian parole and that for two months the shelter hadn't ""provided him with the appropriate accommodations"" for his disability. The adviser wrote that the civil rights office was ""reviewing your concerns""; he asked for proof the boy was deaf.

In July 2018, one of the boy's lawyers emailed CRCL to write that when CBP held the boy in custody, he ""was able to understand that the agents were mocking him"" because they didn't believe he was deaf.

The lawyer further argued that CBP, ICE and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency in charge of shelters, were all in violation of disability rights because they had failed to arrange a video call between the boy and his mother.

The official from the civil rights office then replied that he was ""unable to look into [the boy's] ongoing concerns"" because the teenager had been transferred by CPB, which is within DHS' jurisdiction, to ORR, which is not.

Instead, he suggested, the civil rights office could investigate the mother's concerns because she was in ICE custody, which, like CBP and CRCL, falls under DHS. The boy's attorneys gave the civil rights official contact information for Jordan, the mother's Colorado lawyer.

By that time, Jordan had already been emailing local ICE officials repeated pleas to set up a video call. The call finally happened — nearly three months after U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers had separated the mother and her son. But it wasn't because of action by DHS' civil rights office, Jordan said. It was because DHS was by then under court order to put separated migrant family members in touch with one another by phone and then reunite them.

""In my interactions with individual CRCL officers,"" Jordan said, ""I don't get the sense that they're out to lunch or bad people. I think that they just ultimately can't get much done. I think it comes from being really hamstrung by the fact that they have to work with ICE and get ICE to concur in their recommendations and actually make changes.""

In the children's interest

Although Trump ended his zero-tolerance policy in June 2018 after a public outcry, U.S. border agents have continued to separate families due to parents' criminal records, even for minor offenses, or because of prior deportations.

Immigrant rights groups have long pressed DHS to consider the children's interests, and they've noted that family separation ""causes great harm, disrupting emotional and psychological well-being.""

For failed asylum-seeker Nadia Pulido, the groups' pressure came too late.

Pulido was born in Mexico but is a fluent English-speaker who arrived in California as an undocumented child and was raised by relatives. She could have qualified for a special visa for abandoned children, but no one sought such a visa on her behalf. When she was ""literally just young, stupid and hanging around the wrong crowd,"" she said, she was convicted of robbery and deported.

Because of that history, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and ICE chose to send her children to a shelter and keep her in detention last year while her asylum case went forward.

ICE could have released her on humanitarian parole. Instead, she was held in detention for eight months, until she lost her asylum bid. She could have appealed, but that would have meant more detention — and more time apart from her young children. In the end, Pulido agreed to be deported to Mexico.

After four months in a shelter, Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son were finally released to her husband, a U.S. citizen. Attorneys for the children and Pulido believe a federal lawsuit that led to a court order unifying migrant families was likely a factor. And they doubt their complaint to DHS' civil rights office did anything to hasten the children's release.

In Mexico, where the kids have now joined her, Pulido said she's still scared. To support her need for refuge, she presented Mexican police reports about incidents involving her ex-partner; and in her asylum application, she wrote that he assaulted her while she was pregnant and held a gun to her head.

10-year Treasury yield dives to lowest level since 2016 after Trump announces new China tariffs,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/us-treasury-yields-higher-after-fed-dampens-hopes-of-more-rate-cuts.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since 2016 on Thursday after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese goods.

The president said on Twitter that 10% duties will be imposed on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, effective Sept. 1. Trump's tweets came after a U.S. delegation met with Chinese trade officials earlier this week.

At around 2:30 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had fallen approximately 15 basis points to 1.878%, its lowest level since November 2016. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which clinched its lowest level since October 2016 on Thursday, last traded at 2.428%. It hit a low of 2.422% earlier in the session.

""The tweet is bringing back the 'trade war' risk that markets have dealt with at various times over the past year. My guess is it is a negotiating tactic, but markets are concerned as the stakes are high and there is a chance it backfires,""said Arthur Bass, managing director of fixed income financing, futures, and rates at Wedbush Securities.

""Fed fund futures are now fully pricing two additional 25bp moves this year, although that could easily reverse if the risk-off move abates,"" Bass added. ""With today's move, fixed income investors will no doubt be positioned a bit long going into tomorrow's employment release,"" when the government will announce July's jobs data.

Yields were also under pressure Thursday after the Federal Reserve in the prior session cut interest rates for the first time since 2008.

In approving the cut, the FOMC pointed to ""implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures."" It also characterized economic growth as ""moderate"" and the labor market ""strong,"" but eased policy regardless.

The 2-year Treasury note yield, more representative of changes to Fed policy, fell 16 basis points to 1.72%, off an earlier low of 1.694%, its lowest since November 2017.

The policymaking committee made explicit reference to inflation, a threat to bonds as rising prices chip away at the real value of their fixed payments."
DoD reports higher costs for National Security Space Launch program,https://spacenews.com,['Sandra Erwin'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://spacenews.com/dod-reports-higher-costs-for-national-security-space-launch-program/,"NSSL costs over the entire life of the program increased 7.2% — from $57.2 billion to $61.3 billion.

WASHINGTON — In a new update to its annual report on major acquisition program spending, the Defense Department estimates the total cost of the National Security Space Launch program is up by $4.1 billion since December 2018.

In the so-called Selected Acquisition Reports, DoD estimates the total cost of a program by including what it has already spent and what it projects to spend in the future. In a summary of the SARs for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 released on Thursday, NSSL costs over the entire life of the program increased 7.2% — from $57.2 billion to $61.3 billion. The report says the cost growth is due primarily to increased investment in new launch systems providers to support national security space missions, and an increase of 19 launch services, from 160 to 179, based on satellite launch requirements.

The NSSL program was formerly known as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program. Congress renamed it in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act in recognition that there are now reusable, in addition to expendable, launch vehicles.

The EELV program dates back to 1994 when President Clinton signed a National Space Transportation Policy assigning responsibility for expendable launch vehicles to DoD. The NSSL program is transitioning to new launch vehicles and is seeking to leverage the commercial space industry.

The update to the Selected Acquisition Reports includes details on major defense acquisition program cost, schedule, and performance changes since December 2018. The new figures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 include projected spending in the president’s fiscal year 2020 budget submitted to Congress on March 11.

“SARs summarize the latest estimates of cost, schedule, and performance status,” DoD said in a news release. “These reports are prepared annually in conjunction with submission of the president’s budget.”

Quarterly exception reports are required only for those programs experiencing unit cost increases of at least 15 percent or schedule delays of at least six months. The total program acquisition cost estimates provided in the SARs include research and development, procurement, military construction, and acquisition-related operations and maintenance. These totals reflect actual costs to date as well as future anticipated costs. All estimates are shown in fully inflated then-year dollars.

The cost of the Pentagon’s entire weapons portfolio was $2 trillion in 2018, up from $1.9 trillion in 2017. Quantity changes account for the majority of the increase.

The NSSL program is one of four Air Force major acquisition programs that have reported cost increases greater than $1 billion or 10% since December 2018. The other three are the B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization ($285.3 million, or 10.3%); the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile ($5.2 billion); and the Joint Direct Attack Munition ($1.1 billion)."

Richard Neal: Why the House needs Trump’s tax returns,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Richard Neal'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-my-committee-needs-the-presidents-tax-returns/2019/07/31/05d4505a-b3c8-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html,"Richard E. Neal, a Democrat, represents Massachusetts’s 1st Congressional District in the House and is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

For three decades, the House of Representatives and its Ways and Means Committee have been the site of my life’s work. I never aspired to be a senator or governor or president.

Instead, I learned arcane House rules and sought a position on the Ways and Means Committee because of its tremendous potential to help my district. I have listened to my constituents on matters such as taxes, health care, international trade and Social Security, which are within the committee’s purview. Untold hours have gone into developing legislation and trying to improve, pass or defeat countless bills. That’s the job.

I’d rather hold a roundtable in Pittsfield, Mass., or cross-examine Medicare administrators than pick fights on cable news. Those arguments tend to drive people into their corners, shrinking opportunities to accomplish real results.

I’m an institutionalist. I respect Congress, for all its imperfections. As chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, I am responsible for congressional oversight of the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service’s administration of the federal tax code. The tax code gives the committee chairman the power to request taxpayer information from the IRS. The committee has exercised this power at various times in the past and has never been denied by the IRS or the Treasury Department.

In early April, I requested the president’s tax returns to fulfill a legitimate congressional oversight responsibility: Our voluntary tax-compliance system hinges on the public’s faith that our tax laws are administered fairly and without favor to those in power. The president is unique: No other American has the power to sign bills into law and direct an entire branch of government. That power, and the extent to which the IRS can audit and enforce federal tax laws against a current or future president, merits closer legislative scrutiny.

The IRS has a policy of performing mandatory audits on all sitting presidents and vice presidents. But neither Congress nor the public knows anything about the scope of those audits and whether the president can exert undue influence on the IRS to affect his or her tax treatment. If, for example, the president is already under audit at the time he or she takes office, what happens to that audit? We don’t know.

My committee will consider legislation regarding the mandatory audit program to ensure these audits are conducted fairly and without undue influence from the commander in chief. And, as part of our deliberations, we must review his tax information to better understand the audit program and propose any needed changes.

The law on this is very clear: The IRS “shall furnish ” the Ways and Means Committee with the requested tax returns. Both Democrats and Republicans have made requests for taxpayer information under 6103(f)(1) of the U.S. tax code in the past. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress is entitled to a presumption that its investigatory activities are legitimate, and, in this case, the legitimacy is self-evident. And yet, the administration has stonewalled Congress, ordering the IRS commissioner not to comply with the plain language of the law and setting up a pending legal clash.

I did not pick this fight, but I will not shirk it because it’s about something much bigger than tax forms. This is not an exercise in political retribution: I am not willing to trade the reputation of the Ways and Means Committee for cheap political gains.

The committee is a venerable part of U.S. history, having given the nation Social Security, Medicare, the entire tax code, all of our trade agreements, and numerous programs serving children and families. This committee financed America’s role in both world wars, and its antecedent paid for the Lewis and Clark expedition. I have no intention of squandering my chairmanship of this distinguished panel on petty or malevolent efforts to embarrass the current president.

But in this country, we take seriously the Magna Carta’s precept of the rule of law, not the law of rulers. I will fight with everything I have to reassert Congress’s constitutional mandate to serve as an equal branch of government. This country has thrived through the centuries because we have durable political institutions with a robust system of checks and balances.

Our political institutions won’t continue to function unless we guard them vigilantly, and my colleagues and I in the House majority are committed to doing so. It is the root of our oath to uphold the law."
EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process,https://thehill.com,[],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455854-epa-proposes-easing-air-pollution-permitting-process,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moved to finalize a rule Thursday that would ease the air pollution permitting process for certain power plants and manufacturers.

Since the early days of the Trump administration, the EPA has argued the process for obtaining permits under the Clean Air Act, known as New Source Review (NSR), is too burdensome.

The agency's proposal seeks to make a regulation out of a 2018 memo from former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process Pair of GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule MORE that has already been challenged in court by environmental groups.

The Sierra Club said the proposed rule would allow “some of the wealthiest industries in our country to avoid cleaning up their air emissions instead of installing modern pollution controls on their dirty facilities.”

EPA argues it will help ease the process for facilities looking to install new equipment.

The NSR process at the crux of the proposed regulation kicks in both for new facilities and when power plants install new equipment or make changes that would significantly increase air pollution.

The debate between the EPA and environmentalists largely centers on how much pollution must be factored in when weighing changes at a power plant. Whether or not a plant has to install pollution controls hinges on that calculation.

Environmentalists say the law requires looking at the plant as a whole, including all the ways a facility decreases and increases pollution through its operations.

John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the EPA proposal weighs the increased pollution from one change against all the other decreases in the plant — something that ignores that net pollution may go up.

“You can’t cherry-pick the decreases because it’s allowing even greater increases to escape control,” he said, thus leading to more pollution. “And that’s really the point of this regulation, to allow greater increases to escape control.”

He gave the example of installing a new boiler at a plant. The new technology might be more energy efficient, but if the boiler is run more often than the old one, it will still produce more pollution.

The EPA pushed back against Walke’s assertion.

“Today’s proposal is an important step towards President Trump Donald John TrumpKentucky miners' struggle is that of many working Americans Cummings releases statement on attempted break-in after Trump attacks PhRMA top lobbyist to leave post MORE’s goal of reforming the elements of NSR that regularly discouraged facilities from upgrading and deploying the latest energy efficient technologies,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules it says are too lax MORE said in a release. “By simplifying the permitting process and implementing a common-sense interpretation of our NSR rules, we will remove a major obstacle to the construction of cleaner and more efficient facilities.”

But Walke said calling the changes “upgrades” ignores that they cause pollution.

“The EPA and industry like to call them upgrades and efficiency improvements cause that sounds nice and sounds like things we should be doing, but what that masks is that they are all activities that increase air pollution significantly.”"
The US military spent $33 million on tech known to be vulnerable to Chinese cyberespionage,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1679475/dod-spent-30m-on-china-hackable-tech-from-lenovo-gopro-others/,"The US Department of Defense (DoD) purchased and used millions of dollars worth of electronics last year containing “known cybersecurity vulnerabilities” that make them particularly susceptible to Chinese government espionage. The findings are included in a recent audit (pdf) by the Pentagon’s Inspector General (IG) for DoD cyberspace operations, which warns that “missions critical to national security could be compromised” if the military does not take swift action.

Some models or brands of so-called COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) technology can allow adversaries access to communications infrastructure, command and control systems, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance networks, says the partially redacted IG report.

To that end, at least $32.8 million in COTS purchases made by the US Army and Air Force during the 2018 fiscal year were singled out for concern. The products include software, cameras, and networking equipment red-flagged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate, as well as computers that have been banned for use by State Department employees since 2006.

Repelling cyberattacks has become an increasingly worrisome problem for the military since the DoD was hit with its first significant cyberattack from China in 2003. Last year, the Chinese government hacked into a US Navy contractor’s computer network, gaining access to highly sensitive secrets about a classified undersea missile program. Also last year, a breach of DoD travel records exposed the personal information and credit card data of tens of thousands of servicemembers and civilians, although that has not been explicitly linked to Beijing, which reportedly maintains a cyberespionage force with nearly 200,000 members (pdf) spanning both the military and private sectors. What’s more, a report issued last October by the Government Accountability Office found “mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in nearly all weapon systems” developed by the US military between 2012 and 2017.

“The Chinese have already broken into my stuff,” Army acquisitions official Lt. Gen. Paul Ostrowski told attendees at an event earlier this month. “The personnel system has been broken into. This is something that has risen to the top of the concern list. Not only within the Army, but within [the Office of the Secretary of Defense].”

Unheeded warnings

As much as 80% of the DoD’s systems are off-the-shelf items, or contain components that are commercially available, says the new IG report. Yet, there is no “approved products list to prevent unsecure items from being purchased.”

In one example highlighted by the IG, the Pentagon continued to buy and use video surveillance systems manufactured by two Chinese companies, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology and Dahua Technology, for at least 16 months after the state department warned against it due to cyberespionage concerns. The DoD didn’t stop until August 2018, when Congress officially banned the federal government from doing business with the two firms.

The current items singled out as problematic by the IG include such household names as Lenovo computers, Lexmark printers, and GoPro cameras.

Lenovo

In 2006, the report notes, the State Department banned Lenovo products from its classified networks after reports that the company’s computers were being manufactured with hidden spyware and backdoors. In 2015, the DHS issued a warning about cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Lenovo devices, and in 2016 the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate warned that Lenovo hardware posed a cyberespionage risk to both classified and unclassified networks and had the potential to compromise the entire DoD supply chain.

Still, the Army purchased 195 Lenovo products last year, for around $268,000, while the Air Force acquired 1,378 Lenovo products for $1.9 million.

Plenty of warnings about Lenovo products.

Lexmark

Last year, the Army and Air Force bought more than 8,000 Lexmark printers for about $30 million. The company is owned by a consortium of Chinese firms, and has links to the country’s military, nuclear, and cyberespionage programs, points out the IG report. A US government vulnerabilities database lists 20 known cybersecurity concerns pertaining to Lexmark, such as “storing and transmitting sensitive network access credentials in plain text and allowing the execution of malicious code on the printer,” which the IG says “could allow remote attackers to use a connected Lexmark printer to conduct cyberespionage or launch a denial of service attack on a DoD network.”

GoPro

The Army and Air Force also purchased 117 GoPro cameras last year, costing $98,000. The built-in wireless and Bluetooth capabilities, which let users share video in real-time, “have vulnerabilities that could allow a remote attacker access to the stored network credentials and live video streams,” says the report. “By exploiting these vulnerabilities, a malicious actor could view the video stream, start recording, or take pictures without the user’s knowledge.”

The DoD’s response to the IG report is almost entirely redacted.

A heavily redacted response.

Next steps?

The DoD must start to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks posed by off-the-shelf technology before it is put into use, cautions the IG. However, the report points out that current DoD policy only mitigates cybersecurity risks “after purchase.”

“Despite DoD policies and the numerous organizations performing cybersecurity testing and analysis,” says the audit, “there appears to be no organization assessing the risks for COTS items DoD-wide, identifying high-risk items for further testing, or actively recommending prohibition of these high-risk items when necessary.”

It’s a serious enough problem that the IG believes a legislative fix might be the only answer.

In the meantime, says the report, “We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct an organization or group to develop a risk-based approach to prioritize COTS items for further evaluation, a process to test high-risk COTS items, and a process to prohibit the purchase and use of high-risk COTS items, when necessary, until mitigation strategies can limit the risk to an acceptable level.”"

State Department wasted $100M on Afghan camp despite early warnings: Report,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-department-wasted-100m-afghan-camp-early-warnings/story?id=64683930,"The U.S. State Department spent over three years and more than $100 million on a project to rebuild a base in Afghanistan that was never rebuilt, even though the department was warned it was a bad idea from the start, according to an incisive new government watchdog report.

Interested in Afghanistan? Add Afghanistan as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Afghanistan news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The report, published online by the State Department's inspector general Tuesday, rapped the department for rushing through a plan in 2014 to reconstruct the government's Camp Eggars in Kabul, Afghanistan, using a defense contracting company that had never taken on such a construction project. The department had hired a consultant to review the project but then dismissed the consultant’s early warnings about issues it foresaw early on.

""As a result, there were a series of cascading problems,"" the report says. “This led to the expenditures of $103.2 million without any discernible benefit to the Department or to the people it intended to protect.”

OIG

The inspector general concedes that the State Department was trying to work as quickly as possible with few options in the midst of a deteriorating security situation, but says the department was in such a rush that it failed to keep the project on track and failed to hold the primary contractor, Aegis Defense Services, accountable. The inspector general undertook the review of the project after the State Department's deputy secretary requested it do so last year. A spokesperson for GardaWorld Federal Services, which does some U.S. government business as Aegis since its parent company bought Aegis in 2015, did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

The original plan, hatched in the summer of 2014, was to rebuild Camp Eggars in order to house security personnel much closer to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Kabul had become more dangerous after the U.S. drawdown in 2014, and officials feared the security personnel, then based two miles away, lived too far from the people they were meant to protect.

But the State Department office that usually handles large construction projects was unable to take on the job, so the department instead modified a government contract meant primarily for security services to include the reconstruction. So Aegis, which previously focused on providing protection for American personnel, attempted to take on the reconstruction itself with the help of construction-focused subcontractors.

That meant that a State Department office unfamiliar with the demands of large construction projects was working with a company with little experience of its own in that area, the report says.

Problems began “almost immediately,” and, coupled with changes the State Department wanted to make as the project progressed, eventually the estimated overall price tag grew to more than $300 million, the report says. In an example of the waste, the report said millions were spent on construction materials, but delays in the project meant they had to be stored elsewhere for long periods of time at additional cost – more than $22 million in all.

The State Department finally gave up in December 2016, with an estimated 10 percent of the construction actually completed.

The inspector general made three recommendations to the State Department to improve its policies related to such warzone construction projects, but the State Department disagreed with two of them, maintaining that the Camp Eggars project presented “very unique circumstances.” The department said it would review the Camp Eggars project, however, to determine “whether the decision to expend the amount cited was necessary or reasonable.”"
Interior secretary will be allowed to meet with former fossil fuel clients starting this weekend,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/interior-secretarys-ethics-pledge-is-set-to-expire-this-weekend-729e7e959374/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s ethics recusal will expire on Saturday. The ethics pledge banned Bernhardt from decisions involving his former firm’s clients for two years.

Bernhardt was also not able to meet with these companies, unless five or more other stakeholders were present and nothing relating specifically to the companies was discussed.

But all of this is set to change on August 3.

Prior to joining the Interior Department in 2017, Bernhardt worked as a lobbyist for the oil and gas industry via the Colorado law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

Among the firm’s 22 clients that Bernhardt was prohibited from engaging with for two years under his ethics recusal were energy companies Halliburton, Eni, and Statoil (now known as Equinor). Other clients included industry groups such as the U.S. Oil and Gas Association and the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).

The end of Bernhardt’s recusal was marked on Friday by a ribbon-cutting ceremony hosted by the Clean Water Fund at a park across from the D.C. Interior headquarters.

During his time in the Trump administration, Bernhardt’s ethical issues have taken center stage. He has so many potential conflicts of interest to avoid that he carries around a card listing all of them so he doesn’t forget. A recent analysis by the Center for American Progress found that Bernhardt has more conflicts of interest than any other Trump Cabinet nominee. (ThinkProgress is an editorially independent news site housed at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.)

In April, Politico revealed that Bernhardt reportedly worked closely on matters he had pledged to recuse himself from. Just weeks after Bernhardt joined the administration, he was working on policies related key water infrastructure policy which he had worked on as a lobbyist. The ethics agreement had barred him from involving himself in “particular matters” with Westlands Water District for just one year, until August 2018.

The California water district is known for having tried to weaken the Endangered Species Act.

And in September 2018, an appearance by Bernhardt at a water industry forum in Colorado was canceled after department ethics officials concluded it could raise conflicts-of-interest concerns.

Public records released by the Western Values Project in February 2018 also that found Bernhardt’s former client, the IPAA, frequently communicated with Interior officials conducting a review of the department’s sage grouse policy. In March 2017, for instance, the IPAA thanked Bernhardt for his action as deputy secretary that benefited the oil and gas industry.

It’s not just Bernhardt though who has faced questions over conflicts of interest.

Just two weeks after Bernhardt was officially confirmed as head of the agency — following the departure of scandal-ridden former Secretary Ryan Zinke — the department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) confirmed an investigation into six other senior DOI officials who may have also potentially violated their ethics pledges due to interactions with former employers and clients.

At the same time, this week, a slew of controversial new appointments were welcomed at Interior.

William Perry Pendley, a former senior official from the Reagan administration, was appointed acting director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Pendley, former president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, has long fought to undo the federal government’s control over public lands.

In a 2016 National Review article, Pendley wrote: “The Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold… Westerners know that only getting title to much of the land in the West will bring real change.”

Pendley has in the past sued the Interior Department on behalf of the fossil fuel industry and has tried to undermine endangered species protections along with working to reduce the size of federal lands in favor of development.

Also this week, a climate denier tied to the coal industry was appointed as a senior adviser in the department. Christian Palich previously worked as the president of the pro-Trump Ohio Coal Association until 2017. Palich comes to the Interior this week from lobbying firm Siekman, Siekman & Associates, whose clients include Halliburton and pipeline firm Sunoco Logistics. He was also previously deputy associate administrator for congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Environmental Protection Agency.

Palich has made numerous Fox News appearances praising President Donald Trump’s environmental rollbacks and he has frequently doubted established climate science on Twitter, calling it “junk science.”

After Trump’s election, for example, he tweeted: “Time to push fight [sic] back on all the radical enviro regs that have been illegally been [sic] brought on America over last 8 yrs.”

And finally, after 10 years, the department now has a Senate-confirmed inspector general. Mark Greenblatt — an attorney who previously worked at the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General — will be responsible for investigating allegations of ethics violations by Bernhardt and others at the department.

When pressed by lawmakers earlier this year on his appointment, Greenblatt asserted he had “zero intent” of shutting down any ongoing investigations into the department’s operations."

Now, Ginnie is taking yet another step to squash abuses, announcing Thursday that it is moving forward with a proposal to remove VA-backed cash-out refinances with high loan-to-value ratios from its flagship securities.

First announced in May, the proposal revises the pooling eligibility requirements for VA refinances, creating new criteria for cash-out refis with loan-to-value ratios that exceed 90%.

After a three-month period to collect industry feedback on the proposed rule, the agency has announced that 90% LTV cash-outs will officially be ineligible for Ginnie Mae I Single Issuer Pools and Ginnie Mae II Multiple Issuer Pools starting November 1, 2019. Instead, these high LTV loans can be placed into a custom Ginnie Mae pool.

Permanent construction financing loans will be the only exception, Ginnie noted.

According to a release issued by the agency, the revised pooling requirement “provides global investors with increased certainty in the performance of the Ginnie Mae security, which ultimately lowers mortgage rates for all borrowers served by the program.”

Ginnie’s move coincides with steps taken by the Federal Housing Administration to limit cash-out refinances on FHA-backed loans.

In a release announcing both changes, the FHA said the prevalence of VA cash-outs was an increasing concern for investors.

“Cash-out refinance programs are particularly susceptible to accelerated prepayment speeds, which is why Ginnie Mae is restricting the inclusion of such loans to custom MBS securities,” the statement read. “This allows for greater market transparency for investors pricing Ginnie Mae securities.”

Ginnie Mae Acting President Maren Kasper also weighed in.

“Today’s announcement underscores Ginnie Mae’s commitment to ensuring the agency’s policies enable homeowners to borrow prudently, utilizing the government-guaranteed mortgage market,” Kasper said. “Additionally, this policy provides global investors with increased certainty in the performance of the Ginnie Mae security, which ultimately lowers mortgage rates for all borrowers served by our program.”"
Ryan Zinke email use now part of Justice Department investigation,https://www.cnn.com,['Gregory Wallace'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/31/politics/zinke-email-investigation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's use of private email to conduct official business is now part of a Department of Justice criminal probe, a government watchdog said Tuesday.

The Interior Department inspector general wrote to members of Congress that it is now working with federal prosecutors.

""In consultation with DOJ and to avoid any interference with the criminal case, we have decided to combine the investigations,"" read the letter from acting inspector general Gail Ennis.

It said the Justice Department probe began ""last year,"" around the time when two senior Democratic lawmakers, Reps. Raul Grijalva and Elijah Cummings, requested information from the inspector general on ""many instances in which Secretary Zinke sent and received emails containing official business using his personal email account.""

In October, CNN reported that the Justice Department was investigating whether Zinke used his position for private gain.

Housing Authority Initiates Nearly $500 Million in Affordable Housing Developments,https://therivardreport.com,"['Iris Dimmick', 'More Iris']",,,,https://therivardreport.com/housing-authority-initiates-nearly-500-million-in-affordable-housing-developments/,"The San Antonio Housing Authority’s board approved on Thursday future transactions, tax credits, and bond applications that will be part of $486 million in affordable housing projects.

The nearly unanimous approval marks one of the largest amounts of financing authorized in a single day, said SAHA President and CEO David Nisivoccia. The funding will assist 14 different projects (nearly 3,500 housing units) across Bexar County that will have a portion reserved for residents who earn less than the area median income (AMI), ranging from 30 to 80 percent of AMI. These projects could come open in two to five years.

“This is not a normal Thursday,” Nisivoccia told the Rivard Report. “It’s a seminal day for the agency. I think staff here at San Antonio Housing Authority heard an action call; we heard that from the [Mayor’s Housing Policy] Task Force, the mayor, my board, and more importantly the residents of San Antonio saying, ‘Hey, we need more affordable housing.'”

City Council approved a policy framework last year, produced by the task force, that calls for increased spending and better procedures surrounding the affordable housing market.

Several of the items approved on Thursday have been years in the making, Nisivoccia said. “It’s not like it happened overnight. A lot of people might ask [what did SAHA do] for the last two years. Well, this is what we’ve been doing.”

Gone are the days of large, so-called “housing projects” that place low-income families in apartment buildings en masse, he said. The current model is to work with an affordable housing developer on public-private partnerships that have a mix of market-rate and subsidized units, and “I think you’re going to see more of it. … The market is good.”

Most of the projects will still need to come before the board again for final approval, including the tax credits and tax-exempt bond applications.

These are in preliminary stages, said Timothy Alcott, SAHA real estate and legal services officer, but the deadline to apply for those through the State is Aug. 15. These “volume caps” are first-come, first-serve.

These projects are just coming to fruition at the same time, Alcott said, hence the meeting’s large price tag. “We’re getting more players in and [that] gives us the ability to do more affordable units.”

SAHA is seeking volume caps for Alazán Courts (adjacent to the Alazán Lofts project in the West Side), 1604 Flats, Old Pearsall Flats, Traders Flats, Kitty Hawk Flats, and Mira Vista Apartments. SAHA has yet to identify partners for some of those projects, such as Alazán Courts.

The board also gave the go-ahead to pursue proposals from four companies to build seven different projects:

The Lynd Co. wants to construct Culebra Crossing, a $47 million 325-unit apartment complex near Loop 1604;

ARDC Ruiz proposes a $21 million, 102-unit that will rent almost exclusively to families earning 60 percent of AMI;

Real estate developer JMJ wants a one of two 24-story towers near La Villita on South St. Mary’s Street to include affordable units;

Weal Development proposes a $65 million, eight-story, 252-unit apartment complex at South St. Mary’s Street and East Nueva Street. Half of the units in the St. John Square project will be for families earning 50 percent of AMI;

Vesta Corp. is seeking to acquire three existing low-income housing projects in the South and Southwest sides;

SAHA also is pursuing $20 million in bonds to develop Charity at Springview Apartments. Charity, a working title, is a 250-unit project on the East Side.

Alcott and Nisivoccia said they were confident that almost all – if not all – projects initiated Thursday would come to fruition.

SAHA Commissioner Sofia Lopez cast the lone vote against the deals related to St. Mary’s Towers and Culebra Commons.

In the case of Culebra, Lopez said 80 percent of AMI isn’t affordable enough for many San Antonians. In both cases, Lopez said she wanted more details about the cost-benefit analysis and how such projects fit into the broader picture of housing stock in San Antonio.

She wants to make sure “we really are getting the best bang for our buck,” Lopez said.

Board Chair Jessica Weaver agreed that the board needs a kind of “retreat” in which staff provides an overview of SAHA’s strategies.

“Staff stands ready to have that retreat at any time,” Nisivoccia said.

Several residents spoke out about Alazán Lofts, a SAHA-NRP Group project that recently received a competitive 9 percent tax credit from the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs. Forty-eight of the 88 units will be public housing, eight will be market-rate apartments, and the rest will be allocated for renters making 60 percent of AMI.

To build the four-story complex, however, requires a change in zoning. The area community plan calls for two-story homes there. City Council is slated to consider the zoning change Aug. 22. The Zoning Commission recommended approval this month.

“It’s not OK to dismiss community members,” Yaneth Flores, a West Side community organizer with the Esperanza Peace and Justice Center, said during the public comment period of the meeting.

Stephanie Marquez / Rivard Report

Alazán Lofts is a separate project from Alazán Courts. The latter is a proposal to demolish the oldest public housing project in the United States and build a more modern facility with 328 units.

“Demolition of this development would be disastrous for this community,” Flores said, because it would separate residents from their support network.

Those residents would have first dibs on temporary units elsewhere while construction proceeds at Alazán Courts, Nisivoccia said after the meeting, and have the option of moving back once completed.

The proposal would allow SAHA to update the facility and provide more of the “deep-dive” subsidies for those making less than half of AMI, he said. “That’s how I want to honor the past, is to provide people presently the opportunity to see a good life for themselves and most importantly their children.”

Court documents allege that Emmit Marshall, 52, owner of the Alliance School of Trucking (AST), along with his co-defendant Robert Waggoner, 56, who served as the school’s director, recruited eligible veterans under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.



Marshall and Waggoner convinced veterans to enroll in their school by telling them “they could collect housing and other fees from the VA without attending the programs,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California.



Marshall told FreightWaves on July 31 that his trucking school is still open for business, but is no longer accepting veterans as students.



Knowing that the vast majority of veterans enrolled at AST did not intend to attend any portion of the programs the trucking school offered, which included a 160-hour Tractor Trailer and Safety class and a 600-hour Select Driver Development program, Marshall and Waggoner “created and submitted fraudulent enrollment certifications,” according to Marshall’s plea agreement.



Marshall and Waggoner also created student files that contained “bogus documents,” prosecutors allege.



Once AST became aware of the investigation, Marshall, Waggoner and others at the trucking school “removed fraudulent documents from student files, and Marshall later ordered that these files be destroyed,” Marshall’s plea agreement states.



Over a four-year period, court documents claim the VA paid AST approximately $2.3 million in tuition and fee payments for veterans who didn’t attend classes. The VA also paid around $1.9 million in educational benefits directly to veterans who did not attend classes at AST.



Marshall is scheduled to be sentenced on November 18. He faces a statutory maximum sentence of 100 years in federal prison. Waggoner is scheduled to go to trial on February 25, 2020.

EPA says cleanup of arsenic-laced Minneapolis Superfund site is mostly complete,http://www.startribune.com,"['Greg Stanley', 'Greg.Stanley Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/epa-says-cleanup-of-arsenic-laced-minneapolis-superfund-site-is-mostly-complete/513463092/,"After more than a decade of cleanup efforts and testing, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is ready to essentially shut down a Superfund site in south Minneapolis where industrial arsenic had contaminated the soil surrounding about 600 homes.

The East Phillips neighborhood site, near Hiawatha Avenue and E. 28th Street, has been on the EPA’s list of priorities under its Superfund program for years after extremely high arsenic levels were found in many of the yards surrounding an old rail line.

Remediation efforts have been almost entirely finished since 2011, when the EPA completed a $25 million project to dig up and replace most of the contaminated soil. A scheduled review conducted in April found that the soil poses no threat to humans or the environment and that it’s time to take the vast majority of the neighborhood off the priority list.

“The remedy is functioning as intended,” the review said.

The EPA plans to keep just nine properties on the cleanup list, where homeowners have refused to allow soil tests. The agency will continue conducting regular reviews until all nine are tested and remediated.

With the soil safe, there’s really no reason to keep the rest of the neighborhood on the list, said Cathy Villas-Horns, supervisor of the incident response unit for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.

1930s-1960s: Arsenic blows in from a neighboring pesticide manufacturer. 2000s: EPA scientists find high arsenic levels in local soil, begin excavating and replacing it. 2011: EPA announces most yards have been cleaned up.

“Except for those nine properties, the cleanup has been completed,” Villas-Horns said.

Regulators believe that wind carried the arsenic into the neighborhood over the course of three decades from a site where the now-defunct Reade Manufacturing Co. had been storing, producing and dumping an arsenic-based insecticide from the 1930s until the 1960s.

In the early and mid-2000s, the EPA and Agriculture Department tested the soil of more than 3,500 houses, day-care centers and parks, as well as a cemetery in the area, finding unsafe levels of arsenic in more than 600 properties. By 2011, the two agencies had spent more than $25 million, largely from federal economic stimulus money, tearing out the yards and removing at least 1 foot of topsoil in each of the contaminated properties. They poured in clean topsoil and reseeded each lawn with grass.

There were roughly 30 holdouts in 2011 — properties where owners refused to grant permission to test their lawns. Over the past eight years, the EPA has whittled that number down to the nine who continue to deny permission.

Minnesota has 25 sites on the EPA Superfund priority list, which serves as a roster of contaminated areas that are eligible for federal cleanup funding. It primarily helps EPA managers decide where to focus limited funds. The site’s removal from the Superfund list “does not in any way alter EPA’s right to take enforcement actions, as appropriate,” the agency said in a statement.

If more contaminants are found, the EPA could place the area back on the list.

The state keeps its own list of cleanup priorities for the Superfund sites in Minnesota, including the former Reade Manufacturing property itself, at 2800 Hiawatha Av. The EPA decision will not affect the state’s ongoing groundwater cleanup and monitoring efforts at that property, which is a now a business center, Villas-Horns said.

Neighbors still worry

Some residents expressed concern Wednesday about potential consequences of taking the neighborhood off the Superfund list, saying the area is far from clean.

“If anything deserved the designation of a Superfund site, this neighborhood did and still does,” said Brad Pass of the East Phillips Improvement Coalition.

Properties in the area, such as the former Roof Depot immediately west of the Reade site, are slated for redevelopment, Pass said. But the building and asphalt parking lots may have been built on top of potentially polluted soil, trapping contaminants there for years.

Once those structures are torn down, Pass said, he’s worried there may be arsenic underneath that is once again blown into the neighborhood.

“Although they have remediated certain lots, this is going to open up tremendous potential for spreading this arsenic all over the place,” Pass said."
If we had a normal US President...,https://www.cnn.com,['Frida Ghitis'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/opinions/if-we-had-a-normal-us-president-russia-china-ghitis/index.html,"Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) In another time, the President of the United States might have called an urgent press conference on Monday morning -- making sure he could command the world's attention -- and issued a stern warning that violent repression of peaceful protesters is intolerable.

After all, what we saw this weekend in Moscow and Hong Kong were alarming signs that a wave of more brutal repression is looming. The regimes in Moscow and Beijing have sent notice that they are about to crush peaceful, popular movements. This should alarm the US president and produce an urgent response.

Instead, President Donald Trump woke up Monday morning prepared to stoke racist sentiment across the United States, tweeting a new barrage of inflammatory messages against prominent African American figures in what has become a familiar pattern : racist tweets from the President, widespread condemnation by the public, doubling down by the President. Trump is making racism his trademark, spending his time energizing racists while decisively removing America from the moral high ground.

Perhaps not coincidentally, this is happening at the time when democracy activists most desperately need a show of support. They could use a strong statement from Washington telling the leaders in Russia and China that the world is watching. That their actions could have consequences. That, at the very least, their position on the global stage is teetering. That the American people stand on the side of those demanding justice.

Consider what happened in Russia, where pro-democracy activists have been protesting for the right to vote after authorities brazenly disqualified opposition candidates for an upcoming municipal election. President Vladimir Putin's approval has been sliding, discontent growing, and the largest protests in years have taken place, even though Russian law now makes it nearly impossible to obtain a protest permit.

This weekend, police sent rows of menacing riot police to break down a peaceful protest, arresting more than a thousand people in Moscow.

Most alarming is what happened to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose very life may well depend on whether the rest of the world makes it clear to the Kremlin that, if he is killed, there will be consequences.

Navalny was arrested earlier in the week after calling for a demonstration. Then, suddenly, on Sunday, he was rushed to a hospital with what the hospital called an ""acute allergic reaction."" He does not suffer from allergies. The news immediately brought to mind the fate of other Kremlin critics who have faced, shall we call it, biochemical issues.

Recall the horrific disfigurement of former Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian politician who dared to challenge Putin's preferred candidate in 2004. He narrowly escaped death after being poisoned with dioxin. He believes the Kremlin was behind the assassination attempt.

The Kremlin stands accused of poisoning other Putin critics, even exiled ones, including Alexander Litvinenko, who died from radioactive polonium poisoning blamed on Putin by a UK inquest, and Sergei Skripal and his daughter, poisoned in Salisbury, England. British authorities have accused two Russian men of carrying out the hit, saying they belong to Russian military intelligence. The men say they were simply tourists visiting Salisbury.

Other Kremlin critics have died mysterious deaths. The popular politician and Putin critic Boris Nemtsov, shot in front of the Kremlin, former ally Boris Berezovsky, who supposedly killed himself, and many, many courageous journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists counts 28 Russian journalists killed since 2000, the year Putin rose to power.

Navalny's personal doctor says he has been taken back out of the hospital into prison against her advice. She thinks he has been poisoned. Perhaps it was a warning, perhaps an attempt on his life. Navalny, back in prison on Monday, suggested he may have been poisoned while in police custody.

A well-articulated warning from Washington might just save him and others.

A warning to Beijing is just as urgent. For weeks the people of Hong Kong have waged peaceful protests against a government that is supposed to be independent of China under the ""one country, two systems"" model agreed when the territory reverted to China from the UK.

Protests started against a bill that would have allowed extradition to China, where the legal system is beholden to the Communist Party-controlled regime. The protests have been massive, bringing out as many as two million people in a territory of just seven million, underscoring how widespread and intense the distrust of China is.

Beijing has been growing impatient, and the signs are nothing short of ominous.

Last week, the spokesman for the Chinese military, Wu Qian, issued a chilling reminder that China's military forces could be quickly deployed inside Hong Kong if the territory's authorities request it. Then he described the protests in a way that made very clear Beijing is running out of patience. The protesters' behavior, Wu declared, ""is intolerable.""

That was Wednesday. On Sunday, Hong Kong police clad in riot gear launched a harsh crackdown against demonstrators. CNN's Anna Coren, in the midst of the mayhem , was visibly horrified. The protesters were completely peaceful, she said.

On Monday, China issued its sternest warning yet, accusing pro-democracy protesters of committing "" evil and criminal acts .""

One shudders to think what might come next at the hands of the regime that massacred protesters at Tiananmen Square 30 years ago.

When the tanks rolled in Tiananmen, then-President George H.W. Bush wasted no time publicly condemning the regime, as have other American presidents who spoke firmly and decisively against repression.

Sure, America has failed many times, and its own history is far from immaculate, but the words of a credible American president can help draw the moral lines. It may or may not stay the hand of a tyrant, it may or may not prevent a massacre. But at the very least it helps clarify what is and is not legitimate conduct in our time. Even if it fails to stop a catastrophe in progress, it may give second thoughts to another tinpot tyrant watching from a distance.

How tragic for America and for the world that Washington today is dominated by a President who thinks nothing matters more than his personal fate and believes inciting racist hatreds at home tops the national agenda."
DHS issues hacking security alert for small planes,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kris Van Cleave'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-issues-hacking-security-alert-small-planes-today-2019-07-30/,"Washington — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rare security alert Tuesday for small planes. The alert warns if a hacker gained physical access to certain small planes, they could attach a common device to its wiring. This could provide false flight data including altitude and airspeed, as well as possible access to the autopilot system, potentially leaving a pilot unable to tell whether the reading was accurate and potentially lose control of the aircraft.

""We could do basically anything the plane can do, pretty much anything the pilot could do by himself,"" said Tod Beardsley, director of research at cyber security firm Rapid7.

In a laboratory setting, researchers at Rapid7 were able to hack what's essentially a plane's electronic central nervous system, allowing them to send the erroneous commands. ""I do think it is something of a wake up call. This is something that needs to be taken seriously now rather than later, like after the disaster,"" Beardsley said.

Last year, Homeland Security researchers, who successfully hacked a 757 while it was parked, warned it's only ""a matter of time before a cybersecurity breach on an airline occurs."" DHS is now urging small plane makers to study the cyber security protections car makers added after hackers were able to exploit similar technology on the roads.

The Federal Aviation Administration tells CBS News a ""scenario that involves unrestricted physical access is unlikely"" but these findings are ""an important reminder to remain vigilant."" Rapid7 said it notified the company that built those two systems, but their findings prompted DHS to urge pilots to secure their aircraft and for manufacturers to take a look at options to better secure these systems."

Computing—“Seeing” in real time

Oak Ridge National Laboratory is training next-generation cameras called dynamic vision sensors, or DVS, to interpret live information—a capability that has applications in robotics and could improve autonomous vehicle sensing. Unlike a traditional digital camera that records large amounts of information in frames, a DVS transmits per-pixel changes in light intensity. Individual pixel locations are recorded and time stamped to the microsecond, creating data “events” that are processed by a neuromorphic network—a type of intelligent, energy-efficient computing architecture. “Because the DVS records only changes in what it sees, there is no redundant data,” said ORNL SULI intern Kemal Fidan, who spent his summer learning about dynamic vision sensors under ORNL’s Robert Patton. This capability makes the sensors fast, power efficient and effective in wide ranges of light intensity. Fidan’s project taught a DVS to recognize human gestures such as waving, clapping and two-finger peace signs in real time. —Abby Bower [Contact: Sara Shoemaker, (865) 576-9219; shoemakerms@ornl.gov]

Fusion—Tungsten rising

Using additive manufacturing, scientists experimenting with tungsten at Oak Ridge National Laboratory hope to unlock new potential of the high-performance heat-transferring material used to protect components from the plasma inside a fusion reactor. Fusion requires hydrogen isotopes to reach millions of degrees. Tungsten, the metal with the highest melting point, holds promise to withstand extreme temperatures at the edge of this reaction, yet it is brittle and difficult to machine. The ORNL team is using an additive manufacturing technique called electron beam melting to build innovative tungsten fusion components with complex, unique geometries that can’t be made through traditional manufacturing. “The electron beam allows us to better control the heat distribution as tungsten is printed layer by layer,” said ORNL’s Betsy Ellis who led the initial experiments. “After more testing, this method may result in a better quality, full-density structure that’s less prone to cracking.” [Contact: Sara Shoemaker, (865) 576-9219; shoemakerms@ornl.gov]

Climate—Energy demand shuffle

A detailed study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory estimated how much more—or less—energy United States residents might consume by 2050 relative to predicted shifts in seasonal weather patterns across the country. ORNL’s Deeksha Rastogi and colleagues used a series of sophisticated climate models run on supercomputing resources at ORNL to estimate changes in household energy demand over a 40-year period. They found that prolonged periods of increased temperatures are expected to drive a rise in electricity needs while shorter, milder cold seasons could reduce natural gas demand. The team’s paper also posits that climate shifts could impact a projected decrease in residential energy demand in some rural areas. “Our results provide a highly comprehensive look at residential energy consumption that we hope will influence future analysis to understand residents’ choices and behavior relative to climate and socioeconomic conditions,” Rastogi said.

Supercomputing—Galactic winds demystified

Using the Titan supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a team of astrophysicists created a set of galactic wind simulations of the highest resolution ever performed. The simulations will allow researchers to gather and interpret more accurate, detailed data that elucidates how galactic winds affect the formation and evolution of galaxies. Brant Robertson of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Evan Schneider of Princeton University developed the simulation suite to better understand galactic winds—outflows of gas released by supernova explosions—which could help explain variations in their density and temperature distributions. The improved set of galactic wind simulations will be incorporated into larger cosmological simulations. “We now have a much clearer idea of how the high speed, high temperature gas produced by clusters of supernovae is ejected after mixing with the cooler, denser gas in the disk of the galaxy,” Schneider said. —Elizabeth Rosenthal [Contact: Katie Bethea, (865) 576-8039; betheakl@ornl.gov]

Clean water—Sunny desalination

A new method developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory improves the energy efficiency of a desalination process known as solar-thermal evaporation. Scientists fashioned tubular devices using nanoengineered graphite foam coated with carbon nanoparticles and a superhydrophobic material that increased the absorption of light energy directly from the sun. The thermal energy was used to heat seawater, producing freshwater vapor that was fed into a condenser to make potable water. The system removed more than 99.5% of salt in simulated seawater and reached 64% solar-thermal conversion efficiency. “Using this improved solar-absorbing material for interfacial water evaporation represents a more efficient use of solar energy,” said ORNL’s Gyoung Jang. The experiment is detailed in the journal Global Challenges. The method can be scaled up into modular systems to provide clean water at remote locations or to serve communities affected by hurricanes or floods.

Trump Pick to Oversee Federal Lands Doesn’t Want the Government to Have Any,http://nymag.com,['Matt Stieb'],07-31-2019,2019,7,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/trump-pick-to-oversee-federal-lands-doesnt-want-any.html,"A ridge in Bears Ears National Monument, which the Trump administration reduced by 201,876 acres. Photo: George Frey/Getty Images

With around 640 million acres in the bank, the federal government controls about 28 percent of the land in these United States, with the bulk of that lying in the West: Over half the ground in Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Alaska, and Oregon is under federal oversight. But the president’s new appointee for Bureau of Land Management, the office that oversees most of that property, isn’t too keen on the government’s role in managing land.

Earlier this week, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt made Wyoming native, attorney, and Reagan administration alum William Perry Pendley the acting director of the BLM. Since serving in the Gipper’s Energy and Interior departments, Pendley has sued Interior on behalf of an oil prospector, tried to slash protections for endangered species — including cutting laws protecting grizzly bears in national parks — and attempted to make it easier to build on federal land.

In addition to his political view on public lands — in 2016, he wrote in the National Review that “[t]he Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold” — Pendley has some personal relationships that add concerns to his nomination. The Washington Post explains:

Pendley’s legal ties, as well as his policy positions, have attracted scrutiny. Environmental groups are pressing Interior to formally recuse Pendley from any involvement in a court case in which he is still the counsel of record representing an aging businessman, Sidney Longwell and his small company Solenex.

Solenex purchased a 6,247-acre lease in northwest Montana in 1982 during the Reagan administration for about $1 an acre. Longwell wants permission to build a six-mile service road and bridge over the Two Medicine River on lands considered sacred by the Blackfeet Tribe. Interior wants to cancel the lease. He would use the road to bring in drilling rigs and other oil exploration equipment.

“The Department’s career ethics professionals are working closely with Mr. Pendley and will advise him as necessary,” an Interior official said.

Pendley has also blasted former Interior secretary Ryan Zinke for not doing enough to open up public lands to private development. In another article for the National Review published in 2017, Pendley criticized Zinke for not reducing national monuments at the rate he deemed necessary: “Instead of doing as asked [by the Trump administration], Secretary Zinke recommended decreasing the size of only four of the most blatantly illegal national monuments while leaving the boundaries of all the others standing with mollycoddle language, which will soon get stricken by environmentalists.” That Zinke reduced only two national monuments wasn’t enough: Pendley rejected that Zinke proposed to make the Badger-Two Medicine preserve in Montana a national monument, an area Solenex wanted to explore for drilling.

Earlier this week, President Trump nominated John Ratcliffe to become the new director of National Intelligence, despite Ratcliffe’s consistent doubt in the efficacy of the intelligence community’s findings on Russia. That the administration has proposed another nominee to deregulate and dismantle the department he runs should now be expected as the norm."
Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules it says are too lax,https://thehill.com,[],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455812-green-group-sues-epa-over-lax-lead-dust-rule,"Environmentalists are suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over a new rule they say doesn’t do enough to protect children from lead contamination.

A group of environmental advocates filed a joint lawsuit against EPA on Thursday challenging the agency’s finalized June Dust-Lead Hazard Standards that the group says are too lax to protect families.

The suit, filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, takes issue with the EPA’s newly revised environmental regulations that measure lead found in dust on floors, window sills and in soil typically from older dwellings.

The rule, rolled out jointly by EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules it says are too lax MORE and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules it says are too lax Ben Carson compares Baltimore's problems to having cancer MORE, is meant in particular to protect children from harmful lead exposure.

“Trump’s EPA had a chance to follow mainstream science and correctly update these standards for children’s sake,” said Eve Gartner, Earthjustice attorney. “Instead it botched the opportunity and gave families a rule that falls far short of protecting children.”

This is the second time Earthjustice is taking the EPA to task over the lead dust standards. The environmental group in 2016 previously sued the EPA to force the agency’s hand in finalizing the rule, saying the EPA at the time was delaying its rulemaking. The court in 2017 sided with the group which lead to the EPA’s finalized rule introduced this year.

“EPA has already taken eight years, wants to delay at least six more, and has disavowed any interest in working with Petitioners to develop an appropriate timeline through mediation. We are also mindful of the severe risks to children of lead-poisoning under EPA’s admittedly insufficient standards,” the court ruled in granting Earthjustice’s request.

But environmentalists are saying the EPA’s new rule still does not provide stringent enough protections for children.

“Current standards result in inspections that fail to identify homes or schools with dangerous levels of lead,” said the coalition of organizations represented by Earthjustice. “When that happens homeowners and others do not take measures to reduce lead, exposing families and children to breathing in toxic levels of lead. This is illegal and intolerable.”

The EPA did not return a request for comment."

Border Patrol tried to fire him for lying about gun incident. Now he's Trump’s DHS spokesman,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-tried-to-fire-him-for-making-stuff-up-now-he-is-the-dhs-spokesman,"The top Homeland Security spokesman, brought in to serve last month by acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, is a former Border Patrol agent whom U.S. Customs and Border Protection once attempted to fire for faking a crime against himself, according to three CBP officials with first-hand knowledge of the incident and a fourth who is also aware of it.

DHS acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Media Operations Jose “Lu” Maheda was terminated by Border Patrol a year into his service during the 1990s. Since then, as one official put it, he has “failed up,” getting his job back and eventually becoming a regional Border Patrol spokesman. And now he is the top spokesman for the 240,000-person department because of his connection to McAleenan.

“The guy’s a proven liar and can’t testify in court and yet he’s a spokesman for DHS,” charged one CBP official who worked with Maheda at the time of the incident. “He is 100% a McAleenan sycophant.”

Under the 1972 Giglio v. United States decision, a witness whose integrity has been called into question cannot testify in court.

While working at the Border Patrol station in Nogales, Arizona during his first year on the job in 1996, Maheda left his loaded gun on the front seat of his work vehicle and set out on foot.

“While he was out — and unbeknownst to him — a supervisor came across the car and saw the” firearm, the official said. “He [Maheda] had failed to secure it, and it was just laying there, and that’s when the supervisor saw it and was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve got to get this out of here.’ So the supervisor pulled the gun out. When Lu got back to the vehicle, he saw the shotgun was missing and didn’t realize the supervisor had taken it. So what he did was, he bust the window out, then went back and reported the shotgun stolen.”

A second official who worked with Maheda at the time confirmed the set of events, as did a third.

“He had a longarm go missing from his Border Patrol four-wheel drive so he busted the window out and made a notification that it was stolen, when it was in fact that an agent had just played a joke on him when he left his door unlocked,” said the third person, who also worked in Tucson at the time.

“There was no squirming out of that one. They had him dead to right,” the first official said.

Another source, a union official with secondhand knowledge of the incident, said the supervisor took the gun out of the vehicle to “safeguard” it, not as a joke. Maheda “broke the window and reported it was stolen,” he said.

While DHS does not comment on specific employee personnel actions, a DHS official provided the following information.

""Over 20 years ago, we can confirm that there was an allegation and subsequent full investigation,"" the official said. ""The employee was afforded due process and since then, the employee has had an exemplary record being promoted throughout the ranks without ill effect.""

Maheda was served termination paperwork a day after the incident. He fought the termination with the help of the National Border Patrol Council and kept his job on what the union official described as a “technicality” because he was issued a termination notice on the last day of routine year-long probation period.

The third official with first-hand knowledge of the incident said the move to provide him the termination paperwork the day after may have been intentional because it gave him a way to fight the decision, since the letter should have been served immediately.

“There were all these rumors that his brother, who was a BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit) agent that was very well thought of — that somebody may have been looking out for the family with that clerical mistake,” the official said.

At the time, Border Patrol agents in their first year could be fired for any reason without being able to appeal the decision or respond to the chief patrol agent’s concerns. A union representative at the time “argued that he was technically no longer on probation because his regular shift had ended before they fired him” and therefore the probation period was technically up, and was able to get an arbitrator to agree, according to the first CBP official. Maheda was reinstated and went to work for the union.

At a certain point in his career at DHS, Maheda began to have ""direct interface"" with McAleenan, who would eventually promote him to his current position.

The third official said Maheda was reprimanded during his work for the internal Border Patrol headquarters division during the 2000s for having “abused travel all over the country basically to install flat screen TVs.”

“He got transferred out of that branch during a bottom-up review that was done by the Border Patrol headquarters staff, led by then Operations Chief Kevin Oaks,” said this source said.

""The United States Border Patrol often conducts reviews and assessments of programs and personnel assignments. During Chief Kevin Oaks’ tenure, the United States Border Patrol restructured several programs and divisions within the Headquarters element, resulting reassignments of multiple personnel and program responsibilities,"" the DHS official said.

The first official described Maheda's promotions as ""one of those things you just keep scratching your head"" over.

“The Department is proud to include a member of the United States Border Patrol within the Department’s Office of Public Affairs,"" said Andrew Meehan, Acting Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. ""Border Patrol agents have a unique and first-hand knowledge of the impact of the crisis on the southern border and continue to provide thoughtful guidance on how to communicate those challenges to the public.”"
DOJ restricts asylum claims based on family relations,https://www.politico.com,['Ted Hesson'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/29/doj-asylum-claims-family-relations-1624028,"Attorney General William Barr said that being part of a nuclear family targeted for persecution doesn’t qualify as a “particular social group” eligible for asylum in the United States. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images immigration DOJ restricts asylum claims based on family relations

A decision issued Monday by Attorney General William Barr will restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum based on their family relations.

In a precedent-setting immigration court opinion, Barr said that simply being part of a nuclear family targeted for persecution doesn’t qualify as a “particular social group” eligible for asylum in the United States.

Story Continued Below

“The fact that a criminal group — such as a drug cartel, gang, or guerrilla force — targets a group of people does not, standing alone, transform those people into a particular social group,” the attorney general wrote.

President Donald Trump has sought to restrict access to asylum, which his administration views as a magnet that draws migrants north from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessionsissued a similar immigration court decision in June 2018 that blocked asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence, a move that drew condemnation from pro-migrant advocates. A federal judge based in Washington, D.C., blocked key parts of a policy related to the decision six months later.

Barr’s ruling will guide future decisions in the immigration courts, which are not part of the federal judiciary and fall under the purview of the Justice Department. Barr highlighted that authority in the ruling Monday, saying “the attorney general has primary responsibility for construing and applying provisions in the immigration laws.”

To receive asylum in the U.S., applicants must prove they faced persecution in their home countries based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Barr’s decision Monday will limit the ability of a familial relationship to qualify as “membership in a particular social group.“ The number of asylum seekers who could be affected each year was not immediately clear.

The attorney general issued the decision in a case that involved a deported Mexican immigrant who claimed drug cartel members had targeted him because they wanted to sell drugs in his father’s Mexico City store.

The Board of Immigration Appeals found that the man’s relationship with his father qualified as a “particular social group,” but ultimately denied the asylum request because the man could not prove he was persecuted over the relationship.

Barr found that being part of a family meets the standard for asylum only when the family is “socially distinct in the eyes of its society.”

Immigration law advocates said the decision defied the precedents of at least two federal appeals courts, which have held that targeting based on family membership can qualify an immigrant for asylum.

“The family provides ‘a prototypical example of a particular social group,’” the Richmond-based 4th Circuitwrote in 2011, quoting an earlier case from the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit.

“It's a significant declaration of power from the A.G. and one that will hopefully take a beating in court,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council said on Twitter.

The DOJ asylum move is only the latest policy change to limit asylum.

Trump announced Friday that his administration had struck a deal with Guatemala that would require asylum seekers passing through that nation to first seek protections there.

The asylum agreement came after a San Francisco-based federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump regulation that barred asylum seekers who passed through other nations en route to the southwest border.

EPA proposal scraps limits on coal plant waste,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455386-epa-proposal-scraps-limits-on-coal-plant-waste,"The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed scrapping restrictions on arsenic-laden waste from coal-fired power plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed lifting some regulations on coal ash, the residue left after burning coal, which is filled with hazardous substances that can leach into the water supply and cause health problems.

“I can say without hesitation that this is an extremely dangerous proposal that will do lasting harm to communities near coal ash reuse sites and coal ash waste piles,” said Lisa Evans, senior counsel with Earthjustice.

Coal ash is used in a variety of ways, largely as a replacement for soil. It can be used to create level ground for construction projects or sprinkled over landfills as a protective cover.

But coal ash has been deemed responsible for contaminating water with arsenic, which is linked with some types of cancer.

The latest proposal from the EPA would eliminate restrictions from 2015 that limited coal ash use to 12,400 tons per site.

The Trump administration proposal would allow projects to use as much coal ash as they want but would have to file a demonstration that shows the project won’t cause harm if it’s close to certain features like groundwater or wetlands.

But Evans said that’s not a realistic safeguard.

“That demonstration doesn’t have to be defended to any regulatory agency or be posted for public notice or be written by any engineer or environmental professional,” Evans said. “You’ve got a fairly meaningless demo having to be created.”

The EPA said the regulations would help spur “beneficial use” — the term for new uses for what would otherwise be industry waste.

“Today the Agency is proposing sensible changes that will improve the coal ash regulations and continue to encourage appropriate beneficial use,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules it says are too lax MORE said in a statement. “These proposed changes will further responsible management of coal ash while protecting human health and the environment.”

The proposal includes some features that would make reporting requirements more accessible to the public, but environmentalists ultimately see the move as a bow to industry.

“Despite compelling and damning scientific evidence highlighting the harm to groundwater from coal ash, and court victories by community groups requiring the EPA to strengthen the 2015 rule, Wheeler is giving this gift to his former employers at the cost of public health,” Earthjustice and the Sierra Club said in a statement. “It is a disgrace to everything the EPA stands for, and we will do everything in our power to stop it.”"
US Defense Department to Develop Blockchain Cybersecurity Shield,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/us-department-of-defense-is-developing-a-blockchain-cybersecurity-shield,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is looking to forge a blockchain cybersecurity shield.

In a report published on July 12 titled Digital Modernization Strategy, the DoD outlined several ways to advance the nation’s digital defenses. This includes the integration of cloud and quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and improved communications through distributed ledgers.

In fact, DARPA, the research wing of the Department is already experimenting with the technology “to create a more efficient, robust, and secure platform,” to secure messaging and process transactions, reports Decrypt.

Specifically, blockchain may be deployed between units and headquarters as well as intelligence officers and the Pentagon. As part of the Digital Identity Management program, the agency may also issue a digital token that authenticates an agent’s identity.

The DoD is also experimenting with the technology to facilitate the creation of an unhackable code to secure its databases.

As part of the second Cryptographic Modernization program, in effect since 2000, the Department is replacing old hardware and cryptographic systems to meet the challenges of the improved computing power of the nation’s adversaries.

Citing the trustless, transparent, and immutable attributes of blockchain the Department writes:

“Blockchain networks not only reduce the probability of compromise, but also impose significantly greater costs on an adversary to achieve it.”

The shift from “low value to high-value work” is also part of the DoDs’ Big Data Platform (BDP), which will handle petabytes of data involved in a number of cross-agency projects. The platform “provides the ability to perform aggregation, correlation, historical trending,” and may perform pattern recognition to “predict attacks.”

A man’s immigration case is in limbo as officials decide if he’ll receive an order of deportation. Marco Aviles Gutierrez was just 5 when he arrived in the U.S. “I grew up here when I was a kid, and I’ve never been to Mexico,” he said. Now 26, Gutierrez has a mental disability, relying on his family for help. “I got my mom here,"" he said. “I’ve got nobody in Mexico who can take care of me.”He’s supposed to be protected under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program for people who were brought to the country illegally as children. Now, there’s an issue. His attorney, Genevra Alberti, said his case was closed, but a new order from the U.S. attorney general reopened it and many others by saying judges can’t administratively close cases. “This case really illustrates how messed up things are right now,” Alberti said. “Now we’re stuck in this position of what do we do with this case?” Alberti said they’ve been told since judges can’t close the case, the best option is accepting a deportation order from the Department of Homeland Security but not worrying about it since Gutierrez would be protected by DACA.“There’s no sense in having this order sitting there making his life miserable, wondering what’s going to happen,” Alberti said. “I think it’s not fair,” Gutierrez said. “I might not see my family no more.”For Alberti, it’s an example of quick policy changes creating issues for both the government and immigrants.“It’s insanity is really the best way to put it because literally on a daily basis, something else seems to happen,” she said. “He may ultimately have to return to a country that he does not know.” Gutierrez and Alberti expect to learn more in a late October court hearing. Gutierrez is taking life skills classes now and has hopes of one day attending the University of Missouri - Kansas City."

DOJ is investigating former interior secretary over use of private email,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Cliff Owen'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-is-investigating-former-interior-secretary-over-use-of-a-private-email,"Resigning as secretary of the interior didn't put an end to Ryan Zinke's legal troubles.

The Department of Justice is investigating Zinke over his use of private email to conduct official business, according to a Tuesday letter from Interior Department Inspector General Gail Ennis to Reps. Raúl Grijalva and Elijah Cummings. Grijalva is the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, while Cummings is chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee.

The letter was written to both representatives in response to their request to investigate Zinke’s use of private email. In the letter, Ennis announced that the request to investigate the emails had been granted, and would be conducted as a joint investigation between the Interior and Justice departments. The letter said that the request was granted as part of a ""related criminal investigation"" and combined the investigations in order to “avoid any interference.”

The larger investigation referenced is believed to be focused on a real estate deal in Zinke’s home state of Montana. The deal involved a foundation Zinke once ran as well as a development group supported by David Lesar, the chairman of the oil company Halliburton. If the investigation finds that Zinke used his personal office to influence and benefit from the deal, he could face up to five years in prison and a fine of $50,000.

Grijalva welcomed the news of the investigation. “Leaving office half a step ahead of the law doesn’t wipe the slate clean,” Grijalva said in a statement Tuesday. “It’s imperative that political appointees at the Department of Justice allow this investigation to continue unimpeded regardless of the risk to Mr. Zinke or other Trump officials.”

Zinke resigned in December amid rumors of the investigations into his emails and conduct. The release of the letter not only confirms previous reporting claiming that Zinke was under investigation from his own department, but also is the first confirmation that the Justice Department is involved.

Zinke and President Trump have yet to comment on the investigation."
U.S. Department of Education wants to stop ‘student aid fraud scheme’ where parents give up custody through dubious guardianships,https://chicago.suntimes.com,['Jul'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/7/30/20747979/department-education-stop-student-aid-fraud-scheme-parents-give-up-custody-guardianships,"Federal and state officials say they want to close loopholes that allow families to get need-based financial aid they would not otherwise receive by giving up guardianship of their college-bound children.

The move, they say, could end “potential student aid fraud” when parents turn over guardianship of their children in hopes of obtaining a tuition break.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General said the office has recommended modifying the language on federal financial aid forms following disclosure of the tactic, first reported by ProPublica Illinois on Monday. The Wall Street Journal also published a story late Monday about the issue.

“What we can tell you is that we are aware of this issue and suggested to the Federal Student Aid office (FSA) that it add clarifying language to the FSA Handbook that would help close possible avenues for this type of potential student aid fraud,” the inspector general’s spokeswoman said in a statement.

The new language would aim to ensure students involved in this kind of guardianship no longer qualify for aid if they continue to receive medical and financial support from their parents.

The Inspector General’s Office was not aware of any prosecutions to date involving “this specific type of student aid fraud scheme,” the spokeswoman added.

Officials with the Illinois attorney general’s office said Tuesday they also “have concerns” about the practice and will contact the state agency that administers a need-based grant “as we look into the matter further.”

State lawmakers also called for reforms.

ProPublica Illinois reported that dozens of suburban Chicago families, and perhaps many more, have given up legal guardianship of their teenage children to qualify for federal, state and university aid.

The parents — including lawyers, educators and a doctor — turn guardianship of their children over to relatives or friends sometimes months before they turn 18. By doing so, the children can then declare themselves financially independent and qualify for aid they would not otherwise receive.

Andy Borst, director of undergraduate admissions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said he is glad the practice has been exposed. The university first alerted the Department of Education to these cases in July 2018.

“I’m pleased that this issue has been brought to light and is being discussed widely,” Borst said. “I am hopeful that additional action can be taken to close this loophole.”

While ProPublica Illinois identified close to four dozen families in the northern suburbs of Lake County alone that filed similar petitions for guardianship, the practice appears to be more widespread. An attorney who has filed petitions in Lake County said she has also filed similar cases in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Will and McHenry counties.

ProPublica Illinois is continuing to investigate.

Illinois lawmakers on Tuesday also called for an examination of any state laws or rules that allow wealthy families to take advantage of the Illinois Monetary Award Program, or MAP, grant. Some 82,000 students were eligible for the grant last year but did not receive it because there wasn’t enough money. The grant, up to about $5,000, is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.

“It looks like theft from taxpayers and theft from students and families who legitimately deserve need-based financial aid,” said state Sen. Pat McGuire, D-Joliet, who chairs the Senate higher education committee.

McGuire said he plans to contact Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office, the Illinois attorney general’s office and the Illinois Student Assistance Commission, which administers the MAP grant, to look for ways to close any loopholes.

If that doesn’t work, he said, he will consider filing new legislation.

“It’s especially galling because the legitimate need for MAP is proven by the fact that not everyone who applies for it gets it,” McGuire said. “And even those who get it, in many cases, still are required to take out loans and work more hours per week than is advised to afford college.”

State Sen. Cristina Castro, D-Elgin, said she shared McGuire’s concerns.

“It is particularly troubling,” she said. “You think of how we’ve increased MAP funds, but we always run out.”

Castro said she was disappointed to read that one of the parents identified by ProPublica Illinois who had given up guardianship of her teenager was an assistant schools superintendent.

“That was mind-boggling,” she said. “Those are people who should and are able most of the time to pay for that education. And that’s troubling that they would go to great lengths not to.”

The students involved in these cases have gone on to be accepted at public universities and private colleges across the Midwest and as far away as California, according to their social media accounts and student newspapers.

A spokesman for the University of Missouri on Tuesday said officials have decided to pull university-based financial aid if they are able to confirm the student “misrepresented their financial situation for the sole reason to get need-based aid when they otherwise would not be eligible.”

The university’s financial aid office continues to investigate.

So far, the spokesman said, it has found “an extremely small number” of cases.

Trump EPA yanks Obama-era proposal to restrict mine development in salmon-rich Bristol Bay region,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/trump-administration-scuttles-epa-proposal-to-restrict-alaska-mine-development-in-bristol-bay-region/,"The Environmental Protection Agency scuttled proposed development restrictions Tuesday on an open-pit mine in the headwaters of Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, which sustains the largest sockeye salmon runs in the world.

The move by Chris Hladick, the EPA’s Seattle-based regional administrator, is part of a broader Trump administration push to proceed with a permitting review for the Pebble Mine, a world-class deposit of gold, molybdenum and copper that — due to its sensitive location — is among the most contested mineral-development projects in Alaska history.

The proposed restrictions date to the Obama administration, and would have sharply limited the amount of wetlands and salmon streams that could have been damaged by disposal of mine wastes. The developer’s CEO — Tom Collier of Pebble Partnership — hailed the EPA action Tuesday as removing a “cloud of uncertainty” by reversing “outrageous federal government overreach.”

“The restrictions would have precluded any meaningful mineral development in the region — period,” said Collier, who credited Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy with encouraging the EPA to abandon the proposal.

The Army Corps of Engineers is now undertaking a permitting review scheduled to be completed next year. State permitting would take another few years, which could enable the mine to begin producing ore by 2026, according to Collier.

The EPA action brought a bitter response from a wide-ranging coalition of passionate opponents that includes commercial fishermen from Washington and elsewhere that join in the summer sockeye harvests, sport anglers, seafood processors, recreation companies, Native groups and environmentalists.

“This comes as we are wrapping up the second largest-recorded salmon harvest in Bristol Bay of 42 million salmon and counting, to feed not only our people but the world. Our people will continue to do whatever it takes to stop this mine,” said Alannah Hurley, executive director of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay.

Pebble was first proposed more than a decade ago, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, a longtime critic of the mine, on Tuesday accused the EPA of a “reckless action” that would threaten the Bristol Bay watershed and the fisheries and maritime economy it supports.

During the Obama administration, the EPA undertook a major review of the mine’s environmental impacts in response to a 2011 request from six Bristol Bay tribes. In 2014, the Seattle regional office used the authority vested by the Clean Water Act to propose tight restrictions that included a cap of 1,100 acres of wetlands, lakes and ponds that could be lost to development and the loss of no more than 5 miles of streams used by salmon or other seagoing fish.

“In simple terms, the infrastructure necessary to mine the Pebble deposit jeopardizes the long-term health and sustainability of the Bristol Bay ecosystem,” said the 2014 document released by the EPA’s Seattle regional office.

Northern Dynasty, the Canadian company that owns Pebble Partnership, contested the EPA’s 2014 finding in a lawsuit settled during the first year of the Trump administration, and allowed the project to proceed with federal permitting. The EPA action Tuesday rescinds the 2014 findings, which Dennis McLerran, who served as the agency’s Seattle-based regional administrator during the Obama administration, said were based on the best available science.

“What is happening now is the decision-making process is being politicized and removed from the science,” McLerran said in a Tuesday interview.

The permits likely will face legal challenges.

“I think litigation is inevitable,” said Taryn Kiekow Heimer, a senior advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposes the Pebble Mine."
