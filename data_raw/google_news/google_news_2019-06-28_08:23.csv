"Biden grilled by Harris on race record at chaotic Dem debate, as Bernie’s ‘socialist’ agenda challenged",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-candidates-pile-on-trump-in-second-debate-night,"Democratic presidential primary front-runner Joe Biden ran into a formidable challenge at Thursday night’s debate from Sen. Kamala Harris, who tapped into her prosecutor toolbox to put his race record on trial following controversy over his comments on segregationist senators.

While the other top-polling candidate on stage in Miami, Bernie Sanders, avoided any direct clash with the former vice president, the California senator made a point of confronting Biden on the issue that has rattled his otherwise high-flying campaign.

SWALWELL ZINGS BIDEN ON AGE AT DEBATE

In perhaps the most heated moment of the night, Harris told Biden she doesn’t believe he is a “racist” but considers his recent comments about being able to work with segregationist senators early in his career “hurtful.” (Biden has said he disagreed with the senators on segregation, but was still able to work with them in the Senate).

“You worked with them to oppose busing,” Harris then said, referring to efforts to limit orders for school desegregation by busing. In an emotional moment, she told her own story of being bussed as a little girl in California.

Biden fired back that Harris’ comments were a “mischaracterization of my position across the board,” saying he never praised racists, while denying that he opposed busing. He insisted he opposed busing ordered by the Department of Education, as opposed to localities making their own decisions.

Adamantly defending his record on race and civil rights, he also swiped at Harris by noting he became a public defender -- not a prosecutor, as she was.

CANDIDATES VOW TO COVER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN HEALTH CARE PLANS

The clash amounted to one of several moments where Harris grabbed attention, including when she scolded her rivals after they were shouting over one another in an earlier skirmish. “America does not want to witness a food fight,” Harris said. “They want to know how they’re going to put food on their table.”

With 10 candidates on stage, just like the previous night's showdown in Miami, the moderators frequently had to step in as well to stop them from talking over one another.

Biden, though, for the most part kept his focus on the candidate he really wants to face -- President Trump -- while repeatedly invoking the name and record of his popular running-mate Barack Obama and brushing back swipes at his age from long-shot candidate Rep. Eric Swalwell, who repeatedly called on him to ""pass the torch.""

""I'm still holding onto that torch,"" Biden said with a grin.

It's unclear whether the clash with Harris might damage Biden, considering most prior controversies have not dinged his poll numbers -- or simply give her some needed momentum in a race where fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren, on stage the night before, has been climbing.

Sanders, for his part, spent much of the NBC-hosted debate defending his big-government agenda against questions from moderators and criticism from more centrist – and lower-polling – candidates.

Early in the debate, Sanders dismissed a moderator's contention that nominating a democratic socialist could re-elect Trump, pointing to polls showing him ahead of the president in head-to-head matchups.

“The American people understand that Trump is a phony,” Sanders said. “Trump is a pathological liar and a racist and that he lied to the American people during his campaign. He said he was going to stand up for working families.”

But several rivals took issue with some of Sanders’ socialistic policies, like ""Medicare-for-all"" and free college tuition.

Former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado took issue with his rivals embracing socialism, saying it’s not good politics.

“I think that the bottom line is if we don't clearly define we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way we can and call us socialists,” Hickenlooper said.

Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet challenged Medicare-for-all, saying the public should be able to have a choice on health care, public option or otherwise.

And South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg broke with Sanders in saying while he supports free college for children of low and middle income, “I just don’t believe it makes sense to ask working-class families to subsidize even the children of billionaires.”

Harris was also pressed on how Democrats will pay for the massive programs they are proposing, but tried to turn the tables on Trump instead.

“I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top one percent and the biggest cover corporations contributing to the debt of America which middle-class families will pay for one way or another,” Harris asked.

California Rep. Swalwell was the first to go on offense against Biden, recalling a speech Biden gave years ago saying it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation.

“Joe Biden was right when he said that 32 years ago. He is still right today. If we are going to solve the issue, pass the torch,” Swalwell said.

The debate also made clear how Democrats have moved to the left on issues relating to immigration.

""One of the worst things about President Trump that he's done to this country is he's torn apart the moral fabric of who we are,"" said New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.

All 10 Democrats raised their hands when asked if their government health care plan would cover illegal immigrants.

“That’s the end of that race!” Trump tweeted as he panned their response.

""All of the Democrats tripped over each other in a race to see who could stand out as the most leftist candidate, threatening government control of every aspect of people’s lives,"" his campaign said in a statement.

At another point, most candidates raised their hands when asked if they support decriminalizing crossing the border without authorization – a vibrant topic in the debate the night before. Candidates also said they did not think someone whose only offense is coming to the United States illegally should be deported.

“Let's remember that's not just a theoretical exercise, that criminalization is the basis for family separation,” Buttigieg said.

Biden said he didn’t want to see immigrants deported whose only offense is coming to America without documents.

“That person should not be the focus of deportation,” Biden said. “We should change the way we deal with things.”

Buttigieg – who has struggled to attract black voters – entered the debate having to answer questions about the racial unrest back home in South Bend, as the city deals with a deadly police-involved shooting.

“I'm not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back,” he said. “The officer didn't have his body camera on. It's a mess. We are hurting.”

The debate stage included two non-politicians with national followings – entrepreneur Andrew Yang and writer Marianne Williamson.

“The right candidate will be solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected,” Yang said. “I am that candidate, I can build a much broader coalition to beat Donald Trump.

“Mr. President if you're listening, I want you to hear me, please,"" Williamson said. ""You've harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out.""

It was the second of two NBC sponsored debates this week, the first being Wednesday night. The network split up 20 of the Democratic candidates over the two nights.

The Wednesday night debate reflected how the party has moved to the left on issues of immigration, taxes and abortion. The candidates who debated Wednesday were: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Trump slams Dems for backing health care for undocumented immigrants,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/27/trump-slams-dems-for-backing-health-care-for-undocumented-immigrants/,"President Trump blasted the contestants in the second Democratic presidential debate on Thursday when they all declared their support for health care coverage for undocumented immigrants.

All of the candidates — including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg — raised their hands when asked by an NBC moderator if they would support a health care plan that would cover undocumented immigrants.

“All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare,” Trump wrote on Twitter from Japan, where he is to attend the G20 Summit.

“How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That’s the end of that race!”

Trump stayed largely quiet during the first Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday night, sending just two tweets during the event.

In his first tweet Wednesday, Trump yawned at the content.

“BORING!” Trump wrote during the first contest on Wednesday, which featured Democratic hopefuls Mayor Bill de Blasio, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Beto O’Rourke.

Later, as he met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump again admitted that he had sneaked a peek at the television.

“Unfortunately, they didn’t discuss what they’re giving to American citizens,” he said of the Dems. “That’s not a good thing.”

He then explained to the chancellor, “You know they have a debate going on . . . They definitely have plenty of candidates, that’s about it. So I look forward to spending time with you rather than watching.”"

""None of them were competitive enough... If you can put Donald Trump on the stage next to any of these people in a one-on-one he'd eat their lunch.""

Tillerson Says Kushner Bypassed Him and Mattis to Make Foreign Policy,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Edward Wong', 'Sharon Lafraniere']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/rex-tillerson-trump.html,"Mr. Tillerson said he did.

A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said Thursday night that “Jared consistently follows proper protocols” with the National Security Council and State Department. He said the “alleged ‘dinner’ to supposedly discuss the blockade never happened,” and no one in the White House was “involved in the blockade.” (A transcript of the interview with Mr. Tillerson described the Riyadh meeting as a dinner.) He added that Mr. Kushner’s work with Mexico had led to positive results on trade and other issues.

The New York Times and several other news organizations obtained a copy of the committee’s interview transcript before its release on Thursday afternoon. Parts had been redacted at the request of Mr. Tillerson and the State Department.

Mr. Tillerson became secretary of state in February 2017, after being asked to meet with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and two other aides, Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus, in Trump Tower. But Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Trump subsequently clashed over policy, the president’s management style and his intellectual capacity — Mr. Tillerson is said to have once called Mr. Trump a “moron” to other officials — before Mr. Tillerson was fired in March 2018.

Mr. Tillerson also alienated State Department officials and career employees because he tried to cut the budget, left important posts open and, in their eyes, remained aloof — all of which he was asked about in the committee interview.

The most telling anecdotes show Mr. Kushner and, to a degree, Mr. Bannon, making foreign policy in the shadows.

Mr. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said that in the weeks leading up to a presidential summit in Riyadh in May 2017, Saudi officials did not give him any indication of their deepening political disputes with Qatar and their aim to join with the Emiratis and other Arab nations to impose a blockade.

One night around May 20, Saudi and Emirati leaders met with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bannon over dinner and told the Americans of their plans for the blockade, a Democratic counsel said during the committee interview. Mr. Tillerson said he had not heard of the dinner until the committee interview."

(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)

In newly disclosed testimony, former secretary of state Rex Tillerson said President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, operated independently with powerful leaders around the world without coordination with the State Department, leaving Tillerson out of the loop and in the dark on emerging U.S. policies and simmering geopolitical crises.

In a transcript of his testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Tillerson also described the challenge of briefing a president who does not read briefing papers and often got distracted by peripheral topics, noting he had to keep his message short and focus on a single topic.

“I learned to be much more concise with what I wanted to bring in front of him,” Tillerson told the House panel during a seven-hour session in May.

He stood by his previous characterization that Trump does not dive deep into details and said he learned not to give the president articles or long memos. “That’s just not what he was going to do,” he said.

The Washington Post and other news outlets received an advance copy of the redacted transcript before it was published by the committee Thursday.

On several occasions, Tillerson said he was blindsided by Kushner’s discussions with world leaders.

In one instance, Tillerson said he learned that Kushner was meeting with Mexico’s foreign secretary, Luis Videgaray, because he happened to be in the same Washington restaurant while the two men hashed out a “fairly comprehensive plan of action” that Tillerson didn’t know about.

“The owner of the restaurant . . . came around and said, “Oh, Mr. Secretary, you might be interested to know the foreign secretary of Mexico is seated at a table near the back in case you want to go by and say hello to him,” Tillerson said. “And so I did.”

Tillerson said he saw the “color go out of the face” of the foreign secretary as he walked into the room. “I said: Welcome to Washington. . . . Give me a call next time you’re coming to town.”

[Read: Tillerson’s testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee]

In another instance, Tillerson explained in detail being stunned by the 2017 Persian Gulf crisis in which key Arab allies severed ties with Qatar, another key U.S. ally. He said he was in Australia at the time with then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and both were caught off guard.

“I was surprised,” he said.

He also said he was not aware of meetings that had been occurring between Arab leaders and Kushner, including a private huddle May 20, 2017, between Kushner, Trump’s then-adviser Stephen K. Bannon and the rulers of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. During the meeting, Arab leaders discussed their intention to impose a blockade on Qatar, though the White House later denied prior knowledge of the June 5 closure.

“What’s your reaction to a meeting of that sort having taken place without your knowledge?” Tillerson was asked by committee staff.

“It makes me angry,” Tillerson said. “Because I didn’t have a say. The State Department’s views were never expressed.”

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said that such a gathering to “discuss the blockade never happened, and neither Jared, nor anyone in the White House, was involved in the blockade.”

“The White House operated under the belief the secretary of state at the time, Mr. Tillerson, would and should know what his own team was working on,” Gidley added.

Gidley also credited Kushner’s diplomacy with the Mexican government, saying it “ultimately led” to the negotiation of a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, though the agreement also involved other senior U.S. officials and still needs to be approved by Congress.

“Jared consistently follows proper protocols with NSC and the State Department, and this instance is no different,” Gidley said.

Tillerson said he asked Kushner to stop making trips overseas without consulting with the embassy or the State Department.

“On occasion the president’s senior adviser would make trips abroad and . . . was in charge of his own agenda,” he said.

When he raised the issue, Kushner said he “would try to do better,” Tillerson recalled. But “not much changed,” the former secretary of state said, making it difficult because everyone was not working from the “same playbook.”

Tillerson declined to answer questions about whether he expressed the sentiment that the president was a “moron,” as publicly reported.

“We really should move on,” Tillerson attorney Reg Brown said when asked about the report. Asked again, Brown said, “We’re ready to move on.”

Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil chief executive who tried but failed to change a number of processes at the State Department, said he was startled that many career diplomats had no idea what their authority was — or what they were supposed to be doing.

“I thought: This is nuts. I mean, this is crazy. You couldn’t run a corner gas station that way,” he said.

Tillerson also spoke about a two-hour meeting he had with Russian President Vladimir Putin about bilateral challenges, including election interference. Tillerson told Putin that Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election created “huge challenges for us here in Washington” in improving U.S. relations with Russia.

Tillerson said no one from the White House gave him any guidance on how to handle the topic — nor did they talk about it with him after the meeting.

He said Putin denied any Russian interference, a response Tillerson didn’t believe.

“I wasn’t expecting mea culpas. I wasn’t expecting him to prostrate himself and say, you got me. But it was important,” he said.

“I’ve known this guy a long time; I’ve dealt with him a long time; and one thing I know he respects is people speaking the truth to him,” he said. “Whether he acknowledges that truth or not, that’s his choice, but he respects people who speak the truth to him and that they stick with it. That’s what he respects.”

During Tillerson’s tenure, the number of State Department press briefings was sharply curtailed, and fewer reporters were allowed to travel with him on his plane, a point of contention that continues under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Tillerson said it was his decision to reduce access to the news media at the agency.

“No,” he responded, when asked whether the White House had any role or reaction to it.

Tillerson, who struggled to fill senior positions in the department, said he was frustrated that he could not pick his top people, and that he was hampered by White House rules prohibiting nominees from taking positions if they had tweeted something negative about the president or signed a “Never Trump” letter. “It never did work smoothly,” he said.

“And that spread pretty widely within town. People began to understand that. And the unfortunate effect of that is a lot of people then contacted me and said: ‘Hey . . . you can take my name off the list of consideration.’ It discouraged them from being considered,” he said.

Roger Stone’s lawyers punch back at DOJ over charges of violating gag order,https://www.politico.com,['Darren Samuelsohn'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/27/roger-stone-lawyer-gag-order-1386122,"Former Trump adviser Roger Stone's lawyers argued he was within his First Amendment rights with his social media activity. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images legal Roger Stone’s lawyers punch back at DOJ over charges of violating gag order

Roger Stone’s lawyers swung back Thursday at federal prosecutors accusing the longtime Donald Trump adviser of violating a court-imposed gag order that could send him to jail.

In an 11-page reply, Stone’s attorneys argued their client was well within his First Amendment rights when he recently posted several times on social media his criticism of the press coverage surrounding his case.

Story Continued Below

A federal judge in Washington D.C. ordered Stone in February to cease commenting about the charges he’s fighting — which center around allegedly making false statements to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering — so as to not destroy the possibility of a fair trial in his case later this fall.

But the U.S. attorney’s office that took over the prosecution originally brought by former special counsel Robert Mueller last week flagged several Stone Instagram posts, including some questioning why the press wasn’t paying more attention to his lawyers' recent legal filings.

Responding on Thursday, Stone’s lawyers argue that he has indeed respected the court’s order and that the posts in dispute “are not ‘statements’, nor do they pose a danger to the fair trial concern which was (and is) the constitutional raison d’etre of the Order.”

Stone’s lawyers questioned the government’s focus on three specific social media posts, which they say “exhibits a willful blindness to the tens of thousands of hostile-to-Stone articles which have been authored by others about the ‘investigation’ and Stone’s ‘case;’ articles, animated cartoons, comments, editorials, television and radio programs, panels, celebrity ‘dark comedy’ readings of the Special Counsel Report, and even a comedic portrayal of Roger Stone by Steve Martin on Saturday Night Live which satirically portrayed Stone as a caricature of himself.” The SNL skit has tallied more than 4.4 million views on YouTube, the attorneys noted.

“The ‘prejudice’ to be concerned about is prejudice against Stone; his lonely voice presents no threat to a fair trial under this Court’s supervision. Of more concern should be the Washington Post’s unrelenting coverage of Roger Stone,” his lawyers argued.

The Stone lawyers’ combative response to the alleged gag order violations marks a far different tone than the one the defense took the last time Stone found himself in trouble on the same issue. In February, Judge Amy Berman Jackson restricted Stone’s public speech after he posted a photo of her on social media with what looked like gun-sight crosshairs.

During a hearing on the matter where he also faced the prospect of jail time, Stone apologized for the post. ""I let you down,” he told Jackson. “I let myself down. I let my family down. I let my attorneys down. I can only say I'm sorry. It was a momentary lapse in judgment. Perhaps I talk too much.""

Jackson ended that hearing by expanding the gag order on Stone — originally, he was allowed to discuss his case, so long as it wasn’t in the immediate vicinity of the Washington D.C. courthouse where he’ll go on trial Nov. 5 — to cover all speech about the case. The judge, an appointee of President Barack Obama, also gave him an ultimatum. ""No, Mr. Stone, I'm not giving you another chance,"" she said. ""I have serious doubts about whether you've learned any lesson at all. It is my job to make sure this trial does not devolve into a circus.""

The latest posts to potentially land Stone in trouble center around messages asking why several major news organizations didn't cover a recent filing his lawyers made arguing that the government did not independently verify that Russian operatives hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Stone posted several more articles touting his attorneys' work, tagging one, ""Funny, No @nytimes or @washingtonpost coverage of this development.""

Prosecutors have since filed a separate document refuting Stone's claims that the government didn't independently confirm that Russia was behind the DNC hack.

The government has also flagged a Stone comment, written on Instagram, about a May report in POLITICO describing Jackson's order to see an unredacted version of any still-secret portions of the Mueller report related to his case.

""The Judge has ruled but @Politico gets most of the story wrong because they are biased elitist snot-nosed fake news shitheads who's [sic] specialty is distortion by omitting key facts to create a false narrative. #rogerstonedidnothingwrong #rogerstone #fakenews,"" Stone's post said.

The Stone reply on Thursday argued that the at-issue posts only included headlines from other media backing up his arguments, but he never posted a link to the actual story. They explained that a Stone post from April that the government flagged to Jackson — drawing attention to a CNN story about the FBI refusing a public records request for emails to CNN — only raises a “rhetorical question.” And his post about the POLITICO story is simply criticism of that media outlet.

“The government’s offer of this posting reveals the government’s desire to tarnish Stone, not to try him here on the facts,” his attorneys wrote. “Stone’s language may be indecorous at times, but that does not obscure the content’s non-culpability under the Order. Criticism of the media is not a violation of the Order.”

More broadly, Stone’s attorneys argue that their client “is the most minor of participants” who generates far less media attention to his case compared with Mueller himself, Attorney General William Barr or many others pulled into the wider Russia probe.

“The 2,402 ‘likes’ of the June 18- 19 Stone postings are but a speck compared to the torrent of publicity, commentary and commotion generated by persons, publications and politicians over which, and over whom, Stone has no control,” his attorneys wrote. “Even witnesses who will be called to testify in this case are contributing to the cacophony.”

Here, the Stone attorneys cited Randy Credico, a New York-based political satirist and radio host whose contacts with WikiLeaks’ founder Julian Assange make him a central figure in the Stone case. Credico, named in the Stone indictment as one of the witnesses he attempted to intimidate, has said he’s received a subpoena to appear at the upcoming Stone trial.

Despite the defense’s unapologetic tone and the insistence that none of the Instagram posts ran afoul of Jackson’s gag order, the new filing indicates Stone has deleted the post attacking POLITICO as well as two of the other seven posts to which the government recently objected. No explanation was given for the deletions.

Jackson has yet to signal what her next steps will be — including possibly holding a public hearing — on the Stone gag order issue. In an order last Friday, she gave Stone’s attorneys until Thursday to file any response in writing “why the Court should not find that the defendant has violated the Court's order dated February 21, 2019 and his conditions of release.”

Trump directs Defense Department to develop policy allowing military academy athletes to turn pro upon graduation,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-military-athletes-policy-defense,"President Trump on Wednesday told Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to come up with a policy that would allow athletes enrolled in military academies to play professional sports upon graduation.

The policy would be a rollback from what the Trump administration enacted in 2017, according to The Hill.

NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS LONG SNAPPER PROMOTED TO NAVY LIEUTENANT

“Highly talented cadets and midshipmen who receive the extraordinary benefits of an education from an Academy or through a ROTC program at taxpayer expense should be able to both take advantage of the short window of time during which playing professional sports is realistically possible, while also honoring the commitment they have made to our Armed Forces and our country,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

Trump signed a presidential memo to give Esper 120 days to come up with the policy.

“This will involve consulting with the civilian and uniformed leadership of the Military Departments,” a separate White House statement added.

Trump expressed interest in changing the policy earlier this year when he was awarding the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy to West Point after they defeated the Naval Academy in last season’s matchup.

Naval Academy pitcher Noah Song stands to benefit from the policy immediately. He was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the fourth round of the MLB Draft earlier this month.

“I hate to speculate on what people are thinking because that’s their job and they know what they’re doing,” Navy coach Paul Kostacopoulos told MLB.com. “But I do think there was some consideration that had to have been taken, considering that he does have a service commitment.”

TRUMP PRAISES FORMER NFL MVP, SAYS HE'S GOING TO READ HIS BOOK ON TRIP TO JAPAN

New England Patriots long snapper Joe Cardona benefited from the policy in 2015, allowing him to turn pro upon graduation. He has won two Super Bowls and was recently promoted by the U.S. Navy from lieutenant junior grade to lieutenant on the 75th anniversary of D-Day.

"VA ordered fake appointments to cut waiting list, whistleblower says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues', 'June At Am']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whistleblower-says-va-ordered-fake-appointments-to-cut-waiting-list/2019/06/26/97e50648-9856-11e9-a027-c571fd3d394d_story.html,"Columnist

One day before Minu Aghevli testified at a House committee hearing about official Department of Veterans Affairs misconduct, she received a thick packet of documents that shook her life.

It amounted to a pink slip more than 170 pages long, including about 140 pages outlining reasons VA plans to fire her, according to Kevin Owen, her lawyer. The packet arrived on Monday. She testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli, 42, is a District native who has spent her entire 20-year career with VA. She is a clinical psychologist with a department opioid treatment program in Baltimore.

But the moniker that matters now for her is VA whistleblower. Aghevli has made disclosures that she said led department officials to dismiss her, despite her Gold VA Pins for excellent customer service.

Aghevli’s allegations are serious. They include phony-wait-list assertions of the type that have bedeviled VA since it was consumed by a scandal that broke in 2014. She also accused department officials of lying to Congress.

“In order to reduce the wait list, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic wait list by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,” she told the House Veterans’ Affairs subcommittee on oversight and investigations. “This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits. . . . The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.” Aghevli said she protested and did not do as instructed.

Other actions to seemingly reduce the number of veterans awaiting care, she said, included coding indigent patients as “care no longer needed” without confirming that.

When lawmakers demanded information about VA wait lists in September 2015, she said, “the VA deliberately sent these incorrect numbers to Congress.”

A VA statement said Aghevli’s proposed firing “is in no way related to any whistleblower activity. Rather, it is due to a number of serious clinical practice allegations against the employee.”

The Office of Special Counsel has moved to block Aghevli’ s firing while it reviews her case. This special counsel protects federal whistleblowers and is not related a better-known special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who led a probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections.

Aghevli is not alone in making recent allegations about VA misconduct. At the House Veterans’ Affairs oversight and investigations subcommittee hearing, Chairman Chris Pappas (D-N.H.) said the panel is investigating secret-wait-list charges made in a Federal Insider column last month by Jereme Whiteman, VA’s national director of clinic practice management.

Only whistleblowers and their advocates testified at the hearing. Pappas said VA officials would be invited to a later session.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie in a letter to the panel expressed disappointment that officials were not included this week. “When the committee holds a hearing to air criticisms of the Department, while simultaneously preventing the Department from participating to offer context and defend itself,” he wrote, “the Committee’s efforts risk appearing more like a political news conference than a hearing aimed at a balanced look at serious issues.”

Jeffery Dettbarn, an Iowa City VA Medical Center employee, said he had an “unblemished record before blowing the whistle on the improper mass cancellation of what turned out to be tens of thousands of radiology orders.”

The retaliation against him, he said, is a “banishment” from patient care as a radiologic technologist that began in July 2017 and continues. “My current situation is unbearable. . . . I am forced to forgo about one-third of my salary” because he no longer gets on-call pay. “But worst of all,” he added, “the VA won’t let me care for veterans.”

Dettbarn said VA has attempted to fire him and also filed “bogus complaints to my licensing agencies. . . . All these allegations were unfounded, but these attacks are incredibly damaging and threaten my professional livelihood.”

VA said complaints about his clinical performance were raised by other VA whistleblowers and the decision regarding his disciplinary action was made before his disclosures.

Charges such as these led Tom Devine, legal director of the advocacy group Government Accountability Project, to tell the panel that VA “remains a free-speech Death Valley for government witnesses. . . . Retaliation is ingrained in the culture” of the department. Forty percent of the 25 whistleblowers he represents are VA clients, he said, “an extraordinary number for an agency that comprises less than 20 percent of the executive branch workforce.”

A department statement said “there is no other agency in the federal government that puts more of a focus on the importance of protecting whistleblowers.”

Aghevli said the retaliation against her caused episodes of severe panic and prolonged tachycardia, an abnormally rapid heart rate. She is on medical leave. Testifying for the first time before Congress was nerve-racking. “I felt both horrified and heartbroken, but also relieved,” she said, to have told her story.

Getting a notice of proposed termination the day before her testimony, when she told her office about it weeks before, was “deliberately intimidating towards me,” she said in an interview, and an effort to frighten other whistleblowers.

Aghevli said she was removed from patient care in April, a few weeks after her complaint about a patient safety issue. She is eager to return to “my veterans.”

“I love my job and the veterans that I treat,” she told the subcommittee. “I can’t imagine any job I’d rather do.”

She might have to start thinking about that. VA doesn’t want her anymore.

The Census Case Shows Why We Need a Defender General,https://slate.com,['Matthew R.

It’s been a rough couple of weeks for Department of Justice lawyers representing the Trump administration. Last week, career DOJ attorney Sarah Fabian came under intense criticism for an argument in which she equivocated when federal appellate judges asked her whether it would be “safe and sanitary” for the government to deny detained migrant children access to toothbrushes, soap, and blankets. And on Thursday, citing evidence that the Trump administration “contrived” its explanations to courts, the Supreme Court largely upheld a district court’s decision to block a citizenship question on the 2020 census. This opinion is a powerful, though tacit, rebuke of the DOJ attorneys who failed to acknowledge that their clients’ proffered rationale for adding the citizenship question—enforcing the Voting Rights Act—was pretextual. Essentially, the government lied about why it was taking a certain action in the census case, and the government’s attorneys failed to acknowledge those lies to the Supreme Court. This is not what our country’s top government lawyers should be doing.

I’ve litigated against Fabian and respect her public service, so I share the dismay that so many have expressed about her “safe and sanitary” argument. But the crucial lesson of the DOJ’s recent actions isn’t that we should be disappointed in a particular DOJ lawyer, or even Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who argued the government’s position in the census case. It’s that DOJ lawyers aren’t going to save us. As the census case shows, there are serious and ongoing institutional problems with the DOJ’s defense of Trump administration policies. These problems demand an institutional solution—one that will empower government lawyers to stand up for what’s right.

Part of the solution should be to create a new legal office—a defender general—to represent the interests of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, and to push back against faulty legal arguments by government attorneys that advance the president’s political interests.

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Let’s start with the DOJ. It has spent two-plus years utterly failing to serve as a bulwark against the Trump administration’s wanton cruelty. Sadly, we now know that, no matter what cruel policies Trump undertakes, skilled lawyers will not only take prestigious political jobs like solicitor general and attorney general, but use those jobs to paper over the Trump administration’s discriminatory intent.

For example, although in theory the solicitor general’s office has a practice of “confessing error” when it believes the government should lose a case, Francisco has not seen fit to concede the illegality of any Trump administration policy. Not the Muslim ban. Not the ban on transgender service personnel. Not family separation (where an appeal has been held in abeyance following a district court ruling against the practice). And not the citizenship question, even when confronted with what the Supreme Court just called “an explanation for agency action that is incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decisionmaking process.”

It’s the end of responsible government as we know it, and the DOJ feels fine.

Career DOJ lawyers like Fabian can’t be expected to fix what those in leadership are breaking. These lawyers are in a difficult situation because their political clients and bosses often direct the positions they take in court. If they stay in their jobs, their legal skills might be exploited to defend a cruel practice or launder Trump’s discriminatory intent. If they quit in protest, they will inevitably be replaced by lawyers who are less troubled by Trump’s actions.

Indeed, as a civil rights lawyer representing immigrants against the Trump administration, I’ve been frustrated by the tactics and arguments that some career DOJ lawyers have deployed to keep my clients from the justice they deserve. But I don’t think the career DOJ lawyers are calling the shots.

To protect the rule of law, and to save the legal profession from being debased by the next Trump, we need to look beyond individual attorneys and toward the health of our institutions.

Here’s where the Office of the Defender General would come in. The concept of a defender general has been floated in legal circles as a means of improving representation for indigent criminal defendants. Consistent with these aims, Valparaiso University Law School professor Andrea Lyon has proposed that a defender general could serve as a “voice at the policy table for the accused, incarcerated and paroled.” And Sen. Cory Booker has introduced legislation that would create a “Defender Office for Supreme Court Advocacy” to help criminal defendants in the U.S. Supreme Court and state courts of last resort.

The events of the Trump era point to another reason to create a defender general’s office: the need to counteract the DOJ during times of moral rot.

A defender general’s office could serve precisely this function if it were afforded some independence—Booker’s bill would make it a nonprofit corporation—and if its mission were understood to go beyond criminal defense. We need a government-sponsored institution whose lawyers will stand up in court, and stand athwart DOJ lawyers, to articulate our country’s interests in the liberty of people subjected to government incarceration and detention, from prisons and jails to immigration detention.

Properly empowered, a defender general could pressure the DOJ to make more responsible legal arguments, and then publicly and loudly call out the DOJ—within government and in court—when it falls short. Would DOJ leaders have sent a career lawyer to quibble with federal judges about soap and blankets for detained kids if they had understood that a prestigious government-funded law office was prepared to tell the court that the DOJ’s position was meritless?

Another virtue of creating a defender general office is that it would generate alumni who could speak out in public when the government oversteps. A weird feature of the Trump era has been that so many “resistance” heroes are former prosecutors. This is partly because media outlets favor people who have been powerful lawyers, and there are almost no powerful government law jobs devoted to criminal defense or civil rights. As a result, the voices of lawyers who have devoted their careers to freeing people, instead of advancing reasons to keep them locked up, tend to be disproportionately drowned out, not only in government but in the public square.

None of this means that a quasi-governmental defender general could easily halt the Department of Justice’s dismaying slide toward defending the indefensible. But it’s clear that the remedy for what ails the DOJ must include institutional reform of some kind. And if the defender general can’t protect the rule of law, then maybe, by publicly confronting the failure of DOJ lawyering, she can avenge it.

New leaders installed at top immigration agencies amid questions over DHS secretary’s future,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-leaders-installed-at-top-immigration-agencies-amid-questions-over-dhs-secretarys-future,"The Trump administration named new leaders Thursday to top immigration agencies amid a deepening crisis at the border -- and swirling speculation over the future of the Homeland Security secretary who oversees it all after he was accused of leaking a highly sensitive operation.

Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday announced that Mark Morgan, who was serving as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would be shifted over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to replace former Commissioner John Sanders, who abruptly resigned from his post this week. ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence was tapped to replace Morgan at that agency.

But bigger questions now surround McAleenan himself.

Two senior administration officials told Fox News that high-level discussions were underway with top administration and White House officials regarding McAleenan’s future in light of the accusations against him -- which the secretary strongly denies. The officials said there is uncertainty as to how much longer the secretary could remain in his post.

A White House official declined to comment on these claims when asked by Fox News.

DHS BOSS MCALEENAN ACCUSED OF OPPOSING, LEAKING PLANNED ICE RAIDS

McAleenan had come under fire after officials and other sources publicly, and privately, accused him of leaking details of planned ICE deportation raids. The report in question, which was published by Washington Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn in major cities.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff less than 24 hours before the story was published. The source also said that when the raids were in a planning phase, McAleenan was opposed and even ordered Morgan to call off the operation -- though Trump told him to proceed. The president, though, put the operation on hold after the leak amid talks with Congress.

One senior administration official told Fox News on Thursday that after the alleged leak, ""He’s lost the confidence and trust of both the workforce and his superiors, with no viable path to proceed with any confidence and credibility.""

The official lamented the state of morale at the department, saying: “DHS has devolved into chaos and employee morale is abysmal.”

Another senior administration official also told Fox News Thursday that McAleenan has “completely lost his credibility leading the Department.”

“I can’t imagine the White House has an interest in keeping him in place much longer when they know he opposes most of their immigration policies,” the official said.

McAleenan, though, has adamantly denied the leak claims. In an interview with Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio, he said: ""Categorically, I did not and would not leak details of a law enforcement operation.""

Meanwhile, one of the officials told Fox News that McAleenan spent several days in Guatemala this week for multilateral meetings with Central American allies, while other top administration officials negotiated on Capitol Hill for additional funding for the agencies as part of a major piece of legislation -- which has not yet cleared Congress.

The official told Fox News that “support for a spending package vital to the department coalesced, was debated, and voted on in his absence.” That official also said that McAleenan has been “cut out of the process.”

Another administration official noted that McAleenan was slated to host a press conference on Thursday afternoon on the supplemental spending bill. “It’s interesting that he is standing alone. This is him trying to save his job, and taking a victory lap on the supplemental bill when he has been absent for the last few days.”

The event, though, was later canceled."

Jacky Rosen is blocking two of President Donald Trump's Department of Homeland Security nominees, citing ""inhumane and substandard"" conditions for children at the department's facilities, according to her office.

Rosen said she will delay the nominations of Chad F. Wolf for DHS under secretary for strategy, policy, and plans and Troy D. Edgar for chief financial officer. Earlier this month, the two appeared before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

The future of their nominations now remain on hold, ""until the inhumane and substandard conditions for children at DHS processing and detention facilities improve significantly,"" Rosen said in a statement.

""I will maintain these holds until a nongovernmental third party certifies that DHS has complied. I will use all tools available to hold this Administration accountable for their treatment of vulnerable children and families,"" she added.

The move is yet another setback for the Trump administration which has been occupying several roles in DHS with acting heads, particularly in leadership.

"In New Turf War, Treasury Dept. Seeks Control of Secret Service",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Alan Rappeport', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/secret-service-treasury.html,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is seeking to wrest control of the Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security and has been lobbying President Trump to back such a move, according to administration officials.

The discussions between the Treasury Department, the White House and high-ranking Secret Service officials have taken place over the past year and have intensified in recent months, as Mr. Trump has pressed homeland security officials to focus on stemming immigration and ousted some for failing to do so.

The president supports the idea of moving the Secret Service back to the Treasury Department, where it was housed until 2003, according to people familiar with the discussions. The agency, which had been part of Treasury for more than 100 years, was transferred as part of the Homeland Security Act, which sought to consolidate security agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Some senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been pushing back against the move, concerned about losing an agency that has cybersecurity and investigative components. The department, which oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is responsible for protecting the country against cyberattacks and ensuring election security, in addition to enforcing immigration law."
Supreme Court gives Marine seeking VA benefits second chance in lower court,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Devan Cole']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/supreme-court-kisor-wilkie-marine-veteran-federal-agencies/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave a Marine Corps veteran who sought disability benefits for his service-related post-traumatic stress a second chance to prevail in a case that will impact the amount of power federal agencies have.

But lurking behind the case was a dispute over government agencies that some conservatives feel have become too powerful, upsetting the balance of power.

Writing for five of the nine justices, Justice Elena Kagan narrowed the circumstances in which courts will defer to an agency's interpretation of ambiguous language in its own regulations. But Kagan stopped short of overturning court precedent.

Kagan wrote that such deference ""retains an important role in construing agency regulations,"" but she said it is ""sometimes appropriate and sometimes not."" She outlined ""markers"" for when courts should and should not defer.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment outlining those markers.

""The underlying regulation must be genuinely ambiguous; the agency's interpretation must be reasonable and must reflect its authoritative, expertise-based, and fair and considered judgment; and the agency must take account of reliance interests and avoid unfair surprise,"" Roberts wrote.

Paul Hughes, a lawyer for Kisor, praised the ruling, saying, ""Today's decision will significantly narrow agency authority."" Hughes noted that the lower court had applied a ""reflexive form of deference"" to the agency that was not warranted.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined in full by Justice Clarence Thomas and in part by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, wrote to say they thought court precedent should have been ""easy for the Court"" to overturn. Gorsuch said that while the opinion manages to leave court precedent ""maimed and enfeebled"" the justices should have found the ""nerve"" to wipe it off the books.

""Although it's easy to get lost in the administrative law weeds of this case, the major headline here is that Chief Justice (John) Roberts declined to join the four other conservative justices in overruling prior precedent, and instead joined his more progressive colleagues in narrowing but not ditching the idea that courts should sometimes defer to how administrative agencies resolve ambiguities in their own regulations,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

""The chief justice wrote separately to suggest that there isn't that much daylight between the result the Court reached and the one the dissenters would have adopted, but lower courts may well disagree as cases like these go forward,"" he said.

Vladeck added that the Court ""was unanimous in agreeing to send the case back to the Federal Circuit, but split as to what should happen thereafter.""

""Five Justices still think there is some room for deference to the VA, although they're not sure whether such deference is warranted in this case. Four would have the lower courts resolve the issue without any deference to the VA,"" he said.

USDA identifies unapproved GMO wheat growing wild in Washington,https://www.upi.com,['Jessie Higgins'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/06/27/USDA-identifies-unapproved-GMO-wheat-growing-wild-in-Washington/6441561660173/,"No genetically engineered wheat is approved for use in the United States. Photo by Alexandr Dobysh/Shutterstock

June 27 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture has identified the genetically modified, unapproved wheat found growing wild in Washington state as a grain created by Monsanto.

The wheat was genetically engineered to withstand the company's Roundup herbicide, which would allow farmers to better kill other plants without affecting their wheat crops. It's called Roundup Ready wheat.

The company also makes Roundup Ready corn and soybeans, both of which are approved by the USDA.

The wheat, also called MON 71800, does not have USDA approval -- no genetically engineered wheat is approved from commercial use anywhere in the world.

RELATED Unapproved GMO wheat found growing wild in Washington

Monsanto petitioned for its approval in 2002 and 2004, but chose to withdraw its applications before the agency issued a ruling, said Rick Coker, a USDA spokesman.

However, the Food and Drug Administration completed a ""voluntary consultation"" of MON 71800 in 2004, ""concluding that this GE wheat is as safe as food and feed as non-GE wheat currently on the market,"" Coker said.

The Roundup Ready wheat was found growing wild in eastern Washington state in early June in an area that was ""possibly on the site of a former [Monsanto] field trial,"" Charla Lord, a spokeswoman for Bayer, which recently purchased Monsanto, said shortly after it was found.

The USDA still is reviewing the situation, and anticipates the investigation will take between six and nine months, Coker said.

Bayer had no comment on the USDA's most recent findings. Shortly after the USDA announced the discovery June 7, the company issued the statement, ""We are cooperating with USDA to gather more information and facts as the agency reviews the situation. We will provide more information when possible."""

"Senate vote requires military, EPA to deal with harmful 'forever chemicals'",https://thehill.com,[],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450706-senate-vote-requires-military-epa-to-deal-with-harmful-forever,"The Senate passed a defense bill Thursday that would require an increased response from the government to harmful chemicals that have leached into water in at least 43 states.

Included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is language that would push the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set a national drinking water standard for a class of chemicals known as PFAS that have been linked with cancer and other health problems.

The EPA has said it will decide by the end of the year whether to regulate the chemicals that are so persistent in the environment they’ve been deemed “forever chemicals.”

PFAS is used in a staggering number of products, including firefighting foam, which the bill directs the military to stop using.

A move by Congress to force a drinking water standard would be significant and ultimately require local governments to keep PFAS in water below a certain level. Currently, the EPA recommends water contain no more than 70 parts per trillion of PFAS, but many states, tired of waiting for the EPA, have set more stringent standards far below that figure.

The bill also directs the Department of Defense to take more aggressive action on PFAS following accusation that the Pentagon was trying to weaken EPA regulations that would force the military to take on expensive cleanup costs now estimated at around $2 billion.

The bill pushes the Pentagon to finalize agreements with states for cleaning up PFAS contamination caused by the military largely through the use of firefighting foam. The military would have three years to phase out use of the foam.

Other provisions would also force the EPA to consider barring new uses of PFAS and require PFAS manufacturers to share data on their production.

But the Senate version does not make Superfund cleanup money available for places where PFAS has contaminated drinking water, something Sen.

“The provisions we secured in this legislation will improve both the federal government’s understanding of and response to PFAS contamination. The Department of Defense’s use of firefighting foam containing PFAS is a significant source of this contamination,"" he said. ""The use of these chemicals in firefighting foam has undoubtedly saved lives, but the cruel irony is that those same life-saving chemicals can endanger lives when they wind up in a glass of drinking water.""

He added, ""While the provisions we included in this package are an important start, I am disappointed that we were unable to successfully include the legislation I introduced with Senator Capito that would designate PFAS as hazardous substances under the Superfund law, and I will continue to fight to ensure that important measure is enacted into law.”

Debbie Dingell Deborah (Debbie) Ann DingellSenate vote requires military, EPA to deal with harmful 'forever chemicals' California official blasts EPA head over car standard negotiations Democrats grill Trump officials over fuel standard rollback MORE (D-Mich.) has included such a measure to require the EPA to include PFAS under the Superfund law.

Environmental groups hailed the bill as an important first step in dealing with the growing PFAS problem.

“The first step to addressing this catastrophe is knowing where PFAS pollution is coming from and understanding how far it has spread. This legislation will go a long way in doing just that. Much more needs to be done to address the crisis, but monitoring the scope of PFAS pollution will lay the groundwork for further progress,” Scott Faber, with the Environmental Working Group, said in a statement.

The Senate version also includes a number of other environmental measures, including funding for research into carbon capture."

Bill Wehrum is leaving his post as the Environmental Protection Agency's top air policy official. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Bill Wehrum spent only a year and a half as the Environmental Protection Agency’s top air official before announcing plans to resign Wednesday amid scrutiny over possible violations of federal ethics rules.

But during that time, Wehrum served as one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the ambition and reach of the EPA, and to retreat from President Obama’s push to slash emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. He oversaw efforts to ease regulation of the coal industry, slow requirements that cars and trucks become more fuel efficient and overhaul how the agency calculates costs and benefits to favor industry.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s announcement Wednesday did not cite a specific reason for the departure of Wehrum, who as an attorney represented power companies seeking to scale back air pollution rules. But Wehrum has privately expressed concern about how an ongoing House Energy and Commerce Committee probe was affecting his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, according to individuals familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

“While I have known of Bill’s desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,” Wheeler said Wednesday, praising Wehrum for “his service, his dedication to his job, the leadership he provided to his staff and the agency, and for his friendship.”

Environmental groups, Democrats on Capitol Hill and other critics were quick to celebrate Wehrum’s departure, calling him an integral part of the “swamp” that President Trump had vowed to drain in Washington.

“William Wehrum was emblematic of the administration’s struggles to remain ethical,"" Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said in a statement. ""While it’s a good thing that Wehrum’s potential ethics problems will no longer affect the agency, the tone is set at the top, and if the EPA is to clean up the mess started by Scott Pruitt, the Trump administration needs to get serious about policing its ethical failures.”

Wehrum, who was confirmed in November 2017, is the latest Trump appointee to depart after coming under investigation for possible misconduct. Four Cabinet members — EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin — have all left under an ethics cloud, along with other senior staffers such as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator William “Brock” Long.

Interior’s Office of Inspector General is currently investigating seven current or former top appointees for improperly engaging with their former employers or clients on department-related business, including Secretary David Bernhardt. Bernhardt has denied any wrongdoing, and the other officials have not commented publicly on the allegations.

The Energy and Commerce Committee launched its inquiry of Wehrum after The Washington Post reported in February that questions had been raised about his compliance with the Trump ethics pledge, which requires political appointees to recuse themselves from specific matters involving their former employers and clients for two years. If an appointee does meet with a former client, the pledge dictates that the gathering should be open to all interested parties — a requirement that has been interpreted to mean four other participants who were not clients.

Less than one month after joining the EPA, Wehrum met with two former clients at his old firm without consulting in advance with ethics officials, even though they had cautioned him about such interactions. That same month, Wehrum weighed in on a decision that appeared to benefit a former client, DTE Energy.

Wehrum, who heads the air and radiation office at the EPA, acknowledged both incidents in an interview with The Post but said he had determined that he did not violate federal ethics rules.

“I have, from day one, tried to be absolutely strict and assiduous as to what I do about complying with my ethical obligations,” Wehrum said, “because it doesn’t do me any good, and it doesn’t do the agency any good, to be doing things that people see as unethical.”

Still, the fallout from the disclosure about Wehrum’s ties to his former firm and the utility industry by The Post and other outlets — including Politico, the New York Times and E&E News — has continued to reverberate. The Utility Air Regulatory Group, a collection of power companies that paid Hunton Andrews Kurth millions in membership dues, disbanded earlier this year.

Wehrum has said he represented the group as its own entity, rather than the individual utilities that made up its membership. But investigators on Capitol Hill have explored whether he and his former firm represented the power companies as well, according to one person familiar with the inquiry, raising the prospect that Werhum’s meetings could have violated ethics rules on multiple counts. The individual spoke on condition of anonymity because it is ongoing.

Both Wehrum’s supporters and his critics say that he has accomplished some of industry’s long-sought goals. In doing so, he has rolled back some of President Barack Obama’s most sweeping air policies. Last week the EPA finalized a rule targeting power plants that cuts carbon emissions by less than half of what experts say is needed to avoid catastrophic global warming. He has advanced other controversial proposals as well, including one that would slow efforts to improve gas mileage for cars and light trucks. Another would limit how the EPA calculates public health benefits in proposed regulations, which could make it tougher to limit pollution sources.

“No assistant administrator at EPA had more on their plate than Bill,"" Ross Eisenberg, vice president of energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement. ""He executed the job with a steady hand and got big things done.”

But what some industry officials saw as Wehrum’s reasonable measures to reduce the regulatory burden on companies, critics describe as undermining the agency’s mission to protect public health and the environment.

“It is, at the very least, going to take years to undo the damage that has been done,” said John Coequyt, global climate policy director for the Sierra Club.

In a phone interview, Coequyt said that as Wehrum returns to the private sector, corporate clients could face blowback for enlisting Wehrum’s help. “We believe he’s toxic to their interests, and anyone who hires him will be publicly criticized for doing so.""

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who joined other Democrats in February in asking EPA’s inspector general to investigate Wehrum, predicted that he would end up representing one of the companies that has sought regulatory relief from Trump’s EPA.

“I can’t wait to see where Bill Wehrum lands once he’s out the door,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “What do you bet it’s with one of the fossil fuel interests he has served so well as air chief, delivering one big handout after another?”"
"So deep in student debt, they're suing Betsy DeVos over delays in loan forgiveness",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Sarah Min'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/betsy-devos-former-students-sue-betsy-devos-and-department-of-education-over-loan-forgiveness-delays/,"Seven plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, alleging they're illegally stalling on processing more than 158,000 applications for student loan forgiveness.

Under the ""borrower defense"" rule, defrauded students can apply for loan relief if their schools were found to have misled them.

The Education Department blamed a constant stream of politicized litigation for any holds on processing claims.

Alicia Davis feels like she was scammed. As a student at Florida Metropolitan University from 2006 to 2008, she said she was told the cost of her online criminal justice program would be covered by Pell grants and scholarships. She was told her credits could be transferred to other schools. Graduating from the school, a subsidiary of the for-profit Corinthian Colleges, would lead to a job and a decent wage.

None of it was true, said Davis, who accrued more than $22,000 in student loans from FMU. The 36-year-old is now one of seven plaintiffs suing the U.S. Department of Education and its chief, Betsy DeVos, for allegedly failing to offer relief to more than 158,000 student-loan borrowers who claim they were defrauded by for-profit colleges.

""They pretty much sold me a lie and a dream,"" Davis told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Turns out pretty much all of it was a lie.""

More than 158,000 pending claims for loan forgiveness

Davis and her co-plaintiffs are pinning their lawsuit on the ""borrower defense"" rule, which allows students to apply for loan forgiveness if their schools were found to have misled them. The rule was expanded during the Obama administration after Corinthian Colleges collapsed in 2015, spotlighting widespread fraud at some for-profit schools. Over 200,000 former students have applied for loan cancellation since 2015 — and the suit says three-quarters of those claims are still pending.

Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending, which filed the case on behalf of the plaintiffs, said the Department of Education has illegally halted processing forgiveness applications under DeVos's tenure, neither rejecting nor approving any claims. According to the complaint, the department ""intentionally adopted a policy of inaction and obfuscation."" The Education Department last approved a borrower-defense application in June 2018.

Financial tips for new college grads with student debt

""The Department of Education has knowingly enabled for-profit colleges to defraud students,"" Eileen Connor, legal director at the Project on Predatory Student Lending, said in a statement. ""It recklessly continued to act as a loan broker for disreputable schools despite clear records of abuse and misconduct,"" Connor added.

The Harvard Law project, which also released an open call for testimonials from former for-profit students, said the online form received more than 200 submissions in 24 hours. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco.

Previously delayed

The Education Department disputes the allegations, saying it's ready to finalize borrower-defense claims when other pending litigation over student loans is resolved and the courts allow it to proceed. Department officials also blamed the Obama administration for the backlog of claims, saying it failed to put into place an effective process to review a flood of applications.

""The only thing stopping the Department from finalizing thousands of these claims is the constant stream of litigation brought by ideological, so-called student advocate special interests,"" spokeswoman Liz Hill said in a statement.

DeVos has been sued before for her stance on the Obama-era borrower-defense policy, which she tried to delay from being implemented in 2017, saying it too easily allows students to ""raise his or her hand"" to get ""free money."" A federal judge ruled against the delay last September, finding it unlawful and calling it ""arbitrary and capricious.""

Instead, DeVos rolled out a more restrictive tiered relief system in December to partially compensate defrauded students based on their earnings. The plan has been frozen as part of a separate lawsuit.

Key issue in 2020

The latest lawsuit against DeVos has already won praise among dozens of progressive groups and Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren, who tweeted her support Tuesday saying, ""If she doesn't care about helping defrauded students, then let's hope a federal judge will make her care.""

I’m glad students cheated by shady for-profit colleges are fighting back against @BetsyDeVosED in court. If she doesn’t care about helping defrauded students, then let’s hope a federal judge will make her care. https://t.co/nJp0mwbw4S — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 25, 2019

The lawsuit comes as student loan debt becomes a key issue on the presidential campaign trail. Both Senators Warren and Bernie Sanders announced plans to forgive student loan debt, which has climbed to nearly $1.6 trillion nationwide for 44 million Americans. While proposing different solutions, both presidential candidates seek to erase a burden making it difficult for Americans to reach traditional milestones, like owning a home or a car or starting a family.

U.S. Reps. Susie Lee and Rosa DeLauro released joint legislation Wednesday to improve protections of students, including veterans, at for-profit colleges, including bolstering and enforcing borrower defense against repayment.

Today, along w/@Rosa_DeLauro, I introduced the PROTECT Students Act to finally give student protections from #4profit colleges.@BetsyDevosED has rolled back for-profit oversight, leaving students open to all kinds of predatory practices. No more. Let's put our students first. — Rep. Susie Lee (@RepSusieLee) June 26, 2019

Davis, with her $22,000 in federal loans to attend FMU, said she had to start her education over from scratch after learning her college credits weren't transferable and her certifications were not recognized. She went on to amass an additional $75,000 in loans to get her bachelor's and master's degrees and is now a crime analyst at a law enforcement agency.

But Davis, an Orlando resident, said her time at FMU continues to dog her in other ways: Even after establishing a borrower-defense claim in 2016, she received notices from the U.S. Department of Education threatening to garnish her wages. Having defaulted on her FMU loans at that time, she has had to explain her poor credit score to employers before any hiring offer. It has also prevented her from buying a car.

She hopes her suit can help others who may feel embarrassed or ashamed to move forward: ""Then we can do the next step and close this next part of our lives and hopefully recover financially, emotionally and become stable,"" she said."
‘A Constant Game of Musical Chairs’ Amid Another Homeland Security Shake-Up,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Zolan Kanno-Youngs', 'Maggie Haberman']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/politics/mark-morgan-ice-cbp.html,"In an interview on Tuesday for a coming book about the president’s immigration policies, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tumult among his top immigration officials.

“I do burn out on people, I do. If somebody’s not really great, I do,” the president said during the interview in the Oval Office. He did not directly address the turnover at Customs and Border Protection, but said he had made “good changes” in the people who run his immigration agencies.

“I understand what I want,” he said. “And we’re starting to get there.”

The White House directed Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, to replace Mr. Sanders with Mr. Morgan after multiple White House officials expressed displeasure that Mr. Sanders was not being aggressive enough at the southwestern border, administration officials said. Mr. McAleenan complied, hoping to diminish friction with the White House, officials said.

Mr. McAleenan resisted an earlier push by Stephen Miller, the architect behind Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, to appoint Mr. Morgan as the head of Customs and Border Protection, according to current and former homeland security officials.

In 2017, shortly after he took office, Mr. Trump forced out Mr. Morgan as Border Patrol chief. But Mr. Morgan won the approval of the White House after backing the president’s aggressive policies on television. In one appearance on Fox News, Mr. Morgan said that when he looked into the eyes of detained migrant children, he saw a “soon-to-be MS-13 gang member.”

In a letter to Customs and Border Protection employees on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders confirmed his departure.

“Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful,” Mr. Sanders, a former chief technology officer at the Transportation Security Administration who helped spearhead the agency’s PreCheck program, wrote, “I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of C.B.P. has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career.”"

Hard-liners inside and outside the Trump administration are pressing for the removal of President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary amid a rolling leadership purge that began in April and shows no signs of ending, according to five people in the Trump administration and four former Department of Homeland Security officials.

Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies, including former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, who might become the administration’s immigration czar.

Story Continued Below

Following the purge of three other immigration officials since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders, a McAleenan ally, said Monday that he’ll resign effective July 5. Sanders did not offer a public explanation for his resignation.

Several critics of the administration, including former DHS officials, have characterized the latest shakeup as another instance of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller seizing an opportunity to fill key immigration posts with allies. But one senior administration official said the president also agrees with these stances.

“The two issues the president is driving the train on at all times are trade and immigration,” the official said. “There is disbelief inside the administration that we can’t enforce the law and people are trying to find the right personnel who will do it and not look for ways out of it.”

Miller and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. The White House press office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McAleenan.

The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day and detained children are being denied basic necessities like toothbrushes and soap. Current and former DHS employees complain that the leadership turnover and attendant jostling for power have slowed the government’s ability to respond to what is now widely recognized to be a crisis.

“It’s awful for morale,” said one current CBP official. “Whoever’s going to be confirmed to acting [commissioner] next, we’re back to square one, getting a new person briefed. … It’s like starting all over in a transition.”

Homan suggested on “Fox & Friends” that this week’s planned ICE raids were delayed because McAleenan leaked information about them.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “In The Washington Post or in numerous media outlets, he does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue. You don’t tell the men and women of ICE, a day before they go out there and do this operation — ‘Look, this story was leaked.’ They gave the locations of the cities, the day it was supposed to start, how many targets.”

Homan spoke while sitting in front of a DHS seal, looking like a government official — something he has not been since June 2018. The seal was in a room set up in the basement of his Virginia home, according to two former DHS officials. Trump told Fox News on June 14 that Homan would be his new “border czar,” but Homan said a day later that the announcement was “kind of premature” and indicated that he hadn’t yet decided whether to take the job. An administration official said Wednesday that Homan has not yet been given a clear description of what the job would entail.

“Homan’s getting paid a lot better as border czar of Fox News than border czar of the White House,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-migrant National Immigration Forum. “And he kind of has the same job, to go on Fox News and carry the administration’s message.”

Several administration officials and hard-line immigration advocates have targeted McAleenan in recent days, arguing behind the scenes that he’s too liberal to run DHS because he served under President Barack Obama and has donated money in the past to Democratic candidates and organizations. Conservative media outlets, including the Washington Examiner, have run critical stories to amplify that narrative.

Brandon Judd, president of a union that represents Border Patrol agents and a Trump ally, also torched McAleenan in a Fox News op-ed over the weekend.

Judd — who has attacked McAleenan in the past for being insufficiently committed to Trump — said that if McAleenan did leak information about the raids, then he “was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm’s way in order to further his own agenda.”

“There is no question that the president is sensitive to the lack of progress in resolving this crisis at the border and frustrated with the pace of changes, and it has become increasingly evident that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is because Kevin McAleenan has been reluctant to take action that would more effective,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “A lot of ideas proposed have been bottled up by him and his front office.”

The Trump White House assumed McAleenan could work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to secure more funding and policy changes, since he’s worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Vaughan said. But “he has not been able to deliver on those things.”

Within the past month Trump installed a pair of vocal immigration hard-liners in key immigration positions, naming Mark Morgan acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Ken Cuccinelli acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Both had drawn the president’s attention by making provocative statements about immigration on Fox News; Morgan, for instance, said he could tell whether a migrant child would later join MS-13 merely by looking into that child’s eyes.

Morgan appears already on the move. POLITICO and other outlets reported Tuesday that he’s expected to be named the new acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, although the White House has not made an official announcement.

Cuccinelli, meanwhile, scored a coveted perk during his first month that his predecessor, Francis Cissna, never enjoyed. Trump designated him to be one of 10 officials to get a government-funded car to drive him from his Virginia home to USCIS headquarters.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3778/1155968404_6044370239001_6044253724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

A USCIS spokesperson confirmed that Cuccinelli had been granted the benefit, but said that he “is currently driving himself to the office.”

Both newly installed officials occupy new “principal deputy director” positions created at their respective agencies to allow them to serve in an acting capacity under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act — a bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that could circumvent the confirmation process.

Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and head of a conservative political action committee, would face a hard road to confirmation in the Senate because he backed challenges to mainstream Republicans in recent years, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Morgan would at the least face strong Democratic opposition.

“I think the White House is looking for a certain model,” said one current administration official. “Cuccinelli and Morgan have been on Fox every day. I don’t think you’ll ever see Sanders up there.”

The latest personnel shake-up happened just days after the administration caught flak for its treatment of roughly 300 migrant children at a Texas facility who were filthy, hungry, and largely unsupervised, according to lawyers who interviewed some of them.

Several conservative immigration advocates said the DHS shake-up was unrelated to the ensuing public outcry, and instead had been brewing for weeks. Moving Morgan to CBP sets the stage for the administration to now get rid of McAleenan, one advocate said.

“Things have not changed at DHS since Nielsen left,” said a top official at a restrictionist immigration organization. “I disagreed with them getting rid of Francis Cissna but right now, they are looking in the right place.”

But “having all of this churn and not having stable leadership makes it very difficult to address the problems,” said Leon Fresco, former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation. “Whenever you change a leader, you automatically lose a month as the person gets acclimated.”

House Dems Stiff-Arm DHS on Domestic Terror Funds,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin Banco', 'Betsy Woodruff', 'National Security Reporter', 'Political Reporter']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-dems-stiff-arm-dhs-on-domestic-terror-funds,"As white supremacist terror attacks have left dozens dead around the United States, the Department of Homeland Security has faced blistering criticism for its approach to the threat. Earlier this year, however, congressional Democrats declined to make more money available for the department’s efforts to thwart domestic terrorist attacks.

Their reason, in part: concern the Trump administration could use new money to target American Muslims instead of white supremacists.

It’s a complex episode of a messy fight between Trump’s Department of Homeland Security and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives—a fight with tens of millions of dollars at stake. And it didn’t have to happen.

When Trump came into office, his Office of Management and Budget didn’t ask Congress for money for a small grant program DHS used to fund efforts to counter domestic terrorism. A source familiar with the department’s efforts said there were concerns that some of the grants provided by DHS at the end of the Obama administration to help prevent attacks by homegrown violent extremists were inefficient and failed to address the threats adequately.

After two years without funding, DHS officials decided to go straight to congressional appropriators to request the money instead of going through the White House. Per one congressional source familiar with the request, they asked for more than $17 million—$10 million to offset the grant money that existed under the Obama administration, plus about $7 million more. They made the ask in recent weeks.

But House appropriators didn’t bite, and declined to include that money in a recent funding bill. They worried, according to half a dozen sources familiar with the talks, that DHS doesn’t have a cohesive strategy for fighting domestic terror—a concern a DHS official said is unwarranted. And the White House has yet to release a clear strategy document on the growing threat, instead just having officials characterize it in speeches and congressional testimony. Four of those sources specifically said that concerns about potential anti-Muslim programs informed Democrats’ reticence to provide the new funds.

And the request’s timing didn’t help. One Democratic aide said the committee had already written a bill funding the department for 2020 by the time the request came in. DHS submitted its request in the spring, the aide said.

“The department requested funding for these grants under the Obama administration, but there was a [concern] that under Trump [the grants] would be used in the new administration to fuel anti-Muslim programming and rhetoric,” a House Democratic aide told The Daily Beast.

“ The Trump administration’s emphasis has been placed on addressing the potential for violence by immigrants... But the primary threat facing us comes from people here who become radicalized by what they see online. ” — former DHS official John Cohen

A DHS official strongly disagreed with this characterization. “DHS is committed to protecting the homeland by working to prevent all types of violent extremism,” this official told The Daily Beast. “The department rejects the premise that its prevention programs have or would target Muslims.”

In testimony in front of Congress in June, Elizabeth Neumann, the assistant secretary for Threat Prevention and Security Policy, the division that oversees programs to prevent domestic terrorist attacks, said the tactics used by homegrown violent extremists make it “extremely difficult for law enforcement to detect and thwart potential attacks.”

The DHS request came as the Trump administration began to push a new strategy regarding security at the southern border. Over the past year, the White House and DHS have pushed for more resources to try to slow an influx of Central American migrants.

In May, the White House requested $4.5 billion in emergency border funding from Congress, more than $3 billion of which would go to humanitarian efforts. President Trump reportedly requested the additional funding for the border because the money the administration previously received from the Department of Defense came with several restrictions and limitations. The House voted Tuesday to approve the supplemental funding.

And over the weekend, Trump postponed nationwide raids to deport undocumented families after threatening to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents out on the streets if Democrats on Capitol Hill did not agree to changes in asylum law.

Meanwhile, Homeland Security has drawn criticism for its handling of election security and domestic terrorism issues. The Daily Beast reported the department this year shuttered a group within its intelligence arm focused on analysis of domestic terrorism. It also gutted two task forces focused on election security and foreign interference.

On top of that, headquarters has asked each Homeland Security component to send volunteers away from their day jobs and to the border. The department’s agency responsible for protecting America’s vital infrastructure—including election systems—struggled to initially fulfill the request and had to send out more than one request for volunteers. Democrats and other outside observers say the White House’s decision to prioritize border security over other core DHS missions leaves the country at risk.

“The Trump administration’s emphasis has been placed on addressing the potential for violence by immigrants and others outside of this country,” said John Cohen, the former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “ But the primary threat facing us comes from people here who become radicalized by what they see online. So, any effort to protect this nation has to focus on the domestic environment as opposed to being obsessed by that potential violence that feeds the administration’s anti-immigration agenda.”"
Veterans Affairs whistleblowers call for end to culture of retaliation,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veterans-affairs-whistleblower-notified-termination-day-congressional-testimony/story?id=63922369,"A Department of Veterans Affairs health care worker said she received a letter from the agency on Monday notifying her that she would be terminated, just one day before she was scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing about how the VA treats other whistleblowers.

Baltimore psychologist Minu Aghevli said she received the letter, which outlined the VA Maryland Health Care Center's proposal to terminate her employment, after working for the agency for nearly 20 years and raising concerns for years about the quality of patient care and manipulating wait lists in opioid treatment programs. In an earlier letter, the VA says she was facing disciplinary action for treating a patient at a non-VA hospital and violating the agency's code of conduct, but she and her lawyer argue the agency is retaliating against her for raising concerns about problems within the department.

The agency denies that the notice was related to her testimony.

The VA has faced dozens of complaints from whistleblowers who say they were retaliated against for raising concerns about the quality of medical care for veterans or actions by agency officials, according to the agency that handles whistleblower complaints from federal employees. Aghevli and two other whistleblowers from the agency testified in front of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Tuesday saying the agency has a culture of trying to silence or punish people who report problems.

C-SPAN

Aghevli called the termination proposal scary, because she said it appears to be a warning shot to ward off other potential whistleblowers.

""This feels obviously retaliatory, but worse than that I feel like I'm being used as a threat against other employees who might think about speaking up about patient care concerns and I resent that. I do not want to be used as a pawn,"" she testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli first reported concerns over hospital waitlists in 2014, just as a national scandal erupted over wait times, amid allegations patients had died waiting for care at a VA facility in Phoenix.

""In order to reduce the waitlist, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic waitlist by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,"" Aghevli said in remarks she prepared to share with Congress on Tuesday. ""This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits...The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.

""The VA also pressured me to artificially reduce the number of patients on the waitlist through other improper means,"" she added.

The VA's internal watchdog has investigated concerns about wait lists in opioid treatment facilities in Maryland, though it does not specify if it was prompted by Aghevli's complaint. The inspector general's inquiry published in 2018 confirmed that the VA's opioid program transferred veterans waiting for treatment to another list where they essentially wouldn't be counted. In an earlier report, the agency said they would improve internal controls by 2017 to ensure that all patients receive treatment.

Aghevli said the VA has ""engaged in continuous retaliation"" against her in an apparent effort to oust her from the agency ever since she first reported her concerns, including being stripped of patient-care privileges and assigned to do ""menial administrative tasks.""

""Two months ago, I was told that my clinical privileges are being suspended. So since that time I have been forbidden from having any clinical contact with patients and I was assigned to pretty menial administrative tasks,"" she said. ""It felt like I was put in a position where I would be especially visible to other staff to make it sort of a publicly humiliating situation.""

A letter from her legal team to the Office of Special Counsel -- which aims to safeguard federal employees, especially whistleblowers -- says Aghevli received the ""notice of proposed removal"" on June 24.

""The notice of proposed removal was issued immediately after the Agency learned that Dr. Aghevli's disclosures would be the subject of a front-page story in USA Today and that she would be testifying before Congress,"" her legal team wrote in the letter to OSC.

""The reasons set forth by the Agency for proposing Dr. Aghevli's removal are without merit and cannot be the actual reasons for proposing her removal.""

Aghevli did not send ABC News a copy of the letter because she said wanted to send her official response first.

Aghevli, who served as the former coordinator of the department's opioid addiction treatment program in Baltimore, said hospital officials cited in the letter an ongoing matter with a patient's follow-up care and gave her several business days to respond. In her testimony on Tuesday, she said her privileges were suspended in April because she visited a high-risk patient in a local hospital after he overdosed, and that the patient disclosed he attempted suicide after leaving the VA facility.

Aghevli declined to offer specific details about the April incident, citing potential patient privacy concerns, but she said it involved a ""high risk veteran"" who had visited the hospital’s emergency room in the past.

""So basically, what they say is I shouldn't have followed up with this high risk veteran in a community hospital, despite everything the VA says about following up with high risk veterans,"" she said. ""The VA says that we should engage them, keep them involved in care and provide proper mental health treatment.""

In a statement, the VA Maryland Health Care System said the notice of proposed termination was not related to her scheduled testimony on Tuesday.

""Dr. Aghevli will have an opportunity to respond to the proposed action, and a regional VA leader will decide whether to uphold it or mitigate it after ensuring all procedural protections in the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act have been met,"" it said in a statement, adding ""identifying as a whistleblower doesn’t shield someone from accountability when they have failed to uphold VA’s values and committed clear instances of misconduct.""

Another VA whistleblower who testified Tuesday, Katherine Mitchell a physician and consultant for the VA in Arizona, said she has faced continued retaliation even after the concerns she raised were addressed. She was one of the first people to raise concerns in 2014 about officials manipulating wait lists and jeopardizing care for veterans in Arizona.

She said she's seen a lot of improvement in patient care at the VA but that there's still a culture where some agency leaders make it difficult for people concerned about behavior that could be dangerous for patients to come forward.

""This has nothing to do with who’s in office. Things got worse two years ago because the media's attention turned off whistleblowers and turned on to politics and other things,"" she said Tuesday.

""It has nothing to do with who's in the president's office or who controls Congress. This is a malignant leadership culture that will outlast us all unless someone has the courage to break rank in leadership and finally change it."""
Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/24/735525569/treasury-department-launches-investigation-into-delays-behind-harriet-tubman-20-,"Treasury Department Launches Investigation Into Delays Behind Harriet Tubman $20 Bill

The Treasury Department will conduct an investigation into the circumstances leading to a delay in the production of a new $20 bill featuring a portrait of slave-turned-slave-emancipator Harriet Tubman.

In a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released Monday, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar explained the inquiry will be folded into a larger examination of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's project management processes for new note design that was already in the works.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote.

In 2016, the Treasury Department announced it would replace former President Andrew Jackson's face with that of the famed abolitionist by 2020. As NPR reported, the update would have made Tubman the first woman since Martha Washington to appear on an American currency note and the first African American. But last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the redesign will be delayed until 2028.

Schumer called on the department to launch an investigation last week, specifically asking for a review of ""the involvement of other participants in the interagency process related to the redesign — including the Secret Service, Federal Reserve, and the White House — to ensure that political considerations have not been allowed to infect the process for designing American currency.""

Delmar noted the review will seek interviews with officials, including senior executives from Treasury, BEP, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), United States Secret Service and the Board's Currency Technology Office.

He added it will take approximately 10 months.

""If, in the course of our audit work, we discover indications of the employee misconduct or other matters that warrant a referral to our Office of Investigations, we will do so expeditiously,"" Delmar said.

Before he was elected, President Trump was critical of a redesign that would eliminate Jackson's image, saying the move was motivated by ""pure political correctness.""

Jackson ""represented somebody that really was very important to this country,"" Trump said in a Today show interview. He suggested it would be ""more appropriate"" to put Tubman's image on a note of different denomination."
White House protocol chief suspended amid State Department investigation ahead of G-20,https://www.cnn.com,['Michelle Kosinski'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/state-department-protocol-chief-suspended/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's protocol chief, Sean Lawler, has been suspended indefinitely just ahead of the G-20 meeting in Japan pending the outcome of a State Department investigation into his conduct, according to multiple State Department officials with direct knowledge of the matter.

Two State officials told CNN that Lawler was called into the office of the deputy secretary on Monday afternoon and told he needed to leave due to the status of the investigation.

On the same afternoon, senior staff in the protocol office met with State Department management and were told that Lawler had to leave over personnel issues, according to the officials.

They were also told in this meeting that their new acting chief of protocol is Mary-Kate Fisher, and her acting deputy is Cathy Fenton, who served as social secretary in the George W. Bush White House and also handled social affairs‎ for Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush. State Department sources said both are highly respected.

One of the State Department officials described what multiple others told CNN was a pattern of behavior on Lawler's part. ""In my decade of government service, I have never seen someone so unprofessional, abrasive and rude as him,"" the official said. ""His bad behavior was terrible, and it was obvious. I personally saw it myself, as did a good chunk of the office.

"DHS boss McAleenan accused of opposing, leaking planned ICE raids",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcaleenan-accused-leaking-ice-raids,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is being accused of leaking plans last week for scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, after expressing fierce opposition and allegedly ordering top officials to “stand down” on the operation.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that when the operation was in its planning phase two weeks ago, McAleenan ordered ICE Acting Director Mark Morgan to call off the deportation operation that was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country. President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""

TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS

The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April—prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello’s departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up—and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

“He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,” the source told Fox News. “He has been fighting this operation since its inception.”

On Friday, The Washington Post published a story with explicit details of the planned raids, citing U.S. officials familiar with the operation. The story, written by Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn, in major cities including Houston, Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles. Miroff also reported that the planned raids would begin on Sunday.

Tom Homan, the former head of ICE, first suggested in an interview Saturday on ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan was behind that story as he accused the DHS leader of working against the ICE operation.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “He does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue.”

He noted that the leaked story ""gave the location of the cities, the day this was supposed to start, how many targets"" and added: ""This leak -- which I know where the leak came from, I think we all know where the leak came from, that story only benefits one person -- put these officers at greater risk of harm.""

The source familiar with the matter also told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff, just 48 hours before the story was published.

“To have somebody within DHS leak this information that would have put the general public, as well as our officers in danger—that is one of the most egregious leaks I have ever seen in my life,” the source told Fox News, noting that “you can’t go forward with an operation once everyone knows the time, the place, the details. ICE officers and other law enforcement would have been put directly in harm's way.”

Sources also told The Washington Examiner that McAleenan was behind the leak.

A spokesperson in McAleenan's office denied the allegations, telling ""Fox & Friends"" that he's never leaked anything in his entire career.

Following the publication of the Post story, ICE said in a statement that “due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigrants and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.”

ICE did say, however, that it prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants “who pose a threat to national security, public safety, and border security.”

TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON EXPECTED ICE RAID AMID PUSHBACK FROM LOCAL DEM POLITICIANS

By Saturday morning, the president announced that the plan would be delayed for two weeks to give congressional Democrats and Republicans time to come to a bipartisan solution on the border crisis. Trump warned, though, that if an agreement could not be reached, deportations would begin.

The change of plans came after Trump, earlier in the week, said that ICE would “begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.”

On Saturday night, in an interview with Jeanine Pirro on Fox News' “Justice with Judge Jeanine,” Morgan said the postponement of the raids would “give Congress another chance on a bipartisan method to actually get together, pass this supplement, so that we can enforce the rule of law, positively impact this crisis and maintain the integrity of this system.”

He added: “I’ve got the green light to, anyone that’s here in violation of federal immigration law, I have the authority and the support to go after them, apply consequences, and remove them.”

Architect of clean-air rollbacks resigns at EPA,https://www.greencarreports.com,"['Eric C. Evarts', 'Eric C. Evarts - Contributor', 'Bengt Halvorson - Senior Editor']",,,,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1123829_architect-of-clean-air-rollbacks-resigns-at-epa,"EPA Office of Air and Radiation Administrator Bill Wehrum, an attorney who formerly represented power companies in their effort to roll back clean-air regulations, has resigned.

The biggest air-quality issues that the Office of Air and Radiation oversees are tailpipe emissions from cars, and emissions from power plants that increasingly provide power for electric cars.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler made the announcement Wednesday. He didn't cite a reason for Wehrum's departure, but the air-office chief had expressed concern about the effects of a Congressional investigation into his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, according to a Washington Post report.

In his year and a half on the job, the office has drafted new regulations rolling back signature climate control programs from the Obama administration, including ratcheting up fuel-economy requirements from cars and the Clean Power Plan, which would have required coal-fired powerplants to capture carbon or convert to cleaner fuels. (The latter is mostly happening anyway for economic reasons.)

The long-anticipated final rule to freeze federal emissions and fuel economy standards at 2020 levels through 2026 is expected to be released at any time, though the EPA exchanged heated words with California officials in Congress last week.

Last Wednesday, the agency released the new Affordable Clean Energy rule, designed to replace the Clean Power Plan, which critics say will reduce global warming emissions from power plants by less than half the amount required to meet global climate-change reduction goals.

Under Wehrum, the agency also proposed a new rule that would change the way health benefits from proposed regulations are calculated to make it harder to pass new clean-air regulations.

Wehrum was confirmed under former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who resigned last year under a cloud of ethical investigations over his relationships with lobbyists.

Automakers have been lobbying Congress and the Trump administration to work with California and come up with new vehicle emissions rules. Companies are okay with annual increases but want more flexibility in meeting them and more uniformity between the EPA, NHTSA, and California.

Environmental groups were quick to celebrate Wehrum's departure at the end of the month. No replacement has yet been named."
FedEx sues the Department of Commerce after incident involving misrouted Huawei packages – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/fedex-sues-the-department-of-commerce-after-incident-involving-misrouted-huawei-packages/,"FedEx is suing the United States Department of Commerce, claiming that it has been “essentially deputize[d]” to enforce its trade blacklist. The lawsuit comes a month after Huawei said it is reassessing its relationship with the delivery giant after several packages meant for shipment within Asia were instead diverted, or erroneously marked for delivery, to the U.S. FedEx claimed the packages (which Huawei said did not contain any technology covered by the trade ban imposed against it by the Trump administration) had been misrouted by accident.

In a statement today about the lawsuit, FedEx said that the current export ban “places an unreasonable burden on FedEx to police the millions of shipments that transit our network every day.” Filed on Monday, the lawsuit asks the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia to stop the Department of Commerce from enforcing prohibitions in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) against FedEx.

FedEx said in its court filing that it has “developed a sophisticated proprietary risk-based compliance system” to adhere to U.S. export laws by screening for senders or recipients on the list of entities believed to pose a national security risk. Huawei, which was not mentioned by name in either FedEx’s announcement or its complaint against the U.S. government, was added to that list last month. But FedEx says the U.S. government expects it to perform a “virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally” since it handles million of packages each day and most of them are sealed by customers before being given to the company. Therefore, the company argues that EAR violates its rights to due process under the Fifth Amendment.

China is an important growth market for FedEx, but earlier this month its future there was put in jeopardy when the Chinese government said it was under investigation for violating laws and regulations after the incident involving Huawei’s packages. Last year the company was forced to cut its 2019 earnings guidance. FedEx’s chairman and CEO Frederick Smith blamed “bad political choices” around the world, including Brexit, state-owned enterprises and China and U.S. tariffs, for hurting its business."

Veuer’s Justin Kircher has the details. Buzz60

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Omarosa Manigault Newman alleging that the former ""Apprentice"" star who served as an adviser to President Donald Trump before becoming a prominent critic of his administration failed to file a financial disclosure report after she was fired from the White House.

In a civil complaint filed in federal court in Washington, the department said Manigault Newman failed to file the report despite several emails reminding her to do so. Such a report is required of employees who leave government jobs. The Justice Department is seeking a $50,000 penalty against Manigault Newman.

Manigault Newman was unavailable for comment. Her attorney, John Phillips, accused the White House of using the Justice Department to retaliate against Manigault Newman and said allegations that she ""knowingly and willfully"" did not file the disclosure report is untrue.

Phillips said the White House is still in possession of documents that Manigault Newman needed to file the report. He said Manigault Newman repeatedly requested these files from the White House, and told staffers in ""several calls and emails"" that she needed the contents of ""seven boxes"" of documents that were seized after her firing. The White House agreed to provide the documents on May 10, months after the deadline to file the report, but Phillips said Manigault Newman has not received any of the files.

Manigault Newman was assistant to the president and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison at the White House. Her annual salary was $179,700 a year, the top pay allowed by law for White House aides. Former chief of staff John Kelly fired her in December 2017 after less than a year on the job.

Manigault Newman later published a tell-all book describing the Trump White House as ""the most chaotic, outrageous"" in history. She also revealed that she had secretly recorded a Situation Room conversation in which Kelly fired her, as well as another conversation with Trump afterward.

The former ""Apprentice"" star, who said she worked closely with Trump for more than 15 years before he became president, has since been the subject of presidential insults on Twitter.

Trump tweeted in August 2018 that ""Wacky Omarosa"" ""begged"" him for a job and that White House staffers hated her.

"NASA, Homeland Security receive D- grades on IT issues",https://thehill.com,[],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/450520-nasa-homeland-security-receive-d-grades-on-it-issues,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) were both awarded D- grades on their information technology management efforts in a biannual scorecard of federal agencies.

The House Oversight government operations subcommittee released version 8.0 of the Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) scorecard in a hearing on Wednesday.

The scorecard gave IT scores to two dozen agencies, as well as individual scores for each agency in areas such as cybersecurity, the modernization of technology and transparency and risk management.

The scorecard has been required since 2014 as part of the FITARA Act, which requires multiple federal agencies to boost IT security and modernization efforts. It was first published in November 2015, with the most recent previous scorecard released this past December.

While DHS and NASA both received the lowest grades, the Department of Education, the Small Business Administration, the General Services Administration, and the National Science Foundation tied for the top overall grade of a B+. No agency received an A overall score.

Scores most stayed stagnant from December, with five federal agencies increasing their scores, 14 keeping the same scores and five seeing lower scores. DHS was among those to have its grade cut, going from a C- to a D-, while the departments of Agriculture and Defense were among those that saw the most improvement since December.

Most agencies appeared to struggle most in cybersecurity, with only the National Science Foundation receiving an A in that category.

The departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Commerce all received Fs on cyber issues. Software licensing, by comparison, was the area where agencies most excelled, with 20 receiving As.

Subcommittee Chairman Gerald Connolly (D-Va.) said during the hearing that the scorecard “reflects the improvements agencies have made in implementing” the FITARA Act, and said the law would help agencies protect themselves against cyber attacks.

A former senior Commerce Department official refused to answer more than 100 questions during an interview with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that centered on the Trump administration’s controversial decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, according to a transcript released Tuesday.

Commerce Department lawyers instructed James Uthmeier, who served as senior adviser and counsel to Secretary Wilbur Ross, not to answer the committee’s questions about his contacts with the White House and his conversations with Ross.

Story Continued Below

Uthmeier was also directed not to discuss the contents of a memo he wrote to a senior Justice Department official, John Gore, that purportedly outlines legal arguments surrounding the addition of a citizenship question to the census. On several occasions, Uthmeier was also blocked from disclosing details about his own conversations with Gore.

The Trump administration has sought to block several witnesses from cooperating with House Democrats’ investigations, including the Oversight Committee’s investigation of the census and the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice. In both cases, the Trump administration has asserted that current and former officials are immune from testifying about their conversations with the president and their tenure in the administration.

Earlier this month, the Oversight Committee voted to hold Ross and Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over subpoenaed documents about the citizenship question and the Justice and Commerce departments’ coordination in creating it. The vote came after Trump asserted executive privilege over all of the documents.

Late Monday night, the committee officially filed its contempt report.

Uthmeier, who worked at a law firm that counted Trump’s presidential campaign as a client, told the committee during his June 11 interview that he “spoke with White House personnel” about the citizenship question, but Commerce Department lawyers blocked him from stating the names of those White House officials. Uthmeier also acquiesced to the department’s demands that he refuse to answer questions about his conversations with Ross.

But Uthmeier did tell the committee that both Ross and Earl Comstock, Ross’ policy chief, asked him to look into the legal arguments about a citizenship question in early 2017. Commerce Department lawyers objected to every follow-up question seeking more details about those conversations, but Democrats said Uthmeier’s response showed that Ross lied to Congress about the true origins of the citizenship question when he said it was added to the census “solely” at the request of the Justice Department.

Uthmeier delivered his memo analyzing those legal questions to Gore, who then formally asked the Commerce Department to add a citizenship question.

Administration officials have said that the citizenship question was added to the 2020 census in order to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have been skeptical of that claim. Uthmeier did not answer a question about whether the memo he wrote for Gore discusses the Voting Rights Act.

When asked why he wrote the memo, Uthmeier said: “In my research, the Voting Rights Act came up, and I am not very familiar with the Voting Rights Act and all of its nuances, and thus, I was hoping John [Gore] would provide legal advice that dealt with the memo and the topics that I was investigating.” Uthmeier did not answer follow-up questions.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the committee, said in a statement: “Official after official appearing before the committee have refused to answer questions about the real reasons behind their effort, but the mounting evidence points to a partisan and discriminatory effort to harm the interests of Democrats and non-whites. The census is the foundation of our democracy, and our committee will continue doing everything in its power to ensure that it counts every single person in the United States.”

The committee has made the census probe — and the reasons a citizenship question was added — a central focus in its various investigations, which are also targeting Trump’s personal finances and the White House security clearance process.

Democrats say they’ve uncovered evidence supporting their claim that the Trump administration added the citizenship question in order to boost Republicans in future elections. Excluding noncitizens from the official census count, they say, would lead to redrawn congressional districts that favor Republicans.

Their investigation has revealed that administration officials spoke with immigration hard-liners known for their views on the citizenship question, including former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, now-deceased GOP operative Thomas Hofeller, and John Baker, a law professor.

The White House blocked Kobach from answering the committee’s questions about his conversations with Trump and other senior officials, arguing that they are privileged. Hofeller opined frequently about how Republicans would benefit from a citizenship question. And Uthmeier told the committee that Baker, who espoused similar views, was a “long-time mentor.”"
"DHS Inspector General expected to release report describing Texas border facility as ""dangerous""",https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-inspector-general-to-release-investigation-describing-clint-texas-border-patrol-station-as-dangerous/,"CBS News has confirmed the Homeland Security Inspector General is expected to release the results of an investigation next week that describes conditions at a Border Patrol in Clint, Texas, that drew outrage from activists as ""dangerous.""

Attorneys and doctors who inspected the station last week said they found about 250 infants, children and teens locked up for weeks without adequate food, water and sanitation. Authorities moved most of the children to another facility after those reports but Border Patrol returned 100 of them to the station earlier this week.

CBS News' Omar Villafranca took a tour of the Clint, Texas, facility on Wednesday. He said the conditions did not match up with those descriptions but points out this was a controlled, guided tour. Journalists were not allowed to take cameras or cell phones inside and were not allowed to talk with the children.

Villafranca reports seeing a full facility – 117 children total in a building meant to house 106. He was also shown food crates, clothing and toiletry supplies.

On Wednesday, the lawyers who recently toured this facility filed a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of endangering these children. One 12-year-old boy told the lawyers, ""I'm so hungry that I have woken up in the middle of the night with hunger."" Another, a 16-year-old girl, told them, ""the day after we arrived here, my baby began vomiting and having diarrhea. I asked to see a doctor and they did not take us.""

CBP has not returned our request for comment on the suit, but have previously said their facilities are overwhelmed and overcrowded.

Be Ready for Market Volatility on Friday,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/be-ready-for-market-volatility-on-friday/,"USDA acreage report often has market-moving implications since it gives the industry a sense of how big, or small, the major grain crops will be in any given year.

The saga of the 2019 planting season continues. Extreme weather challenges, which started months ago, have caused a record-slow planting pace and huge questions about crop quality. As of June 23, USDA reports 96% of the nation’s corn and 85% of the nation’s soybeans are planted.

While planting is finally nearing the finish line, both the corn and soybean crops are behind in development. Just 89% of the corn and 71% of the country’s soybeans were emerged as of June 23. The historical averages for emergence in late June are 99% for corn and 91% for soybeans.

Around 60% of the corn crop has condition ratings of good or excellent. Last year, 77% of the crop received those ratings. For soybeans, just 54% is good or excellent, which compares to 73% last year.

On June 28, USDA will release the annual Acreage report. Historically, this report is a strong indicator of final planted acres. But, that’s not likely the case this year, says Joe Vaclavik, founder and president of Standard Grain.

“These surveys for acreage were taken during first two weeks of June, and I think only 67% of corn acres planted as of June 2,” he says. “So, I don't know how to report can possible be accurate in regards to acreage.”

Chip Flory, host of AgriTalk, agrees.

“USDA collected data until June 17, but a lot of that data was in before June 17,” he says. “I just have a feeling that [Friday’s report] is going to include ‘intentions’ to stick with corn. The market was telling producers to try to stick with corn. Therefore, if they were going to fill it out honestly, weren't they going to say, ‘I'm still going to try to plant corn.’”

In the March Prospective Plantings report, USDA forecast 92.8 million acres of corn and 84.6 million acres of soybeans. Earlier this month in the June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report, USDA took corn acres down to 89.8 million and barely lowered soybean acres.

Ahead of the report, Paul Georgy, president and CEO of Allendale, says analysts expect the acres to be adjusted to 86.66 million acres of corn and 84.35 million acres of soybeans.

The all wheat acres are predicted to be 45.65 million acres in Friday’s report, which compares to 45.8 million acres in the June WASDE report and 45.75 million acres in the Prospective Plantings report.

“Grain markets are mixed as traders place their bets in front of a busy wrap-up to the week tomorrow,” Georgy says.

Farmers should be prepared for some volatility on Friday morning, Vaclavik says. “The acreage numbers are not likely to be accurate, and tomorrow’s report is just the start of discovering what the real acres are.”

Todd Hubbs, University of Illinois agricultural economist, agrees tomorrow’s report may provide a weak indication of corn and soybean acreage this year. (Read his recent farmdoc Daily articles: Soybean Stocks and Acreage and Corn Acreage and Stocks.)

“Uncertainty about corn acreage looks to remain in place through the summer,” he says. “The June acreage estimate may indicate the scale of acreage shifts into soybeans but prevented plant acres may not be known until later in the year.”

Yet, Hubbs says, the reports could provide clues for the direction of prices.

“The implications for soybean prices contained in the Acreage report appears set to form expectations about prices moving forward,” he says.

For corn, weakening demand should not be a hindrance to a continued price rally since the supply situation is quite dismal, he adds.

“Strengthening corn basis and futures prices point to marketing strategies involving delayed pricing of the new crop,” Hubbs says. “Price objectives need to be set to take advantage of current corn market dynamics.”

Hubbs says it is essential for farmers to have a marketing strategy since supply shocks provide a limited time frame to take advantage of pricing opportunities. “The strategy probably should include plans for pricing some of the 2020 crop.”

Anticipation Mounts for Busy Friday by Paul Georgy"
Devin Nunes: Christopher Steele must be interviewed by DOJ to answer questions on anti-Trump dossier,https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/christopher-steele-congress-devin-nunes,"House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes has called on British ex-spy Christopher Steele to be interviewed to answer key questions on the anti-Trump dossier.

Nunes, R-Calif., said Monday on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" that Steele also must be interviewed by U.S. Attorney for Connecticut John Durham, whom Attorney General William Barr selected in April to examine the origins of the Russia investigation.

""The Clinton campaign and Democrats were paying Christopher Steele to do this,"" he said, noting how the Clinton campaign and DNC, through the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, funded the dossier's creation.

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL CITED STEELE IN EMAILS WITH OHR AFTER FLAGGING CREDIBILITY ISSUES TO FBI, DOCS REVEAL

""We were never able to interview Christopher Steele. I think he needs to be interviewed by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.""

Regarding Steele's work, host Tucker Carlson pointed out that Nunes sent a letter to the FBI requesting information about a 2016 meeting between the ex-MI6 spy and State Department official Kathleen Kavalec.

Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavalec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims apparently were false, to a senior FBI executive.

On that front, Nunes said he would give the FBI until Friday before he sends a criminal referral to the Justice Department, remarking that the bureau's failure to respond would be ""clearly obstructing our investigation.""

Nunes added that the British government also should reach out to the U.S. to assist in the matter.

""I think the Brits have a lot of answers to give to the United States,"" he said.

""The bottom line is, the guy was being paid by the Democrats. To do what? To dirty up Donald Trump and make it look like he had ties to Russians. The only one who had ties to Russians would be the Democrats themselves because Christopher Steele was supposedly talking to Russians."""
"Top cybersecurity official: U.S. should employ ""range of tools"" against active adversaries",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chris-krebs-top-dhs-cybersecurity-official-says-us-should-employ-range-of-tools-against-adversaries/,"Editor's note: This ""Intelligence Matters"" interview was taped on June 19, before recent cyber-related events in Iran took place.

As cyberattacks against targets in the United States grow more pervasive, frequent and sophisticated, the U.S. government should leverage a diverse array of retaliatory and response measures, according to Chris Krebs, the top cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

""When we understand that there is an active adversary — whether it's a criminal group, a proxy group, a nation state — the U.S. government needs to act using a range of tools both overt and covert, offensive legal sanctions, diplomatic,"" Krebs said. ""We have a broad range of tools.""

Krebs, who leads the recently elevated Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at DHS, spoke with ""Intelligence Matters"" host and CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell about the country's response options in what has become an increasingly broad threat landscape. As more critical systems in the U.S. become internet-connected and more foreign cyber actors refine their intelligence-gathering and offensive techniques, Krebs said, private industries and the government have no choice but to work more closely together.

(The interview with Krebs was taped before news emerged that U.S. Cyber Command had taken retaliatory strikes against Iranian targets and before CISA issued a warning to U.S. entities about a recent rise in malicious cyber activity by Iranian regime actors and proxies.)

""If we learned anything, I think, through 2016 and the Russian interference with our elections, it's: no single organization, no single state, no locality can go at this problem alone,"" Krebs said.

""When you're facing a concerted effort from the Russian military, the GRU, the SVR, the FSB, it's going to take a team effort to push back and harden the underlying infrastructure, harden our people, our citizenry, and then strike back when we have to,"" he told Morell.

In his role atop CISA, Krebs is charged with leading cybersecurity defensive efforts across the U.S. government and helping private sector organizations that own or operate critical infrastructure access information about potential threats.

""Over the intervening 15, 16 years since 2003 when [DHS] was stood up, the threat landscape has shifted dramatically,"" he said. ""We have peer and near-peer adversaries. Great power competition is a thing again.""

China and Russia are among the most capable and aggressive adversaries the U.S. faces, Krebs told Morell, though their long-term strategies have differences.

The Chinese government appears to be jockeying for economic position and seeking to make the U.S. into something of a ""client state,"" Krebs explained.

""They're not trying to disrupt us, necessarily. They're trying to manipulate us,"" he said. ""And they're getting there by intellectual property theft, acquiring U.S. companies, requiring U.S. companies to come into the Chinese market to join in [joint ventures] and tech transfer.""

""And they're as effective as they've ever been,"" Krebs told Morell. ""They're improving their tradecraft. And rather than going that whack-a-mole, onesie-twosie approach, they're going to the points of aggregation. And they're just sweeping up a whole bunch of information while they're doing it,"" he said, citing a December 2018 indictment of Chinese government-linked actors who targeted cloud service providers.

Russia, by contrast, is playing a more destabilizing role, he said.

""I look at Russia as trying to disrupt the system, particularly from an elections and undermining-democracy perspective,"" Krebs said. ""They're trying to knock us off our global position as a leader of the free world ... And that's really what it comes down to.""

""Russia's not trying to win the game. They're trying [to cause] everyone else to lose,"" he said.

As CISA works to shore up state and local election systems ahead of the 2020 election, Krebs said, his team is active in all 50 states and engaging with nearly 2,000 local election jurisdictions. CISA has also offered briefings on basic cybersecurity measures to all the presidential candidates who have entered the race.

He expressed hope that CISA's warnings and advice were breaking through.

""I mean, gosh, if you didn't learn from 2016, the you're not listening,"" he said. ""And shame on us if we're not ready this time around.""
