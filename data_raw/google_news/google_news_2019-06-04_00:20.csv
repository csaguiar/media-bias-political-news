Meghan Markle a no-show at banquet for Trump,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/03/meghan-markle-a-no-show-at-banquet-for-trump-after-nasty-comment/,"Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, was a no-show at the Buckingham Palace banquet for President Trump’s state visit to England on Monday.

Markle — who is married to Prince Harry and on maternity leave after giving birth to their first child, Archie — sat out the dinner amid a feud with the president that included him calling the former actress “nasty” in an interview with a British newspaper.

Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, the wife of Prince William, was in attendance at the banquet as were Trump’s adult children.

The American-born Markle also missed a royal luncheon at the palace with Trump and first lady Melania Trump earlier Monday – although Harry attended.

Harry apparently also say out the dinner.

In an interview with The Sun published on Saturday, Trump was asked about Markle referring to him as “misogynistic” and “divisive” and her claim that she would move to Canada if he was elected president in 2016.

“I didn’t know that. What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty,” he said, according to the newspaper."
"Pompeo says Trump open to talks with Iran, in shift from “maximum pressure” policy.",https://slate.com,['Fred Kaplan'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-pompeo-iran-negotiations-pressure.html,"Photo illustration by Slate.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pulled a head-spinning switcheroo over the weekend, telling reporters that the Trump administration is ready to hold talks with Iran with “no preconditions.”

On the one hand, this is a welcome development. Until now, Pompeo has insisted on 12 steps Iranian leaders must take—all of them requiring sharp shifts in policy, some a surrender of sovereignty—before the United States would sit down with them at the same table. The clear message was that Pompeo wasn’t interested in talks.

On the other hand, this new pivot marks another sign that President Donald Trump and Pompeo are terrible negotiators and that, when it comes to foreign policy, the United States under their helm is a ship adrift in a stormy sea.

A little over a year ago, Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal—which President Barack Obama and the leaders of five other nations had negotiated with Iran three years earlier—and reimposed economic sanctions that had been lifted as part of the deal. He then threatened to sanction other countries—including those that had signed the nuclear deal—if they continued doing business with Iran. He called the policy “maximum pressure.”

The policy’s aim was unclear: Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton said they wanted to make the Iranians scream until their regime collapsed; Trump claimed he merely wanted them to come back to the table and negotiate a “better” deal.

Either way, Pompeo’s new statement scuttles whatever chances the pressure campaign had of working.

Not that the chances were great to begin with. Iran’s economy is feeling a squeeze. But foreign interference only strengthens domestic support for the regime—and if the regime did collapse, it would likely be replaced not by western-leaning liberals (who don’t form an organized party) but by the most hard-line factions or the military.

This new pivot marks another sign that Trump and Pompeo are terrible negotiators.

“Maximum pressure” didn’t work so well in Trump’s approach to North Korea, either. It may have helped bring Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table, but once there, Kim gave up nothing. Trump was the one who wound up star-struck, and Kim’s scientists have continued enriching uranium and building missiles unabated.

But let’s say maximum pressure could yield results in some country, under some scenario; it might yet have had an effect—though not necessarily a desirable one—in Iran. This is now no longer the case. Pompeo’s shift unmasks maximum pressure as a tentative bluff. Targets of Trump’s belligerent rhetoric, from now on, can sit back and wait until his impatience for results intensifies and he slackens his demands.

In the case of Iran, the slackening began in mid-May, when Trump seemed suddenly to realize that the path he’d undertaken might lead to war, especially with Bolton—a longtime advocate of forcible regime change—in the driver’s seat. Trump told reporters he wanted the Iranian leaders to call him; he even gave Swiss officials—who had served as an intermediary between Washington and Tehran back when the two capitals had no direct contact—a phone number where he could be reached.

Pompeo, who has spent the past two years—first as CIA director, now as the top diplomat—amassing power by parroting the master in the White House, had issued his 12 preconditions a year ago, when he thought (quite reasonably) that Trump wanted regime change, not talks. Now Trump has said he wants talks, and Pompeo has changed his patter.

The new position is the correct one; there is no reason why the United States shouldn’t resume talks, without preconditions, especially since Iran has continued abiding by the terms of the nuclear deal. But by shifting positions so drastically, Pompeo has diminished the credibility of whatever position he and Trump adopt next—and wiped out whatever leverage they might have had in advancing it.

All this might be the stuff of tactical missteps, as distinct from strategic blunders, if the Trump administration had a position—a set of long-term policies and goals—toward Iran to begin with. But it doesn’t. In this sense, there is no such thing as “the Trump administration.” In every presidency before this one, the top officials or their deputies assembled in National Security Council meetings to hammer out differences and devise a common policy. Under Trump, there are no (or very few) NSC meetings. There are only the scattered Cabinet secretaries and advisers, trying to make their disparate agendas align with the broad direction that the president seems to be taking—and there are Trump’s eruptive tweets, which can spin the compass and upset those agendas on a moment’s notice.

Even this rampant randomness might be a bit more manageable if the president didn’t so often act like—let’s not mince words here—a raving lunatic. Take his tweet early Monday morning, tapped out as Air Force One was about to land in London for a state visit with the royal family:

.@SadiqKhan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly “nasty” to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019

Trump then added:

....Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019

Whatever London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s sins (and they consist mainly of not caring much for Trump), what kind of state leader says such things, publicly, minutes before touching down on the mayor’s city and meeting with the mayor’s queen? This reveals, more clearly than any official statement he might recite, how little Trump values—or understands—diplomacy."
"Group trolls Trump during UK visit by projecting Obama approval ratings, U.S.S. John McCain hat on landmarks",https://www.foxnews.com,['Anna Hopkins'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-london-trolled-obama-mccain,"President Trump is no stranger to trolling his adversaries on Twitter, but an activist group attempted to get under his skin in the flesh on the opening day of his trip to the United Kingdom.

The group projected a graphic onto the Tower of London showing former President Barack Obama's approval ratings in Britain compared to Trump's: 72 percent to 21 percent, respectively, the image claims.

""Hi @realDonaldTrump,"" a tweet from the group's account reads. ""Just so you know, you’re wildly unpopular here in Britain. SAD! People REALLY don’t like you (though they love @BarackObama). Hope you like seeing your FAILING approval numbers projected onto the Tower of London.""

TRUMP BEGINS UK VISIT MEETING QUEEN, SPARRING WITH LONDON MAYOR

They also plastered a photo of a hat bearing the image of the U.S.S. John McCain onto Madame Tussaud's wax museum. The group said it chose the image after the U.S. Navy confirmed that a request was made to place the ship named after the deceased Arizona senator out of sight during the president's recent state visit to Japan. Trump and McCain were vocal adversaries and in the months since McCain's passing, the president has continued to criticize him.

Trump later denied any knowledge of the ship's movement but said whoever made the request was ""well meaning.""

The images were a part of a nation-wide protest to Trump's visit, illustrated by banners reading ""Resist Trump"" which hung from London's Vauxhall bridge.

Trump is angry he can’t watch Fox News in the UK,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/3/18650282/trump-cnn-fox-news-uk,"Hours after arriving in the United Kingdom for three days of vital meetings, President Donald Trump complained about not having access to one of his favorite home comforts: Fox News.

The president first stopped to visit the American ambassador’s residence in London on Monday. While Trump is accustomed to seeing his favorite conservative commentators on television when he walks around the White House, he had no such luck at the diplomatic home.

Here’s why: CNN International airs in more than 200 countries and territories, including the UK. Viewers can watch Fox News in many nations too, but it’s not available in Britain.

21st Century Fox, the news channel’s parent company, took it off the UK’s airwaves in 2017 because it didn’t prove a commercial success. What’s more, the UK’s media regulator said that the conservative channel didn’t abide by the country’s impartiality rules.

So even if staffers at America’s British embassy wanted to watch Fox & Friends or Hannity on TV, they’d be out of luck.

That clearly doesn’t sit well with the president, who spent valuable prep time firing off two tweets decrying the lack of Fox News in his life.

Just arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that @CNN is the primary source of news available from the U.S. After watching it for a short while, I turned it off. All negative & so much Fake News, very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop. Why doesn’t owner @ATT do something? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019

I believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @ATT, they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN, which is dying in the ratings anyway. It is so unfair with such bad, Fake News! Why wouldn’t they act. When the World watches @CNN, it gets a false picture of USA. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019

Trump was already in a combative mood, only hours earlier calling London Mayor Sadiq Khan a “stone cold” loser in response to the British politician’s less-than-flattering op-ed about him.

But it’s not so surprising that Trump lambasted CNN. He’s long feuded with the outlet for not covering him as favorably as Fox News does, going so far in 2017 as to tweet out a video of himself punching the CNN logo superimposed on a person’s face. (Yes, that actually happened.)

He took his hatred to new heights when he also advocated for a boycott of CNN’s parent company AT&T in his tweets, supposedly over the cable news network’s coverage of him. Not only is it that request a blatant attack on American journalism, it’s also the American president calling for an American company to lose business simply because he’s unhappy with it. That only adds to Trump’s longstanding effort to stop AT&T’s massive merger with Time Warner.

But the core of Trump’s complaint right now seems to be something much more immediate and personal: He just wants to watch Fox News. It’d make him feel better.

That’s quite the insight into the president: Ahead of big diplomatic engagements — in this case with the queen and UK Prime Minister Theresa May, among others — Trump let the world know that all it takes to throw him off his game is to put CNN on TV and keep Fox News out of view. One could imagine adversarial nations thinking of ways to ensure Trump only has access to CNN when he visits them.

For now, a fired-up Trump has to find a way to be diplomatic while visiting one of his key allies — or risk disaster at the start of his European tour."
The Day GOP Resistance to Trump Died,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['David A. Graham', 'Staff Writer At']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/end-republican-trump-resistance/590935/,"Read: The 2020 U.S. presidential race: a cheat sheet

Consider National Review, the grand old organ of the conservative movement. In 2016, in the most ambitious crossover event in right-wing-media history, the magazine published a collection of conservative writers of all stripes writing in opposition to Trump’s candidacy. The gesture was dramatic, though a little too late. Around the same time, one of National Review’s writers, David French, considered a quixotic challenge to Trump in the name of a principled conservatism. Trump’s triumph was a bitter revelation for these writers—that the GOP was not the principled, orderly Burkean party they had imagined, but rather an unruly populist groundswell.

And today? The pundits have largely accommodated themselves to the GOP as it is, rather than as they imagined it was. The National Review editor Rich Lowry, who oversaw that issue, routinely writes sympathetically or in defense of Trump. Jonah Goldberg, one of the magazine’s most stalwart anti-Trumpers, departed on Friday for a new conservative-media venture. French has become, probably unfairly, the target in an otherwise largely inscrutable internecine battle among conservative pundits about approach. Erick Erickson, who is not part of the NR crew but contributed to the never-Trump issue, earlier this year endorsed Trump for reelection and has become a vocal defender of the president.

If Trump loses his bid for reelection (and perhaps even if he wins), the 2020 Republican primary—or rather, the lack thereof—will be a mystery for future political scientists to puzzle over. How could a president who is historically unpopular, careens from crisis to crisis, and faces a serious threat of impeachment cruise to renomination without a serious challenge?

In explaining his decision not to run, Hogan cited his obligations to the voters who elected him: “I have a commitment to the 6 million people of Maryland and a lot of work to do, things we haven’t completed.” Yet he, like Kasich, also acknowledged the political reality of the situation. With the president’s approval rating among Republicans at an astronomical 90 percent (about double the general population’s approval), what’s the point in throwing yourself in front of the Trump train?

There is a moral case for doing so, which is basically Weld’s: Trump has no business being president, and so challenging him is the right thing to do, even if it’s doomed. “We need to have a bigger tent and find a way to get things done,” Hogan told the Post. “We need some civility and bipartisanship. Our politics are broken. Washington is broken. But we have a story to tell.” Yet Hogan is eschewing the simplest way to tell that story.

Alan Jacobs: What a clash between conservatives reveals

Yet one could also make a case for running based on, believe it or not, polling of Republican voters. Despite Trump’s strong support inside the party, 43 percent of GOP voters say they want to see a primary challenge to the president, even as 56 percent do not, according to Pew. That’s a slight increase from last fall. Pat Buchanan’s 1992 primary challenge to President George H. W. Bush shows the impact a long-shot challenge can have. (Then again, Bush entered the campaign popular overall but weakened within the GOP—a mirror image of Trump, who is more popular within his party than among the general public.)"
Trump’s Love Affair With the Royal Family Dates Back to His Mother,https://www.nytimes.com,['Ellen Barry'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/world/europe/trump-mother-queen-uk-visit.html,"LONDON — One of President Trump’s earliest memories, one he routinely recounts to journalists and biographers, is of watching his mother watch television, so enthralled that she barely moved for hours, on the day in 1953 that Queen Elizabeth was crowned.

He was only 6 years old, but he understood that the gilded spectacle unfolding more than 3,400 miles away inside Westminster Abbey struck a chord in his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, a poor girl who had immigrated from Scotland and who had worked for a time as a housemaid in a grand mansion. He also understood that, for some reason, the same spectacle offended his father.

“I also remember my father that day, pacing around impatiently, ‘For Christ’s sake, Mary,’ he said, ‘enough is enough, turn it off. They’re all a bunch of con artists,’ ” Mr. Trump recalled, years later. “My mother didn’t even look up. They were total opposites in that sense.”

Mr. Trump tells this story in his book “The Art of the Deal” as an explanation for why he was not satisfied with simply inheriting his father’s business. His mother had passed on a love of spectacle and grandeur, as expressed in the coronation — “loftier dreams” of “splendor and magnificence.”"

A new deal between the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission will see U.S. regulators divide and conquer as they expand their oversight of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook, according to multiple reports.

New details have emerged of an agreement between the two U.S. regulators that would see the Federal Trade Commission take the reins in antitrust investigations of Amazon and Facebook, while the Department of Justice will oversee investigations of Alphabet’s Google business and Apple.

Shares of Apple’s stock tumbled on news of the Justice Department’s role in overseeing the company, which was first reported by Reuters even as the company was in the middle of its developer conference celebrating all things Apple.

Google has been here before. Eight years ago, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Google for antitrust violations, ultimately determining that the company had not violated any antitrust or anti-competitive statutes in its display of search results.

On Friday, The Washington Post reported that the Justice Department was initiating a federal antitrust investigation into Google’s business practices, according to multiple sources.

That report was followed by additional reporting from The Wall Street Journal indicating that Facebook would be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission."
Venezuela’s Two Presidents Collide,https://www.newyorker.com,"['Jon Lee Anderson', 'Naomi Fry', 'Jim Derogatis', 'Ta-Nehisi Coates', 'Patrick Berry', 'Valeria Luiselli']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/10/venezuelas-two-presidents-collide,"There are a few rules for how to topple a government. Make sure that you have the military on your side, or at least enough of it to dissuade unsympathetic soldiers from intervening. Spread money around, to inspire loyalty. Determine which part of the populace will join your uprising, which part will resist, and which part will stand aside and watch. Neutralize the resistance quickly; take over the media so that you can disseminate orders. Once the ruler is displaced, kill him or hustle him out of the country as fast as you can. When Juan Guaidó, the leader of Venezuela’s uprising, announced the “final phase of Operation Freedom,” on April 30th, he seemed to have done none of those things. He arrived before dawn outside the La Carlota airbase, in Caracas, and recorded a video declaring that the time had come to force out the country’s increasingly tyrannical ruler, Nicolás Maduro. Guaidó, thirty-five years old, had recently been named the speaker of the National Assembly, and he looked a bit surprised to find himself where he was. With a few dozen military sympathizers at his side, he said, “There have been years of sacrifice. There have been years of persecution. There have been years of fear, even. Today, that fear is overcome.” The previous May, Maduro had been elected to a second six-year term, but the election was widely viewed as illegitimate. One criticism was that his principal rivals were either in exile, under house arrest, or banned from political activity. Another was that his first term had been so disastrous that an honest victory seemed inconceivable. Maduro had entered government as a protégé of the charismatic leftist Hugo Chávez, who ruled for fourteen years and used the country’s oil wealth to bolster a “Pink Tide” of socialist-leaning governments in Latin America. Since Chávez’s death, in 2013, Maduro has presided over Venezuela’s unravelling. Its economy collapsed as the price of crude oil fell; corruption and mismanagement made things worse. Hyperinflation, which is expected to reach ten million per cent this year, has left the currency worthless. Hunger and disease are epidemic. In Caracas, people go panning in the filthy water of the Guaire River for gold jewelry that has been dropped down sinks; butchers sell cow hooves to customers desperate for protein; women give up careers to work as prostitutes in neighboring countries. More than ten per cent of Venezuela’s population has fled. Maduro has responded blithely, alternately denying the problems and advising his departed citizens to “stop cleaning toilets abroad and come home.” The current crisis began in 2016, when the National Assembly launched a referendum to remove Maduro from power, and he responded by creating a rival legislature, filled with his loyalists. Months of demonstrations followed, and more than a hundred protesters were killed. As tensions rose, the persecution of political dissidents, whom Maduro has derided to me as “counter-revolutionaries,” grew more common. Last August, as Maduro presided over a military parade, an armed drone exploded overhead, in an apparent assassination attempt. No one died, but an opposition politician named Fernando Albán was arrested. Three days later, he fell to his death from the tenth floor of the intelligence headquarters. The official explanation was suicide, but rumors persisted that agents had drowned him in “the bathtub,” a local equivalent of waterboarding, and then thrown his body out a window. At a rally on January 23rd, Guaidó invoked a constitutional clause to assert that Maduro’s sham election had rendered the office vacant, and to name himself Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Since then, the country has been caught in a seesawing conflict between two Presidents—one spuriously elected but backed by the armed forces, the other self-proclaimed but endorsed by much of the Western world. Since taking office, Donald Trump has frequently called for Maduro to be removed, by military coup if necessary. Within minutes of Guaidó’s speech, Trump publicly recognized him as the rightful leader of Venezuela. John Bolton, Trump’s pugnacious national-security adviser, added a warning: “Any violence and intimidation against U.S. diplomatic personnel, Venezuela’s democratic leader, Juan Guaido, or the National Assembly itself would represent a grave assault on the rule of law and will be met with a significant response.” More than fifty other governments, including those of Canada and most countries in the European Union, quickly endorsed Guaidó. His supporters began referring to him as “Presidente” and to Maduro as “the usurper.” When the final phase of Operation Freedom commenced, though, it was a disaster. At the airbase, Guaidó’s political mentor, Leopoldo López, appeared unexpectedly, after several years under house arrest, but stood by silently, looking wary and slightly dazed. Guaidó’s speech for the video cameras seemed hastily improvised. In the middle of it, a cell phone rang for several seconds before someone turned it off. “Today, brave soldiers, brave patriots, brave men loyal to the Constitution have responded to our call,” Guaidó announced. But not many soldiers seemed to be joining the fight. A few thousand civilians gathered near La Carlota, where loyalist troops surrounded them, sometimes firing guns. Assault vehicles drove through the crowds, scattering the protesters. Within a few hours, the soldiers who had joined Guaidó sought refuge in the Brazilian Embassy. That evening, Maduro gave a speech, claiming victory over a small group of plotters who had “handed their souls over to the coup-mongering far right.” For three days, Guaidó was missing, and rumors spread that he was sleeping at a different foreign embassy every night. Finally, he appeared at a press conference, in the back yard of a house belonging to political allies. Despite the mayhem in the country, Guaidó smiled imperturbably and flashed a thumbs-up. When asked about the fracaso—the failed uprising—he had a ready answer. “It’s true that Maduro, the usurper, is still in power,” he said. “And that’s a fracaso for all Venezuela. But we are going to continue going forward, to fight for change.” Guaidó’s calm determination suggested a young man with unusual political acumen, and also one with powerful friends.

One morning in March, a few weeks before the uprising, Guaidó took me with him to Vargas, his home state, on the Caribbean coast. For the trip, an hour’s drive from Guaidó’s apartment in Caracas, we sat in the back of an armored S.U.V. A man in owlish glasses sat between us. He introduced himself as Davíd, the President’s astrologer. “My laser eye surgery was expensive but worth every penny.” As we set out, Davíd said that he hoped we wouldn’t meet any colectivos—groups of paramilitary thugs, who roam around on motorcycles, shooting at anti-government protesters. The colectivos, he declared, were “la encarnación del mal”—the incarnation of evil—and “representatives of the Devil on earth.” Riding in front was Guaidó’s chief of staff, Roberto Marrero. An extroverted man with a goatee and the demeanor of a stage villain, Marrero lightened the mood by playing us a video clip on his phone. It showed a young man riffing on an irreverent taunt that has become a ritual across Venezuela: one person shouts “Maduro!” and everyone within earshot shouts back “Coño e’tu madre! ”—a supremely rude reference to his mother’s anatomy. (In Buenos Aires, where there is a burgeoning Venezuelan expat community, a sympathizer recently opened a restaurant called Maduro Coño e’Tu Madre.) In Marrero’s clip, the young man had turned the taunt into a rap, with a reggaetón beat and a raucous chorus harmonizing in the background. Marrero said delightedly, “That’s Vargas style, man. It’s where we’re going.” Along the highway that leads down the mountain from Caracas to the sea, Guaidó pointed out the spot where he had been arrested by Maduro’s intelligence agents. It had happened on January 13th, eight days after his inauguration as speaker, during which he had condemned Maduro as “illegitimate.” He was held for only a few hours, but passing drivers had caught the arrest on camera; they spread video of it on social media, causing a global outcry and galvanizing the opposition. Guaidó quickly became the center of an international effort to depose an autocrat. Everything has happened fast for Guaidó, and at times his inexperience shows. During our car trip, he was boyishly restless, drumming on his knees and distractedly whistling a tune. At one point, he recalled an encounter he’d had the previous day, when a little girl approached him and proclaimed, “Queremos futuro”—“We want a future.” Guaidó repeated the phrase several times, imitating her falsetto, before breaking into a giggle. Someone who works closely with the Trump Administration on Venezuela policy told me, “Look, Guaidó is not yet a leader. But you have to understand, the Venezuelans are so desperate at this point that if you put a dog on a podium they’d vote for it.” He was very much an accidental President. The job of speaker of the National Assembly rotates among parties; when the new term began, last December, it happened to be his party’s turn. There were three people ahead of Guaidó for the job. But Leopoldo López, the head of the party, was under house arrest; his second-in-command had been forced into exile; and the third man was under political asylum in the Chilean Embassy. Guaidó was young, likable, and a quick learner, and, in a country where all the experienced politicians had failed, he was a virtual unknown. Unlike most Venezuelan officials, he did not seem to be personally corrupt. Slim and fresh-faced, with brown skin and a wide smile, Guaidó invites comparisons to the young Barack Obama, a perception that he has encouraged by adopting the slogan “Yes, we can!” Chely Escalona, one of Guaidó’s former schoolteachers, told me, “Let’s be honest here. Juan Guaidó is an ordinary guy, nothing special about him. A nice guy, yes, but ordinary. And that’s fine! We have to get past this strongman fixation we have in Venezuela.” Guaidó grew up, with four siblings, in a suburb of La Guaira, a port town at the foot of the jungly mountains below Caracas. As we reached the coast and began driving east, he pointed out familiar places. There was the international airport of Maiquetía, where his father once worked as a pilot. There was a series of white sandy beaches and beat-up resort hotels—a traditional weekend escape for caraqueños. Entering La Guaira, we passed a small stadium, erected by the government. Guaidó scowled. The stadium had been under construction for seven years, and, seat for seat, “it cost more than Yankee Stadium,” he claimed. “The corruption has finished them off,” he said, disgustedly, of the chavistas. Venezuela’s oil wealth is like a spigot, he added: “As long as water comes out, everything’s fine. It’s only when it stops flowing that people start asking what’s up. And that’s what’s happened here.” Guaidó’s parents divorced when he was young, and his father immigrated to the Canary Islands, where he now works as a taxi-driver. But Guaidó was surrounded by family, and he was popular in the neighborhood, an avid salsa dancer and a fan of the local baseball team, the Guaira Sharks. Things changed in 1999, when, during his senior year of high school, a mudslide, swollen by days of heavy rain, crashed down on the town. The catastrophe killed thousands of people and left many more homeless. Guaidó’s house was destroyed; so was his school. Chávez had come to power earlier that year, and the mudslide was among his first major tests as Venezuela’s leader. His response was widely seen as a colossal failure. Soldiers sent to Vargas as rescuers were accused of lootings, killings, and other crimes; a government program to rebuild public housing and other infrastructure was inexplicably slow. “El desastre de Vargas,” as Venezuelans call it, was the turning point of Guaidó’s young life; he invokes it constantly in speeches. Displaced by the catastrophe, his family moved to a temporary home in Caracas, where he was enrolled in a new high school. He stayed in Caracas to attend a Catholic university, and graduated in 2007, with a degree in industrial engineering. In those years, Chávez’s regime was following an increasingly radical socialist ideology. Guaidó and several other students formed a movement to oppose him. He and his comrades became known as the 2007 Generation, and a number of them have remained active in the opposition. In 2009, Guaidó joined Leopoldo López to found Voluntad Popular—a right-of-center party that is part of a broad coalition opposed to the regime. The next year, while still in his twenties, he entered the National Assembly. López—thirteen years older, a charismatic graduate of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government—became the opposition’s most prominent leader. But many poor Venezuelans suspected that his loyalties ultimately lay with the sifrinos, the country’s wealthy class, which is predominantly white and fiercely anti-chavista. He was also a target of the regime. In 2014, he was arrested, after leading a series of protests, and given a thirteen-year sentence. When Guaidó became the face of the opposition, his humble origins helped attract sympathy to the cause, in Venezuela and in the United States. A former senior U.S. official told me, with a laugh, “We needed someone who wasn’t a member of the Caracas Polo Club.” At his home one morning, Guaidó introduced me to his wife, Fabiana, a slender woman of twenty-seven, who greeted me with a shy smile. They met at a Voluntad Popular youth rally in 2013, when Fabiana had just graduated from college with a degree in journalism, and they married soon afterward; they now have a two-year-old daughter named Miranda. At the apartment, Guaidó picked up Miranda and kissed her, encouraging her to wave to me. The apartment was a no-frills two-bedroom, with a galley kitchen, a narrow living room, and a view of nearby apartment buildings. Guaidó laughed: “It’s not much, but it’s home.” An aide pointed out that the apartment was at least safe. One day while Guaidó was away, he said, special-forces agents had showed up and intimidated Fabiana and Miranda. Watchful neighbors had seen the agents approaching; they berated the men until they left. The aide said, “Here, everyone is with him, and they are watching out for him.” That afternoon, Guaidó had lunch at El Mosquero (roughly, the Place of Flies), an open-air fish market next to the Guaira port. He sat at a Formica table to eat empanadas; within minutes, he was mobbed by locals, calling out “Guaidó Presidente!” and taking selfies with him. An elderly woman cooed, “My love! My prince!” Others kissed and hugged him. A man told me that he had worked in the port for thirty-five years, but now there were no jobs, and he could not feed his family. He reached across the table to fist-bump Guaidó, and instructed him, “You have to go forward, never back.” A woman with a walker was seated next to Guaidó and given an empanada. Between bites, she raised her voice and yelled, like a soccer fan, “We have to win!” Away from the crowd, Davíd informed me that Guaidó was a descendant of Guaicaipuro, a sixteenth-century indigenous chieftain who had fought the Spanish conquest before being ambushed and killed. Chávez had resurrected Guaicaipuro as a national hero, ordering that his remains be symbolically reinterred in the National Pantheon. Seeing my bemusement, Davíd explained that all of Venezuela’s leaders were the reincarnations of predecessors. Chávez wanted to be Simón Bolívar but was really Guaicaipuro, while Guaidó was mostly Guaicaipuro, with a little bit of Tiuna, another indigenous chief. Maduro, however, was just “the axis of evil.” Davíd explained that “the Cubans”—Maduro’s rumored team of secret advisers—had practiced the “dark arts” of Santería to lead Maduro to evil. “Venezuela is ordained to be the best country in the region, and after a world war, which is now unfolding, it will receive many people from all over the world,” he said. “In order to be ready, however, it must be liberated.” Guaidó would bring about that liberation, he claimed: “I met him in December, and I told him, ‘You are the Chosen One.’ ” Many of Guaidó’s followers were similarly fervent, but for more practical reasons: he offered hope, and he was willing to risk making a public argument for sweeping change. After lunch, his team drove to a small plaza, where he jumped onto a stage and gave a speech. It was, like all his speeches, economical and inspirational. He told the crowd that it wouldn’t be long before “we the people” occupied Miraflores, the Presidential palace, where “the usurper” Maduro still lived. But a long road lay ahead, and unity and fortitude were essential. A group of women in the crowd raised their hands in the air, like believers at a Pentecostal sermon. One had her eyes closed, a beatific expression on her face.

In March, Venezuela’s electrical grid crashed, and the lights went out all over the country. The blackout, or apagón, lasted for five days, deepening the crisis. As Maduro went on television to accuse the Trump Administration of launching an “electromagnetic attack,” most Venezuelans blamed governmental ineptitude and negligence. It emerged that underbrush had not been cleared around key electrical installations, and fires had broken out. The effects were calamitous. The Internet failed, water stopped running, and hospitals scrambled to keep incubators and dialysis machines going. Satellite images showed Venezuela as a dark spot on the South American map, like a black hole in a starry constellation. I had arrived in Caracas on the second day of the apagón. The airport had no electricity or air-conditioning, and immigration and customs officials appeared hot and exhausted. The rest of the country was effectively shut down: Maduro had closed schools and told public employees to stay home. At the hotel where I was booked, the generator had burned out, so the elevator didn’t work and there was no water. The hotels with functioning generators were full, their lobbies packed with well-to-do Venezuelan families and their servants. In an elegant hotel favored by Caracas’s upper class, I saw a woman in designer leisure clothes handing the reception staff a wad of crisp hundred-dollar bills, as she lamented being forced to leave her Cavalier King Charles spaniel alone in her house. She had gone to visit him, she said, and found him “all depressed, pobrecito.” The receptionists clucked sympathetically. “Be careful with your third wish. Another book you might already have read would be a bummer.” Throughout the city, the opposing sides had marked territory. On the highway into Caracas, graffiti in the Soviet style that Maduro favors showed his profile linked with Chávez’s. A newly erected signboard portrayed Simón Bolívar, the great hero of the chavista revolution, with the aphorism “If tyranny is chaos, revolution is order.” In the middle-class opposition strongholds of Altamira and Los Palos Grandes, there were messages spray-painted on walls: “Maduro = Murderer,” “Medicine is not a privilege.” Someone had defaced a “Long live Maduro” sign, replacing the President’s name with “hunger.” On the raised highway that runs through Caracas, a convoy of armored personnel carriers belonging to the National Guard had blocked an exit. On the road below, hundreds of people had gathered to march in support of the opposition, but their progress was stopped by Guardsmen poised with riot gear and guns. After dark, the streets were eerily silent. Caracas was one of the world’s most dangerous cities at the best of times; now it felt flatly apocalyptic. Masked colectivo thugs roamed the backstreets on motorbikes. One night, after midnight, I saw that soldiers had blocked the darkened approaches to the Miraflores palace. Outside, the embers of rubber tires were still burning where protest barricades had been erected. Wherever there was power, people gathered to plug in their phones. Near a mobile-phone relay tower, some had pulled up their cars to check e-mail. Their hazard signals, blinking in the darkness, were the only light that could be seen.

The caraqueños refer to their slums as los cerros—the hills—because they occupy the mountainsides above Caracas. Some extend for miles, spreading over hilltops and down into canyons, where countless people live in red brick shanties and unpainted cement huts. The state is effectively nonexistent in the cerros, except for a few services instituted during the Chávez era: monthly food handouts, small allowances, and teams of Cuban doctors who provide primary health care. Even these services have become irregular, and life is precarious. Unemployment and crime are ubiquitous. Residents usually get electricity by cannibalizing weak current from municipal lines. Now even that was unavailable. On the third day of the apagón, I visited San Blas, a grimy, defoliated area of the sprawling Petare slum, and came across a group of people lined up on a dirt road with plastic buckets. At the front of the line, a spigot, linked to an underground spring, poked up from a pool of muddy water. It gave out only a thin trickle, and each bucket took nearly half an hour to fill. The people sat in the scant shade of nearby houses, slumped from exhaustion. A woman near the front of the line said that she had been waiting since before dawn, nine hours earlier. It would be two more hours before it was her turn. The people around her nodded; everyone was in the same predicament. An older woman said that the water problems predated the apagón; there had been no running water for a month in San Blas, where thirty thousand residents shared three spigots. No one from the government had come to inspect, or to supply water from cistern trucks. With a disgusted look, she said, “It’s been like this since the Fourth Republic,” the forty-year period of democracy that preceded Chávez. “Back in those days, we had water all the time. But these people”—she waved down the hill toward the authorities—“do nothing for anyone but themselves.” Most of her listeners were too young to remember life before Chávez. All they knew was that they had no water, and that lining up with a bucket was the way to get some. When I asked a woman if she was planning to go into the city to join one of Guaidó’s demonstrations, she shook her head and gave me an uncomprehending look. Guaidó often says that his message is gaining support in the cerros, but most people I spoke to there seemed too accustomed to crisis to believe in the possibility of transformative change. At the summit of the Petare hill, a shopkeeper looked out from the half-closed grilles of his storefront. He had lost all his refrigerated food, and couldn’t operate the oven he used to bake bread, so he had nothing to sell except batteries, candy, and a few other sundries. Shrugging, he said, “There’s nothing to be done.” He was no more hopeful about the political situation. When I mentioned Guaidó’s movement, he said laconically, “Pueblo no tumba gobierno”—ordinary people don’t topple governments. In Caracas, the opposition leader Henrique Capriles had told me much the same thing. “Let’s imagine that I’ve been kidnapped,” he said. “My family wants to rescue me, but, if the kidnapper doesn’t pick up the telephone, what’s to be done? Who frees me? That’s the situation we’re in here.”

The question of the United States’ intentions hung over the crisis in Venezuela, but Guaidó admitted to being hazy on American politics. In Vargas, he took me aside to ask about the 2020 elections. He noted that Bernie Sanders had announced his intention to run, but he knew little about Beto O’Rourke. Asked about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during a recent Fox Business interview, he had drawn a blank. He’d Googled her afterward, and he told me with a laugh that she didn’t seem all that radical: “What they refer to as socialist in the United States is what we’d call a Social Democrat here.” Davíd interrupted to say that he had “read the cards” and that Trump was likely to win reëlection, but that it depended on Venezuela’s becoming free. He added that Trump had a “Karmic problem,” because he “didn’t know how to express himself,” but that he was successful despite his impediments. “He’s like Maxwell Smart,” Davíd said—the bumbling spy in the sixties sitcom. “Everything he does is wrong but turns out well in the end.” Trump became interested in Venezuela early in his term. In February, 2017, he received a visit at the White House from Lilian Tintori, the wife of Leopoldo López. Tintori—a former reality-TV star and champion kite-surfer—gave an impassioned talk about human rights in Venezuela and her husband’s plight. Afterward, she posed for pictures. According to U.S. officials, Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence were smitten. Fernando Cutz, who at the time led Latin-American initiatives for the National Security Council, told me that Trump called him in for a briefing on Venezuela. “He asked me what we could do,” Cutz said. “Why were the people suffering there?” Cutz said that Trump almost never mentioned Cuba, traditionally the U.S.’s central concern in Latin America, but regularly asked about Venezuela. “Clearly, it was a priority for him,” Cutz said. For months, Trump said nothing about an armed intervention. Then, in August, 2017, he brought up Venezuela at a meeting in the Oval Office with John Kelly, the chief of staff; H. R. McMaster, the national-security adviser; and Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State. According to attendees, he asked, “Why don’t we use the military?” McMaster replied, “Well, Mr. President, there are other options.” Trump asked the other officials what they thought, and they all tried to dissuade him. Trump nodded, but then, the next day, he announced to reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, “We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option.” Kelly and Tillerson were there; they stood stolidly. Nikki Haley, the U.N. Ambassador, apparently hearing the suggestion for the first time, gave Trump a look of befuddled alarm. A U.S. military intervention would have enormous implications around the world. Maduro has few allies in Latin America; the Pink Tide of leftist leaders has mostly receded. But Cuba remains tightly entwined with Venezuela, which for years has supplied it with oil in exchange for experts, including thousands of doctors and, by all accounts, some military and intelligence advisers. Maduro also has substantial alliances with China, which has made enormous investments in Venezuela, and particularly with Russia. After the U.S. endorsed Guaidó, Vladimir Putin called Maduro to offer support and to denounce “destructive external interference.” In late March, Putin dispatched a hundred military advisers and technicians to Venezuela, purportedly to repair air defenses that Chávez had put in place. The gesture was conspicuous: the military aircraft carrying the troops flew from Syria, where Russia is also agitating against U.S. interests, and landed at the main airport in Caracas. The Russians’ actions caused acute frustration in Washington. “They’ve figured out that with very little cost they can get into an international situation and become a player,” Cutz said. “Russia is no longer a superpower, but it’s fairly good at acting like one. A hundred troops to Venezuela? That’s nothing. But we in the U.S. have not figured out how to extract them or to respond to this.” McMaster favored an incremental approach to the crisis, with gradually increasing sanctions, intended to encourage talks. The Administration invited the rebels to Washington for advice and urged anti-Maduro factions to unite, apparently with little success. In 2017, the U.S. helped bring the regime and the opposition together for talks, in the Dominican Republic, but they quickly fell apart. Before the invasion of Afghanistan, Americans flew in with millions of dollars of cash to inspire local warlords to support a campaign against the Taliban. In Venezuela, Trump officials have occasionally offered incentives to officers who defected, but there has apparently been no budget for a wider effort to convert the military. After Bolton replaced McMaster, in April, 2018, the Administration imposed financial sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, designed so that any new profits would be deposited in an account under Guaidó’s authority. But the Administration has not yet figured out how to disburse the funds to Guaidó. Mostly, Trump officials seem to believe that they can effect change by making pronouncements. Since Bolton took office, he has devoted a majority of his tweets to confronting Maduro. In one, he wrote, “I wish Nicolas Maduro and his top advisors a long, quiet retirement, living on a nice beach somewhere far from Venezuela.” Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, has tweeted with particularly Trumpish zeal, mocking small crowds at a pro-regime rally (“Wow! . . . Very impressive turnout”) and assailing Maduro’s potency (“the emperor . . . has no clothes”). At times, he has made forthright threats. In a tweet addressed to the “Maduro Crime Family,” he promised that “the willingness of many nations to support stronger multilateral actions to dislodge them has increased dramatically.” At one point, he tweeted a series of photographs of deposed dictators: Manuel Noriega, Nicolae Ceauşescu, and, in a gruesome image, Muammar Qaddafi being brutalized by rebels just before his murder, in 2011. When I asked Guaidó if the photographs had helped his cause, he gave a knowing laugh and quickly formulated a politic answer: “I don’t know if they help, but I understand their language. Now, extricating myself from those images, the only possible comparisons to the Venezuelan case are dictatorships of that type, or of cases of countries at war. O.K., maybe those are hateful comparisons. But if you take those photos away and you put in their place access to water, inflation, gross domestic product, access to information, to justice, political prisoners, there are no other comparisons possible.” “The couple will now exchange vows that they wrote themselves, because I guess mine weren’t good enough, but, whatever, let’s see what you’ve got.” The regime uses these provocations for maximum propaganda value. In March, Diosdado Cabello, a member of Maduro’s cabinet, appeared on his weekly TV show, whose name translates loosely as “Beat Them with a Club,” to lead the audience in a chant of “Yankee, go home!” An influential Venezuelan politician told me, “If I could talk to Trump, I would tell him, and also Bolton, Pence, and Rubio, to stop! Por favor! ” Other observers told me that the Trump Administration’s messages helped provide cover for Maduro’s repressiveness. “Rubio is like a scarecrow for Maduro,” a diplomat in Caracas said. “He uses his tweets to prove there is an invasion coming.” In recent meetings, the diplomat said, Maduro had seemed galvanized by the standoff, saying that he felt “excited about confronting Trump.” He had also said, “I’m not going to end up like Qaddafi, or like Mubarak. After me, someone else will come.” He had begun comparing himself to the Chilean President Salvador Allende, who was overthrown in a U.S.-backed coup in 1973, and committed suicide rather than be taken prisoner. The diplomat rolled his eyes in disdain.

The Administration’s most dramatic action on Guaidó’s behalf was a high-profile operation, in February, to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuela. As U.S. military planes flew food and medical supplies to the border with Colombia, Guaidó and his American backers urged the regime to allow the shipments through. Humanitarian-aid missions are traditionally kept separate from politics. In this case, though, public offers were made to specific senior officers to defect in exchange for amnesty for past abuses. A military attaché to Washington had switched sides, as had a general, who broke with the regime on social media. This was less significant than it might have seemed; Venezuela’s Army has more than two thousand generals. Meanwhile, the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, declared that he and his troops remained loyal to Maduro and the Bolivarian revolution. The delivery was scheduled for February 23rd, and, in the preceding days, Maduro rejected the aid, saying, “We are not beggars.” He sent tankers and shipping containers to block three crucial border bridges, and deployed the National Guard for added security. That morning, Guaidó appeared on the Colombian side, standing alongside a group of conservative leaders from the region. A crowd had gathered, and Guaidó urged them to be brave, promising that the aid would “restore prosperity to Venezuela.” The tycoon Richard Branson had organized a concert, Venezuela Aid Live, on the Colombian side, where top Latin entertainers attracted more than two hundred thousand people. A counter-concert organized by Maduro’s people flopped, as most of the performers pulled out beforehand. In a TV interview, Rubio said that Maduro was powerless to stop the aid: “The question is whether it gets through in a way that he’s coöperative with or in a way that he’s not.” On Twitter, Guaidó announced, “As commander-in-chief of the armed forces . . . I declare that soldiers who cross the border will not be considered traitors to their homeland,” and some sixty disgruntled soldiers took him up on the guarantee. The initiative, though, turned out to be devastatingly underplanned. Guaidó hoped to form a “human chain” to pass bags of food and medical supplies across the bridges. But the regime’s soldiers wouldn’t move the barricades, and the standoff devolved into violence. Emiliana Duarte, a Venezuelan journalist who was there that day, shot video of a chaotic scene. A truck loaded with supplies had been accidentally set on fire, apparently by anti-Maduro demonstrators hurling Molotov cocktails. Armed loyalists on motorbikes terrorized protesters. “The most frightening thing was how the colectivos and the National Guardsmen coördinated their efforts,” Duarte said. She showed me video of protesters running and hiding from the colectivos, and of the National Guard firing pellet guns into the crowd. One Guardsman fired at Duarte from a dozen paces away, and she dropped her camera as the shot whizzed past. Maduro’s men injured hundreds of protesters. On the Brazilian border, National Guardsmen broke up an effort to bring in aid by firing at activists from the Pemón indigenous community, killing four. In the capital, Maduro held a rally, at which he called himself “stronger than ever” and danced with his wife onstage. Guaidó, frustrated, made his first major misstep: he posted a tweet in which he appeared to advocate military force against Maduro. “Today’s events oblige me to take a decision: to propose formally to the international community that we keep all the doors open to achieve the liberation of this fatherland that struggles and will continue to struggle. Hope was not born in order to die, Venezuela!” In support, Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that “all options are on the table.” But the rest of the region was alarmed by the prospect of an invasion. At a subsequent meeting of the Lima Group, a council of fourteen Latin-American countries, which had been set up in 2017 to deal with the Venezuela crisis, several senior officials said that they would not support a war to unseat Maduro. “We have never contemplated a military solution,” the Colombian foreign minister, Carlos Trujillo, said in a radio interview. “All the actions are political and diplomatic, and I say that emphatically, so there’s no more speculation on Colombia’s position.”

During the blackout, a looting spree erupted in the oil city of Maracaibo, after an ice vender refused to serve customers unless they paid in U.S. dollars. (Throughout Venezuela, as hyperinflation has devalued the currency, the economy has run increasingly on dollars.) The ice seller’s sweltering customers grew frustrated, and then violent. The unrest spread; in the following week, more than five hundred businesses were ransacked or burned, and several major factories and warehouses were stripped, with even their wiring hauled away. The looters were determined and, in some cases, armed; the police did not intervene, apparently out of fear for their lives. With the lights still out and the looters unchecked, many people felt that Maduro had lost the ability to govern. The diplomat told me that his regime represented the death of the chavista dream: “They’ve lasted for twenty years, but I think they’ve hit their limit, and the reason is that these people aren’t real revolutionaries. They’re malandros”—villains. “They like money. Oil has created a shallow and short-term political culture in Venezuela. In the seventies, Venezuelans would take the Concorde to Paris just to take a shower, or to New York to dance at Studio 54, and the nomenklatura of those days has simply been replaced by the nouveau-riche chavistas of today. On top of that, they have created a security state. There is repression, political prisoners, torture, and even executions, but there is no security for the citizens. This is ‘Ubu Roi’—that’s what this is. Totally aberrant.” Still, Maduro is undeniably able to rally Venezuelans to defend his regime, especially in the slums. In Caracas, one of the traditional chavista bastions is the community known as the 23rd of January, for the date of the military coup that overthrew the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez, in 1958. El 23, as it is known, is a vast housing complex in northwestern Caracas. It was erected in the fifties, when the country’s oil economy was booming, and was modelled on Le Corbusier’s Cité Radieuse, in Marseille. In those days, the government built projects across the country: universities, highways, bridges, dams. They now serve as reminders of a lost era. At El 23, the gardens that were planted after the complex was built have been obliterated by thousands of shanties. Colectivo Alexis Vives was founded in El 23, with financial support from Chávez, as a community-support organization. It is situated in a former commercial block, next to a burned-out supermarket. A mural outside depicts the Last Supper, with Christ as a brown-skinned man with a bushy beard, surrounded by revolutionary apostles: Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Mao, Lenin, Chávez. It has been run for years by a diehard chavista named Roberto Longa. A burly, voluble man, Longa holds court in a kind of command center, with a panel of sixteen video screens that monitor security cameras around the estate. When I visited Longa during the blackout, he claimed, improbably, “The chavistas have never had a better moment than the present one.” His reasoning was quintessentially Marxist: “the contradictions are deepening” in Venezuelan society—part of a necessary process of broadening the revolution. “The contradictions need to deepen even more before a dialogue can take place between the government and the popular forces,” he said. There was no need to include Guaidó in such a dialogue, he stressed. “We’re confronting the Empire”—the United States. “Guaidó is a symbol of the Empire, and he should be imprisoned and then tried for treason.” Longa confided that he believes “the Empire” murdered Chávez, by injecting him with an aggressive strain of cancer. He showed me a photograph of Chávez during a visit to El 23. He said, “Our love is for Chávez, and we are never going to stop loving him for all of our lives.” In his view, Maduro was carrying on Chávez’s work, and his explanations for the real cause of the country’s woes were inarguable. The blackout had been brought about by American sabotage; the widespread poverty and hunger resulted from an “economic war” led by the U.S. “The gringos have said, ‘We’re going to asphyxiate you,’ and we can see it happening,” he said. If the Americans forced Maduro from power, he vowed to take up arms. “We’ll radicalize the revolution,” he said. “We’ll initiate a prolonged popular war, an insurrection, and then move against the rancid oligarchy, and take over the oil industry, and so on.” Later, Jefferson González, a young member of Longa’s colectivo, told me that most chavistas had closed ranks with Maduro: “People might have their complaints, but we wash our dirty laundry in private. One thing I can assure you is that, if there is a gringo invasion, the people will come out of the barrios to fight. Meanwhile, Maduro is the leader of the revolution, and he has told the gringos that they should get out of here. What we are all waiting for is for him to arrest Guaidó.” He wore a truculent look, and added, “We saw Guaidó’s ass—which he offered up to the gringos—before we ever saw his face. That’s why Mike Pence is always talking about Venezuela, because he’s the real leader. The opposition right now is the American government.” If the unrest in Venezuela turned to open conflict, it was not clear that Guaidó’s supporters would come to the streets and fight. On Saturdays, the regime and the opposition held rallies in Caracas, and the contrast was telling. The opposition’s events often had the ritual earnestness of a campus protest. The regime’s felt like a cross between a block party and an Army Reserve parade. One weekend during my visit, police blocked off a main avenue downtown, and people dressed in red, the official chavista color, began arriving on buses, carrying pro-government signs. A few hundred men and women in militia uniforms had organized themselves into marching ranks. These milicianos, as they are called, make up an all-volunteer force that Maduro has heralded as the core of a people’s resistance army, which will help defend against a Yankee invasion. They are mostly untrained and inexperienced—one diplomat I spoke to derided them as “wheelchair shooters”—but they are enthusiastic, and they have the regime’s support. A d.j. had set up a booth and was blaring chavista salsa through loudspeakers. “Our comandante always goes onward with the revolution,” the lyrics of one song went, and people sang along, as some broke out of line to dance. The mood was festive, but the milicianos also provide evidence of Venezuela’s militarization. At a rally in April, Maduro announced proudly that their membership had grown to two million, and soon there would be a million more. “With your rifles on your shoulders, be ready to defend the fatherland and dig the furrow to plant the seeds to produce food for the community,” Maduro told them. He asked them to swear to fight “imperialist aggressions”—even if it cost them their lives.

Most chavistas take it as self-evident that Guaidó is a Yankee stooge. In February, Maduro called him “a puppet, a Judas who has tried to help the American empire take control of our country politically and militarily.” The charge rankles Guaidó, but he cannot entirely refute it. As long as the U.S. backs him, he is protected—a kind of one-man no-fly zone. A few weeks before Guaidó launched the “final phase of Operation Freedom,” I visited him at his de-facto headquarters, at a small hotel in a pro-opposition neighborhood of Caracas. When I asked him to clarify his position on the prospect of a U.S. military invasion, he instead talked at length about the destructive effects of Maduro’s rule. Finally, he said, “If we want to be responsible about things, we have to consider all the available options for changing our situation, because the people are paying a social cost that is without precedent.” “Whenever I get annoyed with him, he does that and I’m blinded by desire.” Ever since the Lima Group rejected military action, Guaidó’s American supporters had limited their threats, suggesting that they would invade only if the regime touched him. I asked if he was prepared to sacrifice himself in order to bring on an invasion. His reply was scattershot: “If that’s the cost there is to pay, where do I sign? Of course, nobody wants to risk their freedom, nobody is prepared for that, nobody is born to do that. But for me that would not be a dilemma. It would be very strange if it were to happen. And, look, I know how political that element”—a U.S. military action—“would be. I know the scars that have been left in the region with all of this, but this case is also very different from many others. What is happening in Venezuela is very atypical.” In the end, he said, it wasn’t fair that he be held accountable for a decision that wasn’t his to make. Meanwhile, he and his comrades were doing what they could to find “a Venezuelan solution to a Venezuelan problem.” Guaidó spoke vaguely about the plan that was taking shape. They would hold rallies around the country, and eventually march on Miraflores, to force out Maduro. “It’s a gamble,” he acknowledged. “But we have no other options available to us to channel and contain people’s emotions, because all the other options are violent ones—and that way is craziness. People are going around saying, ‘Miraflores, Miraflores, Miraflores,’ because they’re desperate, and they need to feel there’s a solution to the conflict. Who wants intervention? Nobody! But telling someone who is dying of hunger, ‘Just wait a little more’—that’s not easy to do. It’s hard to know what to say when people come up and tell you their wife died a week ago because there were no drugs for her chemo.”"
State Department says it is now requiring social media info from 'most' visa applicants,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/02/politics/state-department-social-media-visa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The State Department has begun requesting ""most"" US visa applicants provide information on their social media accounts, a department official said in a statement.

The move was expected following an announcement in March of last year that outlined plans to require nearly all US visa applicants to submit their social media handles and other information.

The State Department statement over the weekend said the forms for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants had been updated ""to request additional information, including social media identifiers.""

According to the official's statement, the move is a result of a memorandum issued by President Donald Trump in 2017 on ""vetting"" for people coming to the US and a provision of an executive order from around the same time that sought to block entry to the US for people from several majority-Muslim countries, which included a provision on vetting standards.

CNN previously reported that the change was expected to affect around 15 million people.

Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-calls-gop-the-cult-of-the-presidents-personality-hints-potential-impeachment-could-fail-without-their-support,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""is destined for failure"" without Republican support, while blasting the party as “the cult of the president’s personality"" and stating that he is actually against ""putting the country"" through impeachment proceedings.

Schiff, on ABC News’ “This Week,” said that while he believes House Democrats could impeach the president, the move would likely fail, due to a lack of support from Republicans in the House and Senate.

NADLER: THERE 'CERTAINLY IS' JUSTIFICATION TO IMPEACH TRUMP

""I think we're going to do what is right for the country, and at this point, the speaker has not reached the conclusion, and I haven't either that it's the best for the country to put us through an impeachment proceeding that we know will, is, destined for failure in the Senate,"" Schiff said.

Schiff added that the president's ""conduct qualifies"" as ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" but said: ""at the same time, we have to recognize that the reality — that one party, the Republican Party, has turned itself into the cult of the president’s personality and is not likely to act consistent with its constitutional obligations.""

Schiff added, however, that if Trump ""continues to stonewall"" Congress, and ""demonstrate his unfitness for office,"" congressional Democrats could move forward.

""There may be little additional cost to going through that process, even if unsuccessful in the Senate,"" Schiff said. ""But we're not there yet and I think if it is a close call, close calls go against putting the country through that.""

Schiff’s comments come as rank-and-file congressional Democrats have ramped up their calls for impeachment, following a rare public statement by Special Counsel Robert Mueller last week, who announced it was “not an option” for his team of prosecutors to charge the president with a crime due to longstanding Justice Department policy.

Mueller detailed the findings in his probe, maintaining that there was “not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” with regard to whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.

But Mueller did not mince words on his inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice.

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”

Mueller explained the longstanding Justice Department policy, which states that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, and thus said “charging the president was not an option we could consider.”

Mueller added that “it would be unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”

TRUMP BLASTS MUELLER AS 'HIGHLY CONFLICTED,' CALLS IMPEACHMENT A 'DIRTY, FILTHY, DISGUSTING WORD'

But Mueller said that while the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion blocks a president from indictment while in office, “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing.”

Some on the left took that comment as a green light to ramp up talks about impeachment proceedings against the president.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also compared Mueller's remarks to an ""impeachment referral,"" and said, ""We need to start impeachment proceedings. It's our constitutional obligation.""

Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who is also running for president, said now that Mueller's job is done, ""Impeachment hearings should begin tomorrow.""



House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose committee would oversee impeachment proceedings, said that there ""certainly is"" justification to begin impeachment, but said it was critical to first gain the support fo the American people.

“Impeachment is a political act, and you cannot impeach a president if the American people will not support it,” said Nadler, D-N.Y. “The American people, right now, do not support it because they do not know the story. They don’t know the facts.”

Nadler added: “We have to get the facts out. We have to hold a series of hearings, we have to hold the investigations.”

But despite growing calls from rank-and-file Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has tread lightly on the topic, vowing to investigate allegations against the president, but stopping short of calling to begin impeachment proceedings.

Pelosi, this week, also said that Democrats “want to do what’s right and what gets results.”

“We’re legislating, we’re investigating and we’re litigating,” Pelosi said. “Everybody wants justice, everybody wants the president to be held accountable.”

But House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., despite Pelosi’s resistance to the idea, said Sunday he feels Democrats have “already begun” impeachment proceedings.

“We’ve got all these committees doing their work, we’re having hearings, we’ve already won two court cases and there are other cases that are still to be determined, so why should we get out in front of this process?” Clyburn said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“It’s kind of interesting to me when you talk to people and ask them what they think we ought to do,” he added. “They agree with what we’re doing, it’s just that, emotionally, they would like to see something done and see it done quicker.”

Trump, though, blasted the idea as a “scam.”

“I don’t see how they can,” Trump said Thursday. “It’s a dirty, filthy, disgusting word, impeach. It’s high crimes – there was no high crime. So how do you impeach?”

The White House also has ignored the discussion, and seized only on Mueller's move to announce the official conclusion of the Russia probe. Mueller, last week, said the investigation was officially complete, his office would close, and said he was resigning from the Justice Department to return to private life.

But even without launching official impeachment proceedings, congressional Democrats are leading several high-profile Trump-focused investigations. The House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee potential impeachment proceedings, is investigating the administration’s handling of Mueller’s report, and even voted to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena requiring that he turn over an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, and its underlying evidence and documents. The president, in turn, asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee, Oversight Committee, Ways and Means Committee and Financial Services Committee are all investigating the president and have aggressively sought his financial statements and documents for their probes, as well as testimony from high-profile Trump administration officials.

Thus far, the White House has directed the officials to defy their subpoenas to appear before Congress, and the president has vowed to block “all” subpoenas.

But Republicans, like House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., are shifting their focus to Barr’s review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Barr appointed U.S. attorney from Connecticut John Durham to lead an investigation into the FBI’s original Russia probe, and alleged misconduct related to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, as well as the FBI’s use of informants against the Trump campaign in 2016.

“It’s time for us to find out how this started and go from there,” Collins said on “Fox News Sunday.”"
"Trump's U.K. visit: What you need to know, from royal ceremony to protests in London",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kim Hjelmgaard', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/06/03/president-trumps-state-visit-britain-queen-elizabeth-ii-royal-family/1284000001/,"LONDON – President Donald Trump arrived in the United Kingdom on Monday for several days of pomp and ceremony. Here's your crib sheet.

What's happening?

Trump is in the United Kingdom for a three-day state visit. A state visit is one that formally comes at the invitation of the British monarch: Queen Elizabeth II. It means that there will be an emphasis on ritualized ceremony, including banquets at the queen’s lavish London pile Buckingham Palace, wreath-laying to honor Britain’s military dead, gun salutes fired from the Tower of London and other grand displays of decorum essentially showing through soft power how Britain can be the host with the most.

Still, while the queen sent the invitation and will feature prominently in the visit along with other members of the royal family, she did so at the request of the British government, meaning it won’t be all testimonial readings and charming musical performances. There will be serious talks on defense, investment, security and trade.

Why does it matter?

For a start, while the queen has hosted 152 state visits since becoming monarch in 1952, and met 11 of 12 sitting U.S. presidents over the last 67 years – her majesty’s royal path never crossed with Lyndon B. Johnson – only two U.S. presidents have made state visits to Britain: George W. Bush in 2003 and Barack Obama in 2011. Trump is being accorded a special honor when he arrives June 3.

However, the visit is important for reasons that go beyond ceremonial affairs. Political scientists say it’s about reaffirming the so-called special relationship between two of the world’s closest allies who have deep cultural, economic and political ties, but who haven’t always seen eye-to-eye since Trump came to power vowing to pursue a more unilateralist foreign policy. Areas of disagreement have included Trump’s Muslim travel ban, his talking down of the NATO military alliance and U.S. exits from the climate and Iran nuclear accords. There's also difference of opinion about China, in particular what type of relationship to maintain with Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Washington thinks the company is a massive national security threat; London has a more relaxed view.

The visit also comes as Britain is mired in a weeks-long process to pick a new prime minister after Theresa May said she would vacate the role on June 7 over her handling of Britain’s impending exit from the European Union, known as Brexit.

""If we get a new prime minister who the president can relate to then things might run more smoothly, especially if May's successor allows us to crash out of the EU and comes begging for a trade deal with the USA,"" said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary, University of London, referring to the possibility of a ""no-deal"" Brexit.

Ahead of his arrival, Trump told British tabloid newspaper The Sun that he was backing U.S.-born politician Boris Johnson to be the next prime minister. He also said that his friend Nigel Farage should be involved in negotiations to leave the EU.

Who's coming with Trump?

Aside from the normal retinue of senior advisers and administration officials, a large portion of the Trump family, according to the New York Times. The outlet has reported that along with First Lady Melania Trump, the president will fly over his children, including Donald Jr, 41; Ivanka, 37; Eric, 35; and Tiffany, 25. It is not yet known whether Trump’s youngest son Baron, 13, will also make the transatlantic trip. The White House would not comment on which members of Trump's family would be accompanying him.

Still, if the Trump family does form part of the president's entourage they would be expected to attend the banquet dinner at Buckingham Palace on Monday evening. On the British side, the dinner will be attended by outgoing Prime Minister May, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Prominent British public figures and Americans living in Britain will also be there. The queen and Trump are both expected to make speeches at the start of the banquet.

What will he be doing?

In addition to taking part in bilateral meetings with May, and the dinner banquet, there will be a private lunch with the queen; a visit to an exhibition showcasing items that Britain's foreign office has called of ""historical significance to the United States""; tea with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall; a chance to inspect Britain’s military Guard of Honor; a tour of Westminster Abbey (famous site of many coronations and royal weddings); and a breakfast meeting with senior American and British business leaders.

On Wednesday, Trump will participate in commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. This event will take place in Portsmouth, on Britain’s south coast. It will include a fly-past with 25 modern and historical aircraft. Since Trump is known to like a good parade and military fanfare, Wednesday should be a good day for him.

""I hope President Trump appreciates the full sweep of history when he visits ... Portsmouth ... that European unity is very much an American project; that Europeans' prosperity and security are interlinked with America’s ... and that this is a project that needs America’s support,"" said Heather Conley, an expert on foreign affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

What kind of reception can he expect?

In short: protests.

Over half of Londoners are opposed to Trump's visit to Britain's capital,

according to a recent poll by research firm YouGov and Queen Mary, University of London. Although nationwide: 46% to 40% think the visit should go ahead.

When Trump visited London last year as part of an ordinary working visit an estimated 250,000 people protested on the streets of central London. Anti-Trump activists who oppose his divisive policies from immigration to abortion rights are planning for similar numbers this time. There will be smaller protests around the country.

And remember Trump baby? The phone-wielding, diaper-wearing inflatable that flew above London when Trump visited in July? The team behind it told USA TODAY that the giant orange blimp will again take to the skies, on Tuesday, in Parliament Square.

British media have reported that Trump's three-day visit will cost British police and security services about $23 million to help keep him safe.

Who's giving Trump the cold shoulder?

London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who Trump has clashed with before, was the subject of two disparaging tweets by the U.S. president on Monday. It came after Khan, London's first Muslim mayor, wrote in an op-ed in British newspaper the Observer that it is ""un-British to roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump.""

Trump tweeted that Khan was ""a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.""

""Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height,"" Trump added.

.@SadiqKhan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly “nasty” to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019

....Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019

Prince Harry will meet Trump at one of the planned lunches. But his wife, the Duchess of Sussex (Meghan Markle), will sit it out. Her name is not on any of the official itineraries. Markle may have decided she would rather stay at home with newborn son Archie. Or perhaps it's the man himself. In 2016, she called him ""misogynistic.""

Trump has denied calling Markle ""nasty"" despite an audio recording of his comments.

The president has also not been invited, unlike President Obama, to address Parliament. John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, who makes that decision, has said he is ""strongly opposed"" to Trump addressing British lawmakers.

""Before the imposition of the (Muslim travel ban) I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall,"" Bercow told British parliamentarians in 2017. ""After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.""

Bercow said that being invited to address Parliament was ""an earned honor.""

In a speech in Washington last week, Bercow said that over the past two years ""nothing has happened since then to cause me to change my mind.""

What else is the president doing in Europe?

On Wednesday, he will fly to Ireland for a meeting with leader Leo Varadkar. The meeting will take place at Shannon Airport, not Trump's golf club and hotel in Doonbeg, in County Clare, which he will visit later the same day. The White House said that the two leaders will discuss ""a range of bilateral issues"" and ""shared international interests and priorities."" Translation: Trump wants to play golf in his family's ancestral homeland.

The next day, Trump will travel to France for further D-Day commemorations in Normandy. He will visit the Normandy American Cemetery, established by the U.S. First Army in 1944. It is the first American cemetery on European soil and contains the graves of 9,380 American military dead, most of whom lost their lives in D-Day landings.

While in France, Trump will also hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron and Trump have enjoyed a ""bromance"" of sorts, filled with awkward embraces, macho handshake and military parades. They also regularly attack each others' politics – Macron for his centrism, Trump for his nationalism – in tweets and speeches.

VA whistleblower says there’s a secret wait list for veterans' care,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues', 'June At Am']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whistleblower-says-theres-a-secret-va-wait-list-for-care-the-department-says-thats-not-true/2019/06/01/197e59a2-83df-11e9-bce7-40b4105f7ca0_story.html,"President during the swearing-in ceremony for Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie last year. A whistleblower has accused VA of having a secret wait list. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Columnist

Jereme P. Whiteman rose quickly through the Department of Veterans Affairs, reaching the top grade on the main employee classification scale in only seven years.

But his future within VA appears stymied. He’s become a rebel within the department’s establishment — a whistleblower who says the scandals that shamed the department during the Obama administration haven’t stopped.

Whiteman, VA’s national director of clinic practice management and a onetime Marine, has accused the department under President Trump of having “a secret VA wait list” for veterans seeking health care.

It’s starkly reminiscent of the tsunami-level scandal that broke in 2014 over the coverup of long patient wait times. That coverup included falsifying records to indicate the wait for medical service was shorter than it really was. Congress went ballistic, and the controversy drove then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, a former Army general and chief of staff, from office.

Whiteman said figures from internal reports indicate the actual number of veterans waiting for VA health care could be much higher than the numbers VA makes publicly available. Whiteman provided copies of the internal reports to The Washington Post.

From May 1, 2018, through May 1, 2019, the monthly average on the department’s public electronic wait list (EWL) was 14,971. During that period, the monthly average on the internal electronic wait list was 44,478.

In an email Wednesday night to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, Whiteman said that “I discovered a secret VA wait list” in September and that “the agency has taken steps to conceal this wait list from the public.” He warned Wilkie that this could hurt the agency “unless swift actions are taken to properly address my concerns.”

Through its Veterans Health Administration, the department runs 1,250 health-care facilities, serving 9 million veterans annually.

VA press secretary Curt Cashour said Whiteman’s allegations are false. Cashour said VA’s electronic wait list has two components — clinical and administrative.

He said the clinical list — the public list — tracks the number of veterans waiting for medical treatment.

Of the other list, he said that “the administrative component of the EWL has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment and tracks routine actions, such as facility and provider transfer requests.”

[VA is gearing up for a massive shift of health care to the private sector. But Democrats are fighting back.]

Cashour said VA does not publicly post the administrative component of the EWL, “because it has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment and would only create confusion.”

Whiteman punched back, telling Wilkie that Cashour’s statement to The Post was “incredibly disingenuous.” Whiteman said any veteran waiting for treatment should be included on the public list, including veterans waiting for VA-funded care by private providers or veterans waiting to be transferred to another facility.

Unlike many federal whistleblowers, Whiteman went public while still on the job. Whiteman went through his chain of command months before becoming frustrated and contacting The Post’s Federal Insider.

Whiteman, 39, said he rose to GS-15, the top of the General Schedule, last year after just seven years as a federal civilian, all with VA. The Temple Hills, Md., resident started as a GS-7, doing pharmacy billing.

Before joining VA, he was a Marine for eight years, leaving as a staff sergeant working on jet weapons systems. His pride in that service is evident from his glass-enclosed uniform displayed on his office wall, along with other Marine and family decorations in his windowless spot on the eighth floor of VA’s Central Office, across Lafayette Square from the White House.

In a September email to his boss, Susan Kirsh, the acting assistant deputy undersecretary for health for access to care, and her boss, Steven L. Lieberman, VA’s acting principal deputy undersecretary for health, Whiteman said the discrepancies in public and internal wait-list numbers “could be seen as VA hiding a very large wait list of Veterans waiting extremely long for care.”

Whiteman was so disappointed in the way leadership handled his concerns that he filed a verbal complaint, under oath, about the discrepancies with the department’s Office of the Medical Inspector. He asked the office to investigate circumstances for patients who died while on the wait list to determine whether the deaths were connected to wait times.

Cashour said the medical inspector’s office found the allegations unsubstantiated. In the email to Wilkie, however, Whiteman said the medical inspector never followed up with him beyond his initial statement.

Whiteman has filed official complaints charging VA with retaliation against him because of his whistleblowing.

In an April 27 email, Whiteman told VA’s whistleblower protection office that one example of retribution followed the successful deployment of a text-message reminder system that led to a significant reduction in the number of missed medical appointments, saving an estimated $112 million annually.

“I lead a team of four VA employees on this project,” he wrote in an email to the whistleblower office. “I was the only one of the four who did not get an award for this project. I believe this was retaliation for my Whistleblower activity.”

Cashour said the department does not tolerate retaliation, but he did not comment on this allegation.

[VA security staff compromised safety and Shulkin violated ethics rules, oversight report says]

Whiteman also filed a retaliation complaint in an April 29 email to the Office of Special Counsel. This independent federal office protects federal whistleblowers. Despite the name, it is not led by or related to Robert S. Mueller III, who led a special-counsel investigation of Russia’s actions in support of Trump’s candidacy.

Although Whiteman is a GS-15, his email to the special-counsel office said he was subjected to “numerous undesirable work assignments” from Kirsh, including “reporting to a lower grade GS-11 employee. . . . I find this degrading and humiliating, yet I do the work as directed.”

Cashour said, “Whiteman has always reported to someone above the GS-15 level.” Whiteman said that is on paper, not in reality.

Married and the father of five, Whiteman plans to remain at VA, considering it the best place in the federal government for him as a health-care administrator. But his work life is no longer the same.

“It’s well known within headquarters that I am whistleblowing,” he said. “And I see it when I walk down the halls. People, you know, don’t look at me. They don’t make eye contact with me.”

Because of his disclosures, “there’s no more upward mobility for me at this point.” Whiteman said. “I consider myself probably stalled.”"

2 more Alabama cities selected for Department of Justice violent crime initiative,https://www.al.com,"['Carol Robinson', 'Crobinson Al.Com']",06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/06/2-more-alabama-cities-selected-for-department-of-justice-violent-crime-initiative.html,"Two more Alabama cities have been selected to take part in a Department of Justice initiative aimed at reducing violent crime nationwide.

The National Public Safety Partnership was launched in 2017 in response to President Trump's directive to reduce crime and improve public safety. Then- Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the National Public Safety Partnership, an alliance of local and federal law enforcement agencies coordinating with community organizations to reduce violent crime in areas long plagued by it. The Attorney General selected Birmingham as one of the initial 12 PSP sites.

On Monday, Attorney General William P. Barr announced 10 more cities, including Anniston and Oxford. To be considered for selection, a site must have sustained levels of violence that far exceed the national average and demonstrate a commitment to reducing crime. Cities must also display compliance with federal immigration requirements.

In addition to Anniston, and Oxford, other sites announced Monday are: Anchorage, Alaska; Davenport, Iowa; Wichita, Kansas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio, Amarillo, Texas and Harris County, Texas.

In a DOJ press release, Barr said the Public Safety Partnership provides a framework for enhancing federal support of state, local and tribal law enforcement officials and prosecutors as they aggressively investigate and pursue violent criminals, specifically those involved in gun crime, drug trafficking and gang violence.

“The Public Safety Partnership is a successful program that directs federal law enforcement resources to the cities where they can have the greatest impact,"" Barr said in a prepared statement. ""These resources help police departments to diagnose where crime is highest—and why—and to find, arrest and prosecute criminals. Several participating cities have already seen dramatic reductions in violent crime over the past two years. As we expand this program to 10 more cities across America, we are determined to replicate that success.”

Birmingham's Public Safety Partnership building alliances for safer communities The task force has been instrumental in identifying the worst violent offenders in the area for arrest and prosecution.

Northern District of Alabama U.S. Attorney Jay Town said the partnership provides data-drive resources to assist law enforcement in removing the habitual offenders from the southeast side of the northern district. ““Our collective goal is simply to reduce crime, especially violent crime, in Anniston, Oxford, and surrounding areas. My office, local and federal law enforcement, and the Department of Justice are fully committed to facilitating the strategies, training, and technical assistance to do just that,’’ Town said. “We have prison beds already reserved for the alpha criminals in Calhoun County…and we are coming.”

To be considered for selection, a site must have sustained levels of violence that far exceed the national average and demonstrate a commitment to reducing crime. Cities must also display compliance with federal immigration requirements.

More than 30 cities have taken part in the Public Safety Partnership. The primary participating Justice Department components include the Office of Justice Programs, Office on Violence Against Women, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, FBI, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Marshals Service.

“We are excited to have the DOJ working with us in conjunction with the East Metro Area Crime Center to reduce gun crimes in our region and to reduce overall crime,’’ said Oxford Police Chief Bill Partridge. “This will help the entire region in reducing crime.”"

""Over the decades that followed, the United States hoped that China’s integration into the international system would lead to a more open, tolerant society. Those hopes have been dashed,"" Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement.

Pompeo's statement calls out China's ""new wave of abuses,"" including the the detention of Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang at so-called re-education camps.

Foreign experts estimate as many as 1 million Muslims have been placed into the programs, which Chinese officials likened to ""boarding schools,"" according to The New York Times.

""Even as the party builds a powerful surveillance state, ordinary Chinese citizens continue to seek to exercise their human rights, organize independent unions, pursue justice through the legal system, and simply express their views, for which many are punished, jailed, and even tortured,"" Pompeo said in his Monday statement.

Pompeo also urged the Chinese government to make a ""full, public accounting"" of those killed or missing.

During the June 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, protesters seeking social freedom were forcibly suppressed. Pompeo called the protesters ""heroes"" who inspired future generations to call for freedom and democracy around the world.

""China’s own constitution stipulates that all power belongs to the people. History has shown that nations are stronger when governments are responsive to their citizens, respect the rule of law, and uphold human rights and fundamental freedom,"" Pompeo said."

While Tim Cook and other Apple brass were at WWDC 2019 showing off new iOS 13 features and what's coming to the Apple Watch, the Department of Justice was apparently cooking up other plans for the iPhone maker.

The DOJ reportedly has obtained jurisdiction to potentially investigate Apple over antitrust concerns, according to a Reuters report on Monday. This news came just hours after it was reported that the Federal Trade Commission secured rights to investigate Facebook. And this past Friday, the DOJ reportedly began preparing for an antitrust investigation on Google for its search practices and other business activities.

A spokesperson for the DOJ said it's the agency's policy to not confirm, deny, or otherwise comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.

These moves by the Justice Department and FTC comes as Apple and other Silicon Valley giants face renewed antitrust scrutiny in the United States. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, has made it a key part of her platform to break up the big tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Amazon. Earlier this month, Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, also called for the breakup of the company he helped create.

State Department now requires U.S. visa applicants to share social media accounts,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-now-requires-us-visa-applicants-to-share-social-media-accounts-2019-06-01/,"The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers. It's a vast expansion of the Trump administration's enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors.

In a move that's just taken effect after approval of the revised application forms, the department says it has updated its immigrant and nonimmigrant visa forms to request the additional information, including ""social media identifiers,"" from almost all U.S. applicants.

The change, which was proposed in March 2018, is expected to affect about 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States each year.

Social media, email and phone number histories had only been sought in the past from applicants who were identified for extra scrutiny, such as people who'd traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations. An estimated 65,000 applicants per year had fallen into that category.

The department says collecting the additional information from more applicants ""will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.""

The new rules apply to virtually all applicants for immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. The department estimated it would affect 710,000 immigrant visa applicants and 14 million nonimmigrant visa applicants, including those who want to come to the U.S. for business or education, according to an initial notice.

The new visa application forms list a number of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and require the applicant to provide any account names they may have had on them over the previous five years. They also give applicants the option to volunteer information about social media accounts on platforms not listed on the form.

In addition to their social media histories, visa applicants are now asked for five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, international travel and deportation status, as well as whether any family members have been involved in terrorist activities.

Only applicants for certain diplomatic and official visa types are exempted from the requirements."

WASHINGTON—The Justice Department is gearing up for an antitrust investigation of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, a move that could present a major new layer of regulatory scrutiny for the search giant, according to people familiar with the matter.

Disabled veteran denied a VA mortgage over his marijuana dispensary job in Massachusetts,https://www.masslive.com,"['Michael Bonner', 'Mbonner Masslive.Com']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.masslive.com/boston/2019/06/disabled-veteran-denied-a-va-mortgage-over-his-marijuana-dispensary-job-in-massachusetts.html,"As a benefit of serving in the military, veterans have access to a low-rate mortgage with no money down. One disabled Massachusetts veteran was denied that benefit, though, due to his legal job in the marijuana industry, according to the Boston Globe.

A 35-year-old veteran spoke to the newspaper anonymously to protect his military relationship, but said he was denied a loan in January because he was an assistant manager of a licensed cannabis store.

“I was actually accomplishing a lifelong goal of mine, and then to have it pulled right out from under you at the 11th hour … I was blown away,” he told the Globe. “It was very frustrating and demoralizing.”

While marijuana is legal and several states, it remains illegal federally. The distinction has created many problems including marijuana companies working with banks to secure loans or establish checking or savings accounts.

Marijuana is legal in Massachusetts, but your boss doesn’t have to allow it -- yet A proposed bill would forbid employers from penalizing or discriminating against an employee for marijuana use outside the office, as long as the employee is not impaired while working.

The veteran, a native of Revere, called his congresswoman, U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark, after being denied the loan, he told the Globe.

Clark’s office, the Globe reported, was told the VA didn’t deem the veteran’s source of income as “stable and reliable.”

Clark vowed to draft a legislative response, however, the veteran remains looking for a home for his wife and two children, and unable to receive a loan he is entitled to as a veteran, he told the Globe."
Acting DHS secretary can’t explain how Trump’s tariffs on Mexico work,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/mcaleenan-trump-mexico-tariffs-c674b6c2d6b6/,"In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper Sunday morning, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan wasn’t able to articulate how or when the White House will end its tariffs on Mexican goods.

McAleenan appeared on cable news to defend President Donald Trump’s decision to impose new tariffs on Mexico as a means to address migration to the United States. The longer apprehension rates along the U.S.-Mexico border continue to rise, the higher the tariffs.

As the White House announced last week, a 5% tariff is set to go into effect on June 10 if Mexico does not step up immigration enforcement measures. The tariffs would gradually increase — an additional 5% on the first day of each month for four months — to a maximum of 25% by October, unless “the illegal immigration problem is remedied.”

Tapper asked McAleenan at what point would the administration consider lifting the tariffs, but McAleenan had no concrete response.

“I guess one of the questions I would have is assuming these tariffs go through, and right now it’s just a threat, what specific benchmark are you going to be looking at to see if Mexico is actually doing what you want them to do?” Tapper asked.

“I think what the president said, we need a vast reduction in the numbers crossing,” McAleenan replied.

According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), there were roughly 100,000 apprehensions in April — so what would a “vast reduction” look like to the administration? McAleenan couldn’t answer that either.

Instead, McAleenan recommended the administration ask the Mexican government to enforce its own southern border with Guatemala, put an end to the organizations that help transport migrants across Mexico, and work with the United States on creating new asylum policies.

As ThinkProgress has previously reported, however, the Mexican government is already collaborating with the Trump administration on the immigration front, whether by arresting Central American migrants at the southern Mexico border or ordering bus operators to stop transporting migrants across the country.

Considering that the U.S. is one of Mexico’s biggest trade partners and even the preliminary 5% tariff could have devastating effects on the Mexican economy, this question is critical. U.S. imports of goods from Mexico totaled about $346.5 billion in 2018, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Mexico, meanwhile, sends nearly 80% of its exports to the United States. Should tariffs reach the full 25% that Trump has threatened, American exporters of goods to Mexico would also be impacted, likely shoulder the cost of this new policy.

McAleenan also had no answers for how the U.S. would respond if Mexico’s economy took a downturn, causing more people to migrate.

“Bottom line for me is we need [Mexico] at the table looking at new strategies that we can aggressively move out on,” he said."

It was not exactly the news Apple wanted to leak, especially at the same time that CEO Tim Cook and other company executives took the stage during Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).

But an exclusive report from Reuters that representatives of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division met recently with the Federal Trade Commission to give Justice “jurisdiction to undertake potential antitrust probes of Apple and Google” in some circles was already overshadowing Apple's announcements of updates to iOS and other Apple software, plus the introduction of a new Mac Pro computer.

Reuters pinned its report on unnamed sources.

WWDC: Apple WWDC 2019: Goodbye, iTunes. Hello, iOS 13 and iPadOS

Apple’s stock price was down around 1.7% mid-afternoon Monday, even before the WWDC keynote had concluded.

Neither the Justice Department nor Apple has yet responded to a USA TODAY request for comment.

Reuters didn’t go into specifics on the potential government probe, and it is unclear what connection, if any, there is to Alphabet-owned Google.

But Apple has been in the crosshairs of rivals like Spotify, which back in March, claimed Apple isn't playing fair and is harming consumers. Spotify took its complaint to European Commission antitrust regulators. At the time, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said that Spotify wanted to be treated the same as other apps such as Uber and Deliveroo, which were not subjected to what he terms ""the Apple tax."" Spotify claims Apple applies the tax to a ""targeted"" group of rivals.

Apple subsequently disputed Spotify’s claims, which the EU is still investigating.

Apple and Google aren't the only Silicon Valley companies under possible scrutiny.

This morning, President Trump arrived via AirForce One at Stansted Airport. Then, he and First Lady Melania Trump flew via helicopter to the residence of the American ambassador, before traveling to Buckingham Palace.

There, the president and first lady were greeted by Prince Charles, Camilla, and the Queen. During the official welcome ceremony, Trump and Prince Charles inspected the Guard of Honour, while Camilla, Melania, and the Queen looked on. See a bit of the ceremony here:

Later, the whole group went inside for a private lunch.

It was there that the party was joined by Prince Harry. According to Daily Mail reporter Rebecca English, the Duke of Sussex attended the meal in the Blue Drawing Room, but that ""the lunch is deemed ‘completely private’ and no pictures or further details are expected to be released.""

Lunch is now taking place in the Blue Drawing Room as we speak, with the Duke of Sussex joining the party.

It's unclear why the lunch is so private, but it could have been a bit of an awkward event, given that President Trump recently referred to Harry's wife, the Duchess of Sussex, as ""nasty"" in an interview with the British publication, the Sun.

Prior to marrying Prince Harry, Meghan Markle publicly spoke out about her disdain for Trump, calling him ""misogynistic,"" and saying she would consider moving to Canada (where Suits filmed), if he became president.

When the paper's political editor Tom Newton Dunn spoke of Markle's comments, Trump said: ""I didn’t know that. What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty.""

The American president later denied he referring to the Duchess ""nasty,"" despite their being a recording of the conversation.

I never called Meghan Markle “nasty.” Made up by the Fake News Media, and they got caught cold! Will @CNN, @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2019

Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, says it's difficult to tell what Trump meant in this conversation. ""One would ordinarily assume that his answer refers to that statement,"" Jamieson told the Chicago Tribune. But given his history of calling women nasty, ""it's difficult to know what he meant,"" she said.

Meghan is not participating in this week's events, as she is currently on maternity leave, following the birth of her first child, Archie Harrison."
State Dept. panel to redefine human rights based on 'natural law and natural rights',https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-panel-redefine-human-rights-based-natural/story?id=63400485,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is setting up a commission at the State Department to redefine human rights as based on what the department is describing as ""natural law and natural rights.""

Interested in LGBT? Add LGBT as an interest to stay up to date on the latest LGBT news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The move has alarmed human rights activists, especially those focused on LGBT rights and women's rights, who fear it will mean an end to promoting protections for both groups around the world.

""It's an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,"" Pompeo told reporters Thursday, adding the effort is focused on ""how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world how to engage on those important issues.""

The State Department has declined to comment beyond Pompeo's remarks. But it did issue a public notice in the Federal Register on Thursday that says the body, named the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will provide Pompeo ""advice and recommendations concerning international human rights matters"" and meet about once a month.

""The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,"" according to the notice.

Use of the term ""natural law"" has concerned some advocacy groups and department staff, as it is interpreted in this case as ""God-given"" or religiously-based rights that affect issues like sexuality, abortion rights, and more. In particular, the phrase has been prominent in the work of Princeton professor Robert George.

George has played a prominent role in the creation of the commission, according to a source familiar with the plans for the commission. George, co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, a nonprofit that advocates against same-sex marriage, is among the 15 academics recommended to make up the panel, according to the source.

Author of the 1999 book ""In Defense of Natural Law,"" where he argued against homosexuality and abortion rights and in favor of religious liberty, George also wrote the original concept note that outlined a vision for the commission, the source said.

The commission ""is absolutely about those issues, but it's not explicit in the paper,"" the source said. ""It questions whether and which human rights are universal.""

George did not respond to a request for comment.

Dr. Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning, is listed as the top official on the Federal Register notice. Skinner, who leads the department's long-term foreign policy strategy team, recently raised eyebrows by describing the U.S. rivalry with China as a clash of civilizations and ""the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.""

Along with George and Skinner, the full list of participants has been recommended to the Secretary, but he still has to approve the final list. As part of the process, however, the department had to publish the Federal Register notice, which is dated May 22.

Igniting further concern about the project is the fact that the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor was not consulted in the process, two sources told ABC News.

""The wording of the Commission's mandate raised eyebrows with human rights advocates and congressional staff. The fact that it was announced with no prior outreach to or input from the human rights community immediately raised concerns over its motives... [and] the State Department already has a well-defined understanding of how to advance human rights and maintains several offices dedicated to various human rights issues,"" said Rob Berschinski, who served as deputy assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, or DRL, in the Obama administration.

Pompeo said Thursday the project is ""separate"" from DRL, but ""deeply connected to the work that not only DRL does, but that the entire State Department does around the world.""

Promoting the right to religious freedom has been a high priority for Pompeo, who will host his second summit on the topic this July. But he and the Trump administration, in general, have been criticized for pulling punches on U.S. partners over their human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for example, have been embraced by the top Trump officials despite their crackdowns on political opposition, women's rights activists, and NGOs.

""If the administration truly wants to engage in a meaningful dialogue about respecting human rights, then we are happy to have that discussion. But the fact that this panel was announced without details or consultation with human rights experts suggests that this may be just another instrument to negate rights, rather than protect them,"" said Tarah Demant, director of Amnesty International's Gender, Sexuality, and Identity program."

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico has suggested that Mexico is willing to negotiate over President Trump’s threat to tax all incoming goods from Mexico because Mexico isn’t “doing enough” to stop illegal immigration into the United States. Obrador hinted that his country could tighten migration controls in order to stop Trump from imposing tariffs, first of 5%, then up to 25% by October. Trump made no specific conditions for constitutes “stopping” illegal immigration, so this is all up in the air as to what personally satisfies the Donald. If one didn’t know any better, one would think that the US now has an absolute monarch with absolute power to stop any good from coming into the country by Tweet. Chances are though, now that Mexico wants to talk, Trump will suspend any tariffs from being raised until conclusion of talks, announce the best deal in the history of our local group of galaxies has been made, cancel the tariffs and praise himself for helping the stock market break to new highs. And if that doesn’t happen he’ll blame the Fed.

Gap Gaps Down, Loses GPS

The Gap (NYSE:GPS), agape at its weak Q1 earnings report, gapped down nearly 10% at the end of last week. Same store sales were down 1% at Old Navy, also a Gap brand, and Banana Republic with same store sales down 3%. The Gap itself was the worst performer, same store sales down 10%. Upper management is blaming it on the cold weather in February. Business and traffic picked up in March and April, but February destroyed the quarter according to CEO Art Peck. Gap has gapped down like this before, after the Dot Com bubble burst, and from 2014 to 2016 when it collapsed almost as much as it had in 2000. Is the era of trendy overexpensive teenage clothing gone? Maybe not now that tariffs are all in place on China, so it should be a bit harder ordering cheap clothes from AliExpress.

US Ready To Talk to Iran? So Says Pompeo

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is now saying that President Trump is ready to negotiate with Iran without preconditions, as American weapons and big planes and bombs stream in to Iran’s neighborhood in a show of force that is sure to make them happy. Pompeo may be playing off of Iranian President Rouhani’s call to negotiate with the U.S. without being bullied, which probably means that Rouhani doesn’t quite appreciate the show of force in the Persian Gulf as much as Trump may want him to. Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister has said that talks are not very likely. “We’re prepared to engage in a conversation with no preconditions,” he said. “But the American effort to fundamentally reverse the malign activity of the Islamic Republic, this revolutionary force, is going to continue.” In other words, the “bullying” in Iran’s words, will continue, so looks like no talking here.

Lyft Tempts Drivers With Free Charging In Portland, Land of Charging Ports

Portland, Oregon is truly becoming the land of ports, as in electric charging ports for electric cars driven by Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) drivers. Lyft will be able to charge their electric cars for free in the city, thanks to a partnership with Portland General Electric (NYSE:GE) which is sponsoring the initiative. Hybrid drivers also qualify. We’re proud to fuel Lyft’s mission to minimize its impact on the environment with a robust and healthy EV charging network, as it aligns with our goal to help deploy electric transportation that serves everyone — regardless of how they choose to move throughout our region.” So says Dave Robertson, VP of public policy at Portland General Electric. Don’t let your imagination run wild though. There are a total of 3 public charging stations in Portland. So this isn’t going to be a multimillion dollar partnership or anything. It’s more like passing around a battery-powered tin can. General Electric Portland probably wants people to start using the 3 charging stations so they can get used to them.

Department of Justice to Wants to Make Alphabet Soup Out of Google

The massive fines that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had to deal with in the European Union may be coming to the United States, or worse, Alphabet could be broken up in some way, if the Justice Department is really gunning for it. Google’s parent company is being investigated for antitrust violations for giving search preference to its own businesses. Google has not commented. If Trump indeed wants the stock market to keep rising, then going after tech companies that lead the entire market higher is probably not the best way to do it. Alphabet has been down lately, but not by that much, so the impact of this investigation especially if it leads to fines and/or changes in business practices could bring the stock down significantly, especially if Google has stopped growing since completely taking over the search market.

Defense Dept. to White House: Stop Politicizing the Military,http://nymag.com,['Matt Stieb'],06-02-2019,2019,6,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/06/def-sec-to-white-house-stop-politicizing-the-military.html,"Photo: AFP Contributor/AFP/Getty Images

The White House’s request to obscure the U.S.S. John S. McCain during the president’s recent visit to Japan has unfurled into its own case study of norm violations in the Trump administration. When the news broke on Thursday that the White House had asked that the destroyer stay “out of sight” when Trump was in Japan, the Navy initially denied the existence of such a request. But by Saturday, the Navy had acknowledged that the White House urged that it “minimize the visibility” of the vessel named after the father and grandfather of Trump’s foe in the GOP.

Then on Sunday, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney admitted on Meet the Press that a member of the White House advance team had requested that the destroyer be moved. “The fact some 23- or 24-year-old person went to that site and said, ‘Oh my goodness, there’s the John McCain, we all know how the president feels about the former senator, that’s not the best backdrop, can somebody look into moving it?’ That’s not an unreasonable thing to ask.” Mulvaney added that it would be “silly” for someone to get fired for their role in the posthumous feud, and that Trump’s feelings toward McCain — whom he has called a “dummy” and “not a war hero” — are “well known.”

Normally, this tacit acknowledgment of our toddler president’s behavior would be the end of such an exchange, and the country’s political attention would drift toward the next scandal du jour. But on Sunday, the Pentagon made the unanticipated step of telling the White House to leave the military out of Trump’s political posturing, according to a report from the Associated Press.

Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan reportedly told his chief of staff to inform the White House military office on Friday that “the Department of Defense will not be politicized.” According to the AP, Shanahan’s chief of staff “reported back that he delivered the message,” suggesting that the White House might not have been the most receptive audience.

Shanahan is now reportedly considering sending out formal guidelines to military units so that similar problems can be avoided the next time the White House tries to avoid a presidential meltdown. “The goal would be to ensure there is less ambiguity about how the military should support VIP events and how service members should respond to such political requests,” reports the AP.

The message from the Pentagon is a rare public clash between the Department of Defense and the White House, made more unusual by the uncertain job security of Patrick Shanahan, who is still serving as the acting Defense secretary. But to get the president to stop using the military as a political tool might be an uphill battle, considering such past efforts as announcing the travel ban from the Pentagon’s Hall of Heroes and Trump’s abandoned military parade."
The EPA says a chemical in Monsanto's weed-killer doesn't cause cancer — but there's compelling evidence the agency is wrong,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/glyphosate-cancer-dangers-roundup-epa-2019-5,"Gardeners Alva and Alberta Pilliod say they used Monsanto's Roundup spray to keep weeds off their driveway for more than two decades, applying the herbicide while wearing flip flops, shorts, and tank tops. Now, they both have Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). In a lawsuit, they were awarded $2.05 billion in damages in May.

School groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, now in his 40s, also used to spray Roundup up to 30 times every summer. He has the same blood cancer as the Pilliods, and won nearly $80 million in a suit last year.

A third man, Edwin Hardeman, used Roundup for more than 25 years to keep weeds off his oak trees. He got NHL, too. A jury in California ruled in March that Roundup was a ""substantial factor"" in his diagnosis.

More than 13,000 similar lawsuits have popped up in the US. Almost all are being filed by gardeners, groundskeepers, and other professional weed-whackers who allege that their consistent, repeated use of Roundup gave them cancer. One of the latest allegations came this week from 44-year-old groundskeeper Jeffrey Sabraski. Sabraski alleges he sprayed Roundup several times per week, wearing nothing but shorts and t-shirts, and has also developed NHL. He's suing Monsanto, as the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on Wednesday.

Roundup is the most widely-used herbicide in the world, and its key chemical is called glyphosate. The plaintiffs in this recent surge of court cases say that Monsanto didn't sufficiently warn them about the potential health risks associated with the product or tell them how to protect themselves from exposure.

But teasing out the health risks of glyphosate isn't easy. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) says the chemical is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the agro-chemical giant Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, both say glyphosate isn't linked to cancer in any meaningful way.

""EPA continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen,"" the agency said on its website. Canadian health authorities support the US' stance.

However, peeling back the curtain on the scientific studies that have looked at glyphosate thus far can tell us a lot about how the chemical can indeed be dangerous when people and animals are exposed to it in the wrong ways.

What Monsanto and the EPA say about glyphosate

Glyphosate, which has been in use around the world since the 1970s, blocks an enzyme pathway that helps plants grow. The herbicide's patent expired in 2000, and Indian and Chinese farmers are now the weed-killer's biggest buyers.

It's tricky for epidemiologists to say conclusively that something causes cancer, so what we know so far — from thousands of studies conducted in rats, mice, and humans — is that the pesticide might be linked with cancer, or it might not. Glyphosate might make cancer more likely to sprout up, since there's evidence it can encourage DNA damage. But more research is still needed to learn how, exactly, it affects the human body.

Monsanto maintains there's no good evidence the chemical causes cancer. The company often points to a 2017 study of more than 54,000 pesticide sprayers in Iowa and North Carolina (mostly farmers), which found no statistically significant association between glyphosate and cancer.

The company also often highlights the results of large-scale studies of French, Norwegian, and North American farmers that have found glyphosate to be safe.

But farmers are largely protected from the dangers of herbicides and pesticides, since they spray fields using industrial-grade farm equipment. In that same study, in fact, chemical sprayers who had the most exposure to glyphosate were found to have a slightly higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than people who'd never used the weed-killer. The difference, however, was so small that more research is needed to confirm these results.

The EPA has also consistently said that consumers have nothing to worry about when it comes to glyphosate.

""In 2017, EPA published comprehensive ecological and human health risk assessments for glyphosate. No human health risks were identified,"" the agency said in April. However, the EPA cautioned that ""potential ecological risks were identified for terrestrial and aquatic plants, birds, and mammals, primarily from exposure to spray drift.""

Humans, of course, are terrestrial mammals, too. And gardeners who use lots of glyphosate — without much protection — would arguably also be exposed to spray drift.

""The evidence is not as strong so as to be absolutely sure"" Manolis Kogevinas, of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, told Business Insider. ""But yeah, there's definitely a chance that they will develop cancer.""

The IARC has a different stance

In March 2015, the IARC convened a group of 17 experts from 11 countries to determine the potential human health dangers of glyphosate, along with four other pesticides and herbicides. The international, non-partisan committee concluded that glyphosate is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans, based on studies in humans and lab animals.

That's why glyphosate is now a ""Group 2A"" carcinogen, according to IARC. That means that the chemical is considered to be a contributor to cancer, but not on the level of more well known cancer-causers like formaldehyde and UV radiation.

But the IARC also has a complicated history with glyphosate research. Reuters reported in 2017 that the agency had cut sections out of a draft report that suggested glyphosate might not contribute to cancer. In a follow-up letter to Congress, IARC director Christopher Wild wrote that the group revised that draft because some of the data came from ""a review article co-authored by a Monsanto scientist.""

He added that the information from that article ""was insufficient for independent evaluation of the individual studies and the conclusions reached by the Monsanto scientist.""

Why these groups came to different conclusions about glyphosate

A tightly reviewed and vetted paper published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe earlier this year looked into why the EPA and IARC appear to disagree about the risks of glyphosate. It found that the EPA's conclusions relied mainly on ""unpublished regulatory studies,"" many of them industry-funded. The IARC, on the other hand, looked at ""mostly peer-reviewed studies.""

That could explain why 99% of the glyphosate studies that the EPA considered found that the chemical is not a cancer-causer, while 70% of the studies the WHO looked at suggested it probably is.

""It's kind of easy to understand why EPA would say, 'Well, geez, you know, it must be okay,'"" study author Charles Benbrook, an agricultural economist who now serves as an expert witness for plaintiffs involved in Roundup litigation, told Business Insider. ""It was okay because they were looking at a bunch of negative studies that Monsanto [did]. Monsanto repeated essentially the same study like 30 times.""

Benbrook alleges that the reason so many big payouts are being won in court is that Monsanto didn't properly warn people who used Roundup at home or on a small scale that they should wear protective clothing when they applied the weed-killer.

""It's not farmers out in the field with their large, modern spray rigs, where the operator is inside a steel and glass cab with a sophisticated air filtration system that essentially eliminates exposure,"" Benbrook said. ""Some people are spraying Roundup 6 or 8 hours a day for five days a week with this kind of handheld equipment.""

Monsanto maintains that as long as consumers follow the instructions on the label, glyphosate-based herbicides are perfectly safe. The company also points to hundreds of glyphosate studies in EPA databases that were not Monsanto-funded.

""At the end of the day, whether you're in the court of law, regulatory agencies, or court of public opinion, it's the science that should matter here,"" a Bayer spokesman said in an email to Business Insider. ""And the extensive body of science over 40 years, including several recent human epidemiology studies, shows that glyphosate-based herbicides are not associated with NHL. Customers who know these products best continue to rely on them.""

The company also points to the courtroom testimony of Robert Phalen, an environmental scientist who testified in the Pilliod's trial that human skin actually repels glyphosate. (Phalen once authored a textbook with another scientist also named Robert Phalen, who has said modern air may be ""a little too clean."")

Monsanto tweaked its Roundup formula in Europe

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pets stay off lawns and plants that have just been sprayed with glyphosate, since animals can develop digestive or intestinal issues if they touch the substance when it hasn't dried. Glyphosate has also recently been linked to more severe cases of fatty liver disease in people.

But beyond glyphosate, there's another compound in Roundup: soap-like detergents called surfactants that help the chemical penetrate the leaves of plants to work its weed-killing magic. Benbrook believes Monsanto should be doing more to warn people about how surfactants work and how to protect themselves.

""It's the surfactants that are carrying the glyphosate first through the skin and inside the body, and then inside of cells where damage can be done to DNA,"" he said.

In Europe, Benbrook noted, surfactant chemicals have been made less toxic for consumers. In the US, however, there's been less regulatory pressure, so Monsanto has not changed Roundup formulas in the same way. ""When juries learn that Monsanto is making a product that's at least 10 times, maybe 100 times safer all across Europe?"" he said. ""That's not acceptable. That's one of the reasons that I think we can expect a continuation of these mammoth punitive damage awards that have occurred in the first three trials.""

Bayer said that allegation is one ""we don't believe is supported by the extensive body of science.""

The company told Business Insider in an email that ""regulators have specifically assessed the safety of the class of surfactants used in glyphosate-based herbicides; in 2009, the U.S. EPA concluded that these surfactants are not carcinogenic.""

The statement added that Monsanto tweaked the surfactants in products sold in Europe ""due to market preferences or country-specific requirements in the region.""

Traces of glyphosate in food don't seem to hurt people

As lawsuits about glyphosate have entered the spotlight, some people have expressed concerns about the trace amounts of the chemical in our food.

The traces of glyphosate found in a bowl of Cheerios or a glass of wine are probably not going to kill anyone, though.

""Using the internationally accepted limits, an average adult male would have to drink over 1,000 liters of wine a day to reach any level of risk,"" pharmacologist Ian Musgrave recently wrote in The Conversation.

That said, it's worth remembering that different people's bodies can react differently to chemicals. The foods pregnant women eat impact how their fetus grows and develops, for example, and the developing digestive systems of infants and toddlers may be more delicate than others. Scientists are still studying how pesticides can impact childhood brain development.

Kogevinas still doesn't think the chemical's presence in food is much to worry about, though.

""If you ask me, is the glyphosate the problem in my food? No, it is not,"" he said. But he noted that he prefers to buy organic produce to avoid pesticides more generally.

Kogevinas lives in Barcelona, where the Roundup formulations adhere to the European standards, but that didn't affect his decision about whether or not to buy it: He has opted never to use glyphosate in his own garden."
"Google Slumps as Network Issues, DoJ Probe Report, China List Pressure Shares",https://www.thestreet.com,['Martin Baccardax'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/google-slumps-as-network-issues-doj-probe-report-china-list-pressure-shares-14978494,"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL - Get Report) shares traded sharply lower Monday as investor trimmed holdings of the Google parent following a weekend issue that caused traffic congestion across key parts of its network and a report that suggested it may face a federal antitrust probe over its search engine.

Google said the network issue, which began around mid-afternoon on Sunday, affected both its Cloud and YouTube offerings and caused severe congestion and user outages in the northeastern United States.

""The network congestion issue in eastern USA, affecting Google Cloud, G Suite, and YouTube has been resolved for all affected users as of 4:00 pm US/Pacific,"" Alphabet said in a statement. ""We will conduct an internal investigation of this issue and make appropriate improvements to our systems to help prevent or minimize future recurrence.""

""We will provide a detailed report of this incident once we have completed our internal investigation,"" the statement added. ""This detailed report will contain information regarding SLA credits.""

Google shares were marked 6.2% lower Monday to change hands at $1,037.11 each, a move that would wipe out all of its year-to-date gain and take the stock to its lowest level since January January 4.

Google's larger market issue Monday, however, centers around multiple media reports from late Friday -- first by the Wall Street Journal --- that suggested the U.S. Department of Justice is preparing a far-reaching probe into the tech giant's sprawling business.

""Potential implications for Google could include new regulations on business practices, or

an antitrust probe leading to a breakup,"" said Bank of America analyst Justin Post. To break up Google (on unfair search practices or too much power to influence opinion on multiple properties?), the DOJ would likely have to file a lawsuit and convince judges that Google has undermined competition.""

""It is very rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&T as past

examples, though the government tried to break up Microsoft and failed,"" he added, noting a full investigation could take as many as five years to resolve.

Last year, Google was fined a record $5 billion by European antitrust authorities following a lengthy investigation into contracts that tie makers of android-operated smartphones to the exclusive sale of its apps and was hit with a further $1.7 billion penalty in March for unfairly restricting rivals from displaying ads on its platform via third parties using its AdSense tool.

Should Google find itself in the crosshairs of a similar Justice Department probe in the United States, the Mountain View, California-based group could be susceptible to fines and restrictions in its biggest and most import market. It could also, given the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, appear on the forthcoming list of ""Unreliable Entities"" being prepared by the Chinese government in an effort to respond to the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei Technologies last month.

""Foreign enterprises, organizations and individuals that do not comply with market rules, violate the spirit of contract, block or cut supplies to Chinese firms with non-commercial purposes, and seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, will be added to the list of unreliable entities,"" Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Friday."
DHS says citizenship approvals rose in 2018,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/31/dhs-says-citizenship-approvals-rose-2018/,"Homeland Security reached a five-year high in approvals of citizenship applications last year, and swore in more people as naturalized citizens as well, according to the new statistical report released Friday night.

Those numbers contradict the criticisms of congressional Democrats who had complained about backlogs building at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Homeland Security branch that handles legal immigration.

The new report also suggests that far from a crackdown, the government is processing more asylum-seeker petitions than any of the last four years. That included a 61 percent increase from 2017 to 2018 in affirmative asylum applications — though refugee interviews are down from more than 1250,000 in 2016, the last year under President Barack Obama, to just 26,400 in fiscal year 2018 under President Trump.

Still, when the whole panoply of humanitarian programs is considered — asylum, refugees, crime victim visas, Temporary Protected Status and screening for credible fear or reasonable fear of persecution — the numbers were 32 percent higher than fiscal year 2017. Credible fear and reasonable fear are first steps on the asylum track.

USCIS’s workload has become contentious in recent years, with immigrant-rights groups accusing the Trump administration of building a bureaucratic “wall” to deny people the chance to enter the U.S. legally. The accusation is a play on their disdain for Mr. Trump’s border wall intended to stop illegal immigration.

Hispanic Democrats in Congress say things are so bad that they requested — and have been granted — an investigation to be done by the Government Accountability Office. Rep. Joaquin Castro, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said the case backlog is an example of “President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda.”

Yet the backlog in citizenship applications, for example, exploded during the end of the Obama administration. The Washington Times, which tracked the explosion at the time, sought comment from immigrant-rights activists and lawmakers, including Democrats, but didn’t find many who blamed the Obama administration for the slow processing.

The new numbers from USCIS also detail some of the more hidden parts of the agency’s work, such as its efforts to weed out fraud in legal immigration applications.

Experts say fraud is rampant, but the agency has not released any major fraud assessments in years.

Still, the Fraud Detection and National Security division reported 149,3000 investigative leads or actions year — a 14 percent increase over 2017. That included 30,400 tips of fraud, 7,600 national security matters and nearly 17,000 public safety matters.

FDNS also reported screening social media in 11,700 cases.

"Queen Elizabeth set to fete Trump, as she has so many other US presidents",https://www.cnn.com,['Betsy Klein'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/01/politics/donald-trump-queen-elizabeth-ii-state-visit/index.html,"(CNN) Queen Elizabeth II has met with nearly every American President since Dwight Eisenhower during her more than 67 years on the throne. Next week, she'll welcome President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump back to the United Kingdom, this time for a rare state visit.

Though the Trumps and the Royal Family are expected to adhere to the highest levels of protocol during the visit, Trump's remarks ahead of the trip threaten to damage goodwill with the Queen -- he publicly insulted her grandson's wife on the eve of the visit.

During an interview with The Sun, Trump was asked about comments made by Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, ahead of the 2016 election. Speaking on ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore"" in 2016, Markle called Trump misogynistic and said his politics are divisive, saying she would move to Canada if he won the presidency.

Trump responded, ""I didn't know that she was nasty. I hope she is OK,"" later adding, ""I am sure she will go excellently (as a royal). She will be very good."" Buckingham Palace had no comment on Trump's interview regarding Markle.

The Trumps previously met with the Queen at Windsor Castle last June, a more informal meeting over tea.

The trip comes amid a blitz of foreign travel for the President and will be the Trumps' second state visit in less than two weeks. In May, they were Japanese Emperor Naruhito's first state guests since he ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne earlier that month.

For the Trump's official visit, Buckingham Palace is pulling out all of the Royal stops befitting a world leader. An official state visit requires the formal invitation of the Queen to a head of state ""on the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth office,"" per Buckingham Palace , and usually involves a ceremonial welcome, a state banquet, other meetings with British officials and a formal farewell.

Trump, who is known to appreciate pomp and circumstance, is sure to revel in the pageantry. His adult children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump, will also be joining him and the first lady.

Likewise, they ""will have the opportunity to meet some other members of the Royal Family"" during the arrival ceremony, said a senior administration official briefing reporters on the trip. America's own member of the Royal Family, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is not expected to attend, as she has largely remained out of the public spotlight since giving birth in early May.

The 'special relationship'

The ""special relationship"" with the United Kingdom also carries special significance for the President. After their 2018 tea, Trump told interviewer Piers Morgan that he was thinking of his mother when he met the Queen.

""I was thinking about my mother. My mother passed away a while ago and she was a tremendous fan of the Queen. She thought she was a woman of elegance, and my mother felt she was a great woman. I remember even as a little guy, if there was any kind of a ceremony to do with the Queen, my mother would be watching the television -- she wanted to see it,"" Trump said at the time.

Trump recalled: ""I was walking up and I was saying (to Melania), 'Can you imagine my mother seeing this scene? Windsor. Windsor Castle.' And it was beautiful, it was really beautiful but the Queen is terrific. She is so sharp, so wise, so beautiful. Up close, you see she's so beautiful. She's a very special person.""

Trump told Morgan that the Queen walked him through all of the presidents she had met.

""Harry Truman was the first president that she got to meet and know, and she went through a whole list. It was a very nice moment, Piers, very nice,"" he said.

The Queen met President Harry Truman when she was still Princess Elizabeth, during a trip to Washington in 1951 at the age of 25. She and Prince Philip stayed at Blair House with Truman and his family since the White House was under a four-year major renovation, according to the White House Historical Association.

State visits

Since then, she's met with every US President, with the one exception of President Lyndon B. Johnson. But this is only the third state visit from a US president during Queen Elizabeth II's reign; the invitation has only been extended to Trump's most recent predecessors -- Barack and Michelle Obama in May 2011 and George W. and Laura Bush in November 2003.

She hosted the Kennedys for a banquet -- not an official state visit -- in 1961, which was recently depicted in the Netflix drama ""The Crown,"" hinting at an icy, if not entirely accurate , relationship between the Queen and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.

The Nixons, Carters, and Clintons also met her informally in 1970, 1977, and 1994, respectively, and she hosted a formal dinner honoring the Reagans at Windsor Castle in 1982. Carter drew the Queen Mother's ire during that 1977 visit when he kissed her on the lips.

""Nobody has done that since my husband died,"" she reportedly said.

The Queen has traveled to the United States for informal visits and state visits multiple times during her reign. For her first state visit to the US as Queen in 1957, she and Prince Philip stayed in the same suite in the White House in which her parents, King George VI and the Queen Mother, had stayed in 1939, according to the White House Historical Association, and she was greeted with large crowds on her motorcade from the airport.

At the White House

In 1976, President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford hosted her for a state dinner in the Rose Garden. President Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan served the Queen enchiladas and chile rellenos when she visited them at their Santa Barbara ranch in 1983, and days later, hosted a State Dinner in her honor at San Francisco's M.H. de Young Memorial Museum.

She rolled up her sleeves -- though not literally -- during an official state visit in 1991, planting a tree on the White House South Lawn alongside President George H. W. Bush, replacing a storm-damaged tree her father planted in 1937. And she attended a white-tie state dinner at the George W. Bush White House in 2007.

She shared a warm relationship with the Obamas, as Michelle Obama recently recalled

""So, I had all this protocol buzzing in my head, and I was like, 'Don't trip down the stairs and don't touch anybody, whatever you do,' "" the former first lady said during a book tour event. ""And so, the Queen says, 'Just get in, sit wherever,' and she's telling you one thing and you're remembering protocol and she says, 'Oh it's all rubbish, just get in.' ""

It remains to be seen whether the Queen shares the same affection for Trump.

Asked if he got the feeling she liked him, Trump told Morgan: ""Well, I don't want to speak for her, but I can tell you I liked her. So, usually that helps. But I liked her a lot."""
Elizabeth Warren says she wants to make it legal to indict presidents,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647042/elizabeth-warren-trump-indictment-mueller,"Special counsel Robert Mueller said indicting President Donald Trump was “not an option” this week, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a sitting president from criminal indictments and prosecution.

Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says she would change the policy as president.

Warren, among the first major Democratic 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment, released a two-part proposal on presidential powers Friday. First, she called on Congress to pass a law clarifying that the president of the United States is subject to the same federal criminal code as everyone else. Second, she pledged to appoint an attorney general and assistant AG who would change current Justice Department policy around indicting sitting presidents.

“Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That’s not how our country is supposed to work,” Warren wrote. “I pledge to nominate an [Office of Legal Counsel] head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a President cannot be indicted for criminal behavior.”

On Wednesday, Mueller reiterated he was operating under DOJ policy, as presented by the Office of Legal Counsel, that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime.

“Under longstanding department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,” Mueller said. “That is unconstitutional. ... The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.”

To be clear, what Mueller is referring to is not something expressly written in the Constitution. It’s a large gray area in the nation’s body of law — which Warren says she would address as president.

The question of presidential immunity, briefly explained

The closest the Supreme Court has come to answering the question of presidential immunity recently is a 1997 ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which maintained that a president is subject to civil lawsuits. But whether a sitting president can be subject to criminal prosecution remains an unanswered question in the courts.

Upon review in 1973 and again in 2000, OLC concluded that the best way to address criminal charges is to wait until a president leaves office, leaving impeachment as the avenue for accountability.

As Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained, the most famous argument in favor of making presidents immune from criminal prosecution is from a 1997 law review article by Yale constitutional law professor Akhil Amar and a then-student of his, Brian Kalt, who’s now a law professor at Michigan State University:

Amar and Kalt argue that the president is a unique official, as the sole person ultimately in charge of the executive branch. “If he is arrested, so too is the executive branch of the government,” they write. This distinguishes him from a normal legislator or judge, who can be prosecuted, because there are plenty of other judges and legislators who can carry on their work. “Any distraction of the President from his duties is much more significant than similar distractions of these other, prosecutable officials, and has a much bigger impact on the well-being of the nation and all its People,” they conclude.

But even Kalt says this is unsettled territory. There is an argument to be made that the president should be subject to the same legal standard as everybody else, and that there are structures in place to address a president with “distractions” from his executive duties.

The investigation into Trump, and the special counsel report outlining evidence that Trump may have obstructed justice, has raised this issue into the forefront once again.

William Barr just contradicted himself over a key claim he's made about Mueller's obstruction findings,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Sonam Sheth'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-contradicted-himself-key-claim-made-mueller-obstruction-findings-2019-5,"Attorney General William Barr contradicted himself in a significant way during an exclusive interview with CBS News, during which he revealed that the Department of Justice (DOJ) ""didn't agree with the legal analysis"" the former special counsel Robert Mueller used in his obstruction-of-justice investigation into President Donald Trump.

The attorney general added during the CBS interview that Mueller's analysis ""did not reflect the views of the department"" and instead represented ""the views of a particular lawyer or lawyers.""

But on May 1, while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Barr said the department ""accepted the special counsel's legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the special counsel in reaching our conclusion"" in the obstruction case.

During his CBS News interview, Barr told host Jan Crawford that DOJ officials ""applied what we thought was the right law [in the obstruction case], but then we didn't rely on that. We also looked at all the facts, tried to determine whether the government could establish all the elements, and as to each of those episodes, we felt that the evidence was deficient.""

Mueller did not make a ""traditional prosecutorial judgment"" on whether Trump obstructed justice in the Russia probe. But prosecutors laid out an extensive roadmap of evidence — including 11 potential instances of obstruction — against Trump, many of which appear to meet the legal criteria needed to prove obstruction of justice.

Mueller cited a 1973 Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) memo — which says a sitting president cannot be indicted — as the primary reason he didn't make a conclusion one way or another on whether Trump obstructed justice. Many legal experts have said that even if Mueller couldn't indict Trump, he still could have stated that he believed there was enough evidence of criminal activity.

But Mueller said that suggesting Trump should be charged without actually charging him would be unfair because it would deprive the president of the chance to clear his name in a court of law. For that reason, Mueller said he didn't believe he was authorized to make a formal conclusion on the obstruction question.

Prosecutors noted, however, that their report ""does not exonerate"" the president and that if they had confidence Trump did not [emphasis ours] commit a crime, they would have said so.

They also pointed out that a president is not immune from criminal prosecution once he leaves office, and that the Constitution ""requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" which is a reference to impeachment.

One former senior DOJ official who worked closely with Mueller when he was FBI director characterized Mueller's report and his public statement this week to INSIDER as ""Mueller, in his own way and as loudly as he legally could, shouting from the rooftops that Congress needs to act.""

""Mueller isn't [Whitewater independent counsel] Ken Starr,"" the former senior official added. ""He's not a showman, he's a prosecutor. He got the evidence, he laid out all the facts, and he did the heavy lifting. Now, he's basically saying to Congress: the ball's in your court. Start the impeachment process.""

Before Mueller's report was released to the public, the attorney general took the unusual step of releasing a four-page summary of his ""principal conclusions"" of Mueller's findings. Barr said Mueller's team did not find sufficient evidence to charge Trump or anyone on his campaign for conspiring with the Russian government during the 2016 election.

Read more: Elizabeth Warren says she'd reverse the DOJ policy that says a sitting president can't be indicted

In the obstruction case, Barr took it upon himself to conclude that there wasn't enough evidence to accuse Trump of obstructing justice.

Barr told CBS News that Mueller's statement that he could not clear Trump of a crime ""is not the standard we use at the department.""

""We have to determine whether there is clear violation of the law, and so we applied the standards we would normally apply,"" Barr said. ""We analyzed the law and the facts, and a group of us spent a lot of time doing that and determined that, both, as a matter of law, many of the instances would not amount to obstruction.""

Barr's interview comes as he weathers a firestorm of criticism over his handling of Mueller's report. Barr told Congress during his confirmation hearing earlier this year that he would do everything he could to protect the integrity of the FBI's Russia probe and that he did not believe Mueller was on a ""witch hunt,"" as Trump and his allies often claim.

But since taking over as attorney general, Barr has gone to significant lengths to defend the president in ways that many say casts him more as the president's personal defense attorney instead of the nation's chief law enforcement officer.

Barr also skipped a scheduled hearing before the House Judiciary Committee about his oversight of the Russia probe; he launched multiple investigations into the origins of the Russia probe; and he accused the FBI of ""spying"" on the Trump campaign.

This week, during his interview with CBS News, Barr used more inflammatory rhetoric to describe the Russia investigation, saying the bureau crossed "" a serious red line"" by investigating Trump. Seconds later, however, the attorney general admitted he had no clear basis for making the allegation."
State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law',https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Commission on Unalienable Rights will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a move that has surprised and puzzled human rights activists. | Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images foreign policy State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law'

The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.

The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.

Story Continued Below

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.

Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.

The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signal a religious component, experts said.

Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.

“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.

The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.

The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.

Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.

State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.

But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.

Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.

“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”

“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.

Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.

The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.

The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.

But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.

It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.

According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."

US Department of Energy is now referring to fossil fuels as “freedom gas”,https://arstechnica.com,['Megan Geuss'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/us-department-of-energy-is-now-referring-to-fossil-fuels-as-freedom-gas/,"Call it a rebranding of ""energy dominance.""

In a press release published on Tuesday, two Department of Energy officials used the terms ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" to replace your average, everyday term ""natural gas.""

The press release was fairly standard , announcing the expansion of a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal at the Freeport facility on Quintana Island, Texas. It would have gone unnoticed had an E&E News reporter not noted the unique metonymy ""molecules of US freedom.""

DOE Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg is quoted as saying, ""With the US in another year of record-setting natural gas production, I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of US freedom to be exported to the world.”

Also in the press release, US Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes refers to natural gas as ""freedom gas"" in his quote: “Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy.""

Slate notes that the term ""freedom gas"" seems to have originated from an event with DOE Secretary Rick Perry. Earlier this year, the secretary signed an order to double the amount of LNG exports to Europe, saying, “The United States is again delivering a form of freedom to the European continent. And rather than in the form of young American soldiers, it’s in the form of liquefied natural gas.”

A reporter at the order signing jokingly asked whether the LNG shipments should be called ""freedom gas,"" and Perry said, ""I think you may be correct in your observation.""

If the DOE is still running with the term as a joke, then the wit in the Energy Secretary's office is bone dry. Ars contacted the DOE to see if ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" are now going to be standard in department communication with the public. We are also curious if any potential drop in LNG exports could result in patriotism bloat. The DOE has not responded, though we'll update the story if it does.

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and Japan were the top importers of freedom gas last year. China, India, and the UK buy a smaller number of molecules of US freedom."

Sen. Ron Wyden threatened on Thursday to put a hold on Treasury Department nominees unless the administration offers fuller answers about congressional efforts to obtain President Donald Trump’s tax returns.

Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, had pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a letter this month about the administration’s handling of House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal’s request for Trump’s returns. He said Thursday that the department’s response — which came not from Mnuchin, but from Justin Sok of Treasury’s legislative affairs office — was “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.”

Story Continued Below

“If the Treasury Department refuses to answer our questions, I am prepared to again place a hold on department nominees as I did previously when routine requests for information went unanswered,” the Oregon Democrat added. “Congress needs to take action to force the administration to comply with oversight.”

Wyden had already said last week that Brent McIntosh, Treasury’s general counsel and Trump’s nominee to be Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, “needs to be prepared to thoroughly answer” questions about his role in the department’s refusal to comply with Neal’s request and a subsequent subpoena if he wanted the position.

Several other Treasury nominees could face a hold: Brian McGuire for assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Michael Faulkender for assistant secretary for economic policy, Brian Callanan for general counsel and Geoffrey William Seiji Okamoto for deputy undersecretary.

In his letter to Mnuchin this month, Wyden asked how often tax committees had sought tax return information this century and how frequently that request has been handled by the Treasury secretary instead of the IRS commissioner.

Sok’s response maintained that Neal’s request was “categorically different” than previous committee requests for “statistical data to inform the drafting of tax legislation,” similar to the arguments that Mnuchin has made in public. Mnuchin repeatedly has said that Neal’s stated reason for requesting Trump’s returns — to conduct fuller oversight of the IRS’ capabilities in its routine auditing of presidents — is a cover and that Democrats are merely seeking ways to embarrass the president.

Wyden placed holds on Treasury nominees last year — including Justin Muzinich, Trump’s choice to be deputy secretary — because he believed the administration was stonewalling requests for oversight information. Muzinich was confirmed in December.

Spray cheese would count as food stamp staple under Trump administration proposal,https://www.cbsnews.com,"[""Caitlin O'Kane""]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposal-would-count-spray-cheese-beef-jerky-staple-foods/,"A new policy proposed by the Trump administration would allow foods like spray cheese to be considered ""staples"" for federal food stamps. Staple foods are important to the food stamps program, officially known as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), as regulations require SNAP retailers to stock a certain number of these food staples.

Loosening the rules would allow more retailers like convenience stores to accept SNAP benefits, even if they don't carry much in the way of fresh or healthy food.

A 2001 rule from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) required stores that take SNAP to carry a variety of foods in each of the four ""staple food"" categories: Meat, poultry, or fish; dairy products; bread or cereals; and vegetables or fruits. The stores must also carry at least one perishable item in at least two of the categories.

Under the new proposal, which was introduced in April, canned spray cheese or canned cheese dipping sauce would count as a dairy, pimento-stuffed olives would count as a vegetable or fruit, and beef jerky would count as a meat.

The Department of Agriculture said the new proposal ""provides greater regulatory flexibility to SNAP retailers, particularly small entities, in meeting the enhanced stocking requirements of the 2016 final rule.""

This Obama-era rule required SNAP stores carry a wider variety of foods in each group, increasing the number of products from three to seven in each staple group. Some food industry groups opposed this rule, believing small SNAP retailers ""would struggle to reach seven (7) varieties in the meat, poultry, or fish and dairy products staple food categories and such commenters suggested increasing flexibility for stores in these categories,"" the USDA writes.

The National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), which lobbied for the proposed change, said ""meeting the new requirements can be difficult for convenience stores and other small format retailers who face constraints on supply and delivery.""

""On average, convenience stores get food deliveries 1-2 times a week, which can make stocking certain foods, particularly perishable foods, difficult,"" NACS writes on their website. The proposed changes would address this problem by giving retailers more flexibility, saving small businesses $500 over the course of five years, the Department of Agriculture said.

However, some consumer advocates blasted the proposal for putting retailers' interests ahead of the health and nutrition needs of poor families.

The Center for Science in the Public Interest is urging people to ""tell the U. S. Department of Agriculture that low-income families deserve to shop in stores that offer a meaningful variety of healthy staple foods.""

""You don't have to have a nutrition degree to know that canned spray cheese sauce is not a staple food,"" Margo Wootan, the group's vice president for nutrition, told Bloomberg News, which first reported on the proposal. She compared it to the notorious Reagan administration federal school lunch policy which sought to count ketchup as a vegetable.

""Those are not real food you could serve to your family for dinner,"" Wootan said.

The Department of Agriculture will be taking public comments on the proposal until June 7, when a decision to adopt the new rules will be made."
Department of Corrections turns over disputed documents to Justice Department,https://www.al.com,"['William Thornton', 'Wthornton Al.Com']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.al.com/news/2019/06/department-of-corrections-turns-over-disputed-documents-to-justice-department.html,"The Alabama Department of Corrections surrendered documents this week that the U.S. Department of Justice said dealt with reports of excessive force and sexual abuse against inmates by correctional officers.

According to a four-page motion filed Thursday by lawyers representing the DOJ, the ADOC provided documents “specifically related to use of force and sexual abuse by staff.” As a result, the DOJ withdrew a petition to enforce a subpoena that it filed last October.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Gray Borden had given both sides until Friday to come up with a solution to the impasse.

There is no word yet on what DOJ will do with the documents. In April the Justice Department released a report on its two-and-a-half-year investigation into violence and poor conditions within Alabama’s men’s prisons. The DOJ concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that conditions in the prisons violate the Eighth Amendment.

Last month, in an effort to get the contested documents, Justice Department lawyers said there are still areas of the investigation that have “not been completed.”

A footnote on the first page of the 62-page report on Alabama’s prisons says that the investigation was opened to look at whether ADOC was adequately ensuring inmate safety from physical and sexual violence between inmates, and whether inmates had safe and sanitary living conditions.

However, the footnote stated that an investigation into a third issue - whether inmates were safe from excessive force and sexual abuse from staff members – is ongoing “because the Department’s petition to enforce its subpoena for documents relevant to that issue is pending with the court.”

On Oct. 12, 2018, DOJ filed a petition requesting the federal court force ADOC to turn over a series of individual prisoner investigative files, and documents on open and closed investigations, including autopsy reports on some inmates and some medical records not previously made available at correctional facilities.

The filing also requested weekly reports from ADOC’s Intelligence and Investigations Division from September 2016 to September 2017.

Since 2012, Alabama men’s and women’s prisons have come under repeated scrutiny for staffing and safety, as well as a pervasive atmosphere of documented sexual and physical abuse."

One cell built to hold 12 migrants had 76 detainees, while another meant for eight people had 41 migrants, the report says. “[Customs and Border Protection] was struggling to maintain hygienic conditions in the holding cells. With limited access to showers and clean clothing, detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks,” the report says. “We also observed detainees standing on toilets in the cells to make room and gain breathing space, thus limiting access to the toilets.” The watchdog warned that morale is low among DHS workers at the facility, and “corrective action is critical to the immediate health and safety needs of detainees.”"
VA denies Mass. veteran home loan over his legal marijuana job,https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2019/06/03/denies-mass-veteran-home-loan-over-his-legal-marijuana-job/3vDhId0dVMTA8xmfIsDoXK/story.html,"Finally, in November, they found a yellow split-level ranch in Dracut they loved — it had a giant living room, a two-car garage, and a nice yard for the kids. The veteran filed his Army paperwork.

It wasn’t easy in Massachusetts’ pricey market. But the man, a disabled Army veteran, had one advantage — a military benefit, a loan guarantee, that would provide a low-rate mortgage with no money down.

The couple, crammed in a tiny Revere apartment with two kids and a third on the way, had spent months searching for a house they could afford.

But in January, as the deal was set to close, he learned that the Veterans Administration had denied his loan application.

The reason? His job — assistant manager of a licensed cannabis store.

“I was actually accomplishing a lifelong goal of mine, and then to have it pulled right out from under you at the 11th hour … I was blown away,” said the veteran, 35, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his military relationship. “It was very frustrating and demoralizing.”

The man’s experience highlights one of the many ways that federal cannabis prohibition harms veterans who either consume or work in the marijuana industry. Veterans who find medical relief from pot say they’ve suffered loss of benefits — which the VA denies — or have been labeled unemployable. Many more say they’re financially over-burdened and medically underserved because the VA doesn’t discuss or cover the drug as it does with every other medicine, including opioids.

Veterans who work in the marijuana industry face financial consequences. Retired Army Major Tye Reedy, who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, lost his military pension for working as director of operations at Acreage Holdings, one of the nation’s largest cannabis companies, according to a Barron’s report.

“A military officer working in the cannabis industry runs contrary to Army values,” the Army said, according to Barron’s.

After being rejected for his home loan in January, the Revere veteran called his congresswoman, US Rep. Katherine Clark. Clark was outraged.

“We owe our veterans a great deal of gratitude, but it cannot just be something we say — we have to do it and act on it,” Clark said this week. “There had been an injustice here.”

When Clark’s office contacted the VA, the VA said it didn’t deem the veteran’s source of income “stable and reliable” enough for a mortgage. The VA also said that if VA employees accepted his income for a loan application, they could be prosecuted for assisting in money laundering because marijuana is federally illegal.

On May 23, Clark sent a letter, signed by 20 lawmakers, to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, describing the local veteran’s case and asking for clarification within 30 days on the VA’s policies. The letter noted that more than 211,000 people work in the legal cannabis trade nationwide, which generates $11 billion in sales per year.

“A substantial number of veterans earn their livelihoods in this industry, and in coming years, that number is likely to further rise,” the letter said. “The VA must acknowledge this reality and ensure veterans who work in this sector are able to clearly understand and can equitably access the benefits they’ve earned.”

Asked to comment on the veteran’s case, a VA spokeswoman said: “VA appreciates the lawmakers’ views and will respond directly.”

After receiving the written policies, Clark said, she will “coordinate a legislative response to ensure that veterans get their benefits.”

Meanwhile, the veteran in Revere is looking for a house — again. His wife has headed back to work. This time around, they’ll include her income on the application and go through a more conventional process without the VA home-loan benefit.

He has loved working in the cannabis industry. Having used medical marijuana to get off opioids that were prescribed for chronic pain after both his shoulders were injured during a training exercise, the veteran now finds fulfillment helping customers in his shop.

“I was a shell of myself” on opioids, he said. “Cannabis is a medicine that’s revolutionary, that’s giving people back their quality of life.”

If only the federal government would see it that way, he said. After all, he said, it has no problem collecting his federal taxes from every paycheck.

“If I worked for a startup company, they’d see that as more secure,” he said. “My shop takes in $100,000 a day — what’s more secure backing than that?”

"DOJ inspector general: Ex-FBI official leaked 'sensitive' info, improperly accepted gift from media",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-ex-fbi-official-leaked-sensitive-info-improperly-accepted-gift-from-media,"The Justice Department's watchdog said a high-ranking FBI official leaked ""sensitive"" information to reporters multiple times without authorization and had improperly accepted a gift from the media.

A one-page report from Inspector General Michael Horowitz released Wednesday concluded that a now-former deputy assistant director with the FBI “engaged in misconduct” by disclosing information to the media that had been filed under seal in federal court, maintaining dozens of unauthorized contacts with reporters, and accepting a $225 ticket from a member of the media to attend a dinner sponsored by the media.

Despite these violations of FBI policy, the inspector general said “prosecution of the [deputy assistant director] was declined.”

The investigation was initiated by the Office of the Inspector General in response to allegations from the FBI, and the inspector general said that it is now “providing this report to the FBI for appropriate action.”

When the Washington Examiner reached out to the DOJ inspector general’s office for further information about the investigation, including the identity of the unnamed deputy assistant director, a senior counsel said to file a Freedom of Information Act request with their office.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this month, Sen. Chuck Grassley told Attorney General William Barr “there have been a number of leaks coming out of the Justice Department and FBI during high-profile investigations” and that “leaks undermine the ability of investigators to investigate.” Barr assured him that “we have multiple criminal leak investigations underway.”

[ Related: Doug Collins suspects ex-FBI leaker is Peter Strzok]

The inspector general said in its report Wednesday that the investigation stemmed from one of many episodes referenced in the office’s bombshell 2018 report titled “Review of Allegations Regarding Various Actions by the Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Advance of the 2016 Election.” That inspector general inquiry, which focused on the conduct of the DOJ and FBI during the “Midyear Exam” investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, concluded that members of both the department and the bureau acted improperly.

The 568-page tome that dropped nearly a year ago described “a culture of unauthorized media contacts” within the FBI and had a section focused on “dozens of FBI employees that had contact with members of the media,"" many in violation of FBI policies. Horowitz said “the harm caused by leaks” and “the fear of potential leaks” actually “influenced FBI officials who were advising then Director Comey on consequential investigative decisions in October 2016.”

The 2018 report said investigators “identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.” Horowitz said “we do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,” but instead “we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.”

A February 2018 report from Horowitz found former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had improperly disclosed information to the Wall Street Journal confirming the existence of a Clinton Foundation investigation. That report determined McCabe “lacked candor” when speaking with former FBI Director James Comey, with the FBI’s Internal Investigations Section, and with the Office of the Inspector General. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018 just a couple days before he was set to retire.

Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who has been making the rounds on cable news shows defending his role in the Trump-Russia investigation and his handling of the Steele dossier over the past few weeks, recently confirmed the existence of a likely criminal leaks investigation into him, but declined to provide many specifics. “I am confident that I did nothing wrong and nothing illegal,"" Baker said. That probe was handled by U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was recently picked by Barr to head up the investigation of the investigators who ran the Trump-Russia probe.

Besides looking into criminal leaks, Horowitz is also handling a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse investigation that is expected to wrap up in May or June."
"Dana Milbank: An invitation to impeach, in Mueller-speak",https://www.sltrib.com,"['Dana Milbank', 'The Washington Post']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/05/30/dana-milbank-an/,"Washington - Robert Mueller is that rare public figure who, in this age of bombast and baloney, still uses language with discipline and economy.

For two years as special counsel, he said not a word in public, and his office sprung nary a leak. Even when his purported friend Attorney General William Barr seriously mischaracterized his findings before releasing the report, Mueller kept quiet.

Finally, Mueller emerged in front of the cameras at the Justice Department on Wednesday morning to say that ... well, he doesn’t wish to say anything more.

""It is important the office's written work speak for itself,"" he said, and ""the report is my testimony,"" and ""we chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself.""

This linguistic caution makes it all the more noteworthy that Mueller did depart from the report's language in one area: President Trump's criminality. A ""president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional,"" Mueller said. ""Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that, too, is prohibited."" Charging the president with a crime, he said, ""was therefore not an option.""

Unconstitutional. Prohibited. Not an option. This was stronger language than the report used, and Mueller added that under ""principles of fairness,"" he couldn't charge Trump ""when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge."" Under Justice Department policy, he said, ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal-justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.""

That process is impeachment.

If this man of precise language was not inviting Congress to impeach the president, he certainly seemed to be inviting the belief that he didn't charge Trump with crimes only because he couldn't. And because Mueller chooses words carefully, it's also worth noting which one he didn't use: ""collusion."" Instead, he implicitly rebuked a president who constantly, maddeningly, refers to Vladimir Putin's interference in the 2016 election as the ""Russian hoax.""

""Russian intelligence officers who are part of the Russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system,"" Mueller reminded us Wednesday. He found ""that they used sophisticated cyber techniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign. They stole private information and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization WikiLeaks. The releases were designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate.""

Mueller ended his nearly 10-minute statement where it began, and where the entire investigation began: with a Russian attack on the United States. There ""were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election, and that allegation deserves the attention of every American,"" Mueller said.

If our country's political health were better, the Russian attack would get the attention of every American. But Mueller gives us more credit than we deserve. His report assumed that our leaders would take seriously the Russian threat when presented with overwhelming evidence. It assumed that political leaders would soberly weigh the evidence that Trump obstructed his investigation.

Article continues below

Instead, Trump laughs about the whole thing with Putin, Republican leaders quash bipartisan efforts to protect the 2020 election from another attack, and GOP lawmakers, instead of pondering the president's culpability and Mueller's damning findings, demand investigations of investigators' ""treason"" and attempted ""coup.""

In appealing to their better angels, Mueller was naive. Yet even Wednesday, as he entered the Justice Department briefing room, stooped and alone, he continued to act as though things were on the level. His necktie askew, he read from his text carefully, tripping over a few words, occasionally rubbing his nose and otherwise indicating discomfort in the spotlight. ""I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further,"" he said.

Mueller's sense of propriety seems quaint, given the sabotage done to him. Barr's misdirection about Mueller's findings devalued the crucial work, but Mueller said he didn't question Barr's ""good faith."" Trump outrageously accuses investigators of a capital crime, but Mueller mildly defended his staff's ""fair and independent manner"" and ""highest integrity.""

Trump reacted to Mueller's statement in predictable fashion. He retweeted a false statement saying Mueller found ""no collusion,"" he proclaimed his innocence, and he retweeted a message from his campaign: ""Now it's time to turn to the origins of the Russia hoax and get to the bottom of why the Trump campaign was spied on by the Obama-era DOJ and FBI.""

Russia is preparing to attack us -- again. Trump is poised to benefit -- again. Unlike in 2016, we now know Russia's bad intentions, thanks to Mueller. That Trump and his allies facilitate the Russian attack by refusing to protect against it is the essence of collusion.

Mark Meadows sends referral to DOJ about mysterious UK communique about Christopher Steele,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-referral-to-doj-about-mysterious-uk-communique-about-christopher-steele,"Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a referral to the Justice Department about a message a top United Kingdom national security official delivered to the Trump transition team a week before President Trump's inauguration.

Congressional investigators told the Hill that in January 2017 then-U.K. national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant hand-delivered a memo to soon-to-be national security adviser Michael Flynn's team that asserted the U.K. government had doubts about the credibility of British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Recent reports suggest Steele had briefed British intelligence officials on his dossier after the 2016 presidential election, and the heads of MI5 and MI6 were made aware of the contents of the dossier by late November.

“A whistleblower recently revealed the existence of a communique from our allies in Great Britain during the early days of the Russia collusion investigation,” Meadows said.

“Based on my conversations with that individual, and the credible timelines that are supported by other events, I made a referral to Attorney General William Barr and Inspector General Michael Horowitz for further investigation,” the North Carolina Republican added. “There now is overwhelming evidence to suggest that on multiple occasions the FBI was warned that Christopher Steele and the dossier had severe credibility issues.”

Steele compiled a dossier that contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and was paid, in part, by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. His dossier has become a flashpoint of concern for Republicans after the declassification of a House Intelligence Committee memo that said the FBI used the unverified research to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants beginning in October 2016 to wiretap onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

GOP investigators learned of the communique's existence within the past few weeks by a whistleblower who was part of Flynn's team and are pressing for answers ahead of Trump's visit to the United Kingdom early next month. Its existence came to light a month after the revelation of a State Department official's notes about an October 2016 meeting with Steele, sent to the FBI, that warned he was unreliable and that he had said he was being encouraged to get his allegations out prior to the 2016 presidential election.

The communique could be significant as it would have been delivered before the FBI applied for three FISA renewals against Page in 2017 using Steele's research. Sources said Flynn was not aware of its existence until he was questioned as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian envoy, and therefore Trump too was likely not told about it.

The possible misuse of Steele's dossier has come into greater focus in recent weeks, including questions about whether the dossier contained possible Russian disinformation and whether former FBI Director James Comey or former CIA Director John Brennan tried to include the dossier in the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

At least three federal investigations are looking into alleged FISA abuse, and other matters related to the way the FBI and the Justice Department conducted the Trump-Russia investigation, and several top ex-officials. Among them are Barr's examination of the origins of the counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign. He has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review. Barr says he is working closely with Horowitz, who is nearing completion of his FISA abuse investigation.

Steele is reportedly open to speaking with Horowitz but has declined to cooperate with Barr."
