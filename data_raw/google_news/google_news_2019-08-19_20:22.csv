Donald Trump's latest conspiracy theory target? Fox News.,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/politics/donald-trump-fox-news/index.html,"(CNN) Before he boarded Air Force One to fly back to Washington on Sunday afternoon, President Donald Trump was asked about a recent Fox News poll that showed him in serious trouble vis a vis the 2020 election. Trump, as he is wont to do, went off at length on his once-favorite network.

The poll showed Trump's approval rating in the low 40s and had him losing by six or more points to Democratic 2020 rivals Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden.

Unsurprisingly, Trump didn't like that. Here's the key bit:

""Well, Fox has always given me -- I'll tell you, Fox is a lot different than it used to be, I can tell you that. ... Fox has changed. And my worst polls have always been from Fox. There's something going on at Fox, I'll tell you right now. And I'm not happy with it.""

Trump cuts off one of his closest friends,https://www.politico.com,['Daniel Lippman'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/19/donald-trump-cuts-off-tom-barrack-1467191,"The key issue driving the two men apart: Tom Barrack’s role as chairman of President Donald Trump's 2017 inauguration fund, which is under investigation by prosecutors. | Photo by Jim Bourg - Pool/Getty Images White House Trump cuts off one of his closest friends Inside the president's feud with Tom Barrack.

Tom Barrack and Donald Trump have been friends and confidants for more than three decades — the two men are so close, for instance, that Barrack comforted Trump during the funeral of his father, Fred.

But the intimate relationship between the wealthy California investor and the president has fractured so badly that the two no longer speak, current and former White House officials say.

Story Continued Below

The key issue driving the two men apart: Barrack’s role as chairman of the president’s 2017 inauguration fund, which is under investigation by prosecutors.

Trump was “really upset” to read reports about Barrack’s role in allegedly making it easy for some foreigners and others to try to spend money to get access to Trump and his inner circle and whether some of the inauguration money was misspent, according to a senior administration official.

“The president was really surprised to read all about the inauguration and who was trying to buy access and how, because the president doesn’t get any of that money,” said the official.

(The inaugural committee spent more than $1.5 million at Trump’s hotel in Washington.)

Barrack and Trump have known each other since the late 1980s, when Barrack, now CEO and executive chairman of the real estate and private equity firm Colony Capital, helped sell him the Plaza Hotel in New York for almost $410 million, a property that creditors later seized after Trump couldn’t make the full debt payments. (Trump took out a full-page ad in New York Magazine in 1988 saying the deal was “not economic” and that “I can never justify the price I paid.”)

Barrack, 72, has said in interviews that he grew close to Trump, 73, during “soft moments” such as their divorces and the birth of children. A major fundraiser for the 2016 campaign, he spoke warmly of his friend at the convention in Cleveland — flattering him by saying, among other things, that the New York real estate mogul had played him “like a Steinway piano” in business dealings.

In the early days of the administration, the newly minted president leaned often on his longtime friend for counsel and sympathy. Trump and Barrack sometimes would speak multiple times a day, according to the senior administration official, often calling Barrack late at night to seek advice and catch up. Trump has spoken glowingly of Barrack’s business acumen over the years; he told Fortune for a 2005 profile that “Tom has an amazing vision of the future, an ability to see what’s going to happen that no one else can match.”

But that advice has not always been stellar. According to the Mueller report, Barrack recommended that Trump hire his old friend Paul Manafort, who was initially brought onto the campaign to smooth Trump’s path at the Republican convention. Manafort went on to assume a larger role in the campaign after the firing of Corey Lewandowski, only to be ousted himself amid media scrutiny of his business dealings in Ukraine -- and later to be indicted for those activities.

And as other prosecutors have dug into Barrack’s handling of the inauguration fund, Trump has privately soured on his mentor.

In July, the New York Times reported that the public integrity unit of the U.S. Attorney’s office in Brooklyn was investigating whether Barrack violated laws requiring lobbyists to register when they work for foreign interests, though he has not been accused of any wrongdoing. In particular, the Times reported, prosecutors were probing whether the inauguration let foreigners from the Middle East use straw donors to donate to the inauguration.

Trump was surprised to learn elsewhere, according to a senior administration official, that the inaugural committee paid $26 million to the firm of Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a New York social planner who was previously close to First Lady Melania Trump and was a senior adviser to her in the White House until early last year. (Only $500,000 of that money went to Wolkoff herself, according to documents Vanity Fair reviewed earlier this year.)

All the money raised for the convention, a record $107 million, was for the specific purpose of covering inauguration costs, but it came from a number of people and companies Barrack couldn’t convince to give money to the campaign or to outside groups when he was raising money for Trump during the 2016 campaign, according to the senior administration official.

“Trump improbably wins and they’re like, ‘Holy crap, I better send a check.’ They send a check to the inauguration and are like, ‘Look at me, six- or seven-figure check, I’m involved, I support your presidency,’” this person said. “But you didn’t support his candidacy three days ago.”

Trump’s feud with Barrack may not be permanent; the president has been known to turn on allies and friends, only to bring them back into the fold months or years later. But for now, it’s clear the breach is serious and deep.

The White House declined to comment on the split. But a spokesman for Barrack, Owen Blicksilver, pushed back on the notion that the two are no longer friendly.

“The relationship between Mr. Barrack and the president remains unchanged,” he said in a statement. “They have been friends for 40 years and Tom has great respect for President Trump and the incredibly daunting task of executing the job of president of the United States. Just as the president has worked 24/7 to lead the strongest economy in the last 50 years, Mr. Barrack also has a 24/7 responsibility leading a business he created 26 years ago.”

Still, Barrack has cut back his presence in Washington in the last six months and “has not been around” D.C. much recently, according to someone who knows him, although he attended a dinner that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently hosted for Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Barrack also used to regularly attend dinners or parties hosted by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, but hasn’t been to one recently.

“The last thing Trump needs is to be closely associated with one more person facing scrutiny and potential ethical issues,” said the person who knows Barrack.

The harsh spotlight goes well beyond the inauguration as Barrack, a Lebanese-American who is friendly with several Middle East leaders, has been accused of promoting his own business interests in his dealings with the president.

A report recently released by Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee showed that Barrack worked with well-connected UAE businessman Rashid Al-Malik to make suggestions for an energy speech Trump gave in 2016 to be more favorable toward the Middle East and urged Manafort to get Trump to mention Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.

He also allegedly pushed the administration to give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive nuclear technology while at the same time trying to profit from a potential deal, according to the House committee. (Trump read with interest the Wall Street Journal article on the report, according to the senior administration official.) Nonproliferation experts have opposed such a deal because they worried that it would make it much easier for Saudi Arabia to get a nuclear bomb to compete with Iran.

In late June, when Barrack spoke at the Middle East peace conference in Bahrain organized by the president’s son in law and adviser, Jared Kushner, “eyebrows were definitely raised” inside Trump’s orbit because of his inclusion, the senior administration official said.

Federal prosecutors have probed whether Barrack or other people violated laws requiring public disclosure of efforts to influence national policy or public opinion on behalf of foreign governments or entities, strictures that Manafort, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates have all said they violated. Public integrity prosecutors who work for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Brooklyn interviewed Barrack in June as part of the investigation, albeit at Barrack’s request, according to the Times.

Barrack’s spokesman said that Barrack has fully cooperated with the investigation and that his counsel reached out to the Justice Department, which the spokesman said had confirmed that it had no further questions for Barrack. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office declined to comment.

Barrack cooperated with requests from Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee for their investigation into Trump, with Barrack’s spokesman telling CNBC it was “important work.”

Former special counsel Robert Mueller’s team of investigators also questioned Barrack as part of his probe into Trump’s connections with Russia, which did not go unnoticed inside the White House.

Another point of friction in Trump’s relationship with Barrack is that he kept Gates, who pleaded guilty to two charges and became a star witness for Mueller, on his company Colony NorthStar’s payroll — at a rate of $20,000 per month, according to the Times — up until the moment when Gates was indicted for money laundering and violating foreign lobbying and tax laws.

Early in Trump’s presidency, Barrack brought Gates to the White House several times and also kept paying him even after Trump urged his friend to fire Gates because he was “bad luck” and “a bad penny” who wouldn’t go away, according to the senior administration official. Gates admitted during Manafort’s trial last summer that he might have stolen money from the inaugural committee, which he helped manage. Gates and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.

Several sources said Trump’s falling out with Barrack, who hasn’t yet donated to Trump’s re-election campaign, began even before the damaging reports about the inaugural committee.

“Barrack is the kind of guy who would tell him things he didn’t want to hear, so Trump stopped talking to him,” a former senior White House official said.

Barrack has also made some critical remarks about Trump’s performance in office and said in Trump’s first year that his friend was “better than this” (referring to Trump’s rhetoric toward Muslims and immigrants), and that he was “shocked” and “stunned” by some of the remarks.

At the start of Trump’s presidency, according to another person close to Trump, the president “got tired” of Barrack “because he felt that Tom was checking in all the time and he was a little perturbed by the fact that Tom wanted to be special envoy to the Middle East and then special envoy in South America and then he was going to be the ambassador to Argentina and then he didn’t want that and then he was going to be ambassador to Mexico.

“He was just kind of scattered all over,” the person added.

Trump rages at ‘unstable’ Scaramucci after threat to organize ex-Cabinet officials against him,https://www.foxnews.com,['Judson Berger'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rages-at-unstable-scaramucci-after-threat-to-organize-ex-cabinet-officials-against-him,"President Trump lashed out anew Monday at aide-turned-nemesis Anthony Scaramucci after the former White House communications director threatened to cobble together a coalition of former Cabinet officials to speak out against the president as part of an apparent bid to find an alternative Republican nominee in 2020.

Accelerating a remarkable conversion from short-lived White House insider to brash detractor, Scaramucci said in an interview Monday morning that he wants to find a ""viable alternative"" and is assembling a ""team"" of like-minded people toward that end.

SCARAMUCCI ESCALATES WAR OF WORDS WITH TRUMP

“I’ve got to get some of these former Cabinet officials in unity to speak up about it. They know it’s a crisis,” he said, predicting such a coalition would go public by the fall.

Trump, presumably watching the CNN interview, called the “Mooch” an ""unstable 'nut job,'"" before mocking him over his notoriously brief stint at the White House.

“I barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself, bad on TV. Abused staff,” he said, while taking some personal shots at Scaramucci’s marriage (he and wife Deidre Ball are back together, after calling off a divorce announced in 2017).

“He was a mental wreck. We didn’t want him around. Now Fake News puts him on like he was my buddy!” Trump tweeted.

FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN LEADS PRIMARY FIELD, TRUMP TRAILS IN HEAD-TO-HEADS

The insults are in keeping with an ever-escalating feud between the two men, after Scaramucci publicly turned on the president in recent weeks – calling him a “jacka--” who may drop out of the 2020 race, predicting a “reset” in the GOP and reportedly chatting with “Never Trump” pundit Bill Kristol about trying to find a replacement on top of the ticket.

“You know that the situation is unstable. You know that the president is off his rocker,” he told CNN on Monday, while denying any personal interest in launching such a candidacy.

It’s unclear whether his apparent discussions with former Cabinet officials will materialize into a coalition – and whether such a coalition would make any difference in the GOP presidential primary process, where so far only former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld has announced a challenge.

But while Trump overwhelmingly dominates GOP primary polling and continues to enjoy support from Republican Party leadership and top officials, hypothetical polling in a general election shows Trump trailing.

The latest Fox News Poll showed him trailing all the top Democratic candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden by 12 points.

Scaramucci cited the polling and warnings about a recession in suggesting Monday that Trump could be vulnerable.

Chuck Schumer said. | Pete Marovich/Getty Images Congress Democratic leaders assail Trump's apparent reversal on background checks

Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are lamenting President Donald Trump's apparent about-face on enhanced backgrounds for firearm sales, with Schumer calling the move ""not only disappointing but also heartbreaking.""

Trump told reporters this weekend he will look ""very strongly"" at ideas from both Democrats and Republicans but said to remember that ""we already have a lot of background checks."" Those remarks followed Trump's Aug. 7 claim that ""we can bring up background checks like we’ve never had before.""

Story Continued Below

In the Senate minority leader's view, Trump's remarks amounted to backing away from burgeoning bipartisan talks on reviving and amending the background checks bill by Sens. Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey.

“We’ve seen this movie before: President Trump, feeling public pressure in the immediate aftermath of a horrible shooting, talks about doing something meaningful to address gun violence, but inevitably, he backtracks in response to pressure from the NRA and the hard right,"" Schumer said on Monday afternoon. ""These retreats from President Trump are not only disappointing but also heartbreaking, particularly for the families of the victims of gun violence.""

Added Pelosi: “I pray that the President will listen to the 90 percent of the American people who support universal background checks.""

For well more than a year now, Trump has vacillated between considering stricter firearm measures and dismissing them. After a trio of mass shootings this summer, Trump has revived the idea of bringing up a legislative package in the GOP Senate in a bid to stopping such shootings.

Senators in both parties, including Manchin (D-W.Va.), Toomey (R-Pa.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) have been discussing ideas with each other or with the White House. Some of the proposals include changing the background checks bill to attract more Republicans, installing federal red flag laws aimed at preventing gun violence from people deemed dangerous, cracking down on straw gun purchases and making domestic terrorism a federal crime, as proposed by Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.). Any such bill would need the support of at least 13 Republicans and all 47 Democratic Caucus members, a heavy lift.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has expressed openness to a gun debate in the Senate, but it's possible that work on spending bills could sideline the firearm issue, particularly if Trump is lukewarm. The House passed a universal background checks bill earlier this year and Schumer is urging McConnell to bring it to a Senate vote.

""The way forward is for Sen. McConnell to put the bipartisan House-passed universal background checks bill on the Senate floor for a vote immediately,"" Schumer said on Monday.

Yet that bill will struggle to attract 50 votes, much less the 60 needed to break a filibuster. Collins opposes it because it doesn't include enough exemptions for transfers to family members, essentially guaranteeing it would not pass the Senate.

""You’re really going to go to your adult child and have to do a background check? People in Maine are very sensible and they know it doesn’t make sense,"" Collins said in a recent interview."

Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Permit Employment Discrimination Against Transgender Workers,https://time.com,['Tara Law'],,,,https://time.com/5654844/title-vii-trump-transgender-department-of-justice-supreme-court/,"The Trump administration’s Department of Justice is asking the Supreme Court to set a legal precedent that would enable employers to fire employees because they are transgender.

The Department of Justice has submitted a brief to the Court Friday asking the Justices to rule that Title VII, a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, religion or national origin, does not protect transgender people. The department argued that they should throw out a lower court ruling that found that a funeral home that fired a transgender woman had discriminated against her.

The brief concerns R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, one of three cases that the Supreme Court agreed to hear earlier this year that concern whether Title VII can be applied to LGBTQ workers.

In the case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit found that the owner of the funeral home, Thomas Rost, had violated the law when he fired Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman who worked for the company from 2007 to 2013. According to court documents, Stephens sent the company a letter in 2013 that said she struggled with a “gender identity disorder” and planned to begin to live as a woman, including by wearing the company’s female uniform – a jacket and skirt – instead of a suit and tie.

The company argued that Stephens was fired because she refused to wear the company’s dress code and argued that “[m]aintaining a professional dress code that is not distracting to grieving families is an essential industry requirement that furthers their healing process.”

In its brief, the Department of Justice has argued in favor of the funeral home, arguing that Title VII only protects what it defines as “biological sex.”

“In 1964 [when Title VII was enacted], the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex. It did not encompass transgender status,” the DOJ writes, clarifying, “In the particular context of Title VII—legislation originally designed to eliminate employment discrimination against racial and other minorities—it was especially clear that the prohibition on discrimination because of “sex” referred to unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace.”

Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Stephens, told HuffPo that the case could weaken Title VII protections both for transgender people and other groups.

“People don’t realize that the stakes are extending not just the trans and LGB communities, but every person who departs from sex stereotypes: Women who want to wear pants in the workplace, men who want more childbearing responsibilities,” Strangio said.

Graham: IG's report on Russia probe will be 'ugly and damning' for DOJ,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/graham-igs-report-on-russia-probe-will-be-ugly-and-damning-for-fbi,"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is adamant about revealing what went on behind the scenes of the Russia investigation and is looking forward to the American people learning about what happened.

Graham pointed to three investigations of the investigators that are taking place: one by his committee; one by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was appointed by Attorney General Bill Barr to conduct a probe; and one by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

SUSPECTED FBI INFORMANT LINKED TO RUSSIA 'SMEARS' CLAIMS IMMUNITY AFFORDED TO GOVERNMENT AGENTS

""I believe the Horowitz report will be ugly and damning,"" Graham told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on ""Sunday Morning Futures."" That report has been anticipated for months, but it has faced delays in recent months.

""Every time you turn around you find something new,"" Graham explained. ""Mr. Horowitz is doing a very in-depth dive"" into the FBI's use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to acquire a warrant to monitor former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Graham predicted that the report will finally come out in the coming weeks.

Another man linked to the early stages of the investigation -- former Trump campaign member George Papadopoulos -- is eager to tell his side of the story after serving a brief sentence for providing a false statement to investigators. Papadopoulos is said to have brought about the investigation by revealing to an Australian diplomat (who later alerted U.S. officials) that he had information that Russia had damaging information about Hillary Clinton. This was after he heard about this from Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud.

Graham said that once Horowitz's IG report comes out, he would like Papadopoulos to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Graham believes that, based on interview transcripts, Papadopolous was ""clearly"" not working with Russians.

PETER STRZOK SUES FBI OVER FIRING, ALLEGES BUREAU CAVED TO TRUMP'S 'UNRELENTING PRESSURE'

The more information that gets declassified, the better, according to Graham.

""I want to declassify as much as possible … I don’t want people to believe what I said, I want them to read for themselves how bad it was,"" he declared. Graham claimed that the FBI relied on the dossier compiled by Christopher Steele when they applied for the FISA warrant, despite Steele being ""an unreliable informant"" who hated President Trump.

""I want it all out, I want people to see how off the rails this investigation got, and I want people to be held accountable, and I am patient,"" he said. ""I'm not in a hurry to do it, I want to do it right.""

Graham also expressed a desire to find out just who was ultimately responsible for the Russia investigation, saying he is ""curious about the role the CIA played here."" He also questioned whether it went all the way to the top.

""Who knew about this in the White House?"" he wondered. ""Was President Obama briefed ... I'd like to know that.""

Graham's lengthy interview touched on several other high-profile subject matters. He discussed recent polling that showed several Democratic presidential candidates beating President Trump in a general election.

""Well, I'm not buying it,"" Graham said, predicting that unless Trump has a significant blunder in Afghanistan, ""the president is going to clean their clock on the stage.""

Graham also criticized Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for their recent hostility toward Israel, after the Jewish state barred them from visiting due to their support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement aimed at economically crippling Israel.

""It's been bipartisan up to now about Israel,"" Graham said, pointing out how Israel's enemies are enemies of the U.S. as well.

LINDSEY GRAHAM SUPPORTS ISRAEL BARRING OMAR, TLAIB, SAYS THERE NEEDS TO BE 'CONSEQUENCES' FOR SUPPORTING BDS

""Those who want to destroy Israel want to destroy us. Name one radical Islamic group that wants to destroy the State Israel that doesn't want to destroy America,"" he challenged, referring to Iran, ISIS and al Qaeda.

""The policies coming out of the Democratic Party toward Israel are dangerous,"" he warned. ""Tlaib and Omar openly calling for an economic boycott of the State of Israel which will destroy the State of Israel.

Graham said that the extreme positions of Democrats will lead to a Trump victory in 2020.

""The bottom line here is they are radical when it comes to Israel, they're radical on the economy, they're weak when it comes to fighting terrorism,"" he said. ""Donald Trump is going to win this election because he's been a damn good president and what they are trying to do is make America a socialist country, and that's not going to work.""

Earlier in the interview, Graham discussed another controversial idea endorsed by some Democrats: court packing. Several 2020 hopefuls have suggested expanding the Supreme Court's roster.

Last week, a ground of Democratic Senators filed a brief that accused the Supreme Court of being ""not well,"" and instructed the court to ""heal"" itself before they face calls for restructuring. Graham was having none of it.

""When you hear expanding the court, that’s code for liberals packing the court. Over my dead body, it's not going to happen."
US Commerce Department adds 46 Huawei affiliates to entity list – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/us-commerce-department-adds-46-huawei-affiliates-to-entity-list/,"Update: Huawei has responded to the DoC’s move,

We oppose the US Commerce Department’s decision to add another 46 Huawei affiliates to the Entity List. It’s clear that this decision, made at this particular time, is politically motivated and has nothing to do with national security. These actions violate the basic principles of free market competition. They are in no one’s interests, including US companies. Attempts to suppress Huawei’s business won’t help the United States achieve technological leadership. We call on the US government to put an end to this unjust treatment and remove Huawei from the Entity List.

The United States Department of Commerce announced this morning the addition of 46 Huawei affiliates to its Entity List. Effective today, the companies join more than 100 entries added to the list over connections to the embattled Chinese consumer electronics giant.

The DoC also used this morning’s news to announce an extension of its Temporary General License (TGL), which affords people and companies a limited time use of goods from Huawei and affiliate companies in order to essentially wean them off of Huawei networking equipment. The license, which offers “narrow exceptions” is set to expire 90 days from today.

In a statement provided to the press, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross stated, “As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei’s products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any disruption. Simultaneously, we are constantly working at the Department to ensure that any exports to Huawei and its affiliates do not violate the terms of the Entity Listing or Temporary General License.”

Huawei has, of course, long denied any ties to security or spying accusations from the U.S. government. Recently, stories, including alleged ties to African government spying, have continued to shine a light on concerns about the company’s ties to the Chinese government. Those concerns have led to Huawei’s addition to the entities list, along with U.S. government bans on buying equipment.

Per the DoC:

Huawei was added to the Entity List after the Department concluded that the company is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, including alleged violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), conspiracy to violate IEEPA by providing prohibited financial services to Iran, and obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation of those alleged violations of U.S. sanctions, among other illicit activities.

Losing access to American software and hardware could, in turn, have a devastating impact on the company. Notably, Huawei recently unveiled HarmonyOS. The new mobile operating system is not yet an Android replacement, but is believed by many to be part of a long-term strategy to wean itself off of dependence on Google.

We have reached out to Huawei for comment."
Bureau of Prisons chief removed in wake of Jeffrey Epstein suicide,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/politics/bureau-of-prisons-director/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General William Barr removed the acting head of the Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Department said Monday, replacing the agency's top official in the wake of the suicide of Jeffrey Epstein earlier this month.

In a statement, Barr said Hugh Hurwitz, who had served in the acting position since last year, would return to the assistant director position he formerly occupied.

Dr. Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, who led the bureau from 1992 to 2003, will be the new director, Barr said.

Barr has said he was ""appalled"" and ""angry"" to learn of the suicide, and cited ""serious irregularities"" at the Manhattan facility where Epstein had been detained.

Barr had already shaken up the top leadership at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, announcing last week that the facility's warden would be reassigned while the FBI and Justice Department's inspector general investigated the conditions leading up to the suicide.

""I believe the Horowitz report will be ugly and damning,"" Graham said. ""Mr. Horowitz is doing a very in-depth dive.""







SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, you've got three lanes here. You have what the committee will do, my committee, you've got Mr. Durham who's looking at criminality -- he's the U.S. Attorney in Connecticut -- And you've got the DOJ Inspector General report. I think it will be coming out in weeks, not days, not months. The Horowitz report will probably be ugly and damning regarding the Department of Justice handling of the Russia probe.



MARIA BARTIROMO: Tell me about that, we know that the DOJ is not prosecuting James Comey. Learned that about a month ago. We know we just got the so-called 302 out of Bruce Ohr, that's the investigation and interviews of Ohr with the FBI. And the IG report, we were supposed to get it months ago. How come it is so late?



GRAHAM: Every time you turn around you find something new. Mr. Horowitz is doing a very in-depth dive about the FISA warrant application. The behavior regarding the counterintelligence operation. He will send his report over to the Department of Justice, they will look at for classified information. I am going to meet with the Attorney General next week, I want to declassify as much as possible. On the American public to hear the story, I want all of this information to come out, I didn't want people to believe what I said I want them to read for themselves how bad it was.



The warrant application to the FISA court, I think quite frankly was a fraud. I want all the committee cases out, where they will notice Christopher Steele hated Trump and that he was an unreliable informant. I want this information coming out that the Steele dossier with information coming from Russia is unverified information, I want the transcripts surrounding interviews with Papadopoulos to be released where it was clear he was not working with the Russians.



I want it all out. I want people to see how this investigation got so off the rails and I want people to be held accountable and I am patient, and not in a hurry, I want to do it right.



BARTIROMO: Trey Gowdy says there some interviews of Papadopoulos ... that are so clear that he had nothing to do with it, but they did not present that to the FISA court. You mentioned George Papadopoulos, we had him on the show and he told me he's intending on testifying in front of your committee. When do you expect that to take place?



GRAHAM: What I want to do is get the Horowitz report and have him come testify about it. My job will be to make sure this never happens again. Do we need to change the FISA warrant application process to protect against this in the future? Do we need to have rules about counterintelligence investigations being open against politicians? Do we need to restructure the Department of Justice? These are things that Congress will be looking at. Durham will be looking at criminality, did someone violate the law? And Horowitz will be telling us about the good, the bad and the ugly and what should be done internally.



So a guy like George Papadopoulos, yeah, I would like to call him. I would like for him to tell the world what kind of interactions he had, where he had them, and what did he say that working with the Russians and is there verification that he told the informants early on that to work with Russia would be treason and a crime and I would never do that. If he did say that and they went ahead anyway, it raises a lot of concerns.



BARTIROMO: Senator you've done a lot of work on this. This is my final question on the subject, who do you think is the mastermind of this? Whose idea was it to insert Donald Trump into Russia meddling?



GRAHAM: You know, I really am very curious about the role that the CIA played here. We know that the FISA warrant application was based on a dossier from Christopher Steele that was biased against President Trump, that was one problem -- but this whole intelligence operation, what role did the CIA play? Who knew about this in the White House? There is a question! Was President Obama briefed on the fact that they were opening up the counterintelligence investigation against the Trump campaign? I would like to know that."

"Some jail staffers not cooperating with DOJ investigation into Epstein suicide, source says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Vandana Rambaran', 'Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News', 'Politics At Foxnews.Com. She Can Be Found On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/prison-personnel-refuse-to-cooperate-with-doj-investigators-digging-into-epstein-suicide,"Personnel at the New York City prison where accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide last week have not been initially cooperative with investigators from the Department of Justice, a federal source told Fox News Friday.

Attorney General William Barr sent two senior DOJ officials to personally visit the Metropolitan Correctional Center and speak with staff from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in order to gather information on Epstein's death after Barr said officials uncovered ""serious irregularities"" at the jail, a senior DOJ official told Fox News. The officials have been on site since Thursday and the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general are investigating conditions at the MCC.

NEW YORK MEDICAL EXAMINER: JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S DEATH WAS A SUICIDE BY HANGING

BOP officials from various regional offices have also been sent to the Manhattan facility to lend their expertise and insight. In addition, a separate BOP ""After Action Team"" went to MCC earlier this week in an effort to examine what happened the night Epstein died. The use of the ""After Action Team"" is part of BOP protocol whenever a ""significant event takes place at a prison.

Epstein was found dead in his cell on Aug. 10. Earlier Friday, New York City's medical examiner officially ruled the 66-year-old's death a suicide by hanging.

Fox News has also learned that 20 of 21 prison staff posts were filled between the hours of 4 p.m. and 12 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 9, the day before Epstein was found. Of those prison workers, six of them were working voluntary overtime. Between 12 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 10, 18 of 19 staff posts were filled. Of those 18 staffers, 10 were working overtime and all but one of those were doing so voluntarily.

Conspiracy theories swirled following Epstein's death, as many wondered how the wealthy financier could have been able to kill himself in a high-security facility just over two weeks after being placed on suicide watch, though officials later confirmed Epstein had been taken off suicide watch shortly before his death.

Correctional officers did not check in with Epstein for ""several hours"" before his death, despite being required to visit him every 30 minutes, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News earlier this week.

Jail guards on duty the night of Epstein's death are also suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were checking on inmates every half-hour as required, The Associated Press reported, citing several people familiar with the matter.

Two staffers have been placed on administrative leave and the MCC's warden has been reassigned pending an investigation.

Late Friday, Epstein's attorneys issued a statement decrying what they described as ""the harsh, even medieval conditions at the MCC.""

""It is indisputable that the authorities violated their own protocols,"" Martin Weinberg, Reid Weingarten and Michael Miller said. ""The defense team fully intends to conduct its own independent and complete investigation into the circumstances and cause of Mr. Epstein’s death including if necessary legal action to view the pivotal videos - if they exist as they should - of the area proximate to Mr. Epstein's cell during the time period leading to his death.

""We are not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical examiner,"" the statement concluded. "" We will have a more complete response in the coming days

DOJ asks appeals court to block subpoenas for Trump bank records,https://thehill.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/457967-doj-calls-on-court-to-block-subpoenas-for-trump-bank-records,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday asked a federal appeals court to block House subpoenas for President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE’s personal financial information.

In a Monday brief, the DOJ argued that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit should block subpoenas from House committees who are seeking Trump’s records at Deutsche Bank and Capital One.

Trump has sued to prevent Capital One and Deutsche Bank from turning over records of their business with the president to the House Financial Services, Intelligence and Oversight and Reform committees.

Those committees issued subpoenas for Trump’s financial records in April as part of a broad investigation into Russian money laundering and financial crimes in the U.S.

The District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in May that the House subpoenas should proceed, but the requests are on hold while Trump appeals the case.

The Justice Department argued in its Monday brief that the district court erred in approving the subpoenas without asking lawmakers to narrow the scope of their requests. The DOJ said lawmakers have failed to prove a legitimate legislative reason for the subpoenas, which they claim clash with constitutional protections for executive power.

“There is no objective reason for a congressional investigation into the general problem of money laundering and other illicit financial transactions to focus on the President and his family,” the department argued.



“The Committees have not connected the dots between the ‘undeniably broad’ scope of these subpoenas and the general legislative purpose that the House has articulated: closing regulatory loopholes that permit corrupt financial activity,” the department wrote.



The DOJ has also previously weighed in on another court fight for Trump's financial records, in the case involving a subpoena for documents from Mazars, an accounting firm, being sought by the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Earlier this month, the department similarly said in a court filing before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that the committee had not provided a legislative reason for seeking those documents."

Byron Allen Rips Comcast & Donald Trump’s DOJ For “Institutionalized Racism” As SCOTUS Showdown Looms,https://deadline.com,"['Dominic Patten Mike Fleming Jr', 'Dominic Patten', 'Mike Fleming Jr']",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://deadline.com/2019/08/byron-allen-comcast-civil-rights-lawsuit-supreme-court-filing-reaction-doj-donald-trump-1202671369/,"With the nation's highest court aiming to look at the ongoing lawsuit between the NBCU owner & Entertainment Studios, the DOJ has now waded in

EXCLUSIVE: Heading towards a $20 billion showdown with Comcast at the U.S. Supreme Court this fall in his long running racial discrimination lawsuit against the media giant, Byron Allen today tore into the Brian Roberts-run behemoth and an 11th hour intervention by the Department of Justice

“This is historic,” the Entertainment Studios boss said of the August 15 brief filed by the feds seeking to tighten the definitions of a Reconstruction Era statute in Comcast’s favor. “Donald Trump’s DOJ and Comcast are working together to destroy a civil right statue in the U.S. Supreme Court.”

“It is in the Supreme Court, and you’ve got the biggest media company in the world, which has been beating up Donald Trump for racism, and now they are saying, we will work together to maintain institutionalized racism in this country in this Amicus Brief they delivered this past Thursday,” Allen asserted in the starkest of terms of the now William Barr-run DOJ and its move to tip the scales for Comcast as the parties await a November 13 hearing before the nine Justices.

The newly declared emphasis by the DOJ now puts a more than 150-year law in a distinctly different light from how Allen’s lawyers have been reading it, as the Department’s filing openly says.

“Although the statute does not expressly describe the necessary causal link between a plaintiff ’s race and a defendant’s refusal to contract, the text is most naturally read to require but-for causation, and background common-law principles confirm that a but-for rule applies,” the incensory submission last week from Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Assistant AG Joseph Hunt argues (read it here).

“The court of appeals erred in concluding otherwise,” the DOJ brass state of lower court ruling in February in the huge money suit that Allen first filed in early 2015, along with a $10 billion suit against Charter Communications several months later. Comcast and Charter sought to have the matter dismissed. When they failed in that effort to end a case that they framed as a form of corporate expression, the MSNBC-owner took the battle to Chief Justice John Roberts and the Associate Justices.

The government detailed its POV by saying last week that “because ‘making’ a contract means entering a contract, a person does not enjoy ‘the same right’ guaranteed by Section 1981 if race prevents her from entering a contract that a similarly situated white person would have entered. And the inverse is also true.”

The feds’ brief leaning into the law to require that Entertainment Studios has to prove that race was not merely a motivating factor, as 9th Circuit interpreted the statute earlier this summer. Now, under the DOJ’s take of the stature, Allen’s lawyers could be required to prove that race was absolutely only reason that Comcast didn’t place the company’s channels on its distribution services and platforms.

For Allen, the result is a near impossible standard for Entertainment Studios or any other person or entity availing themselves of the statute as it presently stands.

“They said, we need to go to the Supreme Court and change the definition of the statute so African Americans cannot use it and we can compromise everyone’s civil rights,” Allen told Deadline of the sudden paperwork by the DOJ, offering the Comcast and their well-funded lobbyists in D.C. an advantage at the Supreme Court.

“Comcast, in the name of profits, is compromising everyone’s civil rights,” the CEO and Joe Biden-donor proclaimed. “If you think you have a good case, take me to court. Deal with me. Don’t jeopardize everybody’s civil rights.”

Contacted by Deadline, Comcast did not reply to requests for comment on the DOJ brief or Allen’s remarks about the filing. Entertainment Studios themselves have until next month to respond to the feds’ filing and Comcast’s own docket entry citing the Appeal Court reading of the post-Civil War statute as too broad.

Following a surprising reversal of fortune this winter where the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal essentially brought the case back to life, SCOTUS agreed in June that they would review the matter after a request by Philadelphia-based and very well politically connected Comcast.

With the initial filing of his cases in 2015 and 2016, Allen’s contention has been that both Comcast and Charter violated the Civil Rights Act after he attempted for years to get the cable giants to carry his networks, which were available to millions of television viewers through rival distributors including Verizon, the now AT&T-owned DirecTV and DISH. The African-American executive said he has been repeatedly rebuffed and jerked around and states clearly that he believes race played a factor because Entertainment Studios is a fully minority owned entity.

Both Comcast and Charter in their respective suits have said race was not a factor in the carriage deals or lack there of.

Allen and Entertainment Studios are represented in the case by a team from Miller Bardondess LLP and University of California Berkley School of Law’s Erwin Chemerinsky. Attorneys from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP are working for Comcast in the matter."
Treasury is about to flood the market with debt to fund U.S.’s $1 trillion deficit — and that is a concern,https://www.marketwatch.com,"['Joy Wiltermuth', 'Markets Reporter']",08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-treasury-is-about-to-flood-the-market-with-debt-to-fund-a-1-trillion-deficit-heres-why-that-is-a-worry-2019-08-15,"There may be some limitations to the U.S. government’s borrowing, after all.

An anticipated surge of U.S. borrowing in the global debt markets in the second half of this year is starting to create concern as the Treasury is expected to ramp up its issuance of bills, notes and bonds to fund a soaring $1 trillion budget deficit.

The U.S. government’s budget gap has widened 27% as compared with the first 10 months of fiscal 2018, as spending has risen 8% and receipts have grown by 3%. The federal fiscal year runs October through September. The Trump administration recently forecast a $1 trillion full-year shortfall, while the Congressional Budget Office is slightly more conservative, putting it at $896 billion.

Last month the U.S. Treasury laid out its plans to borrow $814 billion between July and December, after the Trump administration and Congress agreed to a two-year postponement of the U.S. debt ceiling, ensuring no government shutdown or a federal default.

Not only does the Treasury needs to borrow to cover the fiscal deficit created by Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and the inability of Congress to agree on spending cuts, but Treasury needs to rebuild its cash balance which was run down to pay the governments bills when the debt ceiling was hit in May.

The coming deluge of Treasury issuance has stoked worries on Wall Street about whether there is enough liquidity in the system in the short term to meet the supply without pushing up short-term borrowing costs and inverting the yield curve even further.

U.S. dollar liquidity is deteriorating and “is reaching a point where it may require drastic action if measures aren’t taken to address it soon,” warned Gaurav Saroliya, director of macro strategy at Oxford Economics, in a note on Wednesday.

To illustrate the concern, Saroliya pointed to the higher costs already faced by London-based banks lending to one other overnight in dollars, the popular dollar Libor-OIS spread, which has climbed in anticipation of the Treasury glut hitting markets.

This chart shows the rise of the 3-month dollar Libor-OIS spread since May, even as U.S. Treasury cash balances at the Federal Reserve have dropped from about $400 billion to closer to $150 billion.

Oxford Economics International funding squeeze

As the Treasury restores its cash balance with the coming supply, Saroliya expects liquidity woes to worsen, particularly in a scenario where long-term Treasury notes are yielding less than shorter-dated debt.

“With Treasury issuance set to surge in the wake of the recent debt-ceiling deal, an inverted yield curve could create a significant issuance indigestion in the market,” Saroliya wrote.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury 10-year note’s TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.93% yield briefly fell below the 2-year note’s TMUBMUSD02Y, +3.82% yield, an inversion of the funding curve that has foretold past economic slowdowns.

Read: 2-year/10-year Treasury yield curve inverts, triggering bond-market recession indicator

Meanwhile fears of an economic recession rattled U.S. stocks Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.96% closing down 800 points, its biggest one-day fall this year, before some recovery on Thursday morning in the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, +1.21% .

Amid the stock-market rout, the chances of a half-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate in September rose to 30.4%. Markets are pricing in a 69.6% chance of a quarter-point rate cut next month.

Despite the rising Treasury debt issuance, investors globally have been buying U.S. government debt, pushing the 30-year U.S. bond TMUBMUSD30Y, +2.44% to a record low around 2% this week, as yields on many other developed-economy bonds are even lower, with about $15 trillion in debt now offered at negative yields.

Slowing global economic growth due to the U.S.-China trade war is resulting in central banks’ easing monetary policy, and an array of geopolitical risks from Brexit, to Italian political instability, to U.S. sanctions on Iran and violent protests in Hong Kong are encouraging investors into the safe haven of U.S. debt.

But in the short-term money markets, the coming flood of U.S. debt issuance may cause indigestion.

Bond dealers who underwrite the Treasury’s debt sales in the weekly auctions are already holding record amounts of U.S. Treasurys on their books as the fiscal deficit has increased. Now their need to borrow more cash in short-term money markets, using Treasuries as collateral, to buy even more government debt is pushing up short-term rates.

A key risk barometer, the U.S. “repo” market, where cash is borrowed overnight using Treasurys for collateral, has signaled that liquidity is tightening.

Repo rates have climbed recently in relation to what the Federal Reserve pay banks to hold excess reserves. The rate that lenders have charged for cash in the market for Treasury repurchase agreements was 2.22% on Tuesday, compared with the 2.1% that the Federal Reserve pays banks to hold excess reserves, known as the IOER rate.

See at WSJ.com: Rising repo rates fuel concern over mounting U.S. debt

Liquidity may also be tightening in the market for short term borrowing of U.S. dollars internationally, known as the “foreign repo pool” where non-U.S. investors keep cash balances with the Federal Reserve, and the rising costs of currency hedging given the strength of the U.S. dollar may make investing in U.S. Treasury debt less appealing, Saroliya noted.

China and Japan were by far the largest foreign holders of Treasury securities, as of July 16, in the most recent report of holders.

For Saroliya, it all boils down to the Federal Reserve needing to act to preserve liquidity, perhaps by cutting benchmark U.S. rates by another 50 to 100 basis points or through another round of quantitative easing or bond buying.

“And that needs to be immediate!” Saroliya urged.

Earlier this month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Cabana also warned that the historically high levels of Treasury securities held by dealers could pose problems when it come to issuing more debt.

This chart shows dealer holdings of Treasury debt rising between January and July, at the same time custody holdings at the New York Fed have declined.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch

“We are concerned that the U.S. banking system is nearing reserve scarcity,” Cabana wrote in a note to clients. Ultimately, he said opening the Treasury “floodgates” would likely “force the Fed to start expanding its balance sheet by year-end.”

To be sure, not everyone sees doom in the U.S. adding to the already $22.4 trillion national debt.

“A lot of Street commentators have highlighted the fact that there is going to be a huge amount of supply in the Treasury market, and how that is going to affect rates,” said Robert Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, in an interview with MarketWatch.

“When you look at the space though this is a market that most people want to own at some point, especially given the fact that there are $15 trillion of bonds in negative yields,” he said. “It makes the U.S. look really attractive.”"
"State Department officials berated staff, labeled some 'traitors,' report says",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/politics/state-department-officials-watchdog-report-political-retaliation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Top officials in the State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs subjected employees to ""disrespectful and hostile treatment,"" accusations of disloyalty, and retaliation, a long-awaited report from the department's watchdog agency found. The report also said the bureau's leadership ""did not take significant action"" to address these concerns.

""Nearly every employee interviewed by OIG raised concerns about the leadership of IO and the treatment of staff,"" according to the report released Thursday by the State Department Office of Inspector General.

The bureau's leaders labeled some employees ""traitors,"" if they felt they didn't support President Donald Trump. They berated others for following procedures, punished staff for not doing work the department's Office of the Legal Adviser had deemed ""inappropriate"" and targeted others for retaliation, in one case because of a staffer's ""relationship with the gay and lesbian community.""

'Six to eight hostile interactions per day'

""Although some IO employees reported that they had never witnessed Assistant Secretary Moley or Ms. Stull behave unprofessionally, the majority of employees OIG interviewed either directly experienced hostile treatment or witnessed such treatment directed at others,"" the report said. ""In fact, one IO employee told OIG that working with Ms. Stull involved 'six to eight hostile interactions per day.'""

Stull left the department in January 2019 ; Moley remains in his post. Moley participated in an interview with the OIG, but Stull declined.

The report cited numerous examples of Stull and Moley berating employees for following established department procedures for tasks ranging from sending briefings to booking travel accommodations.

'Inappropriate accusations of disloyalty'

Stull and Moley also ""made inappropriate accusations of disloyalty and made positive or negative comments about employees based on perceived political views,"" according to the report.

""For example, several career employees reported that throughout her tenure at the Department, Ms. Stull referred to them or to other career employees as 'Obama holdovers,' 'traitors,' or 'disloyal,'"" the report said. ""Other career employees told OIG that Ms. Stull accused them of being part of the 'Deep State' and that the Assistant Secretary accused them of 'undermining the President's agenda.'""

In one instance, the report noted, Stull ""expressed displeasure"" with a legislative affairs employee accompanying a delegation of the Congressional Black Caucus ""because it consisted of only Democratic members."" Stull accused the employee ""of trying to 'thwart' President Trump and undermine his agenda"" and many of the employee's job responsibilities were reassigned. That employee eventually left the State Department.

Retaliation

Moley and Stull retaliated against other employees as well, according to the report. Moley removed a principal deputy assistant secretary, a career diplomat, after she raised concerns about Stull's treatment of employees and conflict of interest.

Moley ""told the PDAS that he did not believe that her concerns about Ms. Stull were valid"" and ""it was obvious to him that she had problems working with Ms. Stull and that, therefore, the PDAS should be prepared to leave the bureau,"" according to the report.

In another instance, the OIG found that Moley had canceled the selection process for a deputy director position in order to support Stull's move to block the leading candidate for that post. Stull did not like the candidate's work with the UN agency that aids Palestinian refugees -- a point which Moley confirmed to the OIG. Stull also reportedly had a problem with that candidate's ""relationship with the gay and lesbian community,"" according to the report.

She criticized two career employees ""whom she believed had been insufficiently supportive of her position"" in a work dispute stemming from her time at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. She also attempted to remove work responsibilities from one of those employees for failing to assist her, despite the fact that what she had asked them to do was deemed ""inappropriate"" by the Office of the Legal Adviser.

Failure to address concerns

Despite concerns raised by both IO employees and State Department management, Moley did little to address them, according to the report. Moley told OIG ""that no employees had 'ever' raised concerns with him regarding morale or treatment of employees.""

However, the report said he had conversations with two undersecretaries in April and on June 13, 2018, and with Deputy Secretary John Sullivan on June 25, 2018 regarding the issues raised about his bureau. In each, he was advised to address the misbehavior.

In the June 13 meeting, he was directed to take several steps -- let all IO employees know about his commitment to inclusion, develop a staffing plan to address two IO departures, ensure that Stull had recused herself from all activities related to her prior work at the UN, and direct her to stop ""all further public engagement"" criticizing State Department employees.

Although Moley took some of these steps, the misconduct continued. The report noted that OIG continued to receive reports about ""hostile treatment of employees, allegations of disloyalty, and conflicts of interest"" throughout the course of its review.

'We won't stop until this culture of impunity is ended'

The watchdog recommended in its report that the State Department ""develop a corrective action plan to address the leadership and management deficiencies"" in IO within 60 days. It also noted the department should consider whether to take disciplinary action for the conduct described in the 34-page document. The State Department agreed with both of these recommendations, the report said.

Thursday's report presented the findings of one of two OIG investigations into political retaliation at the department. It was opened in June 2018 after members of Congress expressed concern to the State Department about allegations of Stull's vetting of career employees were reported by Foreign Policy Magazine.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel said Thursday that the report ""confirms what we feared: 'disrespectful and hostile' treatment of career employees at the State Department."" The New York Democrat urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to fire Moley.

""There is more to come, and I hope it comes very soon. The delays from the Department on this matter have been frustrating. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, along with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is conducting an independent inquiry on these matters, and we won't stop until this culture of impunity is ended and everyone responsible faces stiff consequences,"" Engel said in a statement."
Sean Hannity: Sources say 'most explosive' part of DOJ review is about 'outsourcing of illegal intelligence-gathering',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-sources-say-most-explosive-part-of-doj-review-about-outsourcing-of-illegal-intelligence-gathering,"Fox News host Sean Hannity said his sources are telling him the most ""explosive"" finding in the Justice Department review on the origins of the Russia investigation has to do with illegal intelligence-gathering on American citizens.

Hannity first mentioned this during his show Thursday evening while speaking to the Hill's John Solomon, who said DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's soon-to-be-released report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses will find ""a lot more wrong than right"" and will be ""difficult"" for former top FBI officials such as James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok.

Hannity said there is some discrepancy between what he and Solomon expect in the watchdog report and the Justice Department inquiry being run by Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham, who are examining the behavior of the FBI and Justice Department for possible wrongdoing.

""I want to know who's going to be held responsible. Because If I lie to a court, and I premeditated a fraud on the court, I have a funny feeling there’s not a lawyer in the country that is going to save my sorry ass from being sent to jail. I’m just guessing, but maybe — I’m Irish, I'm pessimistic,"" he said.

""Let me ask you this. So, we both agree on those. You think there might be an IG report alone on leaking?"" Hannity added, to which Solomon agreed.

""And I’m expecting, from what my sources are telling me, Durham, Barr, and everybody else, to get to the origins of what is a counterintelligence investigation, which Andy McCarthy rightly points out in his new book, would mean Obama knew because the president has to sign off on it but that origins of this counterintelligence investigation, what did Obama know, when did he know it?"" Hannity said.

He was referring to former U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy, who is promoting his new book, Ball of Collusion, and Thursday on Fox & Friends accused Obama of improperly using counterintelligence powers and law enforcement to assist Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.

""But more importantly,"" Hannity continued, ""What will Barr, Durham, come out with in terms of — let's say the Barr-Durham report? ... Or whatever that ends up being. Because I hear that is where the single most explosive bit of information, outsourcing of illegal intelligence-gathering for the sake of circumventing American laws, took place, and a lot of people would be found in violation of spying on Americans against the law.""

Solomon warned that he did not want to get ahead of the Justice Department's findings, but did say that the Barr and Durham review will provide ""a much broader view"" of alleged spy tactics than what the IG report will show because they are not limited to what went on in the Justice Department.

Hannity later noted how there is ""a lot of activity"" in Europe tied to these investigative efforts, including the 16-hour interview conducted with British ex-spy Christopher Steele earlier this summer. He also suggested the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia were roped into the inquiry.

Steele's anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause."
Department of Justice Backs Led Zeppelin in ‘Stairway to Heaven’ Copyright Case,https://variety.com,"['Jem Aswad Gene Maddaus', 'Jem Aswad', 'Gene Maddaus']",08-16-2019,2019,8,https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/led-zeppelin-trump-stairway-to-heaven-copyright-case-1203305048/,"The U.S. Department of Justice has weighed in on the next big music copyright case on the horizon following the Katy Perry “Dark Horse” decision, and taken Led Zeppelin’s side in the long-running copyright dispute that pits the writers of the group’s anthem “Stairway to Heaven” against the publishers of the earlier song “Taurus” by Spirit.

The DOJ filed an amicus brief late Thursday supporting Zeppelin against a claim by the trustees of the late Spirit singer/guitarist Randy Wolfe — a.k.a. Randy California — that it lifted a musical passage for its song from “Taurus.”

Michael Skidmore, the trustee of the Randy Craig Wolfe Trust, sued the band in 2014, arguing that “Stairway to Heaven” ripped off elements of Wolfe’s composition. A jury ruled in favor of Led Zeppelin in 2016, finding that the two songs were not substantially similar.

Skidmore appealed, and on Friday a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a new trial. The panel found that U.S. District Court Judge Gary Klausner gave instructions that failed to make clear that an arrangement of otherwise unprotectable elements in a song can be sufficiently original to merit copyright protection.

“Without a selection and arrangement instruction, the jury instructions severely undermined Skidmore’s argument for extrinsic similarity, which is exactly what the jury found lacking,” wrote Circuit Judge Richard A. Paez, for the court.

Paez also faulted Klausner for refusing to allow Skidmore’s attorney to play “Taurus” while Jimmy Page was testifying. The attorney was seeking to show that Page had access to “Taurus” when “Stairway to Heaven” was composed, but Klausner ruled that playing the song with the jury present could be confusing.

But in June, the full Ninth Circuit said it would hear the appeal again. On Thursday, the Justice Department said the trial judge was correct in ruling that the only work subject to copyright protection was the sheet music — which was filed with the copyright office — and not sound recordings, and that the relevant portion of the songs is not virtually identical.

Thursday’s move is significant for a number of reasons, not least because the juries in the recent “Dark Horse” and 2015 “Blurred Lines” decision — in which Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were found to have infringed on the copyright of Marvin Gaye’s song “Got to Give It up” based on a similar “feel” — ruled against the defendants, which in this case is Led Zeppelin.

The case goes before the appeals court next month."
Buying Greenland isn't a good idea — it's a great idea,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-17-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/buying-greenland-isnt-a-good-idea-its-a-great-idea,"The reaction to President Trump's sudden interest in buying Greenland from Denmark has been mostly one of derision. And Denmark, which owns the territory, appears to oppose any sale.

But don't laugh — an American purchase of Greenland could represent an extraordinary deal in terms of America's national security, economic interests, and environmental protection.

As much as it might seem out of the blue, U.S. acquisition of Greenland is not at all a strange or irrational idea. Following Denmark's fall to Nazi Germany in 1940, American forces defended Greenland. The roots of American-Greenland comradeship are thus old and formal. In 1946, one Harry S. Truman even attempted to purchase Greenland for $100 million. Was Truman crazy? On the contrary, he was the president who ended a global war and set America on its ultimate course to defeat the Soviet Union.

As for the contemporary utility of purchasing Greenland, it has extraordinary strategic value. Through the U.S. Air Force base already present at Thule, Greenland offers critical intelligence capabilities to conduct satellite operations and to detect possible over-the-North-Pole nuclear missile launches from China or Russia. Thule better allows the U.S. to warn its citizens of an imminent attack.

And it does more than that. Thanks to Thule's deep water port and long runway, the base provides a logistics hub for operations in the Arctic. And it gives the U.S. military the means to deter and defeat prospective aggression. Russia, in particular, has been working to secure territorial control over resource-rich areas of the Arctic. America's presence in Greenland is increasingly relevant for that reason.

The purchase of Greenland would further strengthen these existing national security benefits. Unbound from political sensitivities in Denmark, for example, the U.S. could station missile forces in Greenland, including intermediate range missile forces. Russia's Arctic ambitions would have to be put on ice.

Greenland also abounds with resources. An already energy independent U.S. would have unfettered access to a land rich not only in hydrocarbons but also in rare earth metals that are currently only available from an adversary, China. Greenland also controls flourishing fishing waters.

But this isn't just about American interests. Greenland's small population also has everything to gain from a massive influx of American investment. The surge in tourism alone would surely offer a vast untapped potential.

And Greenland offers many grand opportunities for environmental protection. Its waters are home to numerous species of Whale, its lands to numerous species of flower and animals, and its skies to numerous species of birds. Greenland offers the potential for vast new designated wildlife reserves, and it would give American scientists the chance to study the Arctic environment from a unique vantage point.

As odd as it might sound at first blush — and America's purchase of Alaska also seemed very odd at the time — Americans of all political stripes would benefit from Greenland and its 56,000 inhabitants joining our national family."
"Trump’s plan to let employers discriminate against LGBTQ workers, explained",https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/8/16/20806990/trump-religion-lgbtq-discrimination-rule,"The Trump administration caused an uproar Wednesday for proposing a policy that would give certain federal contractors the right to discriminate against people who don’t share their employer’s religious views.

“Unconscionable,” “shameless,” and “dangerous” were just a few of the reactions from lawmakers and civil rights advocates over the religious-exemption rule that seemed, in particular, to target LGBTQ employees. Patricia Shiu, who oversaw the federal contracting office under President Barack Obama, described it to Vox as shocking.

The proposed rule from the Department of Labor dramatically transforms the government’s decades-old policy that bars federal contractors from discriminating against employees based on their race, sex, religion, disability, or national origin. It would instead weaken these protections by expanding the policy’s one exemption: the religious exemption.

Religious organizations — such as a Catholic legal aid group, for example — are already allowed to reject certain job candidates of different faiths. The new rule would go far, far beyond that, letting Catholic-affiliated businesses fire an LGBTQ employee because their views on same-sex marriage conflict with Catholic teachings. Or fire a pregnant woman who is unmarried.

The new rule would gut anti-discrimination protections in a “major and transformational way,” Shiu, who is now an advisor for the Berkeley Center on Comparative Equality & Anti-Discrimination Law, told Vox. “It’s so startling.”

While the rule seems to target LGBTQ individuals, as most religious exemption policies do, it’s so broad that it creates a loophole for employers to discriminate against anyone, Shiu said. She points out that big contractors could ask for a religious exemption so they don’t have to hire women, by saying that their religion dictates that women cannot work outside the home.

The Labor Department has played down this possibility, saying in its proposal that employers can’t use religion as an excuse to discriminate against protected groups. Right now, LGBTQ workers aren’t explicitly protected by federal anti-discrimination law, but even if they were, it would be awfully hard for an employee to prove that a company is using the exemption as a cover to discriminate.

The proposed change is, above all, a political move. By targeting the LGBTQ community, President Donald Trump is showing his support for the fundamentalist evangelical Christians who make up his base of support. These groups, which oppose same-sex marriage, have been fighting for years to weaken protections for LGBTQ Americans.

The new labor rule, explained

More than 42,000 US businesses hold federal contracts, and all of them agree to follow certain rules to keep their lucrative deals with the government. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed Executive Order 11246, which prohibited contractors from discriminating against people on the basis of race — similar to protections Congress gave to individuals as part of the Civil Rights Act. At the time, many federal contractors would not hire black employees, so the goal was to make sure that taxpayer-funded contracts only go to businesses with integrated workforces.

Later on, the executive order would expand protections to employees based on other protected characteristics, such as a person’s sex, religion, national origin, or disability. In 2014, Obama’s labor department expanded it further to include sexual orientation and gender identity. The religious exemption was meant to be super narrow. Past administrations have interpreted it to apply only to nonprofit organizations, such as churches or social service groups, and these groups could only turn away employees who don’t belong to their faith.

Trump’s executive order interprets that exemption far more broadly to include a much larger group of employers, such as for-profit companies that have a religious affiliation (St. Jude’s Hospital, Goodwill, and Georgetown University, for example).

The new rule also explicitly creates a broader definition of the word “religion.” Instead of viewing religion as a particular organized religion, the government would now include “all aspects of religious belief, observance, and practice as understood by the employer.” That language is very vague.

But here is the most concerning line in the 46-page document: The rule would “clarify that the religious exemption allows religious contractors not only to prefer in employment individuals who share their religion, but also to condition employment on acceptance of or adherence to religious tenets as understood by the employing contractor.”

In other words, not only could a religious hospital that contracts with the government refuse to hire someone who is Muslim or Jewish, they could also refuse to hire someone in a same-sex marriage or fire someone who had sex before marriage.

Conservative groups are pushing the limits of religious freedom

Some religious groups have been trying to weaken anti-discrimination laws at every level.

The US Pastors Council and Texas Values, two nonprofit evangelical groups, filed multiple lawsuits in county and federal court in October, claiming that Christian businesses and churches have a constitutional right to fire — or not hire — LGBTQ workers.

One lawsuit challenged the federal Civil Rights Act, which makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against job candidates and workers based on their religion, sex, gender, or race. Two other lawsuits sought to strike down part of an Austin, Texas, city ordinance that prohibits employers from discriminating against similar groups, and explicitly includes protections based on “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.”

In one of the lawsuits against the city of Austin, lawyers for Texas Values said the organization will not comply with the law. “Texas Values will not hire or retain practicing homosexuals or transgendered people as employees, because their lifestyles are contrary to the biblical, Judeo–Christian understandings of sexuality and gender that Texas Values seeks to promote,” they wrote in the complaint.

The federal lawsuit was dismissed in March; the county case is still pending.

The lawsuits marked a new front in the evangelical battle against the LGBTQ civil rights movement. Both right-wing Texas groups were also outspoken in the fight against the spread of so-called “bathroom bills,” which allow transgender individuals to use public restrooms designated for their identified gender.

Two Supreme Court cases foreshadowed this

In one of the Texas cases, the US Pastors Council argued Christian employers are allowed to discriminate against LGBTQ workers based on protections in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

The federal law, enacted in 1993, sets a high standard for government legislators when writing laws that might burden a person’s right to exercise their religion. The act states that such a law must further a “compelling government interest” and must be tailored to minimize the burden on individual religious practices.

The law has generally been used to analyze other laws that might infringe on an individual’s religious freedom. But in a controversial 2014 ruling, the US Supreme Court extended the protection to Christian-owned corporations. In that case, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the arts and crafts store chain challenged the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive mandate, which required businesses to offer health insurance plans that covered the cost of birth control.

David Green, the evangelical owner of Hobby Lobby, objected to the mandate on the grounds that he was religiously opposed to paying for employees’ use of a form of contraception known as the “morning-after pill.” He considered this type of contraception similar to abortion.

The Supreme Court narrowly ruled in his favor, in a 5-4 decision. Justice Samuel Alito, in writing the majority opinion, said that the federal government had a compelling goal in crafting Obamacare’s contraceptive mandate: giving women free access to family planning services. But Alito argued that the government could achieve that goal without infringing on a business owner’s religious views. The government, for example, could pay for the contraception, or provide an exemption to businesses whose owners object to contraception on religious grounds.

The ruling was the first time the Supreme Court had extended the act’s individual religious freedom protection to a for-profit company.

That’s why the case raised so much alarm among LGBTQ advocates, who viewed it as potentially opening the door for businesses to discriminate against gay and transgender employees on the grounds that an employer is exercising religious beliefs.

However, in response to these concerns, Alito made clear that the court’s decision did not mean businesses could do such a thing. “This decision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to … provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious practice,” Alito wrote in the majority opinion.

That same view was reiterated in the court’s 2018 ruling in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, in which a Colorado cake shop owner refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, based on the owner’s religious objection to same-sex marriage.

Though the court ruled in favor of the business owner, the majority said it did so because the Colorado government showed clear anti-religious bias when handling the case. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, made clear that religious beliefs do not justify discrimination against LGBTQ individuals.

Our society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity and worth. For that reason the laws and the Constitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the exercise of their civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the courts.

The problem with these rulings and with the latest labor department rule is that it will be almost impossible for marginalized workers to prove illegal discrimination: Employers could simply justify their actions by pointing to their religious beliefs.

Shiu, who led the federal contracting office from 2009 to 2016, said the new rule is completely unnecessary. She said no federal contractors ever asked for a religious exemption to justify firing someone (or to refuse hiring someone) when she was the director.

“It’s a terrible solution in search of a problem,” she told Vox."
"New evidence shows why Steele, the Ohrs and TSA workers never should have become DOJ sources",https://thehill.com,[],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/457628-new-evidence-shows-why-steele-the-ohrs-and-tsa-workers-never-should-have,"One of the inevitable outcomes of the Russia case will be that the Department of Justice (DOJ) almost certainly will need internal reforms.

The first reform is the most obvious, given the unraveling of the Russia collusion narrative: a new set of rules governing when the FBI can investigate or spy on a First Amendment-protected political campaign during an election.

The FBI never should have been allowed to sustain a counterintelligence investigation into Donald Trump Donald John TrumpTrump pushes back on recent polling data, says internal numbers are 'strongest we've had so far' Illinois state lawmaker apologizes for photos depicting mock assassination of Trump Scaramucci assembling team of former Cabinet members to speak out against Trump MORE’s campaign based on hearsay from Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who helped to arrange a $25 million Australian government donation to the Clinton Foundation, and on a “minimally” verified dossier written by British spy Christopher Steele, who was working on the Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonTop Sanders adviser: Warren isn't competing for 'same pool of voters' Anti-Trump vets join Steyer group in pressing Democrats to impeach Trump Republicans plot comeback in New Jersey MORE opposition-research team.

The second reform may be less visible but becomes painfully obvious, thanks to a series of internal DOJ investigative memos released this month that expose glaring issues with the handling, vetting and weighting of “confidential human sources.” That’s a fancy term for people — sometimes called “snitches” or informants, in street vernacular — who secretly provide evidence to law enforcement.

Some examples of the DOJ’s problems with informers fall outside the Russia case but mirror the same issues unmasked in the now-debunked probe of Trump.

Take, for example, the DOJ inspector general’s finding this month that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was paying other government officials at the Homeland Security Department’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to work as informants.

The IG spared few words in decrying the idiocy of allowing government security officers collecting a federal salary to double-dip into taxpayers’ money by receiving informant pay to report criminal activity they were required by their jobs to disclose.

Two agents and one supervisor “violated the DEA Confidential Source policy” by paying three TSA workers as informants, the report concluded. And one agent wrongly served as handler for a TSA informant with whom he was involved in a “personal relationship,” investigators found, exposing a problem dating to 2013.

“By establishing the TSA employees as paid Limited Use Confidential Sources, the DEA agreed to pay for information that the TSA employees were already obligated to provide to law enforcement,” the IG concluded.

In other words, there should be a bright line: Government agents should stick to their jobs and leave the informing to private citizens.

That line similarly was breached in the minds of many when Bruce Ohr, then the DOJ’s assistant deputy attorney general, began collecting anti-Trump information on July 30, 2016, from former MI6 agent Steele and pushing it on the top levels of the DOJ and the FBI.

At the time, Ohr knew his wife, Nellie, and Steele worked for the Fusion GPS research firm on the same project to dig up Russia dirt on Trump, to help the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) win the 2016 election. Furthermore, Ohr told the FBI he knew Steele was a foreigner “desperate” to stop a Trump presidency, FBI memos show.

With his seniority inside DOJ, Ohr quickly got Steele’s information to the FBI’s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, and three top DOJ supervisors, despite the red flags.

Before long, Steele was working as a confidential informant for the bureau, and his dossier was used to secure a surveillance warrant targeting the Trump campaign weeks before Election Day.

When Steele got fired Nov. 1, 2016, by the FBI for leaking to the media, Ohr became a conduit for the bureau to keep getting information from Steele for months. Ohr met at least 12 times in late 2016 and 2017 with FBI agents to provide new intel from the British spy. In other words, Ohr transitioned from being a DOJ supervisor to a backdoor source for the FBI to receive information from a terminated source.

And he didn’t stop there.

Records released this week, thanks to litigation by the conservative group Judicial Watch, show the senior DOJ official took at least two research files from his wife and her Fusion GPS work and provided them to FBI agents investigating Trump. One alleged that unverified ties existed between the Trump organization and Russian mobsters; the other provided a timeline alleging wrongdoing by former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.

Nellie Ohr testified to Congress that some of her anti-Trump information came from foreign officials in Ukraine, including a parliamentary member highly critical of Manafort.

Examination of the Nellie Ohr documents given to the FBI shows some of her source material also came from former Ukrainian presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko and a lawsuit she filed against Manafort.

Why is that significant? Tymoshenko and Hillary Clinton had a simpatico relationship after the former secretary of State went out of her way in January 2013 to advocate for Tymoshenko’s release from prison on corruption charges.

So, Bruce Ohr became a conduit of information not only for intelligence from Clinton’s British opposition-researcher but also from his wife’s curation of evidence from a Clinton foreign ally and Manafort enemy inside Ukraine. Talk about foreign influence in a U.S. election!

To Ohr’s credit, he disclosed his potential conflict of interest involving his wife to DOJ officials. To DOJ’s discredit, he was allowed to act as a source for both his wife and Steele anyway.

Ohr also didn’t get compensated as a paid informant, like the TSA workers. But documents show a curious thing happened during the time he began peddling the anti-Trump intelligence from his wife and Steele: His annual performance bonus doubled from about $14,000 in November 2015 to $28,000 in November 2016.

The blurred line between government official and informer/source didn’t stop with Ohr. Former FBI General Counsel James Baker also admitted he took dirt on Trump from DNC lawyer Michael Sussmann in summer 2016 and gave it to the agents investigating the Trump campaign.

The ultimate consequence — some might argue folly — of all these blurred lines is most easily exposed in an often overlooked document from the Russia probe.

I’ve written that the FBI kept a spreadsheet showing almost all of what Steele provided agents and Ohr on Russia-Trump dirt turned out to be unverified, disproven or nothing more than internet rumors. But when the FBI closed its paperwork on Steele in 2018, a professional intelligence analyst concluded in his human source validation report that the bureau assessed it had only “medium confidence” in Steele and that his intelligence could only be “minimally” verified.

In other words, his intelligence wasn’t very good. And yet, America spent nearly three years in turmoil only to learn that Steele’s Trump-Russia allegations — paid by Clinton and propagated by Ohr — were not true.

The tales of Bruce and Nellie Ohr, Christopher Steele, Yulia Tymoshenko, and those DEA and TSA agents raise a stark warning: The lines between government officials and informants, unverified political dirt and real intelligence, personal interest and law enforcement, became too blurred for the Justice Department’s own good.

That’s a problem sorely in need of fixing.

Lawmakers Accuse State Dept. of Defying Federal Law by Missing Deadlines for Yemen Reports,https://www.nytimes.com,['Catie Edmondson'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/us/politics/state-department-yemen-reports.html,"WASHINGTON — In defiance of federal law, the State Department is refusing to submit reports to Congress detailing efforts by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, according to legislators and congressional aides.

Trump administration officials have missed both congressionally mandated deadlines this year to submit the biannual reports, most recently last week. This has further inflamed tensions between the administration and legislators who were already furious with the administration’s unflagging support of the Saudi government and were still stung by the White House’s decision in May to circumvent Congress to sell arms to Riyadh.

“Congress has tried again and again to bring accountability and transparency to America’s role in the war in Yemen. At every turn, the Trump administration has blocked our efforts,” said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “But we won’t stop looking for ways to dial back our involvement in a conflict that’s fueling the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.”

Last year, Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, both of whom sit on the Foreign Relations Committee, successfully added a provision to the military defense policy bill that required the State Department to submit certifications to Congress describing the actions Saudi and Emirati officials have taken to reduce the risk of harm to civilians."
DOJ should take action against China's Twitter propaganda,https://thehill.com,[],08-17-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/457772-doj-should-take-action-against-chinas-twitter-propaganda,"Over the last few years, Chinese state media organs have accelerated a campaign to leverage U.S. social media platforms – namely, Twitter – to promote the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) narrative on several issues. All of China’s major state media outlets have Twitter accounts, through which they regularly disseminate a variety of material.Hu Xijin, who heads the state-run Global Times, has become the government’s de facto English-language commentator on trade tensions with the United States.

Beyond this, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai launched an account to share the party line on the recent Hong Kong protests and the Taiwan independence movement. Chinese state media outlets have even targeted a U.S. diplomat for meeting with Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, exposing her personal information and drawing a stern rebuke from the U.S. State Department.

The irony of this trend is not lost on anyone with some familiarity of China’s censorship regime. That China’s state-sponsored propaganda can freely subsist in the virtual echo chambers of Twitter while the platform is blocked entirely on the Chinese mainland is certainly a less than reciprocal arrangement. But beyond this, the circulation of propaganda by certain Chinese state media outlets throughout the United States via Twitter in its current form appears to be in violation of U.S. law.

Last fall, under the tenure of Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsDOJ should take action against China's Twitter propaganda Lewandowski says he's 'happy' to testify before House panel The Hill's Morning Report — Trump and the new Israel-'squad' controversy MORE, the Department of Justice (DOJ) directed Xinhua News Agency and CGTN to register as foreign agents per the provisions of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA. Xinhua is China’s major state-run media outlet, while CGTN is China Central Television’s overseas operation (the English-language China Daily has also been registered since 1983). This was indeed a major step toward ensuring that these entities meet the comprehensive disclosure requirements for foreign lobbyists seeking to influence U.S. politics. A critical aspect of their activity that has gone unpunished, however, is their unbridled sharing of CCP narratives on Twitter.

Per the DOJ, Section 4 of FARA “outlines the responsibilities of a registrant who disseminates informational materials on behalf of a foreign principal.” Section 4(b) of the law effectively requires that such entities provide a disclaimer on any informational materials disseminated that includes “a conspicuous statement that the materials are distributed by the agent on behalf of the foreign principal, and that additional information is on file with the Department of Justice.”

While it is unclear whether CGTN and China Daily (Xinhua has yet to register) have been regularly providing the DOJ with copies of each of their tweets (let’s just say it’s unlikely), their tweets currently do not include any obvious indication that they are being transmitted on behalf of the foreign principal, the Chinese government. More broadly, as a matter of policy, Twitter does not even distinguish between such foreign agents, their employees, and the rest of the Twitter user base. To date, the only means of distinguishing one’s account is the coveted “verified” status, which, according to Twitter, is granted to accounts “of public interest.”

Twitter providing foreign agents like CGTN and China Daily with the legitimacy that comes with the verified status without making clear that they are registered foreign agents is negligent, if not irresponsible, and warrants a review of this policy. But regardless, the frequent activity of these accounts on the platform – which most certainly falls under the umbrella of “informational materials for or in the interests of such foreign principal” – deserves the attention of the DOJ.

There is undoubtedly a lack of enforcement in this area, and the specifics of how the provision should be applied can be debated by the relevant authorities and Twitter personnel. Indeed, the attorney general has the statutory authority to “define what constitutes a conspicuous statement,” or disclaimer label. But the need for action is obvious. If our government considers Russian bot posts a threat to election security, and Twitter regularly takes action to combat such disinformation, then why are similar campaigns by Chinese state actors any less concerning?

Say what you will about China’s censorship regime and its ability to control narratives within its own borders. But Twitter is a U.S. company with more than 300 million active monthly users and, for better or worse, serves as the primary mouthpiece of the sitting U.S. president.

As a platform, it carries significant weight in U.S. politics. It thus bears significant responsibility, not only to help foster a secure election environment but also to prevent state-sponsored disinformation campaigns from gaining traction in U.S. political discourse through unfettered, noncompliant distribution of propaganda.

Given that the expressed purpose of FARA itself is to “protect the national defense, internal security, and foreign relations of the United States,” a first step toward this aim would be for the DOJ to require CGTN and China Daily, and eventually Xinhua (and by extension, other foreign agents like Sputnik and RT), to provide the required disclaimers on all media shared via Twitter and work with the company to hammer out the specifics of how this would be implemented.

We do not censor in the United States, and state-sponsored propaganda outlets should still be free to partake in the marketplace of ideas and enjoy the first amendment rights that often do not exist in their home country. But first and foremost, they must comply with existing U.S. law.

Trump intervention triggered EPA's surprise biofuel waiver decision: sources,https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-17-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/trump-intervention-triggered-epas-surprise-biofuel-waiver-decision-sources-idUSKCN1V610F,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A phone call from U.S. President Donald Trump last week ended a nearly two-month-long review of the nation’s biofuels program, three sources familiar with the matter said, with the White House siding in favor of oil refiners over corn growers.

Trump gave Andrew Wheeler, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the green light for the regulator to announce it had granted 31 small refinery exemptions out of the 40 applications, saying he wanted the issue off his desk, the sources said.

Trump’s call triggered a flurry of action within the EPA, leading up to a surprise Friday afternoon announcement, after weeks of negotiations between U.S. government agencies failed to make progress in addressing farmers’ concerns.

“The president has heard from all sides and in the end he has had enough of it. He called Wheeler and gave him the green light,” a source familiar with knowledge of the matter said.

The White House has sought to make changes to the nation’s biofuels laws since the beginning of Trump’s administration in early 2017, but found themselves caught between the powerful oil and corn lobbies, both of whom have allies in Washington in Trump’s Republican Party.

The debate underscores the rising political importance of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, a more than a decade-old federal policy that requires refineries to blend corn-based ethanol into their gasoline or buy credits from those that do.

Since Trump took office, the EPA has more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted to refineries, including some operated by giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp, saving the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars, but enraging farmers who claim the exemptions threaten demand for one of their staple products.

Refiners dismiss the argument, saying ethanol demand has not been affected.

The White House declined to comment for this story.

The EPA referred Reuters to an Aug. 9 press release on small refinery waivers in which it repeated the criteria on how to qualify for an exemption.

Iowa’s Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said the EPA had “screwed” the U.S. ethanol industry and farmers by granting the waivers.

“They screwed us ... when they issued 31 waivers,” the powerful senator, who represents the largest ethanol-producing state in the country, told Iowa Public Television. “Compared to less than 10 waivers during all the Obama years ... What’s really bad isn’t a waiver, it’s that it’s been granted to people who aren’t in hardship,” he said.

Trump had ordered the revamp of the waiver program in June, after hearing from angry farmers during a trip to Iowa, the nation’s top ethanol producing state. Even though the corn lobby seemed to have the upper hand in early talks, the oil industry’s efforts eventually gained more traction, industry sources have told Reuters.

Iowa is a swing state that Trump carried in 2016 and is potentially crucial for his re-election efforts next year. Farmers in the state have also chafed under Trump’s trade war with China that has sapped demand for agriculture products.

Farmers slammed last Friday’s decision, saying the Trump administration was bailing out the oil industry at a time when U.S. farmers were suffering due to his trade war with China. The refining industry welcomed the move, saying the waivers are lawful and help shield small refiners from the burdensome cost of compliance with RFS."
Exclusive: VA whistleblower-protection worker asks for protection,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et Aug.']",08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/16/va-whistleblower-protection-worker-brandon-coleman-seeks-protection/1891494001/,"CLOSE VA whistleblower Brandon Coleman, hired by VA to do outreach to whistleblowers, has some issues with the office established to protect them. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – All Brandon Coleman wanted was a meeting.

The onetime addiction counselor and Veterans Affairs whistleblower known for exposing poor care of suicidal veterans at the Phoenix VA hospital has been doing outreach to other VA whistleblowers since 2017 on behalf of President Donald Trump’s whistleblower-protection office.

This year, the office got a new leader, VA Assistant Secretary Tamara Bonzanto, so Coleman asked her for a few minutes to brief her on his efforts, including a new mentorship program for other whistleblowers.

""'Absolutely, Brandon, we can work that in,'"" Coleman recalled her telling him during an encounter in March. But the next day, he said a supervisor told him his program was being “put on hold” and he hasn’t heard from Bonzanto since.

Coleman told USA TODAY he has learned from colleagues in recent weeks that he has been excluded from meetings, his program is being eliminated, and he and dozens of other employees at the VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection are being asked to submit resumes and worry they could face possible demotion or worse.

Coleman – one of the highest-profile employees of the whistleblower office – has now requested protection from another federal agency that protects whistleblowers, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. In his request, which he also sent to members of Congress, Coleman described the work environment as ""toxic"" and said the office has turned into a ""Dumpster fire,"" according to a copy of his complaint sent July 31.

In interviews and written complaints reviewed by USA TODAY, three other employees who requested anonymity described Bonzanto as a leader who has cut herself off from employees and issued blanket orders without listening to front-line staff.

""We need help,"" Coleman said. ""How can you treat your employees the exact way we’re trying to protect employees from being treated?""

In response to inquiries from USA TODAY, the VA said Coleman's use of the terms ""toxic"" and ""Dumpster fire"" shows a ""critical disregard"" for the fact that problems at the office have been ""over two years in the making""and include a ""substantial backlog of cases.""

The agency said in a statement that Bonzanto is reorganizing the office to enhance communications with VA employees who report wrongdoing across the country and speed up investigations of the complaints.

The VA said leaders who conducted meetings to inform staff about the ""proposed realignment"" reassured them they ""will not lose their job or have their pay reduced.""

""OAWP has remained transparent with staff throughout the realignment process; solicited and received feedback; and responded to staff questions during multiple meetings and discussions,"" the VA said.

Hearing: Head of VA whistleblower office reassures lawmakers improvements are underway

The complaints from Coleman and his colleagues are the first to become public from inside the office. VA whistleblowers and advocates outside the agency have complained its operations have been ineffective and even vindictive.

VA whistleblowers drive push for change

Trump signed an executive order and later a law in 2017 creating the office to look into claims made by whistleblowers, protect them from retaliation and hold their managers accountable. Coleman stood behind Trump during the signing of the executive order.

Whistleblowing employees who have gone public to expose failures at the VA in recent years have played a critical role in driving a push for improvements at the agency. Health care workers revealed in 2014 that employees were keeping secret wait lists for appointments at the Phoenix VA and veterans had died while waiting.

Since then, they have come forward about the over-prescription of opioids to veterans in Wisconsin, equipment shortages in Washington, and dangerous conditions jeopardizing veteran care in Memphis, among other revelations.

In response to inquiries about Coleman's recent complaints, the VA said Bonzanto didn’t hear from him after he asked for the meeting in March, and his customer service duties ""will continue even after the office is realigned.""

After USA TODAY reached out to the VA for comment about Coleman's request for a meeting with Bonzanto, a senior official told his lawyer he could schedule an appointment.

""If employees have concerns, we encourage them to discuss them with OAWP leadership or provide specific examples so that we can address their concerns directly,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Unfortunately that didn't happen in this case.""

The whistleblower office has been under investigation by the VA inspector general for months and a report is expected in September. A Government Accountability Office report last year raised concerns about the independence of the office’s investigations of wrongdoing reported by whistleblowers.

The VA said Bonzanto’s reorganization is a key improvement she’s making to help address those concerns.

""The inspector general and congressional stakeholders have expressed the need for improvements at OAWP, and that’s precisely what VA Assistant Secretary for Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Dr. Tamara Bonzanto has been focusing on,"" the agency said.

Personal crusade

Improving the VA has been a personal crusade for Coleman, a former Marine with six children, including three Marines. For years, he has backed giving veterans more options for outside care paid for by the VA – a proposal Trump ultimately signed into law.

After Coleman reported in 2014 that suicidal veterans were neglected and left to walk out of the Phoenix VA, his bosses at the time accused him of misconduct and shut down his addiction-treatment program. It took nearly two years to settle the case and get Coleman's program reinstated. He went on to testify before Congress about his experiences.

Coleman was hired to do outreach for the whistleblower office and provide insights to managers on policies and programs.

The office quickly began taking in reports from VA employees – more than 1,000 in the first six months, including more than 200 alleging retaliation by VA bosses for speaking out about problems and dozens about potential threats to veteran health and safety. The office staffed up with more than 50 employees to triage and investigate the reports.

Coleman created the mentorship program, which paired a whistleblower with a senior leader to create and implement an improvement project at their VA hospital. The first pairing Coleman oversaw was in Shreveport, Louisiana, where social worker Shea Wilkes faced retaliation in 2014 after he revealed schedulers had been manipulating appointment wait times.

He partnered with Shreveport VA Director Richard Crockett last year to work on a hotline for employees to anonymously report problems. The VA hailed Coleman’s success in Shreveport last October and said it would ""serve as a model nationwide.""

But complaints about the office’s investigative division had been mounting, including allegations in the GAO report last July that the office allowed officials accused of wrongdoing to participate in investigations of the accusations.

Bonzanto, who was previously an investigator with the House Veterans Affairs Committee, was brought in as a change agent in January.

Meanwhile, Coleman continued to vet new whistleblower applicants for his mentorship program – they had to submit resumes and do interviews to be considered. He said he had eight lined up when he approached Bonzanto to ask for the meeting in March.

After the program was put on hold, Coleman has continued to triage incoming calls from whistleblowers. When he was excluded from the reorganization meetings last month, he said he started receiving calls from colleagues reluctant to report problems because of fear of retaliation from their bosses.

That’s when, Coleman said, ""It hit me.""

""I no longer feel confident referring whistleblowers to come to OAWP for help,"" he said. ""Something’s wrong with the office, and that’s why it was time to come forward. This needs to be fixed.""

Westmoreland housing authority ownership change expected to increase revenue,https://triblive.com,['Rich Cholodofsky'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/westmoreland-housing-authority-ownership-change-expected-to-increase-revenue/,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.

Westmoreland County’s housing authority transferred ownership of nearly 10% of the agency’s public housing units as part of a reorganization officials said will enable it to increase money it receives for needed capital improvements.

“This is a decision that makes all the sense in the world. We will get more money from this, and it gives us the ability to secure capital funding to renovate those units,” said Housing Authority Executive Director Michael Washowich.

No money will directly change hands as part of the transfer. Housing authority officials said the transfer was essentially a paper transaction to reclassify the units into a different subsidized housing program.

The move stems from a policy change enacted last year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that allows for the transfer of ownership of public housing units to subsidized housing programs that utilize federally-funded vouchers. The program shift will change the manner in which the authority receives funding for those units but is not expected to impact tenants who live in those units, Washowich said.

Federal funding for the voucher program has been more secure in recent years, meaning the authority expects to receive more money to operate those units, according to authority administrators.

“Tenants will see no shifts in rent. They won’t even know this happened,” Washowich said.

The authority operates about 1,800 public housing units. The eight properties impacted by the transfer are in Vandergrift, Arnold, Lower Burrell, Latrobe, Derry, Jeannette, Greensburg and Penn Township. Ownership of 174 housing units will be transferred to the Westmoreland Nonprofit Housing Corp., a subsidiary of the authority that currently operates about 350 housing units in eight housing communities throughout the county.

A report by the State Department’s inspector general concludes that leadership of a leading department bureau mistreated and harassed staffers, accused them of political disloyalty to the Trump administration, and retaliated against them.

In response to repeated counseling by more senior State officials that he address staff concerns, the report concluded, Kevin Moley, assistant secretary for international affairs, “did not take significant action.”

The report, released Thursday, is a sweeping condemnation of Moley and more specifically of his former senior adviser, Mari Stull. A former lobbyist and consultant for international food and agriculture interests, Stull left the department in January following press reports that, among other things, she had compiled a list of staffers deemed insufficiently loyal to the Trump administration.

The 30-page report — based on what it said were interviews with dozens of current and former employees, as well as documents — chronicled numerous episodes of Stull berating and belittling employees, and Moley’s repeated failure to deal with complaints reported to him.

Both Stull and Moley, it said, “frequently berated employees, raised their voices, and generally engaged in unprofessional behavior toward staff,” and reportedly moved to retaliate against those who had held their jobs under the previous administration.

Stull, it said, referred to some employees as “Obama holdovers,” “traitors,” or “disloyal,” and accused some of being part of the “Deep State” and the “swamp” — terms that President Trump has used to refer to federal employees. All of those so accused, the report said, were career staffers and not political appointees.

Some staffers said Moley accused them of “undermining the President’s agenda,” the report said.

In a response appended to the report, Moley said he had no recollection of much of the counseling, and said the description of his behavior with employees “does not represent the person I am or have ever been.” He said accounts of the departure of two senior bureau officials was inaccurate, and that he had not witnessed Stull’s reported behavior.

Stull, the report said, declined to speak to investigators.

Recommendations included in the report advised Undersecretary of Political Affairs David Hale, who supervises the international affairs bureau, to develop a “corrective action plan to address the leadership and management deficiencies,” and to consider other action, “including disciplinary action.”

The State Department response, contained in the report and repeated Thursday by a Department spokesman, accepted the recommendations. Noting that Stull was “no longer with the Department,” it said that “with regard to the second employee,” Moley, it would submit a “corrective action plan” within 60 days.

Moley served in a number of government positions in previous administrations, including as permanent U.S. representative to the Geneva-based United Nations office working with international organizations under former president George W. Bush.

The State Department’s international organizations bureau is in charge of U.S. relations with international organizations. Although Moley was nominated for the position under secretary of state Rex Tillerson, he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate a week after Trump fired Tillerson in March 2018. Stull was appointed by Moley in April of that year — as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took over the Department — and left last January.

After Politico first published reports of personnel problems in the bureau in July 2018, congressional Democrats raised concerns with Pompeo. The secretary, the report said, referred the matter to the inspector general, which was already investigating what it said were “similar issues involving the Office of the Secretary.”

Inspector General Steve Linick later told Congress that he had decided to separate the matter into two reports — one on the international organizations bureau, and the other on those portions of the Department that reported directly to the secretary’s office. The latter report has not yet been released."
Senate Dem seeks answers from DHS on reports of pregnant asylum seekers sent back to Mexico,https://thehill.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/latino/457719-senate-dem-seeks-answers-from-dhs-on-reports-of-pregnant-asylum-seekers-sent-back-to,"Sen. Jeff Merkley Jeffrey (Jeff) Alan MerkleySenate Democrats push Trump to permanently shutter migrant detention facility Senate Dem seeks answers from DHS on reports of pregnant asylum seekers sent back to Mexico Schumer backs Pelosi as impeachment roils caucus MORE (D-Ore.) on Friday asked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials to clarify reports that pregnant asylum-seekers have been forced to wait out their immigration cases in Mexican border cities.

Merkley wrote DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, asking why six late-term pregnant women were included in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program in May.

Under the program, known colloquially as “Remain in Mexico,” non-Mexican migrants seeking asylum in the United States are sent back across the border to await results of their asylum claims in U.S. immigration courts.

The Trump administration implemented the program in January with the acquiescence, but not outright support, of the Mexican government, which agreed to take in the migrants rather than deport them back to their countries of origin.

DHS in March expanded the program from the California border to El Paso, Texas, where the pregnant women were reportedly included in MPP.

DHS officials did not immediately return a request for comment.

“Policies and practices targeting pregnant women at the border are horrific and these allegations must be immediately investigated,” wrote Merkley.

Under U.S. law, children born in American territory would be natural-born U.S. citizens. If the children of third-country nationals are born in Mexico, they are also entitled to Mexican citizenship.

While Ciudad Juárez, the Mexican border city across from El Paso, has some infrastructure to provide medical services, migrant shelters in the city are reportedly overbooked and unable to care for guests with specialized needs.

Asylum-seekers with special medical needs are exempt from MPP, but that exemption does not explicitly include pregnancy.

""It is beyond question that pregnant women, particularly those nearing full term, have known health issues,"" Merkley wrote.

And Ciudad Juárez is among the most dangerous cities in Mexico, host to more than 170 murders per month.

“Forcing pregnant women to wait alone in Mexico for their asylum hearings puts them at extreme risk of abuse and extortion. Moreover, it creates significant health risks for mothers and children facing imminent delivery dates when proper medical care is not available,” Merkley said."
USDA: National THC test for hemp ‘as challenging as you think it is’,https://hempindustrydaily.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://hempindustrydaily.com/usda-national-thc-test-for-hemp-as-challenging-as-you-think-it-is/,"Federal agriculture authorities are struggling to craft a nationwide THC testing standard so that state and local regulators can tell hemp from marijuana, complicating the release of standardized production rules, according to an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

William Richmond, head of the Specialty Crops Program in the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, told a group of dietary-supplement and CBD business owners last week the agency hoped to have hemp rules prepared by now.

But he said that the USDA is grappling with the Farm Bill‘s requirement for a national THC testing protocol “using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods.”

“We need to have testing procedures in place,” he said. Coming up with reliable testing methods, he added, is “as complicated as you think it is.”

He gave no timeline for the USDA finishing its work, but said after his speech that USDA still plans to have rules done in time for the 2020 growing season,

The USDA has been “bombarded with questions” about hemp, he added, and is “working hard to issue the hemp regulations.”

He reminded the CBD companies that the USDA’s hemp regulations won’t be final until the industry has had a chance to see them and share feedback.

“Tell us what we got right – and more important, tell us what we got wrong, because we have the opportunity to fix it,” Richmond said.

Which THC?

THC testing has proven a major challenge in moving the hemp industry to a standardized commodity.

Law enforcement authorities from Texas to Florida have said they don’t have tests that can differentiate between legal hemp and illegal marijuana, and the patchwork of testing standards is complicating the Farm Bill’s goal of allowing nationwide commerce for the new crop.

“What we grow in Oregon needs to be able to go to Colorado, to Kentucky, to whatever state and not run into issues with law enforcement,” said Sunny Summers, who coordinates hemp policy for the Oregon Department of Agriculture.

Talking to the same group, a CBD conference in Denver by the American Herbal Products Association, Summers called THC testing “a big, big situation that as an industry we need to deal with.”

The Farm Bill’s direction, she said, doesn’t tell states how to prepare tests “using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods.”

“This is the No. 1 issue that I have – what the heck does that mean?” Summers said. “What is THC? Which version?”

Industry fears

THC testing protocols coming from the USDA could dramatically shake up the growing hemp industry, growers say. That’s because most U.S. hemp farmers are producing cultivars rich in cannabinoids other than THC – the same types of hemp most likely to violate THC limits depending how and when they are tested.

If post-decarboxylized tests are used, “most of the cultivars and most of the varieties that we’re currently using in U.S. would no longer be defined as hemp,” said Matt Cyrus, who raises hemp along with hay and cattle in Sisters, Oregon.

Talking to Hemp Industry Daily, Cyrus said the USDA’s looming hemp rules could throw many entrepreneurs back to the black market, depending on the testing standard.

“In theory everybody who is has hemp biomass on hand anywhere in the U.S. … would suddenly be outside the law,” said Cyrus, who is also president of the Deschutes County (Oregon) Farm Bureau.

USDA wants to make it easy

Richmond told dietary supplement manufacturers that USDA understands how complex it is to set a national THC testing standard – but he promised that federal authorities are scrambling to give farmers and state and local regulators a solution that simplifies interstate hemp commerce.

“Our goal is to provide a consistent, easy-to-follow regulatory framework around hemp production,” he said.

“I can’t speak to whether that means a hard, prescriptive set of requirements for everybody at this stage. But our goal is to provide consistent standards that make sense for growers and for the industry.”"

"Front Range area missed air quality deadline, plans to improve",https://www.denverpost.com,['The Associated Press'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/19/colorado-air-quality-epa-deadline/,"FORT COLLINS, Colo. — The Environmental Protection Agency has announced a Colorado region missed its air quality standards deadline.

The Coloradoan reports that the EPA is expected to mark the nine-county North Front Range region that includes Denver county in serious noncompliance with a federal standard.

Experts say this region has high concentrations of ground-level ozone and smog that could lead to respiratory health issues and heart disease.

Officials say the Air Quality Control Commission passed a zero-emission vehicle standard on Friday in the region to reduce the effects.

Experts say air quality improved on average over the last decade despite the announcement, and the region has plans to adopt more regulations for emission-producing industries.

Officials say the region withdrew an extension request to meet the deadline to better prioritize improvement plans.

Department of Justice sides with Led Zeppelin in “Stairway to Heaven” copyright dispute,https://consequenceofsound.net,['Ben Kaye'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/08/doj-led-zeppelin-stairway-to-heaven-copyright/,"Led Zeppelin

Led Zeppelin has found an unlikely ally in its long-running “Stairway to Heaven” copyright dispute. Attorney General William Barr and the Department of Justice have come out in support of the iconic rockers, filing a friend of the court brief with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday (via NBC News).

Fans have debated for decades whether Zeppelin’s classic track ripped off the Spirit song “Taurus”. Michael Skidmore, trustee for the late “Taurus” songwriter Randy Wolfe, sought to get an official answer by suing the band for copyright infringement in 2014. Two years later, the case went before a jury, who ruled in favor of Led Zeppelin.



(Read: 10 Famous Cases of Alleged Music Plagiarism)

However, though the jury heard testimony from Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, the actual music in question was never played during trial. The presiding judge on the case had ruled that since “Taurus” was written in 1967, prior to a change in federal copyright law, only the sheet music for the song was actually protected. After the initial verdict, the case was sent to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel called for a second trial, stating that the jury should have heard the songs. Finally, in June, the Ninth Circuit decided they’d like to hear the appeal once more.

And this is where the Justice Department comes in. In its brief, the DOJ sided with the trial judge, agreeing that only the “Taurus” sheet music should be considered when questioning copyright. Audio recording didn’t fall under federal copyright protection until the laws changed in 1972, five years after Wolfe penned “Taurus”.

The DOJ’s brief went on to say that protection should be granted to “Taurus” only if the song is “virtually identical” to “Stairway to Heaven”, something the DOJ thinks can’t be proven. We’ll see if the Ninth Circuit heeds that advice when they hear the case again in September."
"FBI 'indifferent' to possible China hack of Hillary Clinton's server, as State Department fought to protect her, interviews suggest",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles.

The information was contained in a letter and interview transcripts sent Monday by the majority staff on the Senate Finance and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees to senior Senate Republicans including Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. The letter also noted that “neither the committees nor the FBI were able to confirm whether an intrusion into the server occurred.""

The review began after two August 2018 news articles ""alleged that a Chinese state-owned company hacked former Secretary Clinton’s nongovernment server and inserted code that forwarded nearly all of her emails to the foreign company,"" the letter stated, citing an article in The Daily Caller, and a later piece by Fox News.

'OMG' -- TOP CLINTON AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT ATTEMPT TO HACK SERVER IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

A source briefed on the matter confirmed to Fox News at the time that the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) was so concerned by the revelation that officials drove over to the FBI to inform agents -- including anti-Trump agent Peter Strzok -- of the development soon after it was discovered via the emails' metadata in late 2015 or early 2016.

The source said the hack was from a Chinese company, describing it as a front for Chinese intelligence.

The letter to Grassley continued: ""The reporting indicated that two Intelligence Community Inspector General [ICIG] officials – Frank Rucker and Jeanette McMillian – discovered the code and brought the possible intrusion to the attention of the FBI.""

In a December 2018 interview with Senate investigators concerning the reporting on the potential foreign hack, Rucker said Strzok -- then the deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division in charge of the Clinton investigation -- seemed ""aloof and dismissive.""

And Strzok didn't ask many questions, according to Rucker.

McMillian, meanwhile, said FBI employees were ""poker-faced"" during the roughly hourlong meeting about the potential breach, even though both the CIA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) had ""significant equities"" in the information contained on the server.

STATE DEPT IDENTIFIES 23 VIOLATIONS, 'MULTIPLE SECURITY VIOLATIONS' AMID ONGOING REVIEW OF CLINTON EMAILS

The FBI did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

McMillian told investigators the episode began when Rucker identified an email address in Clinton's email metadata as a potential ""live dropbox"" for all her emails, which a foreign actor could access.

When Rucker then Googled the email address on the suggestion of then-ICIG Charles McCullough, the name of a Chinese company, ""Shandong Carter Heavy Industry Machinery,"" popped up -- leading Rucker and McCullough to suspect Chinese involvement, according to Rucker's interview with investigators.

In April, the ICIG and Justice Department IG determined that the address apparently matched the one that former Clinton technology aide Paul Combetta -- who managed her server and thoroughly deleted a slew of her emails -- had created as a ""dummy"" to create backups of Clinton's emails.

However, the DOJ IG and ICIG said they “did not identify any information obtained by the FBI during the [Clinton email] Midyear investigation reflecting that Combetta’s dummy email account was associated with a Chinese company or the Chinese government.""

Throughout, according to McMillian's remarks to Senate investigators, FBI brass generally seemed ""impressed"" with Rucker's technical abilities in finding the apparent breach, and apparently took the issue seriously. McMillian specifically said Strzok had found the email account's presence in Clinton's metadata ""strange.""

McMillian said she made sure to tell the FBI that the ICIG was not trying to usurp the FBI's authority after bureau officials asked how it had found information about the potential breach. The FBI made clear the ICIG would provide information to the bureau, but not the other way around, McMillian and Rucker said.

A May 2016 email from Strzok, obtained by Fox News last year, said “we know foreign actors obtained access” to some Clinton emails, including at least one “secret” message “via compromises of the private email accounts” of Clinton staffers.

Strzok, earlier this month, filed a lawsuit against the bureau and the Justice Department – arguing that the FBI caved to the “unrelenting pressure” of the president when it fired him.

DOJ IG Michael Horowitz previously concluded that although he could not prove Strzok had let his political bias influence official decisions during the Clinton email investigation, he did not have confidence that Strzok had acted without bias at critical junctures in the probe.

In text messages with his then-lover, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, Strzok said on his government-issued phone that ""we'll stop"" Trump from becoming president, and called Trump supporters ""retarded.""

Separately, Rucker and McMillian offered more details into reports that the State Department sought to cover for Clinton by downgrading the classification of emails on the server.

FBI SCRAMBLED TO ANSWER TO CLINTON LAWYER IN DAYS BEFORE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, NEW DOCS REVEAL

“At first, State fought back against the intelligence community being involved,"" McMillian told investigators, before noting that they eventually relented.

McMillian claimed that two State Department employees tried to shield some of Clinton's emails from disclosure under the ""deliberative process"" exemption under the Freedom of Information Act -- rather than labeling the emails classified.

The employees, Austin Evers and Catherine Duval, did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment. Evers has since launched the organization American Oversight along with other former Obama administration officials. The group says it is devoted to uncovering ethics issues in the Trump administration.

Rucker also claimed that then-Ambassador Patrick Kennedy questioned ""whether certain emails should be provided to the intelligence community for review and fighting against classifying other emails,"" according to the Senate investigators.

The State Department didn't respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Interviews released in 2016, known as 302s, first revealed the serious allegation that Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public.

Fox News was told as far back as August 2015 that Kennedy was running interference on Capitol Hill. But Kennedy, in his FBI interview on Dec. 21, 2015, “categorically rejected” allegations of classified code tampering.

“In return for altering the classification, the possibility of additional slots for the FBI at missions overseas was discussed,” then-House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said at the time.

In a lengthy statement, the FBI denied it had agreed to declassify any emails in exchange for more overseas slots from the State Department.

A comprehensive IG report into potential FBI and DOJ misconduct during the Clinton and Russia probes is expected soon.

Exclusive: Google Insider Turns Over 950 Pages Of Docs And Laptop To DOJ,https://saraacarter.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://saraacarter.com/exclusive-google-insider-turns-over-950-pages-of-docs-and-laptop-to-doj/,"A former Google insider claiming the company created algorithms to hide its political bias within artificial intelligence platforms – in effect targeting particular words, phrases and contexts to promote, alter, reference or manipulate perceptions of Internet content – delivered roughly 950 pages of documents to the Department of Justice’s Antitrust division Friday.

The former Google insider, who has already spoken in to the nonprofit organization Project Veritas, met with SaraACarter.com on several occasions last week. He was interviewed in silhouette, to conceal his identity, in group’s latest film, which they say exposes bias inside the social media platform.

Several weeks prior, the insider mailed a laptop to the DOJ containing the same information delivered on Friday, they said. The former insider is choosing to remain anonymous until Project Verita’s James O’Keefe reveals his identity tomorrow (Wednesday).

He told this reporter on his recent trip to Washington D.C. that the documents he turned over to the Justice Department will provide proof that Google has been manipulating the algorithms and the evidence of how it was done, the insider said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the House Judiciary Committee in December, 2018, that the search engine was not biased against conservatives. Pichai explained what algorithm’s are said Google’s algorithm was not offensive to conservatives because its artificial intelligence does not operate in that manner. He told lawmakers, “things like relevance, freshness, popularity, how other people are using it” are what drives the search results. Pichai said even if his programmers were anti-Republican, the process is so intricate that the artificial intelligence could not be manipulated and it was to complicated to train the algorithm to fit their bias.

Google did not immediately respond for comment on the insider’s claims, however, this story will be updated if comment is provided.

The insider says Google is aware most people are unaware or not knowledgeable about these advanced IT systems and therefore unable to determine who is telling the truth.

“I honestly think that a free market can fix this issue,” he told this reporter at a meeting in Washington D.C. “The issue is that the free market has been distorted and what’s happened is that the distortion is so grotesque and the engineering is so repulsive, all we need to do is just expose what’s going on. People can hear that it is bad but that can be bias. But when they see what Google has actually written with the documents, this will actually be taught in universities of what totalitarian states can do with this type of capability.”

“It will be so revolting that it doesn’t matter what the solution is, a solution will just form as a reaction to this manipulation they have done,” the Google insider said.

He said he’s asked himself many times if he’s overreacting “and every time I simply look back at the documents and realize that I am not.”

“It’s that bad,” he said. “Disclosing Google’s own words to the American public is something I am, must do, if I am to consider myself a good person. The world that google is building is not a place I, or you or our children want to live in.”

Another Google insider, who has come forward already, told O’Keefe and other media outlets recently that it is the programers at Google who use the algorithms to manipulate the information to advance its leftist agenda.

Greg Coppola, a software engineer, told Project Veritas that he doesn’t “have a smoking gun.”

However, “I’ve just been coding since I was ten, I have a Ph.D., I have five years of experience at Google, and I just know how algorithms are. They don’t write themselves. We write them to make them do what we want them to do.”

“I look at Search and I look at Google News, and I see what it’s doing,” he said. “I see Google executives go to Congress and say … that it’s not political, and I’m just so sure that that’s not true.”

Department of Justice officials declined to comment on the document dump. But SaraACarter.com has reviewed the documents and obtained proof from the Google insider that the documents were delivered to the DOJ.

The unnamed Google insider first spoke to O’Keefe’s Project Veritas. O’Keefe has been criticized by the left for outing the political bias of executives and employees of Google and other social media companies.

In the nonprofits most recent video, Project Veritas uses their undercover techniques to get Google employees to talk openly about their disdain for Trump and how their artificial intelligence operates.

Jenn Gennai, who heads Google’s Responsible Innovation Team, did not know she was being filmed by O’Keefe’s group. She told the undercover journalist that “the reason we launched our AI principals is because we’re not putting our line in the sand. They were not saying what’s fair and what’s equitable so we’re like, well we’re a big company, we’re going to say it.”"

The US Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) has signed a USD600 million contract with Cray Inc to build its first exascale supercomputer, El Capitan. The computer will be housed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California.

Exascale supercomputers are capable of executing a quintillion (1018) calculations each second. This is much faster than the fastest supercomputers in the world today which solve problems at the petascale, or a quadrillion (1015) calculations per second. According to the Exascale Computing Project - a collaborative effort of the DOE's Office of Science and the NNSA - exascale computers represent the next milestone in computing achievement. Their ability to simulate more realistically the processes involved in a range of areas including precision medicine, climate modelling, materials science and nuclear physics will have profound impacts on everyday life, it says.

""The Department of Energy is the world leader in supercomputing and El Capitan is a critical addition to our next generation systems,"" US Energy Secretary Rick Perry said. ""El Capitan's advanced capabilities for modelling, simulation, and Artificial Intelligence will help push America's competitive edge in energy and national security, allow us to ask tougher questions, solve greater challenges, and develop better solutions for generations to come.""

El Capitan will be used to perform ""mission critical"" research to maintain the US nuclear weapons stockpile, NNSA said. ""It will be used by researchers … to run 3D simulations and calculations at resolutions that are difficult, time-consuming, or even impossible using today's state-of-the art supercomputers,"" the administration added.

The computer, which is scheduled for delivery in late 2022, will be the DOE's third exascale supercomputer after Aurora at Argonne National Laboratory and Frontier at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), both of which are scheduled for delivery in 2021. All three are to be built by Cray using their Shasta architecture, Slingshot interconnect, and new system software platform.

ORNL's Summit supercomputer in 2018 was recognised as the fastest supercomputer in the world, when it reached a speed of 122.3 petaflops, which it has since improved to 148.6 petaflops, according to the semi-annual TOP500 List ranking of the world's fastest computing systems. Second place is currently held by the Sierra supercomputer at LLNL, with a fastest speed of 94.6 petaflops. One petaflop is equal to one quadrillion calculations - or ""floating-point operations"" - per second.

“The Trump administration is simply trying to payback its polluter cronies by gutting sound science that our health and environmental protections rely on,” Neil Gormley, an attorney with Earthjustice, wrote in a statement announcing the appeal filed in the D.C. Circuit Court.

would have a conflict of interest and shouldn’t be allowed to serve on various scientific panels that advise the EPA.

The move outraged science and environmental advocates who countered that the policy would sideline some of the nation’s top researchers while paving the way for industry-funded scientists to gain more influence at the EPA.

A July report from the Government Accountability Office found the EPA increased the number of industry representatives and consultants on its top scientific board and failed to ensure the appointees met ethics requirements.

But the Trump administration has already had a victory in court.

A judge previously ruled that the scientists involved in the case have no recourse because EPA’s decision is not subject to court review.

Earthjustice argues the EPA’s rule on conflicts of interest violates ethics rules and the procedure for changing them.

EPA did not immediately respond to request for comment.

A similar suit from the Natural Resources Defense Council was filed in June. That case is still being litigated.

The legal battles come at a time when many critics argue that such committees are under attack by the Trump administration.

A recent executive order signed by Trump directs all federal agencies to cut their advisory boards by at least one-third.

Those boards are often filled by people considered to be at the top of their fields who can provide important technical advice to various departments as they consider crafting a wide variety of policies.

Tensions between the boards and the agencies they advise have been particularly high at the EPA.

Members of the Science Advisory Board recently pushed back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public."
R.I. Veterans Journal: VA updates its disability ratings for claimants,https://www.providencejournal.com,['George W. Reillyspecial To The Journal'],08-18-2019,2019,8,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190818/ri-veterans-journal-va-updates-its-disability-ratings-for-claimants,"As of Aug. 11, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has updated portions of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD, or Rating Schedule) that evaluates infectious diseases, immune disorders and nutritional deficiencies. The collection of federal regulations used by the Veterans Benefits Administration helps claims processors evaluate the severity of disabilities and assign disability ratings to veteran claimants.

""VA is in the process of updating all 15 body systems of the VASRD to more accurately reflect modern medicine and provide veterans with clearer rating decisions,"" said Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie. ""By updating the rating schedule, veterans receive decisions based on the most current medical knowledge of their condition.""

Since September 2017, VA has updated the schedules for dental and oral conditions, conditions related to the endocrine system, gynecological conditions and disorders of the breast, the general rating formula for diseases of the eye, skin conditions and the hematologic and lymphatic systems.

Updating the rating schedule for conditions related to infectious diseases, immune disorders and nutritional deficiencies enables VA claims processors to make more consistent decisions with greater ease and ensure veterans understand these decisions.

The complete and lengthy list of updates to the rating schedule is available online at benefits.va.gov/WARMS/bookc.asp.

Claims pending prior to Aug. 11 will be considered under both the old and new rating criteria, and whichever criteria is more favorable to a veteran will be applied. Claims filed after Aug. 11 will be evaluated under the new rating schedule.

What is the Cranston YMCA Adaptive Program?

The Cranston YMCA and the Gary ""Tiger"" Balletto Foundation have developed the first adaptive gym in Rhode Island. The adaptive program is designed for those who desire to exercise and be healthy but have limitations because of physical or neurological conditions. With state-of-the-art equipment, as well as specialized training, the program is designed to give everyone the ability to exercise, even with friends and family.

An individual or family membership is required to enroll in the adaptive program, along with an initial evaluation, but the Cranston YMCA offers a veterans’ discount and financial assistance is also available for those who qualify. Participants must receive medical clearance from their primary care provider.

The Cranston YMCA partnered with the Balletto Foundation to bring the adaptive gym to Rhode Island. Balletto is a former professional boxer who suffered a spinal cord injury six years ago, making him a quadriplegic. Appalled at the cost of outpatient therapies and specialized gyms, Gary made it his mission to make this gym affordable for all who need something like this. In fact, the cost of a YMCA membership is all that is required.

The program is available for participants with spinal cord injuries, stroke, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy and other neurological diseases. Neurological and physical disabilities may also qualify on a case-by-case basis and you should contact the adaptive program director for more information on this.

With its specialized staff and equipment, the adaptive program is the only one of its kind in Rhode Island. The specialized strength and conditioning equipment allows participants to enjoy the benefits of exercise. The equipment includes NuStep, Standing Frame, a Galileo Tilt Table, Functional Electric Stimulation (FES) and adaptive strength machines. Personalized fitness plans are also available, although they require a certain level of independence. The Adaptive Program director makes recommendations on the fitness plans for individuals.

The evaluation will assess your current abilities and be used to recommend a personalized program. Potential participants should consult with a physician or physical therapist to ensure they are cleared to do load-bearing activities, use a functional electrical stimulation (FES) bike and do intense exercise.

To sign up for a new member evaluation or schedule a tour, call Nico Erausquin at (401) 206-5876 or send an email to nerausquin@gpymca.org.

Roger Stone and the DOJ are fighting in court over a clip from 'The Godfather Part II',https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/16/roger-stone-is-fighting-doj-in-court-over-a-godfather-clip.html,"The Justice Department charged Stone in January with obstruction, false statements and witness tampering in a 24-page indictment that cites the 1974 crime drama.

Stone, who was indicted in January on charges including witness tampering, says the clip will make him out to be a ""murderous mafioso."" The Justice Department calls the video ""directly relevant to the charge.""

""I kept saying Michael Corleone did this, Michael Corleone did that, so I said, yeah, sure,"" Pentangeli says, downplaying his earlier comments, in which he accused Corleone of crimes.

""I don't know nothing about that,"" Pentangeli says in response to a question about Corleone's connections to organized crime. ""Oh — I was in the olive oil business with his father but that was a long time ago.""

The video shows Corleone family mob leader Frank Pentangeli lying to Congress — and abandoning his plans to incriminate Michael Corleone — during a dramatic hearing in which Corleone makes an appearance in the audience.

The conservative provocateur and the Department of Justice have been sparring for a month over whether jurors can be shown a 4-minute-and-20-second clip from the film.

Longtime Republican strategist and former Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone wants a clip from ""The Godfather Part II"" to sleep with the fishes — at least during his upcoming trial.

""On multiple occasions,"" the indictment says, Stone told associate Randy Credico to ""do a 'Frank Pentangeli' before [the House intelligence committee] in order to avoid contradicting"" him.

One day in 2017, the indictment alleges, Stone also told Credico: ""If you testify you're a fool. [...] I guarantee you you are the one who gets indicted for perjury if you're stupid enough to testify.""

In July, the Justice Department asked Judge Amy Berman Jackson to show jurors the clip in order to reveal ""what Stone intended to communicate.""

The government's brief, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, cites an email from Stone to Credico in 2018 in which Stone mimics Pentangeli's language from the scene.

""'Sure I know Roger Stone. he was in the Olive Oil business with my father. But that was a long long time ago. So I told them Roger Stone this, Roger Stone that. You should do Pantagela [SIC] on Erin Burnett,"" the email said, according to the Justice Department. Burnett is an anchor on CNN.

In response, Stone's attorneys filed a brief Aug. 9 in which they argued that showing the clip will ""instantly create a connection in the minds of the jurors that Stone is somehow similar to a murderous mafioso.""

Federal courts allow evidence to be excluded if it is likely to mislead or confuse the jury.

""Once the door is opened with a movie clip, which no doubt will accompany an explanation of why it is being played, the trial detours to a Mafia trial and Stone's connection to it, with all of its history and folklore,"" attorney Bruce Rogow wrote in the brief.

""A fictional demonstration of Mafia intimidation does so much more than the government's purported explanation of context, seeks to introduce. Its introduction is harmful to a fair trial. But introduction of the movie does more,"" Rogow wrote.

He wrote that showing the clip would also implicate Credico, a conservative comedian and activist, by suggesting he was an ""organized crime figure"" like Pentangeli, who ""understood the threats in the same way as the fictional character in the movie understood it.""

""As opposed to the message which was a joke between friends, or a suggestion to follow [Credico's] lawyer's advice and remain silent. It implies that Stone kidnapped [Credico's] brother (if he has one) and kept him hostage. It implies that [Credico] is in a witness protection program like Pentangeli, who has to reside at an Army barracks because of the threat to Pentangeli's safety,"" Rogow wrote. ""It makes Roger Stone the Michael Corleone character in this analogy — an iconic violent godfather of the Mafia.""

In response to a request for comment, Rogow said in an email: ""The filings speak for themselves.""

The battle continued on Friday, when the Justice Department responded to Stone's brief by arguing that the government ""does not intend to suggest that Stone is an organized crime figure.""

Jessie Liu, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, noted that Jackson could warn jurors that ""the clip should not be taken to suggest that Stone is in the mafia"" or ""planned a murder.""

""The movie clip itself powerfully illustrates both the clarity of the references to the scene in Stone's messages and the obvious parallels between the congressional investigation depicted in the film and the congressional investigation that gave rise to [Credico's] subpoena,"" Liu wrote in the five-page brief.
