Judge tosses House Dems' lawsuit over Trump's use of emergency military funds for border wall,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-house-dems-lawsuit-trump-emergency-military-funds-border-wall,"Washington, D.C., district court Judge Trevor McFadden threw out House Democrats' lawsuit seeking an injunction against President Trump's emergency border wall funding reallocation, saying that the matter is fundamentally a political dispute and that the politicians lack standing to make a legal case.

Trump had declared a national emergency this past February over the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, following Congress' failure to fund his border wall legislatively. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Democrats then filed suit in April, charging that Trump was ""stealing from appropriated funds” by moving $6.7 billion from other projects toward border wall construction.

Democrats argued that the White House had ""flouted the fundamental separation-of-powers principles and usurped for itself legislative power specifically vested by the Constitution in Congress.""

But, in his ruling, McFadden, a Trump appointee, suggested Democrats were trying to circumvent the political process.

""This case presents a close question about the appropriate role of the Judiciary in resolving disputes between the other two branches of the Federal Government. To be clear, the court does not imply that Congress may never sue the Executive to protect its powers,"" McFadden wrote in his opinion. ""The Court declines to take sides in this fight between the House and the President.""

McFadden's ruling contrasted with U.S. District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam’s injunction last week, which blocked the administration from using the reallocated funds for projects in specific areas in Texas and Arizona. Gilliam had been appointed by then-President Barack Obama.

McFadden began by focusing on two guiding Supreme Court cases he called ""lodestars""-- the 2015 case Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, and the 1997 case Raines v. Byrd.

""Read together, Raines and Arizona State Legislature create a spectrum of sorts,"" McFadden wrote. ""On one end, individual legislators lack standing to allege a generalized harm to Congress’s Article I power. On the other end, both chambers of a state legislature do have standing to challenge a nullification of their legislative authority brought about through a referendum.""

But, McFadden quickly distinguished the Arizona State Legislature case, which found institutional standing for legislators only in a limited instance. The Arizona case, the judge noted, ""does not touch or concern the question whether Congress has standing to bring a suit against the President,"" and the Supreme Court has found there was ""no federal analogue to Arizona’s initiative power.""

Democrats' dispute was more similar to the one in the Raines case, McFadden wrote. Under the framework and factors considered in Raines -- including how similar matters have been handled historically, and the availability of other remedies besides litigation -- McFadden ruled that House Democrats lacked standing.

Concerning past historical practice, the Trump administration argued in its brief that when Congress was concerned about ""unauthorized Executive Branch spending in the aftermath of World War I, it responded not by threatening litigation, but by creating the General Accounting Office."" The judge cited that argument approvingly in his opinion, calling it ""persuasive.""

Examples of hotly debated political questions being resolved without involving the courts, McFadden continued, ""abound"" throughout history.

PRIVATELY FUNDED BORDER WALL CONSTRUCTION BEGINS IN EL PASO

For example, McFadden wrote, in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""fired an official from his Senate-confirmed position at the Federal Trade Commission. ...The President removed the official without providing a reason. ... The Senate likely had a 'strong[] claim of diminution of' its Advice and Consent power. ... Yet the Senate made no effort to challenge this action in court.""

Additionally, McFadden said Democrats retained constitutional legislative options with which to remedy their objections about the president's purported misuse of the Appropriations Clause. Under Supreme Court precedent in the Raines case, McFadden asserted, the existence of those additional options suggested Democrats lacked standing.

McFadden noted in particular that Democrats retained the power to modify or even repeal the appropriations law if they wanted to ""exempt future appropriations"" from the Trump administration's reach.

Because the White House had not ""nullified"" that legislative power, McFadden wrote, there was no urgent need for judicial intervention sufficient to override the considerations of the political question doctrine, which holds that courts generally stay out of politically sensitive matters best left to voters.

""Congress has several political arrows in its quiver to counter perceived threats to its sphere of power,"" McFadden wrote. ""These tools show that this lawsuit is not a last resort for the House. And this fact is also exemplified by the many other cases across the country challenging the administration's planned construction of the border wall.""

McFadden continued: ""The House retains the institutional tools necessary to remedy any harm caused to this power by the Administration’s actions. Its Members can, with a two-thirds majority, override the President’s veto of the resolution voiding the National Emergency Declaration. They did not. It can amend appropriations laws to expressly restrict the transfer or spending of funds for a border wall under Sections 284 and 2808. Indeed, it appears to be doing so.""

The judge added that House Democrats had the burden of demonstrating that they had standing -- a difficult hurdle for any plaintiff to clear, which involves showing a particularized injury that the court can address.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES ESCALATING TARIFFS ON MEXICO UNTIL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 'STOP'

To that end, McFadden quoted former Chief Justice John Marshall's opinion in the seminal 1803 case Marbury v. Madison, in which Marshall wrote, the ""province of the [C[ourt is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals, not to enquire how the executive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a discretion.""

McFadden also wrote, quoting from another Supreme Court case, ""Intervening in a contest between the House and President over the border wall would entangle the Court 'in a power contest nearly at the height of its political tension' and would 'risk damaging the public confidence that is vital to the functioning of the Judicial Branch.'""

Lawmakers expressly approved only $1.375 billion in the weeks after the shutdown, to go toward funding to 55 miles of wall along the southern border. But, Trump said that was inadequate, and he pushed ahead by moving funds from other Homeland Security projects previously approved by legislators. In his budget request earlier this year, Trump formally requested another $8.6 billion from Congress, saying that would be sufficient to build more than 700 miles of wall.

The emergency-appropriated funding alone could be used to build more than 230 miles of barriers.

At a hearing in May, McFadden hinted that courts should stay out of the matter -- and suggested an appeal was imminent regardless.

""I’m not sure how much necessarily our views will carry the day for the courts above us,"" McFadden said at the hearing.

Disagreement already has been brewing in the lower courts, setting the stage for appellate panels to step in. Gillam, the Northern District of California judge who ruled last month that Trump was likely breaking the law by reallocating the wall funds, blocked some projects slated for immediate construction in Yuma and El Paso.

""In short, the position that when Congress declines the Executive’s request to appropriate funds, the Executive nonetheless may simply find a way to spend those funds without Congress does not square with fundamental separation of powers principles dating back to the earliest days of our Republic,"" Gilliam wrote."
Pastor tells congregation why he prayed for Trump,https://www.politico.com,['Krystal Campos'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/03/pastor-trump-prayer-1352311,"Pastor David Platt prays for President Donald Trump at McLean Bible Church in Vienna, Va., on Sunday. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo politics Pastor tells congregation why he prayed for Trump

The pastor of a Northern Virginia church where President Donald Trump made an unscheduled visit over the weekend has explained why he publicly prayed for the president, acknowledging to his congregation that “some within our church … are hurt that I made this decision.”

“Sometimes we find ourselves in situations that we didn’t see coming, and we’re faced with a decision in a moment when we don’t have the liberty of deliberation, so we do our best to glorify God,” Pastor David Platt of McLean Bible Church said Sunday evening in a statement to church members titled “Prayer for the President.” “Today, I found myself in one of those situations.”

Hours earlier, Trump’s motorcade made an unannounced detour to the church while returning to the White House from Trump National Golf Club in nearby Sterling, Va.

“President Donald J. Trump is visiting McLean Bible Church in Vienna, VA, to visit with the Pastor and pray for the victims and community of Virginia Beach,” Judd Deere, a spokesman for the White House, said in a statement on Sunday, referring to the mass shooting at a municipal complex that left 13 people dead, including the gunman.

Platt explained in the statement to his congregation that he had been caught off guard.

“At the end of my sermon at the 1:00 worship gathering, I stepped to the side for what I thought would be a couple of moments in quiet reflection as we prepared to take the Lord’s Supper,” he said. “But I was immediately called backstage and told that the President of the United States was on his way to the church, would be there in a matter of minutes, and would like for us to pray for him.”

Platt, a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention’s International Mission Board, also explained that he prayed for the president because 1 Timothy 2:1-6 urges, in part, that Christians pray “for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.”

Trump, wearing a blazer over his golf clothes, stood on a stage while Platt prayed.

Afterward, “the president walked off stage without comment, and we closed our gathering by celebrating heroes among us, a couple who has spent the last 48 years spreading the gospel in remote places where it had never gone before they came,” Platt said in his statement. “We then recited the Great Commission as we always do, sending one another out into the city for the glory of our King.”

Platt went on to explain that he had no intention of endorsing the president, his policies or the Republican Party, and said he was sharing details “because I know that some within our church, for a variety of valid reasons, are hurt that I made this decision.”

“This weighs heavy on my heart,” he continued. “I love every member of this church, and I only want to lead us with God’s Word in a way that transcends political party and position, heals the hurts of racial division and injustice, and honors every man and woman made in the image of God.”

A day earlier, the president thanked the evangelist and missionary Franklin Graham for his announcement of a “Special Day of Prayer for the President,” scheduled for Sunday.

“We will all stick together and WIN! Thank you Franklin,” Trump tweeted on Saturday.

"Ex-Trump lawyer slams Mueller report as a ‘fraud,’ cites misleading quote",https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-report-john-dowd-quote-alan-dershowitz,"Ex Trump lawyer John Dowd on Monday slammed the Mueller report as a ""fraud,"" for allegedly mispresenting a quote he had said in a voicemail.

Dowd said there will likely be more discrepancies in the future stemming from the report.

“Isn’t it ironic that this man [Mueller], who kept indicting and prosecuting people for process crimes, committed a false statement in his own report,” Dowd said.

U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes called for the release of “all backup and source information” for the Mueller report on Friday after a newly released transcript of a former Trump lawyer's 2017 voicemail message included content that did not appear in a version that was part of the special counsel's Russia investigation findings.

Nunes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, was reacting to the release of a voicemail message that John Dowd, a former lawyer for President Trump, had left for a lawyer representing former national security adviser Michael Flynn, in which Dowd asks for a “heads up” if Flynn planned to say anything damaging about Trump to Mueller’s team.

Nunes retweeted a side-by-side comparison of the Dowd transcript text and the Mueller report text, suggesting that the Mueller report did not disclose the full Dowd message. The Mueller report had redacted the part of the voicemail where Dowd said he wanted the heads up “not only for the president but for the country” and that he wasn’t asking for “any confidential information.”

Alan Dershowitz claimed on ""Hannity"" Monday night that the quotation was ""distorted.""

""This is a very, very serious issue,"" he said. ""The distortion of the Dowd quote is very serious. Especially since, remember, that a report by a special counsel is always going to be one-sided. Therefore, you have to trust it.""

Dowd said, according to the transcript: “I understand that you can’t join the joint defense; so that’s one thing. If, on the other hand, we have, there’s information that... implicates the president, then we’ve got a national security issue, or maybe a national security issue, I don’t know... some issue, we got to — we got to deal with, not only for the president, but for the country. So... uh... you know, then-then, you know, we need some kind of heads-up.”

Federal prosecutors released the transcript in a court filing. Flynn, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to federal investigators about contacts with Russians and is awaiting sentencing, said the call was an effort to obstruct his cooperation with Mueller’s probe.

Trump Insults London Mayor as ‘Loser’ as He Pays Tribute to the Queen,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Mark Landler', 'Maggie Haberman']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/world/europe/trump-banquet-meghan-markle-sadiq-khan.html,"LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II welcomed President Trump to Buckingham Palace on Monday with an honor guard and royal artillery salute, while Mr. Trump carried on an ugly dispute with the mayor of London, whom he called a “stone cold loser” and said was doing a terrible job of running Britain’s capital city.

The juxtaposition of high pageantry and low name-calling, on the first day of Mr. Trump’s state visit to Britain, captured yet again the odd swath that this president cuts on the world stage: impulsive and erratic, delighted by a lavish welcome but preoccupied by petty feuds or events back home.

It also showcased the deep ambivalence Mr. Trump’s visit has elicited. The British public mostly rejects Mr. Trump and his policies, but the governing elite recognizes the need to reinforce the alliance with the United States as it negotiates Britain’s exit from the European Union."
Mexican Government Privately Warns Trump Administration Of Countertariffs,https://www.npr.org,['Franco Ordoñez'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/03/729402832/mexican-government-privately-warns-trump-administration-of-counter-tariffs,"Mexican Government Privately Warns Trump Administration Of Countertariffs

The Mexican government has employed a tone of friendship that's averse to conflict, but Mexican officials behind the scenes are warning the Trump administration that they're prepared to announce targeted countertariffs if the United States carries out threats of new tariffs on Mexican imports.

Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard met with State Department officials in Washington over the past 48 hours in an effort to find a solution to a tariff fight, which he later described as ""counterproductive"" and that would not decrease immigration.

Publicly, officials are saying they do not want to disrupt crucial supply chains, but those familiar with the talks say they are privately looking at imports that have political significance and are sent directly to Mexico for consumption.

The behind-the-scenes talks are part of a more public push led by Ebrard and other top Mexican officials who are warning their counterparts of disastrous consequences if President Trump carries out threats to impose 5% tariffs on June 10 as punishment for not curbing migration flows, according to two sources familiar with the talks.

""They're going to have to delicately balance inflaming tensions even further, as this could be horrific for both countries, but particularly the Mexican economy,"" said a former White House official familiar with the conversations. ""But you can't just roll over and play dead if you're verbally attacked like this by a foreign government's president. That doesn't play well, domestically.""

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador sent Ebrard as well as Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Márquez and Agriculture Minister Victor Villalobos to Washington in search of a solution to avert the tariff battle.

On Monday, Mexican officials said Márquez was expected to meet with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and Villalobos met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. There were also meetings planned with acting head of the Department of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Ebrard is expected to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday.

Some Republicans in key states that rely on a trade relationship with Mexico are warning Trump that he risks hurting U.S. interests.

""It's important to remember that any actions that we take to secure our Southern border must also keep in mind the important role that Mexico plays in the economy of the United States,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. ""My state enjoys a strong relationship economically with Mexico because of that 1,200-mile common border.""

The Mexican team argues the best way to combat immigration is to invest in Central America, but the Trump administration wants Mexico to take stronger steps along its southern border, dismantle human smuggling chains and improve coordination on asylum.

The relationship between the United States and Mexico goes well beyond immigration.

Mexico is the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner. The two countries collaborate on everything from drug trafficking to human trafficking. The United States has invested more than $2 billion through the Mérida security initiative, and the Mexican government, after decades of hostility, is now allowing U.S. investment in its oil industry.

During a news conference Monday, Márquez expressed confidence in finding a diplomatic solution but said officials are evaluating the proper response if Trump carries out the tariffs.

""I cannot say that we're are going to do the same [tariffs], because we have to make a strategic plan to take into account aspects of the commercial relationship,"" Márquez said in Spanish. ""We do not want to use tariffs to damage supply chains, job creation or investment.""

But Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China, said what Mexico can do that China did not is implement more strategic countermeasures as opposed to blanket tariffs.

As an example, he said Mexico could consider targeting Kentucky bourbon because of its political importance and ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. It is also shipped to Mexico for consumption but is not part of a supply chain like production of various auto parts that make several trips back and forth over the border as a car is built.

""Very simply,"" Guajardo said, ""Sen. Lindsey Graham [R-S.C.] said he supported President Trump's tariffs. You can be first certain that Mexico is thinking [about what] South Carolina [is] exporting to Mexico. And that will be targeted as long as it's not in a supply chain."""

Amazon Offered Job to Pentagon Official Involved With $10 Billion Contract It Sought,https://theintercept.com,[],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://theintercept.com/2019/06/03/amazon-defense-department-jedi-contract/,"In a federal lawsuit, the tech giant Oracle has provided new details to support its accusation that Amazon secretly negotiated a job offer with a then-Department of Defense official who helped shape the procurement process for a massive federal contract for which Amazon was a key bidder.

Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are now the two finalists to win the highly contested $10 billion contract for what is known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI. The deal, one of the largest federal contracts in U.S. history, would pay one company to provide cloud computing services in support of Defense Department operations around the world.

But the contract has been hotly contested since the department began soliciting proposals last year. Two of Amazon’s competitors, IBM and Oracle, filed complaints with the Government Accountability Office saying that the winner-take-all process unfairly favored Amazon, which is seen as an industry leader in cloud computing. When its claim was rejected, Oracle sued the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.

Since the court battle began in 2018, Oracle has aggressively lodged conflict-of-interest accusations involving a former DOD official named Deap Ubhi, who left the department in 2017 to take a job at Amazon. In a court motion filed on Friday, Oracle alleged that while Ubhi worked on the preliminary research for the JEDI program in the late summer and fall of 2017, he was also engaged in a secret job negotiation with Amazon for months, complete with salary discussions, offers of signing bonuses, and lucrative stock options.

The motion further alleges that Ubhi did not recuse himself from the JEDI program until weeks after verbally accepting a job offer from Amazon and that he continued to receive information about Amazon’s competitors and participate in meetings about technical requirements, despite a government regulation that forbids such conflicts of interest.

“Neither Ubhi nor [Amazon Web Services] disclosed the employment discussions or job offer to DOD — not when the employment discussions started, not when the informal job offer occurred, not when the formal offer occurred, and not even when Ubhi accepted the offer,” Oracle’s motion reads.

As America’s technology companies have continued to outpace the Pentagon, the Defense Department has looked to recruit talent from Silicon Valley to help enhance its information technology.

Ubhi is a venture capitalist and technology entrepreneur who worked for Amazon before his time in government. He took a job working on a Defense Department initiative aimed at collaborating with Silicon Valley to modernize the Pentagon’s information technology systems. After working as part of a four-person team to help shape the Pentagon JEDI procurement process, he left the department and returned to Amazon in November 2017.

A spokesperson for Amazon Web Services declined to comment and declined to make Ubhi available for an interview, citing ongoing litigation. Elissa Smith, a spokesperson for the Department of Defense, also told The Intercept that “we don’t comment on pending litigation.”

In a previous court filing, U.S. government lawyers accused Oracle of a “broad fishing expedition primarily [intended] to find support for its claim that the solicitation at issue is tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.”

According to Oracle’s motion on Friday, Ubhi began job negotiations with Amazon in August 2017, while he was working on the early stages of the JEDI program. Oracle claims says that “deep discussions” about employment began in late September and that Ubhi “verbally committed” to take the job on October 4. But according to the filing, Ubhi did not recuse himself until October 31, 2017. Oracle alleges that he continued to influence the program in the meantime.

Under the Procurement Integrity Act, government officials who are “contacted by a [contract] bidder about non-federal employment” have two options: They must either report the contact and reject the offer of employment or promptly recuse themselves from any contract proceedings.

“Contracts should be awarded fairly based on merit,” Mandy Smithberger, director of the Center for Defense Information at the Project on Government Oversight, told The Intercept. “The Procurement Integrity Act seeks to ensure that job offers and other financial conflicts of interest don’t influence that process.”

Last year, a Defense Department review found that “there were four instances where [department] individuals with potential financial conflicts of interest” had worked on the JEDI program, according to court records, but the Pentagon concluded that this hadn’t unfairly impacted the contracting process. Two follow-up reviews — one by the GAO in November 2018 and another by the Defense Department in April 2019 — came to similar conclusions.

The second Pentagon review came after the department said that it had received “new information” about Ubhi and would investigate it. According to Oracle’s motion on Friday, the “new information” came from a “belated submission from [Amazon]” to the DOD’s contracting officer that finally acknowledged the monthslong employment talks.

According to Oracle, Ubhi provided a “false narrative” to the contracting officer at the time of his recusal, saying that he was stepping away from the project because Amazon had offered to acquire a company that Ubhi had a stake in. That was a pretext to mask the fact he had been negotiating for months to obtain a job at the company, Oracle’s filing said.

The filing also alleges that between Ubhi’s verbal commitment to accept Amazon’s offer and his recusal from JEDI, he continued to participate in Pentagon meetings about the project’s technical requirements and to receive submissions from Amazon competitors. It also alleges that Ubhi downloaded material from a JEDI project Google Drive to his own laptop.

In its filings, Oracle has argued that Ubhi was instrumental in persuading the Pentagon to seek services from a single vendor — a decision widely seen to improve Amazon’s chances. Oracle cites workplace messages on the platform Slack in which Ubhi tries to persuade his colleagues to come around to that view, but the company does not cite any messages suggesting what his reasons or motive may have been."
"House Judiciary Committee Launches Tech Antitrust Inquiry Amid Reports DOJ, FTC May Take Action",https://gizmodo.com,"['Tom Mckay', 'About The Author', '... An Upperclassman Who Had Been Researching Terrorist Groups Online.', '- Washington Post']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/house-judiciary-committee-launches-tech-antitrust-inqui-1835222946,"Photo: Cliff Owen (AP)

Over the past week, the two federal agencies with mandates to enforce antitrust law—the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission—have apparently been divvying up Silicon Valley for potential probes. Reports have indicated that the DOJ has scooped up responsibility for Google and Apple, while the FTC could be going after Amazon and Facebook.



Now, according to CNN Business, the House Judiciary Committee is launching what it said would be a “top-to-bottom” antitrust investigation in the tech industry, with all four of the aforementioned companies obvious potential targets.

Congress is more limited in its ability to directly go after tech behemoths than either the DOJ or the FTC—it lacks the power to launch Ma Bell-style breakups of individual firms or impose fines—but as CNN noted, it can “compel testimony from executives, gather documents and force public debate.” In other words, members of Congress can not only generate further political headaches for any firms that get swept up in the probe, but they can use the hearings as an opportunity to build a case for any potential legislative response down the road.

CNN wrote that Democratic Representative David Cicilline (Rhode Island), who heads the committee’s antitrust subcommittee, said the investigation would focus on whether tech firms have amassed too much market power to the detriment of journalism, consumer privacy, and competition in the industry. Cicilline also told the network that the committee’s move was in part intended to hold the DOJ and FTC’s feet to the fire, as the two agencies have regularly faced accusations that they have failed to aggressively enforce antitrust law in the past. Per CNN:

Key areas for the investigation include the tech industry’s impact on local journalism, consumer privacy and the ability for new startups to enter the marketplace, according to Cicilline. At the heart of the inquiry are concerns about what Cicilline called the companies’ “tremendous market power,” which in some cases he feels has led to their accumulating substantial political power. Committee officials have notified Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook of the coming investigation. Cicilline said he wants to hear from senior tech executives, and that he won’t hesitate to issue subpoenas to companies that fail to cooperate... “I don’t have a lot of confidence that [the DOJ and FTC] will get the job done,” Cicilline said.

Cicilline also cited Google’s 90 percent control of search engine use, Amazon’s estimated 50 percent share of the e-commerce market, and Facebook’s repeated “bad conduct” while talking with reporters on Monday, the Daily Beast wrote.

“A small number of dominant, unregulated platforms have extraordinary power over commerce, communication, and information online,” the Judiciary Committee told NBC News and other news outlets in a statement (signed by members of both parties). “Based on investigative reporting and oversight by international policymakers and enforcers, there are concerns that these platforms have the incentive and ability to harm the competitive process.”



“The Antitrust Subcommittee will conduct a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms,” the statement continued. “This is the first time Congress has undertaken an investigation into this behavior.”

As the New York Times noted, the House Judiciary move could also signal that legislators are beginning to consider overhauling antitrust laws—at a time when tech companies are facing a particularly hostile reception in much of DC.

Democratic politicians, including presidential candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, have increasingly warmed to the idea that regulators should seriously look at breaking up some of the biggest players in the industry. Republicans tend to be much more amenable to corporate consolidation, but the current administration has launched a mostly one-sided vendetta against tech companies over unfounded allegations they systematically suppress conservative views.

In turn, many tech companies have ramped up the amount of money they spend on lobbying considerably. Last year, some of the biggest players (including Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Twitter) dropped a combined $64 million plus on efforts to build political influence. Google and Facebook set record spending of $21.2 million and $12.62 million respectively, while Amazon dropped $14 million and Microsoft spent $9.52 million. Apple spent around $6.62 million, a slight decrease, but Twitter spent over $1 million for the first time in the company’s history."
DOJ calls new census allegations a 'baseless attack on the integrity' of department and its employees,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Tammy Kupperman']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/politics/doj-census-allegations/index.html,"(CNN) The Department of Justice on Monday night forcefully disputed an account by the American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause and others that the decision to add a citizenship question to the census was politically motivated.

A Justice Department spokesperson says the allegations that a 2015 study by a Republican redistricting expert played a major role in the request to add a citizenship question to the census are meritless.

In a letter last week, the ACLU, Common Cause and others said they had found ""new evidence"" that the government's true motivation in adding the question was to improve the chances of Republicans.

They pointed to a recently disclosed 2015 study written by Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a Republican redistricting expert, who wrote that using ""citizen voting age"" population as the redistricting population base would be ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.""

The challengers say the new information shows Hofeller played a more significant role in the decision to add the citizenship question than has been disclosed and that his study reveals the true motive behind the administration's decision to add the question.

The Justice Department ripped the allegations as a ""baseless attack on the integrity of the Department and its employees,"" and a spokesperson said the allegations are based on information the challengers have known for months.

According to the spokesperson, the study by the now-deceased Hofeller ""played no role in the Department of Justice's letter recommending reinstatement of a citizenship question to the Census."" Hofeller died last August.

The Justice Department rebutted the allegations on Monday in a six-page letter, accompanied by multiple exhibits, to a federal judge in New York who has scheduled a hearing on Wednesday.

In the court filings, the department calls the claim that a Justice Department official relied on Hofeller's study ""false.""

In the filing, the Department of Justice said senior official John Gore had never falsely testified and ""the assertion that Gore relied on a private, unpublished study to compile information that is widely known and publicly available is absurd.""

The department accuses the challengers of ""conjuring a conspiracy theory involving a deceased political operative that essentially hinges on wordplay.""

District Judge Jesse Furman, of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled against the administration in January and in April the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case. A decision in one of the most closely anticipated cases of the term is due by the end of June.

The Supreme Court agreed to take up the appeal in an expedited time frame. In court, the conservative justices appeared ready to side with the government and allow the question.

In a letter to Furman, the challengers say the evidence bolsters their argument that while the administration contends the question was added to better comply with federal voting laws, the real reason was to intimidate Hispanic households.

""The new evidence thus not only contradicts testimony in this case, but it shows that those who constructed the VRA (Voting Rights Act) rationale knew that adding a citizenship question would not benefit Latino voters, but rather would facilitate significantly reducing their political power,"" the letter to the judge read.

The lawyers attached a copy of a deposition of A. Mark Neuman, who they say was Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' expert adviser on the matter, in their letter to the judge.

Neuman testified that Hofeller was the ""first person"" who suggested to him to add the citizenship question. Neuman said in the deposition that Hofeller had told him it would help maximize ""Latino representation.""

""But new evidence obtained in discovery in state court ... shows that Dr. Hofeller instead knew that adding a citizenship question would have exactly the opposite effect -- it would disadvantage Latinos and benefit 'Non-Hispanic Whites,' "" the lawyers told the judge.

They also say that Hofeller ""ghostwrote"" a ""substantial part"" of a draft letter that would ultimately become the Department of Justice's official letter requesting that the Commerce Department add the citizenship question.

""This is important because it shows that Hofeller's work formed the basis for DOJ's request to add the citizenship question,"" said ACLU attorney Dale Ho.

""The bottom line is the Trump administration doesn't deny that portions of its first draft of a request to add a citizenship question to the census were written by Thomas Hofeller, who advocated for the question because it would be, in his own words, 'advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,' "" Ho said in a statement. ""At this point, does anyone seriously believe that the Trump administration, which hasn't filed a single case under the Voting Rights Act, has gone through all of this trouble so that it can protect voters of color?""

The information came to light after Hofeller had passed away and his estranged daughter collected his belongings. They included a hard drive that turned out to hold some 75,000 files.

The interest group Common Cause was involved in a case concerning gerrymandering in North Carolina and subpoenaed the documents hoping to get a better understanding of Hofeller's work in that area. It then found the documents pertinent to its other case concerning the census.

Richard Hasen, of the University of California Irvine, called the new information ""blockbuster"" but said he doubted the conservative justices on the Supreme Court would agree. He noted that during oral arguments they had accepted at ""face value"" the administration's justification for the law, that the question was ""necessary to protect Hispanic voters."""
Barr’s zealous defense of Trump makes it impossible to trust his legal judgment,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Neal Katyal', 'Neal Katyal Is The Former Acting Solicitor General Of The United States In The Obama Administration', ""The Saunders Professor Of National Security Law At Georgetown University As Well As The Faculty Chair Of Georgetown'S"", 'June At Pm']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/06/03/barrs-zealous-defense-trump-makes-it-impossible-trust-his-legal-judgement/,"

There are two big questions about the now-completed investigation into President Trump, and the answers will determine what happens next. First, why did special counsel Robert S. Mueller III not render a judgment on whether Trump had obstructed justice? And second, since Attorney General William P. Barr did render such a judgment, why isn’t that the end of the matter?

The public appearances last week of Mueller and Barr answer both questions. We saw a hyper-careful special counsel who bent over backward to be fair to Trump. And we saw an attorney general who was acting as the president’s personal lawyer, not the lawyer for the American people.

Mueller explained in his news conference that he would not answer the obstruction question, just as his report didn’t answer the question except to say he could not clear Trump because the facts would not permit him to. Justice Department guidance held that he could not indict a sitting president, he said, so he did not reach a conclusion as to whether the president committed crimes. He said it would be unfair to attack someone as a criminal without indicting them because there would be no legal process for them to prove the accusations wrong. That didn’t mean Mueller was acting as some “angry Democrat” (a hard thing for a Republican to do, in any event) — it meant he was being careful to protect Trump’s rights.

Barr, by contrast, took the opposite approach. He appeared the next day on CBS News and said, “I personally felt he could’ve reached a decision,” and that “the opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office, but he could’ve reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity.”

Barr’s statement was news, not only to the American public, but also, I suspect, to Mueller himself. It also should have come as news to someone else: William P. Barr. On the first day of his confirmation hearing nearly five months ago, Barr was asked by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) about former FBI director James B. Comey’s July 2016 news conference on the decision not to indict Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Here is what Barr said in January: “I thought that to the extent [Comey] actually announced a decision was wrong, and the other thing is, if you’re not going to indict someone, then you don’t stand up there and unload negative information about the person. That’s not the way the Department of Justice does business.”

Barr has now directly contradicted what he told the Senate. Why?

[Barr tried to exonerate Trump. That’s not how the special counsel rules work.]

The answer has to do with how Barr backed himself into a corner when he cleared Trump of obstruction of justice. Barr was criticized resoundingly for reaching such a determination within 48 hours of receiving Mueller’s report (which was more than 400 pages long). Barr tried to defend himself by explaining that he had had time to evaluate everything because Mueller had told him in a meeting three weeks beforehand that he wasn’t going to reach a decision on obstruction of justice. This has always been a strange claim — that Barr was evaluating the evidence without the report in his hand — but now it gets absurd.

If Barr thought Mueller could have reached a decision on obstruction of justice, did he tell Mueller that when they met in March? Wouldn’t that have literally been Barr’s job, as the supervisor of the special counsel? Instead, he revealed his views only later — and contradicted his earlier position that prosecutors cannot “unload negative information about a person” and that that is not how the “Department of Justice does business.”

Barr’s position, as he described it on CBS, is absurd on its face. Imagine the outcry if Mueller were to have done what Barr now claims he could have done: Mueller would be labeling Trump a criminal, but Trump would have no legal process to defend himself. Folks — including me — would scream about the unfairness of such an outcome. Mueller was faithful to long-standing Justice Department considerations about being fair to potential defendants; Barr, by contrast, appears to be lurching from one bad position to the next.

Barr has thrown himself in with Trump in ways unbecoming to the nation’s highest legal official. His conduct in trying to clear Trump is of a piece with his baseless attacks on “spying” by the FBI and his defiance of Congress’s subpoenas. The president already has a White House counsel, who defends the institution of the presidency, as well as a private legal team. Unlike other Cabinet officers at the founding who were susceptible to direct presidential control, the attorney general has been understood to serve the interests of the law, not of the president who put him there. But right now, U.S. taxpayers who pay Barr’s salary are also funding Trump’s legal defense team, and they lack a government official who represents them.

[Barr is wrong: Obstruction of justice doesn’t require another underlying crime]

The only way forward is for Congress to carry out a thorough investigation and reach its own conclusions. Call it an impeachment inquiry if you wish; nothing turns on the name. But a Congress that spent years investigating Benghazi surely should spend an equivalent amount of time and energy investigating potential wrongdoing by the president of the United States. Trump and Barr both insist that he has been cleared, but that’s not what more than 1,000 former federal prosecutors who read the Mueller report say: The evidence described in the report would lead to an indictment of anyone else in the country. If that’s right, we simply cannot have a president who remains in office because of a technicality. If that’s wrong, then let’s get the answer and give Trump an opportunity to clear his name.

Barr’s attempt to clear the president is meaningless. It makes him look willing to say anything and do anything to protect his boss. If Barr wants to keep defending Trump, he should take a page from one of his predecessors, Henry Stanbery, who stepped down as attorney general to serve as President Andrew Johnson’s impeachment counsel. Stanbery, notably, tried to come back as attorney general after the impeachment proceedings concluded. The Senate did not confirm him.

The American people deserve an answer about whether the president obstructed justice. Mueller did not answer that question. Barr tried to. While ordinarily the word of an attorney general should carry much weight, it is difficult, if not impossible, to extend those norms to this situation. Barr has shown himself to be an unreliable and unsteady voice, careening from one position to the next, always in favor of protecting his boss. And even had Barr acted without such partisanship, the whole point of the idea that a sitting president cannot be indicted is that there is an alternative forum to review those questions.

Mueller, pointedly, noted in his news conference last week that the Justice Department opinion barring the indictment of a sitting president says that “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.” Everyone knew what other process Mueller meant. Congress is going to have to provide the answers.

"Schiff says impeachment 'is destined for failure,' calls GOP 'cult of the president's personality'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-calls-gop-the-cult-of-the-presidents-personality-hints-potential-impeachment-could-fail-without-their-support,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""is destined for failure"" without Republican support, while blasting the party as “the cult of the president’s personality"" and stating that he is actually against ""putting the country"" through impeachment proceedings.

Schiff, on ABC News’ “This Week,” said that while he believes House Democrats could impeach the president, the move would likely fail, due to a lack of support from Republicans in the House and Senate.

NADLER: THERE 'CERTAINLY IS' JUSTIFICATION TO IMPEACH TRUMP

""I think we're going to do what is right for the country, and at this point, the speaker has not reached the conclusion, and I haven't either that it's the best for the country to put us through an impeachment proceeding that we know will, is, destined for failure in the Senate,"" Schiff said.

Schiff added that the president's ""conduct qualifies"" as ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" but said: ""at the same time, we have to recognize that the reality — that one party, the Republican Party, has turned itself into the cult of the president’s personality and is not likely to act consistent with its constitutional obligations.""

Schiff added, however, that if Trump ""continues to stonewall"" Congress, and ""demonstrate his unfitness for office,"" congressional Democrats could move forward.

""There may be little additional cost to going through that process, even if unsuccessful in the Senate,"" Schiff said. ""But we're not there yet and I think if it is a close call, close calls go against putting the country through that.""

Schiff’s comments come as rank-and-file congressional Democrats have ramped up their calls for impeachment, following a rare public statement by Special Counsel Robert Mueller last week, who announced it was “not an option” for his team of prosecutors to charge the president with a crime due to longstanding Justice Department policy.

Mueller detailed the findings in his probe, maintaining that there was “not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” with regard to whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.

But Mueller did not mince words on his inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice.

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”

Mueller explained the longstanding Justice Department policy, which states that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, and thus said “charging the president was not an option we could consider.”

Mueller added that “it would be unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”

TRUMP BLASTS MUELLER AS 'HIGHLY CONFLICTED,' CALLS IMPEACHMENT A 'DIRTY, FILTHY, DISGUSTING WORD'

But Mueller said that while the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion blocks a president from indictment while in office, “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing.”

Some on the left took that comment as a green light to ramp up talks about impeachment proceedings against the president.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also compared Mueller's remarks to an ""impeachment referral,"" and said, ""We need to start impeachment proceedings. It's our constitutional obligation.""

Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who is also running for president, said now that Mueller's job is done, ""Impeachment hearings should begin tomorrow.""



House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose committee would oversee impeachment proceedings, said that there ""certainly is"" justification to begin impeachment, but said it was critical to first gain the support fo the American people.

“Impeachment is a political act, and you cannot impeach a president if the American people will not support it,” said Nadler, D-N.Y. “The American people, right now, do not support it because they do not know the story. They don’t know the facts.”

Nadler added: “We have to get the facts out. We have to hold a series of hearings, we have to hold the investigations.”

But despite growing calls from rank-and-file Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has tread lightly on the topic, vowing to investigate allegations against the president, but stopping short of calling to begin impeachment proceedings.

Pelosi, this week, also said that Democrats “want to do what’s right and what gets results.”

“We’re legislating, we’re investigating and we’re litigating,” Pelosi said. “Everybody wants justice, everybody wants the president to be held accountable.”

But House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., despite Pelosi’s resistance to the idea, said Sunday he feels Democrats have “already begun” impeachment proceedings.

“We’ve got all these committees doing their work, we’re having hearings, we’ve already won two court cases and there are other cases that are still to be determined, so why should we get out in front of this process?” Clyburn said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“It’s kind of interesting to me when you talk to people and ask them what they think we ought to do,” he added. “They agree with what we’re doing, it’s just that, emotionally, they would like to see something done and see it done quicker.”

Trump, though, blasted the idea as a “scam.”

“I don’t see how they can,” Trump said Thursday. “It’s a dirty, filthy, disgusting word, impeach. It’s high crimes – there was no high crime. So how do you impeach?”

The White House also has ignored the discussion, and seized only on Mueller's move to announce the official conclusion of the Russia probe. Mueller, last week, said the investigation was officially complete, his office would close, and said he was resigning from the Justice Department to return to private life.

But even without launching official impeachment proceedings, congressional Democrats are leading several high-profile Trump-focused investigations. The House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee potential impeachment proceedings, is investigating the administration’s handling of Mueller’s report, and even voted to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena requiring that he turn over an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, and its underlying evidence and documents. The president, in turn, asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee, Oversight Committee, Ways and Means Committee and Financial Services Committee are all investigating the president and have aggressively sought his financial statements and documents for their probes, as well as testimony from high-profile Trump administration officials.

Thus far, the White House has directed the officials to defy their subpoenas to appear before Congress, and the president has vowed to block “all” subpoenas.

But Republicans, like House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., are shifting their focus to Barr’s review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Barr appointed U.S. attorney from Connecticut John Durham to lead an investigation into the FBI’s original Russia probe, and alleged misconduct related to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, as well as the FBI’s use of informants against the Trump campaign in 2016.

“It’s time for us to find out how this started and go from there,” Collins said on “Fox News Sunday.”"

""Over the decades that followed, the United States hoped that China’s integration into the international system would lead to a more open, tolerant society. Those hopes have been dashed,"" Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement.

Pompeo's statement calls out China's ""new wave of abuses,"" including the the detention of Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang at so-called re-education camps.

Foreign experts estimate as many as 1 million Muslims have been placed into the programs, which Chinese officials likened to ""boarding schools,"" according to The New York Times.

""Even as the party builds a powerful surveillance state, ordinary Chinese citizens continue to seek to exercise their human rights, organize independent unions, pursue justice through the legal system, and simply express their views, for which many are punished, jailed, and even tortured,"" Pompeo said in his Monday statement.

Pompeo also urged the Chinese government to make a ""full, public accounting"" of those killed or missing.

During the June 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, protesters seeking social freedom were forcibly suppressed. Pompeo called the protesters ""heroes"" who inspired future generations to call for freedom and democracy around the world.

Oracle Accuses Amazon Of Courting Former Employee Involved In A $10 Billion DOD Program,https://dailycaller.com,"['Chris White', 'Energy Reporter']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/03/amazon-department-of-defense/,"Amazon made a highly lucrative job offer to a former employee while the man was leading a $10 billion winner-take-all cloud computing contract with the government, according to court documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Computing giant Oracle alleged in the May 31 complaint that former Department of Defense official Deap Ubhi was offered shares in Amazon and a salary with the big tech giant while he was finding a company to help build out the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract.

“AWS (during JEDI and with full knowledge made a hidden job offer to Ubhi, to include a massive [redacted] immediate signing bonus payment, a second [redacted] bonus payment after year one, [redacted} shares of Amazon stock (roughly $950-$960 per share in the relevant period), and a [redacted] salary,” the court document notes, referring to Amazon Web Services, one of the companies vying for the contract.

The document added: “AWS offered a former Amazon employee actively running DoD’s $10 billion JEDI procurement nearly [redacted] dollars in cash and stock during a live procurement, not to mention a substantial salary.” (RELATED: Trump’s Acting DOD Secretary Weighs In On A Cloud Contract Conservatives Loathe)

Ubhi never recused himself, according to the document. Instead, “he spent weeks as a DoD official, downloading the JEDI Google drive to his laptop, meeting with AWS competitors as a DoD official, requesting and participating cloud meetings … and obtaining submissions from JEDI competitors,” Oracle notes in its document.

The filing comes several months after Oracle file a similar lawsuit in December 2018 noting Ubhi’s past employment with Amazon, which stands to be one of two potential winners of JEDI, a cloud computing infrastructure for the U.S. military. Oracle’s lawsuit is an attempt to block the contract until further investigation.

Ubhi openly praised Amazon on Twitter while he was working with the DOD, media reports show. “Once an Amazonian, always an Amazonian. Proud today. Thank you, @JeffBezos,” Ubhi tweeted in January 2017, referencing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’s opposition to President Donald Trump’s border wall.

The former DOD official left the government in late 2017. He now works with AWS.

Oracle and IBM have tried to overturn the single-award approach even. They argue that such a contract would force the Pentagon to pay billions of dollars to one company, while losing out on innovations from other companies down the supply chain. Conservatives have made similar arguments in the past.

“A contract of this magnitude should not be awarded as a sole source contract,” conservative groups wrote in a May 16 letter to Russell Vought, the acting director for the Office of Management and Budget. Citizens Against Government Waste and The American Conservative Union were among several groups that signed the letter.

It has become controversial among Republican lawmakers as well.

Reps. Steve Womack of Arkansas and Tom Cole of Oklahoma, for instance, requested a probe in October 2018 into the Pentagon’s handling of the deal. This came after TheDCNF reported that an adviser to former Secretary of Defense James Mattis once consulted for Amazon Web Services through her firm.

Both Amazon and DOJ refused to provide a comment to TheDCNF, citing ongoing litigation.

Facebook tumbles on antitrust concerns,https://www.cnbc.com,['Lauren Feiner'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/03/amazon-facebook-and-google-stocks-stumble-over-antitrust-concerns.html,"Facebook shares tumbled 7.5% Monday following a Wall Street Journal report that said the FTC will be able to examine the effect of Facebook's practices on digital competition.

Facebook's drop shaved more than $38 billion from its market cap, bringing it to about $469 billion. Facebook is already under investigation by the FTC over its handling of user data and has said it is expecting a fine of up to $5 billion.

Shares of other tech giants took a hit over similar concerns. Amazon's stock fell 4.6% Monday following a Washington Post report that the top U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies have a new agreement on tech oversight. The drop shaved more than $40 billion from its market cap, bringing it to $833 billion.

And shares of Google parent company Alphabet were down 6.1% after the Journal reported Friday that the Justice Department is readying an antitrust investigation of Google. The stock lost about $47 billion from its market cap, bringing it to about $721 billion.

Antitrust regulation has remained a distant threat in recent years as scandals like Cambridge Analytica brought the scale of tech power into focus for the public. In the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, ""break up big tech"" has become a rallying cry for some, including Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

But a new reported agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice brings that threat a bit closer to reality. The FTC will take the lead on oversight of Amazon, while the DOJ will have greater jurisdiction over Google, according to the Post. The FTC previously closed an investigation of Google without taking action, but now the DOJ will take another look into Google's practices in search and other areas, according to the Journal.

The question relates to the 2020 census ahead of the presidential election and seeks to ask whether all members of a household are U.S. citizens. During an appearance on ""America's Newsroom"" on Monday morning, Napolitano argued that the majority conservative Supreme Court will likely rule in favor of the question.

""The government's argument is that we need to know where people are living who are entitled to government benefits and not entitled to government benefits so we can allocate government resources,"" Napolitano said.

""The fear is that people will answer incorrectly and there will be an undercount of human beings and therefore an under -allocation of federal benefits and federal resources,"" he continued.

""The other fear is that people will not answer correctly for fear they will be deported or otherwise incarcerated if they are living but technically overstaying a visa or in violation of some other law.""

It's unclear when exactly the Supreme Court will rule on the citizenship question, but Napolitano said it will have to be soon, as census forms need to be printed well in advance.

Oral arguments were presented several weeks ago, with the government's position seeming ""to have captured a majority view,"" Napolitano said.

"House Dems to vote on holding Barr, McGahn in contempt, seeking to keep Mueller spotlight alive",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-democrats-barr-mcgahn-contempt-mueller-spotlight,"The Democrat-led House of Representatives is set to vote next week on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with congressional subpoenas, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced Monday.

Republicans repeatedly have countered that federal law protecting secretive grand-jury information would prevent Barr from turning over Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. In a rare public statement last week, Mueller specifically remarked, ""I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith"" in deciding to make the report ""largely public.""

As for McGahn, the White House has instructed its former top lawyer not to testify, saying he is legally immune from being compelled to testify about privileged discussions in the course of his official duties. Democrats have responded that McGahn waived that privilege by agreeing to speak to Mueller.

Trump did not assert executive privilege to shield any aspect of the Mueller report itself, and has derided Democrats' efforts as politically motivated attempts to keep what he's called the ""Russia collusion hoax"" alive -- and to distract from, or derail, Barr's own ongoing probes into Justice Department and FBI misconduct.

ANALYSIS: BARR DETERMINED TO FIND TRUTH BEHIND RUSSIA PROBE ORIGINS, LIES AND SMEARS

News of the planned contempt vote came days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation. Last month, Barr appointed U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham to lead the investigation, which is to focus on the use of FBI informants and the alleged improper issuance of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to monitor a variety of individuals, including former Trump aide Carter Page.

But, Hoyer, D-Md., said in a statement that the Trump administration's ""systematic refusal to provide Congress with answers and cooperate with Congressional subpoenas is the biggest cover-up in American history, and Congress has a responsibility to provide oversight on behalf of the American people.""

The vote would be historic, but not unprecedented. In 2012, the GOP-controlled House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for failing to comply with investigations into the Obama administration's failed gun-running sting operation known as ""Fast and Furious."" Holder became the first-ever sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress in that manner.

BARR TEASES PELOSI ON CONTEMPT POSSIBILITY: 'DID YOU BRING YOUR HANDCUFFS?'

The resolution scheduled for a June 11 floor vote would allow the Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement of its subpoenas in federal court, Hoyer said. The House Judiciary Committee voted last month to hold Barr in contempt after he refused to turn over an unredacted version of Mueller's report.

Such an approach would rule out so-called ""inherent contempt,"" a process in which Congress technically can enforce contempt citations on its own -- whether by arrest or fine. In May, Barr reportedly joked about that possibility with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, asking, ""Did you bring your handcuffs?""

""We're really doing this?"" Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw asked Monday on Twitter, responding to the news. ""We’re all supposed to just ignore the fact that Barr is bound by federal law to protect grand jury information? Are we pretending there might be some bombshell hidden in there? This is dishonest politics meant to discredit Barr.""

The move came as Democrats have faced increased pressure from some of their members to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump. Some Democrats at a leadership meeting late Monday indicated they welcomed the contempt vote, according to people familiar with the private session, though it's unlikely to reduce calls for impeachment hearings against Trump.

NUNES CALLS MUELLER REPORT A 'FRAUD' AFTER COURT FILING REVEALS MUELLER TEAM SELECTIVELY EDITED KEY VOICEMAIL CONVERSATION BETWEEN TRUMP'S LEGAL TEAM AND FLYNN'S LAWYER

More than 40 House Democrats have called on House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., to start impeachment proceedings, which would make it easier for them to compel document production and testimony. But Pelosi so far has rejected that option, publiclly preferring a more methodical approach to investigating the president.

As part of that effort, Nadler said Monday that his panel will hold a series of hearings on ""the alleged crimes and other misconduct"" in Mueller's report, starting with a hearing June 10, the day before the planned contempt votes, on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice. The hearing is to feature John Dean, who was White House counsel for President Richard Nixon, and former U.S. attorneys.

The hearings are expected to serve as a stand-in of sorts for Mueller himself, who made clear in public comments last week that he did not want to appear before Congress and would not elaborate on the contents of his report if he were forced to testify. Democrats have suggested they would compel Mueller's appearance if necessary, but it's unclear when — or if — that would happen. Negotiations over Mueller's testimony were ongoing.

In the meantime, Democrats have been searching for ways to keep the spotlight fixed on Mueller's investigation — a challenge compounded by the White House's refusal to comply with requests for documents and testimony related to the report, which has stymied their investigations.

Mueller wrote that found no proof that the Trump team conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 elections, despite multiple overtures from Russian-affiliated individuals to the campaign. Mueller also investigated whether Trump tried to obstruct his investigation, but the report reached no conclusion on whether the president acted illegally.

Nadler said in a statement that Mueller ""has now left Congress to pick up where he left off.""

The special counsel reiterated in his remarks that, bound by Justice Department policy, charging a sitting president with a crime was ""not an option."" But, he also stressed he could not exonerate Trump. Instead, he said, ""The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system.""

In a statement after Mueller's remarks, a spokesperson said the special counsel did not mean to contradict Barr's previous statement on the matter. Barr had said Mueller repeatedly assured him he was not saying that, ""but for"" Justice Department policy, ""he would have found that the president obstructed justice.""

Republicans criticized the decision to hold hearings, with North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows calling the move ""another openly desperate move to resuscitate a dead collusion conspiracy.""

""Thank goodness the Democrats are calling 'Watergate Star' John Dean to testify,"" Meadows tweeted sarcastically.

Dean ultimately cooperated with prosecutors and helped bring down Nixon's presidency, though he served a prison term for obstruction of justice.

DEMS RAMP UP CALLS FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT AFTER MUELLER SPEAKS OUT ON RUSSIA PROBE

“I think we’ve already begun,” Clyburn said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" “We’ve got all of these committees doing their work, we’re having hearings.”

He added: “We do believe that if we sufficiently, effectively educate the public, then we will have done our jobs, and we can move on an impeachment vote and it will stand, and maybe it will be what needs to be done to incent the Senate to act.""

Last week’s public statement from Robert Mueller, the special counsel who led the Russia investigation, emphasizing that his report did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice accusations has triggered an avalanche of calls from Democrats to begin impeachment.

In a radio interview last week, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., whose committee would lead impeachment proceedings, said “there certainly is” justification for Congress to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, but said it was critical for the American public to be on board before launching the process.

NADLER: THERE ‘CERTAINLY’ IS JUSTIFICATION TO IMPEACH TRUMP

“Impeachment is a political act, and you cannot impeach a president if the American people will not support it,” Nadler said Friday. “The American people, right now, do not support it because they do not know the story. They don’t know the facts.”

Mueller's statement has put renewed pressure on Pelosi, who has resisted the calls and questioned the political wisdom of moving forward. During a speech at the California Democratic Party's convention on Saturday, Pelosi was greeted with “impeach” chants from liberal activists. Pelosi has been non-committal about impeachment and said last week, ""Many constituents want to impeach the president. But we want to do what is right and what gets results.""

Despite the momentum, Democrats, even with their congressional majority, still appear to have some work to do in convincing their own party. A New York Times tally says 54 House Democrats support impeachment, 58 do not support it and 123 have not committed. Michigan Rep. Justin Amash is the only House Republican to support impeachment. It takes just a simple majority of the House to impeach.

However, even if they impeach, Democrats do not appear to have the votes in the Senate – where a super majority is required and Republicans have control – to remove Trump from office.

Other top House Democrats, though, are acknowledging the long odds of success.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week” that impeachment ""is destined for failure.""

SCHIFF SAYS IMPEACHMENT 'IS DESTINED FOR FAILURE'

""I think we're going to do what is right for the country, and at this point, the speaker has not reached the conclusion, and I haven't either, that it's the best for the country to put us through an impeachment proceeding that we know will, is, destined for failure in the Senate,"" Schiff said.

The momentum inside the party comes as Trump is overseas. On Monday, he met with Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family at Buckingham Palace amid D-Day commemoration ceremonies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president ripped into Democrats for focusing on impeachment, saying Congress needs to focus on other issues, involving the border, drug prices and infrastructure.

“Democrats can’t impeach a Republican President for crimes committed by Democrats,” the president tweeted, dismissing the Mueller probe as a “witch hunt.”

2 more Alabama cities selected for Department of Justice violent crime initiative,https://www.al.com,"['Carol Robinson', 'Crobinson Al.Com']",06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/06/2-more-alabama-cities-selected-for-department-of-justice-violent-crime-initiative.html,"Two more Alabama cities have been selected to take part in a Department of Justice initiative aimed at reducing violent crime nationwide.

The National Public Safety Partnership was launched in 2017 in response to President Trump's directive to reduce crime and improve public safety. Then- Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the National Public Safety Partnership, an alliance of local and federal law enforcement agencies coordinating with community organizations to reduce violent crime in areas long plagued by it. The Attorney General selected Birmingham as one of the initial 12 PSP sites.

On Monday, Attorney General William P. Barr announced 10 more cities, including Anniston and Oxford. To be considered for selection, a site must have sustained levels of violence that far exceed the national average and demonstrate a commitment to reducing crime. Cities must also display compliance with federal immigration requirements.

In addition to Anniston, and Oxford, other sites announced Monday are: Anchorage, Alaska; Davenport, Iowa; Wichita, Kansas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio, Amarillo, Texas and Harris County, Texas.

In a DOJ press release, Barr said the Public Safety Partnership provides a framework for enhancing federal support of state, local and tribal law enforcement officials and prosecutors as they aggressively investigate and pursue violent criminals, specifically those involved in gun crime, drug trafficking and gang violence.

“The Public Safety Partnership is a successful program that directs federal law enforcement resources to the cities where they can have the greatest impact,"" Barr said in a prepared statement. ""These resources help police departments to diagnose where crime is highest—and why—and to find, arrest and prosecute criminals. Several participating cities have already seen dramatic reductions in violent crime over the past two years. As we expand this program to 10 more cities across America, we are determined to replicate that success.”

Birmingham's Public Safety Partnership building alliances for safer communities The task force has been instrumental in identifying the worst violent offenders in the area for arrest and prosecution.

Northern District of Alabama U.S. Attorney Jay Town said the partnership provides data-drive resources to assist law enforcement in removing the habitual offenders from the southeast side of the northern district. ““Our collective goal is simply to reduce crime, especially violent crime, in Anniston, Oxford, and surrounding areas. My office, local and federal law enforcement, and the Department of Justice are fully committed to facilitating the strategies, training, and technical assistance to do just that,’’ Town said. “We have prison beds already reserved for the alpha criminals in Calhoun County…and we are coming.”

To be considered for selection, a site must have sustained levels of violence that far exceed the national average and demonstrate a commitment to reducing crime. Cities must also display compliance with federal immigration requirements.

More than 30 cities have taken part in the Public Safety Partnership. The primary participating Justice Department components include the Office of Justice Programs, Office on Violence Against Women, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, FBI, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Marshals Service.

“We are excited to have the DOJ working with us in conjunction with the East Metro Area Crime Center to reduce gun crimes in our region and to reduce overall crime,’’ said Oxford Police Chief Bill Partridge. “This will help the entire region in reducing crime.”"
VA whistleblower says there’s a secret wait list for veterans' care,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues', 'June At Am']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whistleblower-says-theres-a-secret-va-wait-list-for-care-the-department-says-thats-not-true/2019/06/01/197e59a2-83df-11e9-bce7-40b4105f7ca0_story.html,"President during the swearing-in ceremony for Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie last year. A whistleblower has accused VA of having a secret wait list. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Columnist

Jereme P. Whiteman rose quickly through the Department of Veterans Affairs, reaching the top grade on the main employee classification scale in only seven years.

But his future within VA appears stymied. He’s become a rebel within the department’s establishment — a whistleblower who says the scandals that shamed the department during the Obama administration haven’t stopped.

Whiteman, VA’s national director of clinic practice management and a onetime Marine, has accused the department under President Trump of having “a secret VA wait list” for veterans seeking health care.

It’s starkly reminiscent of the tsunami-level scandal that broke in 2014 over the coverup of long patient wait times. That coverup included falsifying records to indicate the wait for medical service was shorter than it really was. Congress went ballistic, and the controversy drove then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, a former Army general and chief of staff, from office.

Whiteman said figures from internal reports indicate the actual number of veterans waiting for VA health care could be much higher than the numbers VA makes publicly available. Whiteman provided copies of the internal reports to The Washington Post.

From May 1, 2018, through May 1, 2019, the monthly average on the department’s public electronic wait list (EWL) was 14,971. During that period, the monthly average on the internal electronic wait list was 44,478.

In an email Wednesday night to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, Whiteman said that “I discovered a secret VA wait list” in September and that “the agency has taken steps to conceal this wait list from the public.” He warned Wilkie that this could hurt the agency “unless swift actions are taken to properly address my concerns.”

Through its Veterans Health Administration, the department runs 1,250 health-care facilities, serving 9 million veterans annually.

VA press secretary Curt Cashour said Whiteman’s allegations are false. Cashour said VA’s electronic wait list has two components — clinical and administrative.

He said the clinical list — the public list — tracks the number of veterans waiting for medical treatment.

Of the other list, he said that “the administrative component of the EWL has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment and tracks routine actions, such as facility and provider transfer requests.”

[VA is gearing up for a massive shift of health care to the private sector. But Democrats are fighting back.]

Cashour said VA does not publicly post the administrative component of the EWL, “because it has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment and would only create confusion.”

Whiteman punched back, telling Wilkie that Cashour’s statement to The Post was “incredibly disingenuous.” Whiteman said any veteran waiting for treatment should be included on the public list, including veterans waiting for VA-funded care by private providers or veterans waiting to be transferred to another facility.

Unlike many federal whistleblowers, Whiteman went public while still on the job. Whiteman went through his chain of command months before becoming frustrated and contacting The Post’s Federal Insider.

Whiteman, 39, said he rose to GS-15, the top of the General Schedule, last year after just seven years as a federal civilian, all with VA. The Temple Hills, Md., resident started as a GS-7, doing pharmacy billing.

Before joining VA, he was a Marine for eight years, leaving as a staff sergeant working on jet weapons systems. His pride in that service is evident from his glass-enclosed uniform displayed on his office wall, along with other Marine and family decorations in his windowless spot on the eighth floor of VA’s Central Office, across Lafayette Square from the White House.

In a September email to his boss, Susan Kirsh, the acting assistant deputy undersecretary for health for access to care, and her boss, Steven L. Lieberman, VA’s acting principal deputy undersecretary for health, Whiteman said the discrepancies in public and internal wait-list numbers “could be seen as VA hiding a very large wait list of Veterans waiting extremely long for care.”

Whiteman was so disappointed in the way leadership handled his concerns that he filed a verbal complaint, under oath, about the discrepancies with the department’s Office of the Medical Inspector. He asked the office to investigate circumstances for patients who died while on the wait list to determine whether the deaths were connected to wait times.

Cashour said the medical inspector’s office found the allegations unsubstantiated. In the email to Wilkie, however, Whiteman said the medical inspector never followed up with him beyond his initial statement.

Whiteman has filed official complaints charging VA with retaliation against him because of his whistleblowing.

In an April 27 email, Whiteman told VA’s whistleblower protection office that one example of retribution followed the successful deployment of a text-message reminder system that led to a significant reduction in the number of missed medical appointments, saving an estimated $112 million annually.

“I lead a team of four VA employees on this project,” he wrote in an email to the whistleblower office. “I was the only one of the four who did not get an award for this project. I believe this was retaliation for my Whistleblower activity.”

Cashour said the department does not tolerate retaliation, but he did not comment on this allegation.

[VA security staff compromised safety and Shulkin violated ethics rules, oversight report says]

Whiteman also filed a retaliation complaint in an April 29 email to the Office of Special Counsel. This independent federal office protects federal whistleblowers. Despite the name, it is not led by or related to Robert S. Mueller III, who led a special-counsel investigation of Russia’s actions in support of Trump’s candidacy.

Although Whiteman is a GS-15, his email to the special-counsel office said he was subjected to “numerous undesirable work assignments” from Kirsh, including “reporting to a lower grade GS-11 employee. . . . I find this degrading and humiliating, yet I do the work as directed.”

Cashour said, “Whiteman has always reported to someone above the GS-15 level.” Whiteman said that is on paper, not in reality.

Married and the father of five, Whiteman plans to remain at VA, considering it the best place in the federal government for him as a health-care administrator. But his work life is no longer the same.

“It’s well known within headquarters that I am whistleblowing,” he said. “And I see it when I walk down the halls. People, you know, don’t look at me. They don’t make eye contact with me.”

Because of his disclosures, “there’s no more upward mobility for me at this point.” Whiteman said. “I consider myself probably stalled.”"
"Trump's U.K. visit: What you need to know, from royal ceremony to protests in London",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kim Hjelmgaard', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/06/03/president-trumps-state-visit-britain-queen-elizabeth-ii-royal-family/1284000001/,"LONDON – President Donald Trump arrived in the United Kingdom on Monday for several days of pomp and ceremony. Here's your crib sheet.

What's happening?

Trump is in the United Kingdom for a three-day state visit. A state visit is one that formally comes at the invitation of the British monarch: Queen Elizabeth II. It means that there will be an emphasis on ritualized ceremony, including banquets at the queen’s lavish London pile Buckingham Palace, wreath-laying to honor Britain’s military dead, gun salutes fired from the Tower of London and other grand displays of decorum essentially showing through soft power how Britain can be the host with the most.

Still, while the queen sent the invitation and will feature prominently in the visit along with other members of the royal family, she did so at the request of the British government, meaning it won’t be all testimonial readings and charming musical performances. There will be serious talks on defense, investment, security and trade.

Why does it matter?

For a start, while the queen has hosted 152 state visits since becoming monarch in 1952, and met 11 of 12 sitting U.S. presidents over the last 67 years – her majesty’s royal path never crossed with Lyndon B. Johnson – only two U.S. presidents have made state visits to Britain: George W. Bush in 2003 and Barack Obama in 2011. Trump is being accorded a special honor when he arrives June 3.

However, the visit is important for reasons that go beyond ceremonial affairs. Political scientists say it’s about reaffirming the so-called special relationship between two of the world’s closest allies who have deep cultural, economic and political ties, but who haven’t always seen eye-to-eye since Trump came to power vowing to pursue a more unilateralist foreign policy. Areas of disagreement have included Trump’s Muslim travel ban, his talking down of the NATO military alliance and U.S. exits from the climate and Iran nuclear accords. There's also difference of opinion about China, in particular what type of relationship to maintain with Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Washington thinks the company is a massive national security threat; London has a more relaxed view.

The visit also comes as Britain is mired in a weeks-long process to pick a new prime minister after Theresa May said she would vacate the role on June 7 over her handling of Britain’s impending exit from the European Union, known as Brexit.

""If we get a new prime minister who the president can relate to then things might run more smoothly, especially if May's successor allows us to crash out of the EU and comes begging for a trade deal with the USA,"" said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary, University of London, referring to the possibility of a ""no-deal"" Brexit.

Ahead of his arrival, Trump told British tabloid newspaper The Sun that he was backing U.S.-born politician Boris Johnson to be the next prime minister. He also said that his friend Nigel Farage should be involved in negotiations to leave the EU.

Who's coming with Trump?

Aside from the normal retinue of senior advisers and administration officials, a large portion of the Trump family, according to the New York Times. The outlet has reported that along with First Lady Melania Trump, the president will fly over his children, including Donald Jr, 41; Ivanka, 37; Eric, 35; and Tiffany, 25. It is not yet known whether Trump’s youngest son Baron, 13, will also make the transatlantic trip. The White House would not comment on which members of Trump's family would be accompanying him.

Still, if the Trump family does form part of the president's entourage they would be expected to attend the banquet dinner at Buckingham Palace on Monday evening. On the British side, the dinner will be attended by outgoing Prime Minister May, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Prominent British public figures and Americans living in Britain will also be there. The queen and Trump are both expected to make speeches at the start of the banquet.

What will he be doing?

In addition to taking part in bilateral meetings with May, and the dinner banquet, there will be a private lunch with the queen; a visit to an exhibition showcasing items that Britain's foreign office has called of ""historical significance to the United States""; tea with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall; a chance to inspect Britain’s military Guard of Honor; a tour of Westminster Abbey (famous site of many coronations and royal weddings); and a breakfast meeting with senior American and British business leaders.

On Wednesday, Trump will participate in commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. This event will take place in Portsmouth, on Britain’s south coast. It will include a fly-past with 25 modern and historical aircraft. Since Trump is known to like a good parade and military fanfare, Wednesday should be a good day for him.

""I hope President Trump appreciates the full sweep of history when he visits ... Portsmouth ... that European unity is very much an American project; that Europeans' prosperity and security are interlinked with America’s ... and that this is a project that needs America’s support,"" said Heather Conley, an expert on foreign affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.

What kind of reception can he expect?

In short: protests.

Over half of Londoners are opposed to Trump's visit to Britain's capital,

according to a recent poll by research firm YouGov and Queen Mary, University of London. Although nationwide: 46% to 40% think the visit should go ahead.

When Trump visited London last year as part of an ordinary working visit an estimated 250,000 people protested on the streets of central London. Anti-Trump activists who oppose his divisive policies from immigration to abortion rights are planning for similar numbers this time. There will be smaller protests around the country.

And remember Trump baby? The phone-wielding, diaper-wearing inflatable that flew above London when Trump visited in July? The team behind it told USA TODAY that the giant orange blimp will again take to the skies, on Tuesday, in Parliament Square.

British media have reported that Trump's three-day visit will cost British police and security services about $23 million to help keep him safe.

Who's giving Trump the cold shoulder?

London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who Trump has clashed with before, was the subject of two disparaging tweets by the U.S. president on Monday. It came after Khan, London's first Muslim mayor, wrote in an op-ed in British newspaper the Observer that it is ""un-British to roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump.""

Trump tweeted that Khan was ""a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.""

""Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height,"" Trump added.

.@SadiqKhan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly “nasty” to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019

....Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019

Prince Harry will meet Trump at one of the planned lunches. But his wife, the Duchess of Sussex (Meghan Markle), will sit it out. Her name is not on any of the official itineraries. Markle may have decided she would rather stay at home with newborn son Archie. Or perhaps it's the man himself. In 2016, she called him ""misogynistic.""

Trump has denied calling Markle ""nasty"" despite an audio recording of his comments.

New addition: What Prince Harry's, Meghan Markle's new royal baby means to Britain

The president has also not been invited, unlike President Obama, to address Parliament. John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, who makes that decision, has said he is ""strongly opposed"" to Trump addressing British lawmakers.

""Before the imposition of the (Muslim travel ban) I would myself have been strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall,"" Bercow told British parliamentarians in 2017. ""After the imposition of the migrant ban by President Trump I am even more strongly opposed to an address by President Trump in Westminster Hall.""

Bercow said that being invited to address Parliament was ""an earned honor.""

In a speech in Washington last week, Bercow said that over the past two years ""nothing has happened since then to cause me to change my mind.""

What else is the president doing in Europe?

On Wednesday, he will fly to Ireland for a meeting with leader Leo Varadkar. The meeting will take place at Shannon Airport, not Trump's golf club and hotel in Doonbeg, in County Clare, which he will visit later the same day. The White House said that the two leaders will discuss ""a range of bilateral issues"" and ""shared international interests and priorities."" Translation: Trump wants to play golf in his family's ancestral homeland.

The next day, Trump will travel to France for further D-Day commemorations in Normandy. He will visit the Normandy American Cemetery, established by the U.S. First Army in 1944. It is the first American cemetery on European soil and contains the graves of 9,380 American military dead, most of whom lost their lives in D-Day landings.

While in France, Trump will also hold talks with French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron and Trump have enjoyed a ""bromance"" of sorts, filled with awkward embraces, macho handshake and military parades. They also regularly attack each others' politics – Macron for his centrism, Trump for his nationalism – in tweets and speeches.

State Department says it is now requiring social media info from 'most' visa applicants,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/02/politics/state-department-social-media-visa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The State Department has begun requesting ""most"" US visa applicants provide information on their social media accounts, a department official said in a statement.

The move was expected following an announcement in March of last year that outlined plans to require nearly all US visa applicants to submit their social media handles and other information.

The State Department statement over the weekend said the forms for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants had been updated ""to request additional information, including social media identifiers.""

According to the official's statement, the move is a result of a memorandum issued by President Donald Trump in 2017 on ""vetting"" for people coming to the US and a provision of an executive order from around the same time that sought to block entry to the US for people from several majority-Muslim countries, which included a provision on vetting standards.

CNN previously reported that the change was expected to affect around 15 million people.

WASHINGTON—The Justice Department is gearing up for an antitrust investigation of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, a move that could present a major new layer of regulatory scrutiny for the search giant, according to people familiar with the matter.

Meghan Markle isn't Trump's victim and the media are lying,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/meghan-markle-isnt-trumps-victim-and-the-media-are-lying,"Whenever the national media put forth a new victim to rally behind in the name of the #Resistance, you should suspect you’re being lied to.

The latest is Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. President Trump said in a recent interview that he was unaware Meghan had spoken negatively about him during the 2016 campaign.

A journalist for the British Sun tabloid asked Trump on Sunday ahead of his trip to the U.K., “Are you sorry not to see her? Because she wasn’t so nice during the campaign, I don’t know if you saw that.”

Trump, informed Meghan, originally of Los Angeles, would be on maternity leave, replied, “I didn’t know that. No, I hope she’s OK. I did not know that.”

The journalist goaded Trump, telling him, “She said she’d move to Canada if you got elected; turned out she moved to Britain.”

“That will be good,” Trump said. “A lot of people moving here, so what can I say? No, I didn’t know that she was nasty.”

This was boiled down to: Trump calls princess 'nasty'!

Trump had actually added in the interview that “it’s nice” that the United Kingdom now has a princess of American descent and that “she’ll be very good.”

The term “nasty” was used by Trump as a stand-in for the reporter’s original characterization of “wasn’t so nice.”

But you wouldn't know the real story by glancing at the news coverage. Washington Post blogger Eugene Scott said Trump’s “attacks” on Meghan were “familiar and unsurprising,” because his use of the word “nasty” reinforced the belief that Trump “is sexist and misogynistic.” (For the record, here's Trump using the word ""nasty"" to describe Donny Deutsch, David Gregory, Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Charles Krauthammer, to name a few men.)

See, if you just put forth a claim, whether merited or not, and assert, like Scott, that it’s “rooted” in some belief — any belief! — it becomes true!

Charles Blow, always good for a laugh, acknowledged Sunday in his New York Times column that the question by the Sun journalist was a “set up” for Trump. But Blow knew in his heart that it was a ""set up"" that ""both parties wanted.”

Blow lectured that, “A better journalist, if he or she wanted to have Trump weigh in on [Meghan’s 2016] comments, would simply read Meghan’s response and ask for the president’s response."" These are lessons in journalism coming from Blow, who proudly skipped a face-to-face meeting with Trump in 2017.

And outside of journalism, it’s stupidity not limited to Blow.

ABC analyst Matthew Dowd tweeted that Trump “used the word nasty … in reference to her.”

CBS News correspondent Bill Rehkopf tweeted, “He called her ‘nasty.’”

Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty tweeted, “He actually calls her ‘nasty’ in this audio. That is the exact word he uses.”

Ben White of Politico tweeted, “This is literally exactly what he says. ‘I didn’t know that she was nasty.’”

Well, yes. This is “literally exactly” what Trump said the same way this morning I “literally exactly” said “I’ll kill you.” It turns out I didn’t mean I’d literally kill my editor. I only meant that I didn’t agree with his decision to remove my use of the word “teats” from a piece about Michael Avenatti.

The media do this type of thing freely whenever they need a new victim to post up against Trump. They’ll lie about Trump calling immigrants “animals” (he was explicitly referring to MS-13 gang members).

The EPA says a chemical in Monsanto's weed-killer doesn't cause cancer — but there's compelling evidence the agency is wrong,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/glyphosate-cancer-dangers-roundup-epa-2019-5,"Gardeners Alva and Alberta Pilliod say they used Monsanto's Roundup spray to keep weeds off their driveway for more than two decades, applying the herbicide while wearing flip flops, shorts, and tank tops. Now, they both have Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). In a lawsuit, they were awarded $2.05 billion in damages in May.

School groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, now in his 40s, also used to spray Roundup up to 30 times every summer. He has the same blood cancer as the Pilliods, and won nearly $80 million in a suit last year.

A third man, Edwin Hardeman, used Roundup for more than 25 years to keep weeds off his oak trees. He got NHL, too. A jury in California ruled in March that Roundup was a ""substantial factor"" in his diagnosis.

More than 13,000 similar lawsuits have popped up in the US. Almost all are being filed by gardeners, groundskeepers, and other professional weed-whackers who allege that their consistent, repeated use of Roundup gave them cancer. One of the latest allegations came this week from 44-year-old groundskeeper Jeffrey Sabraski. Sabraski alleges he sprayed Roundup several times per week, wearing nothing but shorts and t-shirts, and has also developed NHL. He's suing Monsanto, as the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on Wednesday.

Roundup is the most widely-used herbicide in the world, and its key chemical is called glyphosate. The plaintiffs in this recent surge of court cases say that Monsanto didn't sufficiently warn them about the potential health risks associated with the product or tell them how to protect themselves from exposure.

But teasing out the health risks of glyphosate isn't easy. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) says the chemical is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the agro-chemical giant Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, both say glyphosate isn't linked to cancer in any meaningful way.

""EPA continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen,"" the agency said on its website. Canadian health authorities support the US' stance.

However, peeling back the curtain on the scientific studies that have looked at glyphosate thus far can tell us a lot about how the chemical can indeed be dangerous when people and animals are exposed to it in the wrong ways.

What Monsanto and the EPA say about glyphosate

Glyphosate, which has been in use around the world since the 1970s, blocks an enzyme pathway that helps plants grow. The herbicide's patent expired in 2000, and Indian and Chinese farmers are now the weed-killer's biggest buyers.

It's tricky for epidemiologists to say conclusively that something causes cancer, so what we know so far — from thousands of studies conducted in rats, mice, and humans — is that the pesticide might be linked with cancer, or it might not. Glyphosate might make cancer more likely to sprout up, since there's evidence it can encourage DNA damage. But more research is still needed to learn how, exactly, it affects the human body.

Monsanto maintains there's no good evidence the chemical causes cancer. The company often points to a 2017 study of more than 54,000 pesticide sprayers in Iowa and North Carolina (mostly farmers), which found no statistically significant association between glyphosate and cancer.

The company also often highlights the results of large-scale studies of French, Norwegian, and North American farmers that have found glyphosate to be safe.

But farmers are largely protected from the dangers of herbicides and pesticides, since they spray fields using industrial-grade farm equipment. In that same study, in fact, chemical sprayers who had the most exposure to glyphosate were found to have a slightly higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than people who'd never used the weed-killer. The difference, however, was so small that more research is needed to confirm these results.

The EPA has also consistently said that consumers have nothing to worry about when it comes to glyphosate.

""In 2017, EPA published comprehensive ecological and human health risk assessments for glyphosate. No human health risks were identified,"" the agency said in April. However, the EPA cautioned that ""potential ecological risks were identified for terrestrial and aquatic plants, birds, and mammals, primarily from exposure to spray drift.""

Humans, of course, are terrestrial mammals, too. And gardeners who use lots of glyphosate — without much protection — would arguably also be exposed to spray drift.

""The evidence is not as strong so as to be absolutely sure"" Manolis Kogevinas, of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, told Business Insider. ""But yeah, there's definitely a chance that they will develop cancer.""

The IARC has a different stance

In March 2015, the IARC convened a group of 17 experts from 11 countries to determine the potential human health dangers of glyphosate, along with four other pesticides and herbicides. The international, non-partisan committee concluded that glyphosate is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans, based on studies in humans and lab animals.

That's why glyphosate is now a ""Group 2A"" carcinogen, according to IARC. That means that the chemical is considered to be a contributor to cancer, but not on the level of more well known cancer-causers like formaldehyde and UV radiation.

But the IARC also has a complicated history with glyphosate research. Reuters reported in 2017 that the agency had cut sections out of a draft report that suggested glyphosate might not contribute to cancer. In a follow-up letter to Congress, IARC director Christopher Wild wrote that the group revised that draft because some of the data came from ""a review article co-authored by a Monsanto scientist.""

He added that the information from that article ""was insufficient for independent evaluation of the individual studies and the conclusions reached by the Monsanto scientist.""

Why these groups came to different conclusions about glyphosate

A tightly reviewed and vetted paper published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe earlier this year looked into why the EPA and IARC appear to disagree about the risks of glyphosate. It found that the EPA's conclusions relied mainly on ""unpublished regulatory studies,"" many of them industry-funded. The IARC, on the other hand, looked at ""mostly peer-reviewed studies.""

That could explain why 99% of the glyphosate studies that the EPA considered found that the chemical is not a cancer-causer, while 70% of the studies the WHO looked at suggested it probably is.

""It's kind of easy to understand why EPA would say, 'Well, geez, you know, it must be okay,'"" study author Charles Benbrook, an agricultural economist who now serves as an expert witness for plaintiffs involved in Roundup litigation, told Business Insider. ""It was okay because they were looking at a bunch of negative studies that Monsanto [did]. Monsanto repeated essentially the same study like 30 times.""

Benbrook alleges that the reason so many big payouts are being won in court is that Monsanto didn't properly warn people who used Roundup at home or on a small scale that they should wear protective clothing when they applied the weed-killer.

""It's not farmers out in the field with their large, modern spray rigs, where the operator is inside a steel and glass cab with a sophisticated air filtration system that essentially eliminates exposure,"" Benbrook said. ""Some people are spraying Roundup 6 or 8 hours a day for five days a week with this kind of handheld equipment.""

Monsanto maintains that as long as consumers follow the instructions on the label, glyphosate-based herbicides are perfectly safe. The company also points to hundreds of glyphosate studies in EPA databases that were not Monsanto-funded.

""At the end of the day, whether you're in the court of law, regulatory agencies, or court of public opinion, it's the science that should matter here,"" a Bayer spokesman said in an email to Business Insider. ""And the extensive body of science over 40 years, including several recent human epidemiology studies, shows that glyphosate-based herbicides are not associated with NHL. Customers who know these products best continue to rely on them.""

The company also points to the courtroom testimony of Robert Phalen, an environmental scientist who testified in the Pilliod's trial that human skin actually repels glyphosate. (Phalen once authored a textbook with another scientist also named Robert Phalen, who has said modern air may be ""a little too clean."")

Monsanto tweaked its Roundup formula in Europe

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pets stay off lawns and plants that have just been sprayed with glyphosate, since animals can develop digestive or intestinal issues if they touch the substance when it hasn't dried. Glyphosate has also recently been linked to more severe cases of fatty liver disease in people.

But beyond glyphosate, there's another compound in Roundup: soap-like detergents called surfactants that help the chemical penetrate the leaves of plants to work its weed-killing magic. Benbrook believes Monsanto should be doing more to warn people about how surfactants work and how to protect themselves.

""It's the surfactants that are carrying the glyphosate first through the skin and inside the body, and then inside of cells where damage can be done to DNA,"" he said.

In Europe, Benbrook noted, surfactant chemicals have been made less toxic for consumers. In the US, however, there's been less regulatory pressure, so Monsanto has not changed Roundup formulas in the same way. ""When juries learn that Monsanto is making a product that's at least 10 times, maybe 100 times safer all across Europe?"" he said. ""That's not acceptable. That's one of the reasons that I think we can expect a continuation of these mammoth punitive damage awards that have occurred in the first three trials.""

Bayer said that allegation is one ""we don't believe is supported by the extensive body of science.""

The company told Business Insider in an email that ""regulators have specifically assessed the safety of the class of surfactants used in glyphosate-based herbicides; in 2009, the U.S. EPA concluded that these surfactants are not carcinogenic.""

The statement added that Monsanto tweaked the surfactants in products sold in Europe ""due to market preferences or country-specific requirements in the region.""

Traces of glyphosate in food don't seem to hurt people

As lawsuits about glyphosate have entered the spotlight, some people have expressed concerns about the trace amounts of the chemical in our food.

The traces of glyphosate found in a bowl of Cheerios or a glass of wine are probably not going to kill anyone, though.

""Using the internationally accepted limits, an average adult male would have to drink over 1,000 liters of wine a day to reach any level of risk,"" pharmacologist Ian Musgrave recently wrote in The Conversation.

That said, it's worth remembering that different people's bodies can react differently to chemicals. The foods pregnant women eat impact how their fetus grows and develops, for example, and the developing digestive systems of infants and toddlers may be more delicate than others. Scientists are still studying how pesticides can impact childhood brain development.

Kogevinas still doesn't think the chemical's presence in food is much to worry about, though.

""If you ask me, is the glyphosate the problem in my food? No, it is not,"" he said. But he noted that he prefers to buy organic produce to avoid pesticides more generally.

Kogevinas lives in Barcelona, where the Roundup formulations adhere to the European standards, but that didn't affect his decision about whether or not to buy it: He has opted never to use glyphosate in his own garden."
State Department now requires U.S. visa applicants to share social media accounts,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-now-requires-us-visa-applicants-to-share-social-media-accounts-2019-06-01/,"The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers. It's a vast expansion of the Trump administration's enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors.

In a move that's just taken effect after approval of the revised application forms, the department says it has updated its immigrant and nonimmigrant visa forms to request the additional information, including ""social media identifiers,"" from almost all U.S. applicants.

The change, which was proposed in March 2018, is expected to affect about 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States each year.

Social media, email and phone number histories had only been sought in the past from applicants who were identified for extra scrutiny, such as people who'd traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations. An estimated 65,000 applicants per year had fallen into that category.

The department says collecting the additional information from more applicants ""will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.""

The new rules apply to virtually all applicants for immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. The department estimated it would affect 710,000 immigrant visa applicants and 14 million nonimmigrant visa applicants, including those who want to come to the U.S. for business or education, according to an initial notice.

The new visa application forms list a number of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and require the applicant to provide any account names they may have had on them over the previous five years. They also give applicants the option to volunteer information about social media accounts on platforms not listed on the form.

In addition to their social media histories, visa applicants are now asked for five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, international travel and deportation status, as well as whether any family members have been involved in terrorist activities.

Only applicants for certain diplomatic and official visa types are exempted from the requirements."

While Tim Cook and other Apple brass were at WWDC 2019 showing off new iOS 13 features and what's coming to the Apple Watch, the Department of Justice was apparently cooking up other plans for the iPhone maker.

The DOJ reportedly has obtained jurisdiction to potentially investigate Apple over antitrust concerns, according to a Reuters report on Monday. This news came just hours after it was reported that the Federal Trade Commission secured rights to investigate Facebook. And this past Friday, the DOJ reportedly began preparing for an antitrust investigation on Google for its search practices and other business activities.

A spokesperson for the DOJ said it's the agency's policy to not confirm, deny, or otherwise comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.

These moves by the Justice Department and FTC comes as Apple and other Silicon Valley giants face renewed antitrust scrutiny in the United States. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, has made it a key part of her platform to break up the big tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Amazon. Earlier this month, Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, also called for the breakup of the company he helped create.

One disabled Massachusetts veteran was denied that benefit, though, due to his legal job in the marijuana industry, according to the Boston Globe.

A 35-year-old veteran spoke to the newspaper anonymously to protect his military relationship, but said he was denied a loan in January because he was an assistant manager of a licensed cannabis store.

“I was actually accomplishing a lifelong goal of mine, and then to have it pulled right out from under you at the 11th hour … I was blown away,” he told the Globe. “It was very frustrating and demoralizing.”

While marijuana is legal and several states, it remains illegal federally. The distinction has created many problems including marijuana companies working with banks to secure loans or establish checking or savings accounts.

Marijuana is legal in Massachusetts, but your boss doesn’t have to allow it -- yet A proposed bill would forbid employers from penalizing or discriminating against an employee for marijuana use outside the office, as long as the employee is not impaired while working.

The veteran, a native of Revere, called his congresswoman, U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark, after being denied the loan, he told the Globe.

Clark’s office, the Globe reported, was told the VA didn’t deem the veteran’s source of income as “stable and reliable.”

Clark vowed to draft a legislative response, however, the veteran remains looking for a home for his wife and two children, and unable to receive a loan he is entitled to as a veteran, he told the Globe."

“The media does a disservice to the American public and sound policy making by not informing the progress we’ve made,” Wheeler said Monday at a luncheon at the National Press Club.

Directing his comments specifically to the reporters present, Wheeler a former energy lobbyist who has overseen various regulatory rollbacks at EPA, said it was the press’ responsibility to change the public perception that energy and environment issues were getting worse, not better, across the country.

“Every year since 2001 Gallup has conducted polling on the same question: Do you think the quality of the environment in the country as a whole is getting better or getting worse? Every year since 2001 more people have said, ‘Getting worse than getting better'” Wheeler said. “We need to fix this perception and we need the help of the press. The public needs to know how far we’ve come as a nation protecting the environment.”

He spoke of the agency’s success, since its establishment nearly half a century ago, in lowering particulate matter in the air and reducing CO2 emissions, listing accomplishments achieved under multiple government administrations.

“You may think I ignore our press clippings. But I don’t, I read them every day,” Wheeler told reporters. “I’ve noticed five things...that the press consistently gets wrong about this administration and the EPA in particular.”

Among them, was criticisms of his lobbying title – he represented more than just the coal industry; comments that a key Obama-era power plant emissions rule was rolled back – “It was never implemented,” he said; and the idea that the EPA is at war with its career staff – “We have a long and dedicated history of dedicated career employees,” Wheeler said.

Wheeler’s criticism of the media came the same day Trump slammed CNN and other media outlets for their coverage of his trip to England to meet Queen Elizabeth II, calling reporting “fake news.” The president went as far Monday as calling for a boycott of AT&T, the parent company of CNN, because of its coverage.

The EPA under Trump has similarly had a fraught relationship with the press. Last year, under Pruitt, a number of outlets were barred from attending a key industry meeting on a cancer-linked chemical. One reporter for the Associated Press was forcefully removed from the event."

Related: Dems Seek Public Comment on T-Mobile-Sprint Conditions

That came in a letter to antitrust chief Makan Delrahim and following a report that while career Justice staffers had recommended denying the deal--which would combine the number three and four wireless carriers--the White House had signaled it liked the deal.

“Since the beginning of this Administration, we have repeatedly raised concerns about reported White House attempts to interfere with the Department of Justice’s antitrust enforcement decision making,” they wrote. “In light of the potential implications of this transaction for American consumers, we write to reiterate that the Department’s decisions should be based on an impartial analysis of the facts and the law, and must be entirely free of improper political influence.”

""This is not the first time that reports have suggested that the White House may have attempted to improperly influence the Department of Justice’s merger review process. Some of us raised similar concerns regarding reports that President Trump ordered Gary Cohn, then the Director of the National Economic Council, to pressure the Antitrust Division to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger.""

They want ""any and all communications between the White House and Department related to the T-Mobile-Sprint merger.""

Also signing on to the letter were senators Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

For her part, Warren has not been shy to telegraph what her administration would do in terms of communications companies, something Trump was criticized by Democrats for doing. Warren has said that if she were elected, her Justice Department would break up. ""I will appoint regulators who are committed to using existing tools to unwind anti-competitive mergers, including: Amazon: Whole Foods; Zappos; Facebook: WhatsApp; Instagram; and Google: Waze; Nest; DoubleClick,"" she said.

Perhaps lighting a fire under the Democrats is the fact that last week the FCC's Republican majority has signaled it will support the Sprint/T-Mobile deal after chairman Ajit Pai said he would circulate an order approving it after the companies volunteered a revised list of conditions that included divesting Boost Mobile, the low-cost prepaid wireless subsidiary; building out high-speed 5G wireless service to most of the nation, including rural areas, on a timetable acceptable to the FCC; and maintaining the same or better prices for three years.""

The FCC majority apparently views creating a stronger competitor to AT&T and Verizon and advancing the Administration priority of 5G is enough to get it over the four-to-three antitrust issue with consolidation in the wireless market."
Acting DHS secretary can’t explain how Trump’s tariffs on Mexico work,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/mcaleenan-trump-mexico-tariffs-c674b6c2d6b6/,"In an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper Sunday morning, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan wasn’t able to articulate how or when the White House will end its tariffs on Mexican goods.

McAleenan appeared on cable news to defend President Donald Trump’s decision to impose new tariffs on Mexico as a means to address migration to the United States. The longer apprehension rates along the U.S.-Mexico border continue to rise, the higher the tariffs.

As the White House announced last week, a 5% tariff is set to go into effect on June 10 if Mexico does not step up immigration enforcement measures. The tariffs would gradually increase — an additional 5% on the first day of each month for four months — to a maximum of 25% by October, unless “the illegal immigration problem is remedied.”

Tapper asked McAleenan at what point would the administration consider lifting the tariffs, but McAleenan had no concrete response.

“I guess one of the questions I would have is assuming these tariffs go through, and right now it’s just a threat, what specific benchmark are you going to be looking at to see if Mexico is actually doing what you want them to do?” Tapper asked.

“I think what the president said, we need a vast reduction in the numbers crossing,” McAleenan replied.

According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), there were roughly 100,000 apprehensions in April — so what would a “vast reduction” look like to the administration? McAleenan couldn’t answer that either.

Instead, McAleenan recommended the administration ask the Mexican government to enforce its own southern border with Guatemala, put an end to the organizations that help transport migrants across Mexico, and work with the United States on creating new asylum policies.

As ThinkProgress has previously reported, however, the Mexican government is already collaborating with the Trump administration on the immigration front, whether by arresting Central American migrants at the southern Mexico border or ordering bus operators to stop transporting migrants across the country.

Considering that the U.S. is one of Mexico’s biggest trade partners and even the preliminary 5% tariff could have devastating effects on the Mexican economy, this question is critical. U.S. imports of goods from Mexico totaled about $346.5 billion in 2018, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Mexico, meanwhile, sends nearly 80% of its exports to the United States. Should tariffs reach the full 25% that Trump has threatened, American exporters of goods to Mexico would also be impacted, likely shoulder the cost of this new policy.

McAleenan also had no answers for how the U.S. would respond if Mexico’s economy took a downturn, causing more people to migrate.

“Bottom line for me is we need [Mexico] at the table looking at new strategies that we can aggressively move out on,” he said."

(CNN) - Global stock markets slumped Monday, as investors reacted to the prospect of a drawn-out trade war.

China on Sunday said it will ""not back down"" in a trade fight with the United States, two days after signaling it could blacklist foreign companies from its huge market.

""The series of actions over the weekend means that China's 'long march' has begun,"" Iris Pang, an economist with ING said in a research note Monday.

""It means that the trade war has not only become a technology war but also a broad-based business war. There will be more retaliation actions from China, especially for the technology sector,"" she added.

Tokyo's Nikkei recovered slightly from a rough opening to close down 0.9% on Monday. The Shanghai Composite declined 0.3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.1%.

In Europe, benchmark indexes in London and Paris were down 1% in early trading. Frankfurt's DAX declined 0.6%.

The Chinese government released a document on Sunday that blamed the United States for the breakdown in trade talks.

Wang Shouwen, a vice minister of commerce and deputy trade negotiator, said the United States can't force a trade deal on China and that the country ""will not back down.""

Beijing also said on Sunday that it is investigating FedEx after embattled Chinese tech firm Huawei said the delivery company diverted to the United States two packages intended for the company's offices in China.

The move on FedEx comes after China announced Friday that is building an ""unreliable entity list,"" effectively preparing to blacklist foreign companies as trade tensions with the United States continue to escalate.

South Korea's KOSPI bucked the trend on Monday, rising more than 1% as foreign investors snapped up shares in tech company Samsung Electronics and chip maker SK Hynix.

Samsung and SK Hynix could benefit from increased sales to Chinese firms barred from doing business with US companies, according to a recent research note from Rex Wu, an analyst with brokerage Jefferies.

President Donald Trump announced Friday that he will remove India from a special trade program on Wednesday. Meanwhile, investors are still trying to determine how new tariffs on Mexico might affect American businesses and the economy.

""Recent events have shown that markets cannot really ever dismiss (trade) uncertainties and that investors may need to accept that the United States is comfortable fighting a trade war on many fronts,"" said Hannah Anderson, a market strategist with JP Morgan.

Dow futures were down 160 points, or 0.6%, signaling a rough start to June for Wall Street. S&P 500 futures dropped 0.6% and Nasdaq futures fell about 0.8%.

DHS says citizenship approvals rose in 2018,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/31/dhs-says-citizenship-approvals-rose-2018/,"Homeland Security reached a five-year high in approvals of citizenship applications last year, and swore in more people as naturalized citizens as well, according to the new statistical report released Friday night.

Those numbers contradict the criticisms of congressional Democrats who had complained about backlogs building at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Homeland Security branch that handles legal immigration.

The new report also suggests that far from a crackdown, the government is processing more asylum-seeker petitions than any of the last four years. That included a 61 percent increase from 2017 to 2018 in affirmative asylum applications — though refugee interviews are down from more than 1250,000 in 2016, the last year under President Barack Obama, to just 26,400 in fiscal year 2018 under President Trump.

Still, when the whole panoply of humanitarian programs is considered — asylum, refugees, crime victim visas, Temporary Protected Status and screening for credible fear or reasonable fear of persecution — the numbers were 32 percent higher than fiscal year 2017. Credible fear and reasonable fear are first steps on the asylum track.

USCIS’s workload has become contentious in recent years, with immigrant-rights groups accusing the Trump administration of building a bureaucratic “wall” to deny people the chance to enter the U.S. legally. The accusation is a play on their disdain for Mr. Trump’s border wall intended to stop illegal immigration.

Hispanic Democrats in Congress say things are so bad that they requested — and have been granted — an investigation to be done by the Government Accountability Office. Rep. Joaquin Castro, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said the case backlog is an example of “President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda.”

Yet the backlog in citizenship applications, for example, exploded during the end of the Obama administration. The Washington Times, which tracked the explosion at the time, sought comment from immigrant-rights activists and lawmakers, including Democrats, but didn’t find many who blamed the Obama administration for the slow processing.

The new numbers from USCIS also detail some of the more hidden parts of the agency’s work, such as its efforts to weed out fraud in legal immigration applications.

Experts say fraud is rampant, but the agency has not released any major fraud assessments in years.

Still, the Fraud Detection and National Security division reported 149,3000 investigative leads or actions year — a 14 percent increase over 2017. That included 30,400 tips of fraud, 7,600 national security matters and nearly 17,000 public safety matters.

FDNS also reported screening social media in 11,700 cases.

State Dept. panel to redefine human rights based on 'natural law and natural rights',https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-panel-redefine-human-rights-based-natural/story?id=63400485,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is setting up a commission at the State Department to redefine human rights as based on what the department is describing as ""natural law and natural rights.""

The move has alarmed human rights activists, especially those focused on LGBT rights and women's rights, who fear it will mean an end to promoting protections for both groups around the world.

""It's an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,"" Pompeo told reporters Thursday, adding the effort is focused on ""how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world how to engage on those important issues.""

The State Department has declined to comment beyond Pompeo's remarks. But it did issue a public notice in the Federal Register on Thursday that says the body, named the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will provide Pompeo ""advice and recommendations concerning international human rights matters"" and meet about once a month.

""The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,"" according to the notice.

Use of the term ""natural law"" has concerned some advocacy groups and department staff, as it is interpreted in this case as ""God-given"" or religiously-based rights that affect issues like sexuality, abortion rights, and more. In particular, the phrase has been prominent in the work of Princeton professor Robert George.

George has played a prominent role in the creation of the commission, according to a source familiar with the plans for the commission. George, co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, a nonprofit that advocates against same-sex marriage, is among the 15 academics recommended to make up the panel, according to the source.

Author of the 1999 book ""In Defense of Natural Law,"" where he argued against homosexuality and abortion rights and in favor of religious liberty, George also wrote the original concept note that outlined a vision for the commission, the source said.

The commission ""is absolutely about those issues, but it's not explicit in the paper,"" the source said. ""It questions whether and which human rights are universal.""

George did not respond to a request for comment.

Dr. Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning, is listed as the top official on the Federal Register notice. Skinner, who leads the department's long-term foreign policy strategy team, recently raised eyebrows by describing the U.S. rivalry with China as a clash of civilizations and ""the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.""

Along with George and Skinner, the full list of participants has been recommended to the Secretary, but he still has to approve the final list. As part of the process, however, the department had to publish the Federal Register notice, which is dated May 22.

Igniting further concern about the project is the fact that the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor was not consulted in the process, two sources told ABC News.

""The wording of the Commission's mandate raised eyebrows with human rights advocates and congressional staff. The fact that it was announced with no prior outreach to or input from the human rights community immediately raised concerns over its motives... [and] the State Department already has a well-defined understanding of how to advance human rights and maintains several offices dedicated to various human rights issues,"" said Rob Berschinski, who served as deputy assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, or DRL, in the Obama administration.

Pompeo said Thursday the project is ""separate"" from DRL, but ""deeply connected to the work that not only DRL does, but that the entire State Department does around the world.""

Promoting the right to religious freedom has been a high priority for Pompeo, who will host his second summit on the topic this July. But he and the Trump administration, in general, have been criticized for pulling punches on U.S. partners over their human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for example, have been embraced by the top Trump officials despite their crackdowns on political opposition, women's rights activists, and NGOs.

""If the administration truly wants to engage in a meaningful dialogue about respecting human rights, then we are happy to have that discussion. But the fact that this panel was announced without details or consultation with human rights experts suggests that this may be just another instrument to negate rights, rather than protect them,"" said Tarah Demant, director of Amnesty International's Gender, Sexuality, and Identity program."

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico has suggested that Mexico is willing to negotiate over President Trump’s threat to tax all incoming goods from Mexico because Mexico isn’t “doing enough” to stop illegal immigration into the United States. Obrador hinted that his country could tighten migration controls in order to stop Trump from imposing tariffs, first of 5%, then up to 25% by October. Trump made no specific conditions for constitutes “stopping” illegal immigration, so this is all up in the air as to what personally satisfies the Donald. If one didn’t know any better, one would think that the US now has an absolute monarch with absolute power to stop any good from coming into the country by Tweet. Chances are though, now that Mexico wants to talk, Trump will suspend any tariffs from being raised until conclusion of talks, announce the best deal in the history of our local group of galaxies has been made, cancel the tariffs and praise himself for helping the stock market break to new highs. And if that doesn’t happen he’ll blame the Fed.

Gap Gaps Down, Loses GPS

The Gap (NYSE:GPS), agape at its weak Q1 earnings report, gapped down nearly 10% at the end of last week. Same store sales were down 1% at Old Navy, also a Gap brand, and Banana Republic with same store sales down 3%. The Gap itself was the worst performer, same store sales down 10%. Upper management is blaming it on the cold weather in February. Business and traffic picked up in March and April, but February destroyed the quarter according to CEO Art Peck. Gap has gapped down like this before, after the Dot Com bubble burst, and from 2014 to 2016 when it collapsed almost as much as it had in 2000. Is the era of trendy overexpensive teenage clothing gone? Maybe not now that tariffs are all in place on China, so it should be a bit harder ordering cheap clothes from AliExpress.

US Ready To Talk to Iran? So Says Pompeo

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is now saying that President Trump is ready to negotiate with Iran without preconditions, as American weapons and big planes and bombs stream in to Iran’s neighborhood in a show of force that is sure to make them happy. Pompeo may be playing off of Iranian President Rouhani’s call to negotiate with the U.S. without being bullied, which probably means that Rouhani doesn’t quite appreciate the show of force in the Persian Gulf as much as Trump may want him to. Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister has said that talks are not very likely. “We’re prepared to engage in a conversation with no preconditions,” he said. “But the American effort to fundamentally reverse the malign activity of the Islamic Republic, this revolutionary force, is going to continue.” In other words, the “bullying” in Iran’s words, will continue, so looks like no talking here.

Lyft Tempts Drivers With Free Charging In Portland, Land of Charging Ports

Portland, Oregon is truly becoming the land of ports, as in electric charging ports for electric cars driven by Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) drivers. Lyft will be able to charge their electric cars for free in the city, thanks to a partnership with Portland General Electric (NYSE:GE) which is sponsoring the initiative. Hybrid drivers also qualify. We’re proud to fuel Lyft’s mission to minimize its impact on the environment with a robust and healthy EV charging network, as it aligns with our goal to help deploy electric transportation that serves everyone — regardless of how they choose to move throughout our region.” So says Dave Robertson, VP of public policy at Portland General Electric. Don’t let your imagination run wild though. There are a total of 3 public charging stations in Portland. So this isn’t going to be a multimillion dollar partnership or anything. It’s more like passing around a battery-powered tin can. General Electric Portland probably wants people to start using the 3 charging stations so they can get used to them.

Department of Justice to Wants to Make Alphabet Soup Out of Google

The massive fines that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had to deal with in the European Union may be coming to the United States, or worse, Alphabet could be broken up in some way, if the Justice Department is really gunning for it. Google’s parent company is being investigated for antitrust violations for giving search preference to its own businesses. Google has not commented. If Trump indeed wants the stock market to keep rising, then going after tech companies that lead the entire market higher is probably not the best way to do it. Alphabet has been down lately, but not by that much, so the impact of this investigation especially if it leads to fines and/or changes in business practices could bring the stock down significantly, especially if Google has stopped growing since completely taking over the search market.

"Queen Elizabeth set to fete Trump, as she has so many other US presidents",https://www.cnn.com,['Betsy Klein'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/01/politics/donald-trump-queen-elizabeth-ii-state-visit/index.html,"(CNN) Queen Elizabeth II has met with nearly every American President since Dwight Eisenhower during her more than 67 years on the throne. Next week, she'll welcome President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump back to the United Kingdom, this time for a rare state visit.

Though the Trumps and the Royal Family are expected to adhere to the highest levels of protocol during the visit, Trump's remarks ahead of the trip threaten to damage goodwill with the Queen -- he publicly insulted her grandson's wife on the eve of the visit.

During an interview with The Sun, Trump was asked about comments made by Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, ahead of the 2016 election. Speaking on ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore"" in 2016, Markle called Trump misogynistic and said his politics are divisive, saying she would move to Canada if he won the presidency.

Trump responded, ""I didn't know that she was nasty. I hope she is OK,"" later adding, ""I am sure she will go excellently (as a royal). She will be very good."" Buckingham Palace had no comment on Trump's interview regarding Markle.

The Trumps previously met with the Queen at Windsor Castle last June, a more informal meeting over tea.

The trip comes amid a blitz of foreign travel for the President and will be the Trumps' second state visit in less than two weeks. In May, they were Japanese Emperor Naruhito's first state guests since he ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne earlier that month.

For the Trump's official visit, Buckingham Palace is pulling out all of the Royal stops befitting a world leader. An official state visit requires the formal invitation of the Queen to a head of state ""on the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth office,"" per Buckingham Palace , and usually involves a ceremonial welcome, a state banquet, other meetings with British officials and a formal farewell.

Trump, who is known to appreciate pomp and circumstance, is sure to revel in the pageantry. His adult children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump, will also be joining him and the first lady.

Likewise, they ""will have the opportunity to meet some other members of the Royal Family"" during the arrival ceremony, said a senior administration official briefing reporters on the trip. America's own member of the Royal Family, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is not expected to attend, as she has largely remained out of the public spotlight since giving birth in early May.

The 'special relationship'

The ""special relationship"" with the United Kingdom also carries special significance for the President. After their 2018 tea, Trump told interviewer Piers Morgan that he was thinking of his mother when he met the Queen.

""I was thinking about my mother. My mother passed away a while ago and she was a tremendous fan of the Queen. She thought she was a woman of elegance, and my mother felt she was a great woman. I remember even as a little guy, if there was any kind of a ceremony to do with the Queen, my mother would be watching the television -- she wanted to see it,"" Trump said at the time.

Trump recalled: ""I was walking up and I was saying (to Melania), 'Can you imagine my mother seeing this scene? Windsor. Windsor Castle.' And it was beautiful, it was really beautiful but the Queen is terrific. She is so sharp, so wise, so beautiful. Up close, you see she's so beautiful. She's a very special person.""

Trump told Morgan that the Queen walked him through all of the presidents she had met.

""Harry Truman was the first president that she got to meet and know, and she went through a whole list. It was a very nice moment, Piers, very nice,"" he said.

The Queen met President Harry Truman when she was still Princess Elizabeth, during a trip to Washington in 1951 at the age of 25. She and Prince Philip stayed at Blair House with Truman and his family since the White House was under a four-year major renovation, according to the White House Historical Association.

State visits

Since then, she's met with every US President, with the one exception of President Lyndon B. Johnson. But this is only the third state visit from a US president during Queen Elizabeth II's reign; the invitation has only been extended to Trump's most recent predecessors -- Barack and Michelle Obama in May 2011 and George W. and Laura Bush in November 2003.

She hosted the Kennedys for a banquet -- not an official state visit -- in 1961, which was recently depicted in the Netflix drama ""The Crown,"" hinting at an icy, if not entirely accurate , relationship between the Queen and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.

The Nixons, Carters, and Clintons also met her informally in 1970, 1977, and 1994, respectively, and she hosted a formal dinner honoring the Reagans at Windsor Castle in 1982. Carter drew the Queen Mother's ire during that 1977 visit when he kissed her on the lips.

""Nobody has done that since my husband died,"" she reportedly said.

The Queen has traveled to the United States for informal visits and state visits multiple times during her reign. For her first state visit to the US as Queen in 1957, she and Prince Philip stayed in the same suite in the White House in which her parents, King George VI and the Queen Mother, had stayed in 1939, according to the White House Historical Association, and she was greeted with large crowds on her motorcade from the airport.

At the White House

In 1976, President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford hosted her for a state dinner in the Rose Garden. President Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan served the Queen enchiladas and chile rellenos when she visited them at their Santa Barbara ranch in 1983, and days later, hosted a State Dinner in her honor at San Francisco's M.H. de Young Memorial Museum.

She rolled up her sleeves -- though not literally -- during an official state visit in 1991, planting a tree on the White House South Lawn alongside President George H. W. Bush, replacing a storm-damaged tree her father planted in 1937. And she attended a white-tie state dinner at the George W. Bush White House in 2007.

She shared a warm relationship with the Obamas, as Michelle Obama recently recalled

""So, I had all this protocol buzzing in my head, and I was like, 'Don't trip down the stairs and don't touch anybody, whatever you do,' "" the former first lady said during a book tour event. ""And so, the Queen says, 'Just get in, sit wherever,' and she's telling you one thing and you're remembering protocol and she says, 'Oh it's all rubbish, just get in.' ""

It remains to be seen whether the Queen shares the same affection for Trump.

Asked if he got the feeling she liked him, Trump told Morgan: ""Well, I don't want to speak for her, but I can tell you I liked her. So, usually that helps. But I liked her a lot."""
The Trump Administration Might Be Too Incompetent to Undermine Environmental Regulations,https://slate.com,['Richard L. Revesz'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/trump-administration-cant-actually-undermine-environmental-regulation-too-incompetent.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Nivellen77/iStock / Getty Images Plus and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

The Trump administration appears to be entering an alarming new stage of its attack on environmental protection. For the past two-plus years, it has used a retail approach, targeting Obama-era environmental rules one by one, trying to suspend compliance deadlines. This strategy has been met with limited success—more than 90 percent of the administration’s deregulatory efforts are being defeated in court, mostly due to sloppy agency actions. But the Environmental Protection Agency has recently decided it will undertake a new approach in its effort to launch a wholesale attack on environmental regulation—it will change the way it collects and processes data, to provide better justification to dismantle the analytical foundation of its rules. These moves fly in the face of established economics and health sciences, and are inconsistent with the practices of administrations of both parties over four decades. The consequences for the environment and public health could be disastrous. But even as this approach might be more deliberate, these actions are unlikely to survive court challenges as well.

The EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards.

In the coming weeks, the EPA plans to finalize vastly weakened versions of two important climate rules: a regulation controlling greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and standards to limit emissions from vehicles. The draft proposals for the Trump administration’s revisions to each of these rules were rife with analytical problems. In the power plant rule revision, the agency exercised its discretion in a manner that imposed billions of dollars’ worth of net harm on the American public. And the vehicle rule analysis is justified by claims about improved safety that rest on a wholly implausible and discredited economic analysis: It assumes that people will buy more—as opposed to fewer—vehicles as they become more expensive. These failures are likely to reappear in the final rules as well, because the administration would be unable to justify its chosen actions without mangling the underlying analysis. As a result of these analytical failures, the rollbacks will be highly vulnerable to legal challenges and could add to the administration’s string of court losses.

Perhaps sensing urgency as these losses mount and the president’s term slips away, the EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards. The agency has taken steps to begin an assault on the core foundations of environmental rulemaking, signaling that it plans to alter the building blocks of the economic analysis that underlies its rules. This new EPA attack features three dirty tricks that would erase the bulk of the benefits of critical environmental policies. These benefits—tens of thousands of averted deaths and hundreds of thousands of averted hospitalizations for strokes, heart attacks, and respiratory ailments—would, of course, still be there. The administration’s analysis would just pretend otherwise.

One EPA method involves calling into question the benefit of reducing pollution below the level of the national ambient air quality standards. Since the late 1970s, every administration—Republican and Democratic—has acknowledged that more stringent standards would provide greater health benefits. But earlier this month, William Wehrum, who oversees air quality for the EPA, brazenly cast doubt on this long-established, science-based approach, telling the New York Times that counting these benefits in regulatory analyses “doesn’t make any sense” because the standards are set at “safe” levels, thereby implying that there can be no benefits at concentrations below the ones that the EPA deems to be “safe.”

The problem with this understanding is that the Supreme Court has made clear that “the word ‘safe’ does not mean ‘risk-free.’ ” And, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which hears all the challenges to national ambient air quality standards, explained that in setting these standards, EPA must “ ‘select … standard levels that … reduce risks sufficiently to protect public health’ ” even while recognizing that “ ‘a zero-risk standard is [not] possible.’ ”

Wehrum should know better, or at least, he did not too long ago. He had previously served under President George W. Bush in senior positions in EPA’s air office between 2001 and 2007. During that time, in setting national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and for ozone, the EPA acknowledged that significantly higher benefits would accrue to the American people if the agency set the standards at levels more stringent that the ones it ultimately chose. The significant concern with this approach is that it will pave the way for the EPA to support laxer standards without having to acknowledge that there is a cost to human life in doing so.

A second EPA trick involves concealing “co-benefits”—the indirect (and often enormous) benefits that result when a regulation reduces pollutants besides the ones being directly targeted by a particular regulation. EPA has launched an attack on co-benefits most directly as part of a revision to a finding related to a major mercury pollution rule—it’s trying to argue that the $37 billion to $90 billion in health co-benefits resulting from reductions in harmful particulate matter pollution don’t exist. If the administration’s goal is to obscure the value of environmental rules, undermining co-benefits will certainly help.

Co-benefits are so universally accepted as a worthwhile thing to consider that even the Trump EPA’s own handpicked Science Advisory Board recently highlighted the importance of considering them. Furthermore, a landmark guidance document on regulatory analysis issued by the Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush explicitly requires the consideration of indirect benefits, though the EPA has consistently taken co-benefits into account since the Reagan administration. Courts have also ruled that the indirect costs of regulations must be considered, so ignoring indirect benefits would create a lopsided and unjustifiable analysis. Indeed, counting indirect effects when they are negative but ignoring them when they are positive is the embodiment of the type of arbitrary and capricious conduct that the law categorically prohibits. But the Trump EPA now wants to make this the norm.

The EPA’s final dirty trick involves questioning foundational scientific studies on the harmful health impacts of particulate pollution. The detrimental health effects of particulate matter emissions are exceptionally well-documented. Two foundational studies performed in the 1990s found that people in cities with the highest levels of these pollutants were dying two years earlier than those in the least-polluted cities. The results were independently verified by two groups of outside researchers, and these studies have helped inform several major air pollution regulations. But an EPA rule proposed last year would bar the consideration of studies like these, even though they are widely regarded as state-of-the-art, because their individual patient health data cannot be shared publicly, because of patient confidentiality rules. The administration’s approach would make it virtually impossible for regulatory policy to rely on epidemiological studies, a science-denying approach that is unlikely to find a receptive ear in the courts.

During the retail phase of the Trump administration’s attack on environmental rules, the EPA cut corners, which led to most of its actions being overturned in court. This new wholesale attack on environmental rulemaking is far more pernicious than the last. The Trump administration is actively trying to undermine and minimize science that has served as a universal baseline for decades. But once again, it’s pursuing its case sloppily, which means the courts are likely to still see through these dirty tricks and stop them before they have a massively negative impact on public health."
Elizabeth Warren says she wants to make it legal to indict presidents,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647042/elizabeth-warren-trump-indictment-mueller,"Special counsel Robert Mueller said indicting President Donald Trump was “not an option” this week, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a sitting president from criminal indictments and prosecution.

Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says she would change the policy as president.

Warren, among the first major Democratic 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment, released a two-part proposal on presidential powers Friday. First, she called on Congress to pass a law clarifying that the president of the United States is subject to the same federal criminal code as everyone else. Second, she pledged to appoint an attorney general and assistant AG who would change current Justice Department policy around indicting sitting presidents.

“Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That’s not how our country is supposed to work,” Warren wrote. “I pledge to nominate an [Office of Legal Counsel] head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a President cannot be indicted for criminal behavior.”

On Wednesday, Mueller reiterated he was operating under DOJ policy, as presented by the Office of Legal Counsel, that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime.

“Under longstanding department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,” Mueller said. “That is unconstitutional. ... The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.”

To be clear, what Mueller is referring to is not something expressly written in the Constitution. It’s a large gray area in the nation’s body of law — which Warren says she would address as president.

The question of presidential immunity, briefly explained

The closest the Supreme Court has come to answering the question of presidential immunity recently is a 1997 ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which maintained that a president is subject to civil lawsuits. But whether a sitting president can be subject to criminal prosecution remains an unanswered question in the courts.

Upon review in 1973 and again in 2000, OLC concluded that the best way to address criminal charges is to wait until a president leaves office, leaving impeachment as the avenue for accountability.

As Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained, the most famous argument in favor of making presidents immune from criminal prosecution is from a 1997 law review article by Yale constitutional law professor Akhil Amar and a then-student of his, Brian Kalt, who’s now a law professor at Michigan State University:

Amar and Kalt argue that the president is a unique official, as the sole person ultimately in charge of the executive branch. “If he is arrested, so too is the executive branch of the government,” they write. This distinguishes him from a normal legislator or judge, who can be prosecuted, because there are plenty of other judges and legislators who can carry on their work. “Any distraction of the President from his duties is much more significant than similar distractions of these other, prosecutable officials, and has a much bigger impact on the well-being of the nation and all its People,” they conclude.

But even Kalt says this is unsettled territory. There is an argument to be made that the president should be subject to the same legal standard as everybody else, and that there are structures in place to address a president with “distractions” from his executive duties.

The investigation into Trump, and the special counsel report outlining evidence that Trump may have obstructed justice, has raised this issue into the forefront once again.

Google shares were marked 6.2% lower Monday to change hands at $1,037.11 each, a move that would wipe out all of its year-to-date gain and take the stock to its lowest level since January January 4.

Google's larger market issue Monday, however, centers around multiple media reports from late Friday -- first by the Wall Street Journal --- that suggested the U.S. Department of Justice is preparing a far-reaching probe into the tech giant's sprawling business.

""Potential implications for Google could include new regulations on business practices, or

an antitrust probe leading to a breakup,"" said Bank of America analyst Justin Post. To break up Google (on unfair search practices or too much power to influence opinion on multiple properties?), the DOJ would likely have to file a lawsuit and convince judges that Google has undermined competition.""

""It is very rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&T as past

examples, though the government tried to break up Microsoft and failed,"" he added, noting a full investigation could take as many as five years to resolve.

Last year, Google was fined a record $5 billion by European antitrust authorities following a lengthy investigation into contracts that tie makers of android-operated smartphones to the exclusive sale of its apps and was hit with a further $1.7 billion penalty in March for unfairly restricting rivals from displaying ads on its platform via third parties using its AdSense tool.

Should Google find itself in the crosshairs of a similar Justice Department probe in the United States, the Mountain View, California-based group could be susceptible to fines and restrictions in its biggest and most import market. It could also, given the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, appear on the forthcoming list of ""Unreliable Entities"" being prepared by the Chinese government in an effort to respond to the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei Technologies last month.

""Foreign enterprises, organizations and individuals that do not comply with market rules, violate the spirit of contract, block or cut supplies to Chinese firms with non-commercial purposes, and seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, will be added to the list of unreliable entities,"" Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Friday."

William Barr just contradicted himself over a key claim he's made about Mueller's obstruction findings,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Sonam Sheth'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/barr-contradicted-himself-key-claim-made-mueller-obstruction-findings-2019-5,"Attorney General William Barr contradicted himself in a significant way during an exclusive interview with CBS News, during which he revealed that the Department of Justice (DOJ) ""didn't agree with the legal analysis"" the former special counsel Robert Mueller used in his obstruction-of-justice investigation into President Donald Trump.

The attorney general added during the CBS interview that Mueller's analysis ""did not reflect the views of the department"" and instead represented ""the views of a particular lawyer or lawyers.""

But on May 1, while testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Barr said the department ""accepted the special counsel's legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the special counsel in reaching our conclusion"" in the obstruction case.

During his CBS News interview, Barr told host Jan Crawford that DOJ officials ""applied what we thought was the right law [in the obstruction case], but then we didn't rely on that. We also looked at all the facts, tried to determine whether the government could establish all the elements, and as to each of those episodes, we felt that the evidence was deficient.""

Mueller did not make a ""traditional prosecutorial judgment"" on whether Trump obstructed justice in the Russia probe. But prosecutors laid out an extensive roadmap of evidence — including 11 potential instances of obstruction — against Trump, many of which appear to meet the legal criteria needed to prove obstruction of justice.

Mueller cited a 1973 Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) memo — which says a sitting president cannot be indicted — as the primary reason he didn't make a conclusion one way or another on whether Trump obstructed justice. Many legal experts have said that even if Mueller couldn't indict Trump, he still could have stated that he believed there was enough evidence of criminal activity.

But Mueller said that suggesting Trump should be charged without actually charging him would be unfair because it would deprive the president of the chance to clear his name in a court of law. For that reason, Mueller said he didn't believe he was authorized to make a formal conclusion on the obstruction question.

Prosecutors noted, however, that their report ""does not exonerate"" the president and that if they had confidence Trump did not [emphasis ours] commit a crime, they would have said so.

They also pointed out that a president is not immune from criminal prosecution once he leaves office, and that the Constitution ""requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" which is a reference to impeachment.

One former senior DOJ official who worked closely with Mueller when he was FBI director characterized Mueller's report and his public statement this week to INSIDER as ""Mueller, in his own way and as loudly as he legally could, shouting from the rooftops that Congress needs to act.""

""Mueller isn't [Whitewater independent counsel] Ken Starr,"" the former senior official added. ""He's not a showman, he's a prosecutor. He got the evidence, he laid out all the facts, and he did the heavy lifting. Now, he's basically saying to Congress: the ball's in your court. Start the impeachment process.""

Before Mueller's report was released to the public, the attorney general took the unusual step of releasing a four-page summary of his ""principal conclusions"" of Mueller's findings. Barr said Mueller's team did not find sufficient evidence to charge Trump or anyone on his campaign for conspiring with the Russian government during the 2016 election.

In the obstruction case, Barr took it upon himself to conclude that there wasn't enough evidence to accuse Trump of obstructing justice.

Barr told CBS News that Mueller's statement that he could not clear Trump of a crime ""is not the standard we use at the department.""

""We have to determine whether there is clear violation of the law, and so we applied the standards we would normally apply,"" Barr said. ""We analyzed the law and the facts, and a group of us spent a lot of time doing that and determined that, both, as a matter of law, many of the instances would not amount to obstruction.""

Barr's interview comes as he weathers a firestorm of criticism over his handling of Mueller's report. Barr told Congress during his confirmation hearing earlier this year that he would do everything he could to protect the integrity of the FBI's Russia probe and that he did not believe Mueller was on a ""witch hunt,"" as Trump and his allies often claim.

But since taking over as attorney general, Barr has gone to significant lengths to defend the president in ways that many say casts him more as the president's personal defense attorney instead of the nation's chief law enforcement officer.

Barr also skipped a scheduled hearing before the House Judiciary Committee about his oversight of the Russia probe; he launched multiple investigations into the origins of the Russia probe; and he accused the FBI of ""spying"" on the Trump campaign.

This week, during his interview with CBS News, Barr used more inflammatory rhetoric to describe the Russia investigation, saying the bureau crossed "" a serious red line"" by investigating Trump. Seconds later, however, the attorney general admitted he had no clear basis for making the allegation."
DOJ rebuffs judge's order to release transcripts of Michael Flynn's conversations with Russian envoy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-rebuffs-judges-order-to-release-transcripts-of-michael-flynns-conversations-with-russian-envoy,"The Justice Department rejected a federal judge's order to release the transcripts of wiretapped conversations retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn had with a Russian envoy.

Prosecutors also declined to produced unredacted portions of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report that had to do with Flynn, who assisted Trump's 2016 campaign and briefly served as national security adviser in 2017.

Little explanation was given beyond stating that the materials were not relevant to Flynn's sentencing.

“The government further represents that it is not relying on any other recordings, of any person, for purposes of establishing the defendant’s guilt or determining his sentence, nor are there any other recordings that are part of the sentencing record,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing Friday in response to an order by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan.

Flynn admitted to lying to the FBI about his communications with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which were about sanctions during the transition before Trump took office, and reached a plea deal to cooperate with Mueller's team. Flynn has yet to be sentenced and is still working with Justice Department prosecutors in a criminal case against Bijan Kian, his former lobbying partner who worked for the Turkish government.

The Justice Department did comply with Sullivan's order to release a transcript of a Nov. 22, 2017, voicemail that former Trump lawyer John Dowd left for Flynn's lawyer Rob Kelner shortly after Flynn agreed to cooperate with Mueller."
State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law',https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Commission on Unalienable Rights will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a move that has surprised and puzzled human rights activists. | Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images foreign policy State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law'

The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.

The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.

Story Continued Below

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.

Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.

The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signal a religious component, experts said.

Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.

“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.

The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.

The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.

Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.

State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.

But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.

Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.

“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”

“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.

Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.

The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.

The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.

But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.

It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.

According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."
