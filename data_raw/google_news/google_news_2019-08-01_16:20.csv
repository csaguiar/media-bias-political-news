Military awards given to prosecutors in a case against a SEAL who was acquitted of murder in the death of a prisoner in Iraq have been revoked by the Navy's top official after President Trump tweeted Wednesday that the commendations should be withdrawn.

Navy Secretary Richard Spencer ordered seven Navy Achievement Medals and three letters of commendation given to the prosecution team be rescinded, Navy spokesman Cmdr. Jereal Dorsey said Wednesday, hours after a pair of scathing tweets from the president.

In the high-profile case, Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher was found not guilty by a military jury of premeditated murder of the 17-year-old Islamic State prisoner in 2017. In early July, Gallagher was sentenced to a demotion in rank and a reduction in pay for posing with the dead captive's body.

The jury heard testimony from fellow SEALs that Gallagher stabbed the captive in the neck, but one of the witnesses dramatically changed his story at trial, saying that in an act of mercy, he had killed the prisoner by blocking his airway after Gallagher stabbed him.

A SEAL sniper and medic, Gallagher, 40, was serving his eighth deployment at the time of the incident. He is a 19-year Navy veteran who had previously been awarded the Bronze Star. He was also accused of shooting unarmed Iraqi civilians but was acquitted on those counts as well.

The prosecution's case was plagued by problems, including a sanction from the military judge for violating the defendant's constitutional rights. The lead prosecutor, Cmdr. Christopher Czaplak, was removed from the case for conducting a warrantless surveillance program aimed at tracking emails sent by the defense team. Prosecutors were also accused of granting immunity in an effort to block defense witnesses from testifying, according to the Navy Times.

In Trump's tweets on Wednesday, the president said the prosecutors had been ""ridiculously given"" the awards, adding, ""Not only did they lose the case, they had difficulty with respect ... to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion.""

The Prosecutors who lost the case against SEAL Eddie Gallagher (who I released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly), were ridiculously given a Navy Achievement Medal.

I have directed the Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer & Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2019

The president's remarks via Twitter on Wednesday marked the third time that he had publicly commented on the case.

After Gallagher's acquittal in early July, Trump tweeted his congratulations, writing: ""Glad I could help!""

Former Pentagon spokesman David Lapan, a retired Marine colonel, told The Associated Press that the personal intervention of the president represented the ""further politicization of the military,"" calling it ""ludicrous ... in the face of so many more important and pressing personnel issues."""

Team Trump Turns to Lindsey Graham to Cut an Iran Deal,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin Banco', 'Asawin Suebsaeng', 'National Security Reporter', 'White House Reporter']",08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/team-trump-turns-to-lindsey-graham-to-cut-an-iran-deal,"President Trump wants a new deal with Iran to replace the nuclear agreement he pulled out of, and he’s turning to one of his most hawkish confidants to help do it.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is working in close coordination with senior Trump administration officials who focus on Middle East policy to find an alternative to the Obama administration’s Iran deal, four people with knowledge of the efforts tell The Daily Beast. Part of that effort includes fielding ideas from outside actors, including foreign officials, two of those sources said.

Graham’s developing role in the Trump administration’s Iran strategy comes as the State Department, Department of Defense, and other government agencies try to manage the delicate relationship between Washington and Tehran.

The two countries have engaged in tit-for-tat escalations over the last several months, feeding fears on Capitol Hill that the two countries are on a crash course that could likely end in a direct military conflict. The situation has worsened in recent weeks, with the Trump administration accusing Iran of attacking tankers in the Gulf of Hormuz, which it heavily patrols.

Despite the growing tensions between the U.S. and Iran, the Trump administration and officials in Tehran have signaled they are willing to meet and negotiate with each other. But neither side is ready to take the plunge just yet.

Iran policy experts, some of whom worked with the former Obama administration, said Tehran will not engage in talks about a revised nuclear deal unless the U.S. rolls back at least some of its sanctions on the country. And with the Treasury Department's recent sanctioning of Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, the chances of negotiations moving forward anytime soon seem unlikely, those sources said.

In the meantime, though, Trump administration officials, and now apparently Graham, are actively working to put together plans for a new nuclear deal.

Graham has been one of the most outspoken senators on Iran. In June, following a classified briefing on tensions between Washington and Tehran, Graham said the U.S. was “closer” to a military confrontation.

“This is a provocative regime that shoots its own people down in the street, that threatens the existence of the state of Israel. This is an enemy of mankind, and if you are not willing to take this enemy on, you will regret it,” Graham said.

Now, though, it appears Graham is keen on finding a new deal that the U.S. can bring to the negotiating table.

It is unclear how far along the team is in crafting a proposal, but Graham did travel to Israel earlier this month to meet with officials about the situation with Iran.

In an interview with The Daily Beast on Wednesday, Graham said he had spoken to Trump about his ideas for a new nuclear deal several times and that the president was contemplating them. The senator said the U.S. should ask the Iranian regime to agree to a so-called 123 Agreement— a key, legally binding commitment that requires countries doing nuclear deals with the U.S. to sign on to nonproliferation standards. The U.S. has entered into those agreements with more than 40 countries.

“I told the president: Put the 123 on the table with the Iranians. Make them say ‘no,’” Graham told The Daily Beast. “I think the Iranians will say no. And I think that will force the Europeans’ hands.”

The U.S. should also require Iran to sign on to the “gold standard,” a pledge not to enrich and reprocess nuclear fuel, Graham said. Enrichment and reprocessing are key steps on the way to a nuclear weapon.

“ If countries want to have their own nuclear industry, that’s fine. I’m not against that. But countries can do that without enrichment and reprocessing, without making their own fuel. ” — Sen. Lindsey Graham

“If countries want to have their own nuclear industry, that’s fine. I’m not against that. But countries can do that without enrichment and reprocessing, without making their own fuel,” Graham said. “The problem the Trump administration has is how do you make a flawed deal better? We need to extend a new deal that cannot be manipulated in the future. If the [State Department] has a better plan, then fine, but I think this is a good option.”

Graham said all countries in the Middle East should agree to both 123 Agreements and the “gold standard.” “It’s reasonable for the entire region,” he said. “Except for Israel. I’m not talking about Israel. They’re in their own sort of… category.”

Graham, too, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal earlier this month with Gen. Jack Keane, a member of IP3, a firm that worked with Trump advisers to export U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia. The senator said he wrote the opinion piece with Keane because the two had discussed the idea of proposing Iran a 123 Agreement. Keane and IP3 have been pushing for a U.S. nuclear comeback by way of nuclear exports to the Middle East.

“The U.S. could begin supplying fuel rods for nuclear reactors throughout the Arab world. Dozens of nations already operate under similar nuclear frameworks,” the op-ed said. “Under this proposal, Iran could become a legitimate nuclear-power nation with all the benefits of following international rules. But under no circumstances would it be permitted to enrich nuclear material for the purpose of building a weapon.”

Asked about Graham’s work on Iran, the State Department said: “The U.S. is seeking a deal with Iran that comprehensively addresses the regime’s destabilizing behavior—not just its nuclear program, but also its missile program, support for terrorist proxies, and malign regional behavior,” a department spokesperson said in a statement. “We want Iran to behave like a ‘normal nation.’”

“ Trump has repeatedly joked about all the countries Graham wants the U.S. military to invade, and conversely has privately praised Paul as someone who ‘won’t let’ America start ‘World War III.’ ” — Sources who’ve spoken to the president about each senator

Graham’s involvement comes at a time when Rand Paul, another Republican who regularly advises Trump, is working behind the scenes to influence the administration’s policy toward the Islamic Republic. The Kentucky senator proposed his own plan, first reported in Politico last month, to become a diplomatic emissary to Iran, with the president signing off on Paul’s mission.

According to Politico, Paul personally made this pitch to Trump while playing a round of golf at the president’s club in Sterling, Virginia. Two sources with knowledge of the situation tell The Daily Beast that Paul had been warming Trump to the idea starting at least two weeks before they played that round of golf. Further, a spokesman for Paul said that the senator “has had multiple conversations with [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo on this issue” in recent weeks, including on the emissary proposal.

When Trump and Paul were on that golf course together discussing Iran and diplomacy, Graham was there with them. However, the two Trump allies have vastly divergent approaches to the region.

According to those who’ve spoken to the president about each senator, Trump has repeatedly joked about all the countries Graham wants the U.S. military to invade, and conversely has privately praised Paul as someone who “won’t let” America start “World War III.”

It is unclear whether the president will even attempt to have the two men work together on Iran policy. When asked by The Daily Beast if he was coordinating with Paul on the issue, Graham chuckled and simply said, “No.” After an extended pause, he added, “I’m not sure what he’s doing.”"

Prosecutors found the IG’s findings compelling but decided not to bring charges because they did not believe they had enough evidence of Comey’s intent to violate the law, according to multiple sources.

The concerns stem from the fact that one memo that Comey leaked to a friend specifically to be published by the media — as he admitted in congressional testimony — contained information classified at the lowest level of “confidential,” and that classification was made by the FBI after Comey had transmitted the information, the sources said.

Although a technical violation, the DOJ did not want to “make its first case against the Russia investigators with such thin margins and look petty and vindictive,” a source told me, explaining the DOJ’s rationale.

But Comey and others inside the FBI and the DOJ during his tenure still face legal jeopardy in ongoing probes by the IG and Barr-appointed special prosecutor John DurhamJohn DurhamHouse Republicans claim victory after Mueller hearings Robert Mueller soon may be exposed as the 'magician of omission' on Russia Justice gives Congress new details on 'spying' probe MORE. Those investigations are focused on the origins of the Russia investigation that included a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant targeting the Trump campaign at the end of the 2016 election, the source said.

“There are significant issues emerging with how the FISA was handled and other conduct in the investigation, and everyone involved remains under scrutiny,” a second source said.

Patrick Fitzgerald and Daniel Richman, two of Comey’s lawyers, and Keith Urbahn, his spokesman, did not return repeated calls and emails seeking comment.

The lack of prosecution is certain to demoralize some conservatives, who long have called for Comey’s head. But the IG report, set to be released within the next few weeks, likely will provide significant condemnations of Comey’s conduct, sources tell me.

While they cautioned that the IG’s final report won’t be complete until it gets feedback from Comey’s lawyers in the next few days, it is expected to conclude that the former FBI director improperly took with him memos that were FBI property when he was fired, transmitted classified information via an insecure email account, and shared some of the memos with his private lawyers. Some of the Comey memos were classified up to the “secret” level, but the FBI has not disclosed whether those were shared with his lawyers like the classified confidential memo was.

The memos, which mostly recount Comey’s interactions with Trump in the Russia case and include information about foreign leaders, were sensitive enough to require government officials to send a professional “scrub team” to a Comey lawyer’s office to ensure all classified information was deleted, sources previously told me.

In addition, the IG is likely to find that Comey engaged in a lack of candor when FBI agents came to retrieve the classified memos in his possession, failing to tell the interviewing agent that he had forwarded some of the sensitive memos by email, according to sources familiar with the probe.

Documents released Thursday by the FBI to the conservative group Judicial Watch support that conclusion, showing the FBI report on its meeting with Comey at his home to recover the memos made no mention that the ex-director had forwarded the memos on to others.

The revelations are likely to dent Comey’s carefully manicured image as a law-and-order FBI director who was fired for standing up to Trump.

The IG concluded in prior investigations that Comey’s firing was not driven by Trump’s fears about the Russia investigation ruining his presidency but, rather, by DOJ concerns about Comey’s performance in the Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonComedy Central shoots down Trump Jr. after he joked network should host Democratic debates Michael Moore urges Michelle Obama to run against Trump Trump echoes Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign slogan in post-debate tweets MORE email probe. Horowitz concluded that Comey wrongly “usurped” the authority of the attorney general when, on July 5, 2016, he announced he would not seek criminal charges against Clinton for transmitting classified information — some of it top secret — on her insecure private email server.

That IG report also chided Comey for criticizing Clinton’s email practices as reckless without filing charges and for improperly announcing the reopening of the email probe in late October 2016, just a few weeks before Election Day when Clinton and Trump were locked in a tight race.

Ironically, Comey’s decision not to charge Clinton for violating the Espionage Act for mishandling classified information on her email server mirrors the same rationale that Barr’s DOJ applied in declining prosecution of him: a lack of evidence of intent.

That won’t be lost on conservatives, who almost certainly will dislike the DOJ’s Comey decision.

But the IG report, at least, reaffirms what has become painfully clear to Americans the past two years: Comey entered the FBI chief’s job with a reputation for excellence but ran a bureau that suffered from ineptitude, political shenanigans, leaking and significant human failings, all of which sharply contrast with the morality lectures he’s become famous for frequently offering since he was fired.

‘Racist words ... giving me flashbacks.' Black Cincinnati residents brace for Trump rally following ‘racist’ comments,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Aamer Madhani', 'Ledyard King', 'Published A.M. Et Aug.']",08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/08/01/trump-rally-cincinnati-residents-react-to-presidents-racist-words/1840639001/,"CLOSE At his North Carolina rally, President Donald Trump highlighted past statements the ""Squad"" have made criticizing his administration's policies. USA TODAY

CINCINNATI — When Donald Trump slammed majority black Baltimore as a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess"", 80-year-old Mary Harper found herself recalling a painful memory from decades ago.

It was the 1960s, and Harper, who is black, had been working at the Cincinnati offices of a big national insurance company that was just beginning to hire more African Americans for entry level jobs. As she stepped on the elevator one day, a white worker turned to her and sneered, ""I guess they're hiring more roaches now.""

Trump’s attacks last week on Rep. Elijah Cummings, who is black, and his Maryland Congressional district took Harper back to that deeply hurtful moment in her own life.

“Trump’s racist words have been giving me flashbacks,” Harper told USA TODAY this week at a meeting of activists in a Cincinnati church sanctuary. “You never forget the hurt of something like that, but why am I being reminded of it by the president?”

Days after the president's attack on Cummings, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Harper’s hometown Thursday for a political rally at the U.S. Bank Arena downtown. The visit to Ohio’s third-largest city, one with a long history of racial tension, segregation and inequality, comes as the president has thrown a series of racial broadsides at opponents as he ramps up his reelection effort.

Trump calls Cummings racist: Trump says Democrats 'always play the race card'

The Cummings insult, as well as a recent invective targeting four Democratic House lawmakers, all women of color, has drawn criticism from Democrats that the president is engaging in a cynical ploy to stoke white voter resentment and rile up his base. But Trump has faced minimal pushback from Republicans over his attacks on African American lawmakers.

For his part, Trump insists that he's not racist, but rather simply calling out Democratic leaders who he says are doing too little to stem violence and poverty in some of the nation's biggest cities.

With his latest big arena rally, Trump has chosen as a backdrop what at times has been one of the most segregated metropolitan areas in the nation.

A racial wage gap persists even among the city’s most educated residents —Cincinnati’s white workers with college degrees earn an average of $5 per hour more than black peers with the same level of education, according to a 2018 study by All-In Cincinnati, a coalition of groups advocating for greater inclusivity.

The Cincinnati metro area also has one of the highest eviction rates in the country, disproportionately impacting minority communities. Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati, sees more than 12,000 evictions annually, according to a University of Cincinnati study published last year.

Black children are three times more likely to live in poverty than white kids, and 38% of black residents live in poverty.The city is 50% white and nearly 43% black.

'As Christians don't we have to speak out?'

At the same time, the city — which has seen its white population increase over the last decade as its black population has declined — is in the midst of a building boom. There are now 55 development projects under construction in the region with a total expected investment of more than $2.6 billion, according to the Cincinnati Business Courier tally of projects.

“Cincinnati is at a racial crossroads,” said the Rev. Damon Lynch III, who leads the New Prospect Baptist Church, one of the city’s prominent African American congregations.

Lynch added that he was dismayed by the president's recent attacks on the minority lawmakers. More disappointing, he said, is the silence from white Evangelicals about the president's actions.

""I understand you may support him for his economic views or because you like who he may appoint to the Supreme Court,"" Lynch said. ""But as Christians don't we have to speak out?""

City Councilwoman and President Pro Tem Tamaya Dennard said the story of Cincinnati is a tale of two cities: one where affluent, predominantly white pockets are thriving and the other where predominantly black neighborhoods are treading water or even moving backward.

During a meeting this week with a group of developers and local real estate officials, Dennard, who is black, lamented that the council had recently passed $220 million in development deals that failed to consider lower income residents. Many of the developers asked for subsidies for their projects but none included an affordable housing component in their plans, she said.

“I don’t want Cincinnati to be white-washed,” Dennard told the group. “I don’t want to look up one day and find that Cincinnati is all white people … We have to get away from being one of the most segregated cities in the country. That’s not acceptable. That’s not OK.”

Jailing of black judge spurs protests

The city has endured several racially fraught moments over the last two decades, and the jailing of a black judge last week again sparked outcry in the black community.

Black politicians, activists and community leaders held protests in the city to voice their anger over the jailing of former Judge Tracie Hunter, the county’s first African American juvenile court judge.

Hunter was ordered to begin serving a six-month prison sentence for a 2014 conviction for unlawful interest in a public contract that stemmed from charges that she used her position to give confidential documents to her brother.

The sentence was originally handed down in 2015 but wasn’t immediately executed as Hunter appealed her conviction. State law does not require a prison sentence.

Several Cincinnati politicians, including Mayor John Cranley, wrote to Common Pleas Judge Patrick Dinkelacker, calling on him to spare her a prison sentence.

But Dinkelacker declined, ordering that Hunter begin serving the sentence. Video of Hunter going limp as sheriff’s deputies dragged her out of the courtroom made international news.

Even before Hunter’s sentence was imposed last week, the case was a flashpoint with many African American leaders who argue Hunter was maliciously targeted because she sought to reform a juvenile justice system that statistics show disproportionately and ineffectively impacts boys and girls of color.

""She represented a paradigm shift,"" said Vanessa Enoch, a supporter of Hunter. ""She said when she came in that we're going to rehabilitate children now. She did not fit the old narrative of the system of making sure there are heads in the beds so the connected contractors continue to get paid.""

Harper and about 200 activists and community members gathered Monday at New Prospect Baptist Church to discuss their next steps, including a potential economic boycott, a media campaign and more protests — one is planned for outside Trump’s rally.

“We have to show (the city) that this is not the end,” said state Sen. Cecil Thomas, who represents a Cincinnati district in the Ohio Assembly. “They think we’re going to fizzle out? They haven’t seen anything yet.”

Cincinnati has seen other flare-ups of racial tension in recent years.

The city saw protests following the July 2015 death of Samuel DuBose, a black motorist who was fatally shot during a traffic stop by University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing.

The former officer was charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter, but juries were unable to reach a verdict during two trials. Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters declined to try Tensing again following the two mistrials.

In 2001, Cincinnati suffered more than $3.6 million in property damage after riots broke out following the fatal shooting of 19-year-old Timothy Thomas by a white police officer, Stephen Roach. Thomas, who was unarmed, was shot after officers chased him to execute open arrest warrants for misdemeanor offenses, most of which were related to traffic violations.

Weeks before the riots, the American Civil Liberties Union and other local groups had filed a lawsuit against the Cincinnati Police Department alleging decades of racial profiling.

'Least racist person in the world' turns race into campaign issue

It remains to be seen if Trump will continue the attacks at the Cincinnati rally, which his campaign billed as an opportunity for the president to tout 50-year lows in American unemployment and a strong economy.

But Trump is showing no signs of letting up on the divisive rhetoric.

In addition to his attacks against Cummings, Trump caused a furor earlier in July when he took to Twitter to call on four freshman lawmakers — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley — to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.”

All four lawmakers are women of color; three of the four were born in the United States and all are citizens.

His feud with the liberal lawmakers — known as the “Squad” — was further inflamed when the crowd at a Trump rally two weeks ago in Greenville, N.C., erupted in chants of “Send her back!” after the president singled out Omar, who was born in Somalia, for more criticism.

The president earlier this week declared himself “the least racist person in the world” and insisted his language wouldn’t hurt him at the ballot box in 2020. At the same time, Trump labeled the black civil rights activist and MSNBC commentator Al Sharpton “a con man” after Sharpton traveled to Baltimore to denounce Trump.

“I think I’m helping myself,” Trump said Tuesday about his attacks on minority lawmakers.

“The African American community is so thankful at what I’ve been doing,” Trump claimed. “They’ve been calling me and saying finally somebody is telling the truth.”

A narrow majority of voters say President Donald Trump is a racist, according to a Quinnipiac University poll published Tuesday.

Fifty-one percent of voters say they think Trump is a racist. Forty-five percent say they do not think so, and 5% don't know. Opinions break down along party lines.

Bob Huser, 59, of Delhi Township and a Trump supporter, said in an interview that he hadn't been following the controversy closely, but has found too often that ""there’s a small group of people on both sides (of the political spectrum) that make it much more in your face than reality would demand.""

""I think the extreme edges on both sides of the argument need to become adults,"" Huser said.

Trump needs to hang on to Ohio

Trump returns to Cincinnati — his fourth visit to the city since launching his first campaign — with his eyes on repeating his 2016 success in the Buckeye State. Trump took the bellwether state — it has voted for the presidential winner in every race dating back to 1964 — by eight percentage points and his campaign sees winning Ohio again as crucial to his reelection hopes.

But winning Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati and trends Democratic, is a long shot for Trump. It’s only one of two Ohio counties in 2016 where Clinton did better than former President Obama, who twice won the state by narrow margins.

David Niven, a political scientist at the University of Cincinnati, described the left-leaning Cincinnati as a sort of “little West Berlin surrounded by East Germany.”

“I would say the main consequence of a rally like this is it will help serve to harden the division between Cincinnati itself and the surrounding community,” Niven said. “This is not a rally for Cincinnati even though it’s a rally in Cincinnati. This is a rally for folks who live 45 miles outside the town.”

While the Trump attacks may be helping Trump with base voters, they could have the opposite impact with on-the-fence voters, according to some strategists.

If the president continues the divisive attacks, he could be wading into “really risky” political territory, said Republican consultant Alex Conant.

It’s an issue the president might be able to overcome with independent voters and moderate Republicans if the Democratic nominee is a candidate from the party’s more liberal wing with policy positions that center-right voters find more worrisome than Trump’s rhetoric or behavior, Conant added.

But Trump may find himself in deeper trouble if the nominee turns out to be a moderate Democrat such as former Vice President Joe Biden, Conant said. A poll published last week by Quinnipiac University showed Biden leading Trump 50% to 42% in Ohio, while four other top-tier Democratic White House hopefuls tied or trailed Trump by single percentage point in the state.

“(Trump) thinks that having these fights are good for him because these are the opponents he wants to have and his base loves to see him fight,” said Conant, who served as a spokesman for Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign. “A lot of soft Republicans held their noses and voted for Trump because they couldn’t stand Hillary Clinton (in 2016). There’s no guarantee that they’ll vote for Trump in 2020 if they think the Democratic alternative is acceptable.“

Ray Boston, 74, a longtime Cincinnati resident who attended the organizing meeting at the church, said it’s baffling that anyone can look at Trump’s rhetoric and not conclude he’s racist.

Boston added that if Trump really was concerned about the ills of urban communities, he’d use the power of his office to do something substantive.

“To criticize black politicians for the problems in their communities, when as the president of the United States, you actually have the power to do something to change things yet do nothing...” Boston said. “What he's saying is nonsense.”

The US military spent $33 million on tech known to be vulnerable to Chinese cyberespionage,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1679475/dod-spent-30m-on-china-hackable-tech-from-lenovo-gopro-others/,"The US Department of Defense (DoD) purchased and used millions of dollars worth of electronics last year containing “known cybersecurity vulnerabilities” that make them particularly susceptible to Chinese government espionage. The findings are included in a recent audit (pdf) by the Pentagon’s Inspector General (IG) for DoD cyberspace operations, which warns that “missions critical to national security could be compromised” if the military does not take swift action.

Some models or brands of so-called COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) technology can allow adversaries access to communications infrastructure, command and control systems, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance networks, says the partially redacted IG report.

To that end, at least $32.8 million in COTS purchases made by the US Army and Air Force during the 2018 fiscal year were singled out for concern. The products include software, cameras, and networking equipment red-flagged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate, as well as computers that have been banned for use by State Department employees since 2006.

Repelling cyberattacks has become an increasingly worrisome problem for the military since the DoD was hit with its first significant cyberattack from China in 2003. Last year, the Chinese government hacked into a US Navy contractor’s computer network, gaining access to highly sensitive secrets about a classified undersea missile program. Also last year, a breach of DoD travel records exposed the personal information and credit card data of tens of thousands of servicemembers and civilians, although that has not been explicitly linked to Beijing, which reportedly maintains a cyberespionage force with nearly 200,000 members (pdf) spanning both the military and private sectors. What’s more, a report issued last October by the Government Accountability Office found “mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in nearly all weapon systems” developed by the US military between 2012 and 2017.

“The Chinese have already broken into my stuff,” Army acquisitions official Lt. Gen. Paul Ostrowski told attendees at an event earlier this month. “The personnel system has been broken into. This is something that has risen to the top of the concern list. Not only within the Army, but within [the Office of the Secretary of Defense].”

Unheeded warnings

As much as 80% of the DoD’s systems are off-the-shelf items, or contain components that are commercially available, says the new IG report. Yet, there is no “approved products list to prevent unsecure items from being purchased.”

In one example highlighted by the IG, the Pentagon continued to buy and use video surveillance systems manufactured by two Chinese companies, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology and Dahua Technology, for at least 16 months after the state department warned against it due to cyberespionage concerns. The DoD didn’t stop until August 2018, when Congress officially banned the federal government from doing business with the two firms.

The current items singled out as problematic by the IG include such household names as Lenovo computers, Lexmark printers, and GoPro cameras.

Lenovo

In 2006, the report notes, the State Department banned Lenovo products from its classified networks after reports that the company’s computers were being manufactured with hidden spyware and backdoors. In 2015, the DHS issued a warning about cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Lenovo devices, and in 2016 the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate warned that Lenovo hardware posed a cyberespionage risk to both classified and unclassified networks and had the potential to compromise the entire DoD supply chain.

Still, the Army purchased 195 Lenovo products last year, for around $268,000, while the Air Force acquired 1,378 Lenovo products for $1.9 million.

Plenty of warnings about Lenovo products.

Lexmark

Last year, the Army and Air Force bought more than 8,000 Lexmark printers for about $30 million. The company is owned by a consortium of Chinese firms, and has links to the country’s military, nuclear, and cyberespionage programs, points out the IG report. A US government vulnerabilities database lists 20 known cybersecurity concerns pertaining to Lexmark, such as “storing and transmitting sensitive network access credentials in plain text and allowing the execution of malicious code on the printer,” which the IG says “could allow remote attackers to use a connected Lexmark printer to conduct cyberespionage or launch a denial of service attack on a DoD network.”

GoPro

The Army and Air Force also purchased 117 GoPro cameras last year, costing $98,000. The built-in wireless and Bluetooth capabilities, which let users share video in real-time, “have vulnerabilities that could allow a remote attacker access to the stored network credentials and live video streams,” says the report. “By exploiting these vulnerabilities, a malicious actor could view the video stream, start recording, or take pictures without the user’s knowledge.”

The DoD’s response to the IG report is almost entirely redacted.

A heavily redacted response.

Next steps?

The DoD must start to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks posed by off-the-shelf technology before it is put into use, cautions the IG. However, the report points out that current DoD policy only mitigates cybersecurity risks “after purchase.”

“Despite DoD policies and the numerous organizations performing cybersecurity testing and analysis,” says the audit, “there appears to be no organization assessing the risks for COTS items DoD-wide, identifying high-risk items for further testing, or actively recommending prohibition of these high-risk items when necessary.”

It’s a serious enough problem that the IG believes a legislative fix might be the only answer.

In the meantime, says the report, “We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct an organization or group to develop a risk-based approach to prioritize COTS items for further evaluation, a process to test high-risk COTS items, and a process to prohibit the purchase and use of high-risk COTS items, when necessary, until mitigation strategies can limit the risk to an acceptable level.”"
F.B.I. Agents Raid South Bend Housing Authority Offices,https://www.nytimes.com,['Neil Vigdor'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/fbi-south-bend-housing-authority-buttigieg.html,"F.B.I. agents raided the offices of the Housing Authority of South Bend, Ind., on Wednesday, the second potential distraction back home for the presidential campaign of the city’s mayor, Pete Buttigieg.

No one was arrested during the raid, in which evidence collection teams visited the housing authority’s headquarters on Alonzo Watson Drive about 1 p.m. with a police officer and United States government trucks.

The agency, which runs nine low-income housing facilities in South Bend and is financed by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been beleaguered by complaints of financial mismanagement for much of the decade.

Such concerns prompted Mr. Buttigieg to replace all six commissioners on the housing authority’s board in 2015."
Richard Neal: Why the House needs Trump’s tax returns,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Richard Neal', 'July At Pm']",07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-my-committee-needs-the-presidents-tax-returns/2019/07/31/05d4505a-b3c8-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html,"Richard E. Neal, a Democrat, represents Massachusetts’s 1st Congressional District in the House and is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

For three decades, the House of Representatives and its Ways and Means Committee have been the site of my life’s work. I never aspired to be a senator or governor or president.

Instead, I learned arcane House rules and sought a position on the Ways and Means Committee because of its tremendous potential to help my district. I have listened to my constituents on matters such as taxes, health care, international trade and Social Security, which are within the committee’s purview. Untold hours have gone into developing legislation and trying to improve, pass or defeat countless bills. That’s the job.

I’d rather hold a roundtable in Pittsfield, Mass., or cross-examine Medicare administrators than pick fights on cable news. Those arguments tend to drive people into their corners, shrinking opportunities to accomplish real results.

I’m an institutionalist. I respect Congress, for all its imperfections. As chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, I am responsible for congressional oversight of the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service’s administration of the federal tax code. The tax code gives the committee chairman the power to request taxpayer information from the IRS. The committee has exercised this power at various times in the past and has never been denied by the IRS or the Treasury Department.

In early April, I requested the president’s tax returns to fulfill a legitimate congressional oversight responsibility: Our voluntary tax-compliance system hinges on the public’s faith that our tax laws are administered fairly and without favor to those in power. The president is unique: No other American has the power to sign bills into law and direct an entire branch of government. That power, and the extent to which the IRS can audit and enforce federal tax laws against a current or future president, merits closer legislative scrutiny.

The IRS has a policy of performing mandatory audits on all sitting presidents and vice presidents. But neither Congress nor the public knows anything about the scope of those audits and whether the president can exert undue influence on the IRS to affect his or her tax treatment. If, for example, the president is already under audit at the time he or she takes office, what happens to that audit? We don’t know.

My committee will consider legislation regarding the mandatory audit program to ensure these audits are conducted fairly and without undue influence from the commander in chief. And, as part of our deliberations, we must review his tax information to better understand the audit program and propose any needed changes.

The law on this is very clear: The IRS “shall furnish ” the Ways and Means Committee with the requested tax returns. Both Democrats and Republicans have made requests for taxpayer information under 6103(f)(1) of the U.S. tax code in the past. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress is entitled to a presumption that its investigatory activities are legitimate, and, in this case, the legitimacy is self-evident. And yet, the administration has stonewalled Congress, ordering the IRS commissioner not to comply with the plain language of the law and setting up a pending legal clash.

I did not pick this fight, but I will not shirk it because it’s about something much bigger than tax forms. This is not an exercise in political retribution: I am not willing to trade the reputation of the Ways and Means Committee for cheap political gains.

The committee is a venerable part of U.S. history, having given the nation Social Security, Medicare, the entire tax code, all of our trade agreements, and numerous programs serving children and families. This committee financed America’s role in both world wars, and its antecedent paid for the Lewis and Clark expedition. I have no intention of squandering my chairmanship of this distinguished panel on petty or malevolent efforts to embarrass the current president.

But in this country, we take seriously the Magna Carta’s precept of the rule of law, not the law of rulers. I will fight with everything I have to reassert Congress’s constitutional mandate to serve as an equal branch of government. This country has thrived through the centuries because we have durable political institutions with a robust system of checks and balances.

Our political institutions won’t continue to function unless we guard them vigilantly, and my colleagues and I in the House majority are committed to doing so. It is the root of our oath to uphold the law."
10-year Treasury yield breaks back below 2% following Fed rate cut,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/us-treasury-yields-higher-after-fed-dampens-hopes-of-more-rate-cuts.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time since 2008.

In approving the cut, the FOMC pointed to ""implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures."" It also characterized economic growth as ""moderate"" and the labor market ""strong,"" but eased policy regardless.

At around 11 a.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit 1.952%, 1 basis point above a recent low of 1.941% hit on July 5. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also lower at 2.465%, also near multiyear lows. The 2-year Treasury note yield, more representative of changes to Fed policy, fell to 1.826%; the rate peaked around 1.96% on Wednesday. Yields move inversely to prices.

The policymaking committee made explicit reference to inflation, a threat to bonds as rising prices chip away at the real value of their fixed payments.

""Overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent,"" the FOMC added. ""Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.""

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also confused investors with comments that the central bank's decision in July did not guarantee additional cuts before the end of 2019.

""We're thinking of it essentially as a midcycle adjustment to policy,"" Powell said following the release of the Fed's decision. ""What I said was it's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts. I didn't say it's just one or anything like that.""

""When you think about rate-cutting cycles, they go on for a long time and the committee's not seeing that,"" he added.

Powell's ""press conference was not as smooth as I know they can be,"" said Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management. ""He clarified that this wasn't the beginning of a long easing cycle and that threw some reality into the market.""

Going forward, ""I think they're also going to be cognizant of global trade tensions, which was sort of the ignition of market's expectations of rate cuts,"" Pollack added. ""[Trade policy's] certainly out of their hands, but the think the Fed allowed the market to push them into these easing expectations.""

The federal funds rate target range is now 2%–2.25%.

The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits increased last week, but the trend in claims remained consistent with tightening labor market conditions.

Claims for state unemployment benefits rose 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 during the week ended July 27, the Labor Department said on Thursday.

EPA proposal scraps limits on coal plant waste,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455386-epa-proposal-scraps-limits-on-coal-plant-waste,"The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed scrapping restrictions on arsenic-laden waste from coal-fired power plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed lifting some regulations on coal ash, the residue left after burning coal, which is filled with hazardous substances that can leach into the water supply and cause health problems.

“I can say without hesitation that this is an extremely dangerous proposal that will do lasting harm to communities near coal ash reuse sites and coal ash waste piles,” said Lisa Evans, senior counsel with Earthjustice.

Coal ash is used in a variety of ways, largely as a replacement for soil. It can be used to create level ground for construction projects or sprinkled over landfills as a protective cover.

But coal ash has been deemed responsible for contaminating water with arsenic, which is linked with some types of cancer.

The latest proposal from the EPA would eliminate restrictions from 2015 that limited coal ash use to 12,400 tons per site.

The Trump administration proposal would allow projects to use as much coal ash as they want but would have to file a demonstration that shows the project won’t cause harm if it’s close to certain features like groundwater or wetlands.

But Evans said that’s not a realistic safeguard.

“That demonstration doesn’t have to be defended to any regulatory agency or be posted for public notice or be written by any engineer or environmental professional,” Evans said. “You’ve got a fairly meaningless demo having to be created.”

The EPA said the regulations would help spur “beneficial use” — the term for new uses for what would otherwise be industry waste.

“Today the Agency is proposing sensible changes that will improve the coal ash regulations and continue to encourage appropriate beneficial use,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerEPA proposal scraps limits on coal plant waste Judge cuts Roundup cancer case payout from billion to million Automakers rebuff Trump, strike fuel efficiency deal with California MORE said in a statement. “These proposed changes will further responsible management of coal ash while protecting human health and the environment.”

The proposal includes some features that would make reporting requirements more accessible to the public, but environmentalists ultimately see the move as a bow to industry.

“Despite compelling and damning scientific evidence highlighting the harm to groundwater from coal ash, and court victories by community groups requiring the EPA to strengthen the 2015 rule, Wheeler is giving this gift to his former employers at the cost of public health,” Earthjustice and the Sierra Club said in a statement. “It is a disgrace to everything the EPA stands for, and we will do everything in our power to stop it.”"

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) In another time, the President of the United States might have called an urgent press conference on Monday morning -- making sure he could command the world's attention -- and issued a stern warning that violent repression of peaceful protesters is intolerable.

After all, what we saw this weekend in Moscow and Hong Kong were alarming signs that a wave of more brutal repression is looming. The regimes in Moscow and Beijing have sent notice that they are about to crush peaceful, popular movements. This should alarm the US president and produce an urgent response.

Instead, President Donald Trump woke up Monday morning prepared to stoke racist sentiment across the United States, tweeting a new barrage of inflammatory messages against prominent African American figures in what has become a familiar pattern : racist tweets from the President, widespread condemnation by the public, doubling down by the President. Trump is making racism his trademark, spending his time energizing racists while decisively removing America from the moral high ground.

Perhaps not coincidentally, this is happening at the time when democracy activists most desperately need a show of support. They could use a strong statement from Washington telling the leaders in Russia and China that the world is watching. That their actions could have consequences. That, at the very least, their position on the global stage is teetering. That the American people stand on the side of those demanding justice.

Consider what happened in Russia, where pro-democracy activists have been protesting for the right to vote after authorities brazenly disqualified opposition candidates for an upcoming municipal election. President Vladimir Putin's approval has been sliding, discontent growing, and the largest protests in years have taken place, even though Russian law now makes it nearly impossible to obtain a protest permit.

This weekend, police sent rows of menacing riot police to break down a peaceful protest, arresting more than a thousand people in Moscow.

Most alarming is what happened to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose very life may well depend on whether the rest of the world makes it clear to the Kremlin that, if he is killed, there will be consequences.

Navalny was arrested earlier in the week after calling for a demonstration. Then, suddenly, on Sunday, he was rushed to a hospital with what the hospital called an ""acute allergic reaction."" He does not suffer from allergies. The news immediately brought to mind the fate of other Kremlin critics who have faced, shall we call it, biochemical issues.

Recall the horrific disfigurement of former Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian politician who dared to challenge Putin's preferred candidate in 2004. He narrowly escaped death after being poisoned with dioxin. He believes the Kremlin was behind the assassination attempt.

The Kremlin stands accused of poisoning other Putin critics, even exiled ones, including Alexander Litvinenko, who died from radioactive polonium poisoning blamed on Putin by a UK inquest, and Sergei Skripal and his daughter, poisoned in Salisbury, England. British authorities have accused two Russian men of carrying out the hit, saying they belong to Russian military intelligence. The men say they were simply tourists visiting Salisbury.

Other Kremlin critics have died mysterious deaths. The popular politician and Putin critic Boris Nemtsov, shot in front of the Kremlin, former ally Boris Berezovsky, who supposedly killed himself, and many, many courageous journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists counts 28 Russian journalists killed since 2000, the year Putin rose to power.

Navalny's personal doctor says he has been taken back out of the hospital into prison against her advice. She thinks he has been poisoned. Perhaps it was a warning, perhaps an attempt on his life. Navalny, back in prison on Monday, suggested he may have been poisoned while in police custody.

A well-articulated warning from Washington might just save him and others.

A warning to Beijing is just as urgent. For weeks the people of Hong Kong have waged peaceful protests against a government that is supposed to be independent of China under the ""one country, two systems"" model agreed when the territory reverted to China from the UK.

Protests started against a bill that would have allowed extradition to China, where the legal system is beholden to the Communist Party-controlled regime. The protests have been massive, bringing out as many as two million people in a territory of just seven million, underscoring how widespread and intense the distrust of China is.

Beijing has been growing impatient, and the signs are nothing short of ominous.

Last week, the spokesman for the Chinese military, Wu Qian, issued a chilling reminder that China's military forces could be quickly deployed inside Hong Kong if the territory's authorities request it. Then he described the protests in a way that made very clear Beijing is running out of patience. The protesters' behavior, Wu declared, ""is intolerable.""

That was Wednesday. On Sunday, Hong Kong police clad in riot gear launched a harsh crackdown against demonstrators. CNN's Anna Coren, in the midst of the mayhem , was visibly horrified. The protesters were completely peaceful, she said.

On Monday, China issued its sternest warning yet, accusing pro-democracy protesters of committing "" evil and criminal acts .""

One shudders to think what might come next at the hands of the regime that massacred protesters at Tiananmen Square 30 years ago.

When the tanks rolled in Tiananmen, then-President George H.W. Bush wasted no time publicly condemning the regime, as have other American presidents who spoke firmly and decisively against repression.

Sure, America has failed many times, and its own history is far from immaculate, but the words of a credible American president can help draw the moral lines. It may or may not stay the hand of a tyrant, it may or may not prevent a massacre. But at the very least it helps clarify what is and is not legitimate conduct in our time. Even if it fails to stop a catastrophe in progress, it may give second thoughts to another tinpot tyrant watching from a distance.

How tragic for America and for the world that Washington today is dominated by a President who thinks nothing matters more than his personal fate and believes inciting racist hatreds at home tops the national agenda."
Democrats agree to September legal arguments in effort to access secret Mueller evidence,https://www.politico.com,['Kyle Cheney'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/31/democrats-secret-mueller-evidence-1442700,"Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee say accessing Robert Mueller’s files is necessary to determine whether they will ultimately recommend articles of impeachment against the president. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO legal Democrats agree to September legal arguments in effort to access secret Mueller evidence

House Democrats weighing the impeachment of President Donald Trump have agreed to a two-month schedule of court filings with the Justice Department in an effort to obtain special counsel Robert Mueller’s grand jury material.

Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, who say accessing Mueller’s files is necessary to determine whether they will ultimately recommend articles of impeachment against Trump, agreed to the timetable, which would likely result in an October ruling. Though that’s a reasonable pace for legal argumentation, it’s sure to frustrate Democrats agitating for Trump’s impeachment, who have argued that the closer their effort gets to presidential primary season, the more impractical it becomes.

Story Continued Below

There were indications Wednesday that the Justice Department intends to oppose the Judiciary Committee’s effort to get the grand jury information. Though Democrats had pleaded with Attorney General William Barr to support their effort to access Mueller’s material, a lawyer for the Justice Department described herself as “counsel for Defendant” in a notice to the judge. A second department lawyer in the matter simply described herself as “counsel for the department.”

Under the schedule, jointly proposed by the committee and Justice Department, department lawyers would file their first brief in the matter by Sept. 13 and the Judiciary Committee would reply by Sept. 30. Justice Department officials said they expected no oral argument would be necessary in the case, but it’s up to the judge — Chief U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia Judge Beryl Howell — to decide. Howell on Wednesday agreed to the briefing schedule proposed by the committee and the department.

Democrats have not voted to formally open an impeachment inquiry against Trump but argued in their effort to obtain Mueller’s grand jury material that they don’t need to take a vote to declare an “impeachment investigation.” It was a rhetorical escalation that Republicans rejected as political theater. But it’s a distinction that Democrats made forcefully in their legal filing, suggesting that there are no formal procedures to determine when and whether the House is considered to be in an active “impeachment inquiry.”

In their filing, Judiciary Committee Democrats indicated that they intend to rely on Mueller’s grand jury material to inform their questioning of crucial witnesses in his investigation — including former White House counsel Don McGahn, who provided damaging testimony to Mueller, describing potential obstruction of justice by Trump. The committee has indicated that it intends to file a lawsuit to enforce a subpoena for McGahn’s testimony this week but has so far held off while last-minute talks continue."
DHS issues hacking security alert for small planes,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kris Van Cleave'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-issues-hacking-security-alert-small-planes-today-2019-07-30/,"Washington — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rare security alert Tuesday for small planes. The alert warns if a hacker gained physical access to certain small planes, they could attach a common device to its wiring. This could provide false flight data including altitude and airspeed, as well as possible access to the autopilot system, potentially leaving a pilot unable to tell whether the reading was accurate and potentially lose control of the aircraft.

""We could do basically anything the plane can do, pretty much anything the pilot could do by himself,"" said Tod Beardsley, director of research at cyber security firm Rapid7.

In a laboratory setting, researchers at Rapid7 were able to hack what's essentially a plane's electronic central nervous system, allowing them to send the erroneous commands. ""I do think it is something of a wake up call. This is something that needs to be taken seriously now rather than later, like after the disaster,"" Beardsley said.

Last year, Homeland Security researchers, who successfully hacked a 757 while it was parked, warned it's only ""a matter of time before a cybersecurity breach on an airline occurs."" DHS is now urging small plane makers to study the cyber security protections car makers added after hackers were able to exploit similar technology on the roads.

The Federal Aviation Administration tells CBS News a ""scenario that involves unrestricted physical access is unlikely"" but these findings are ""an important reminder to remain vigilant."" Rapid7 said it notified the company that built those two systems, but their findings prompted DHS to urge pilots to secure their aircraft and for manufacturers to take a look at options to better secure these systems."
Trump EPA yanks Obama-era proposal to restrict mine development in salmon-rich Bristol Bay region,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/trump-administration-scuttles-epa-proposal-to-restrict-alaska-mine-development-in-bristol-bay-region/,"The Environmental Protection Agency scuttled proposed development restrictions Tuesday on an open-pit mine in the headwaters of Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, which sustains the largest sockeye salmon runs in the world.

The move by Chris Hladick, the EPA’s Seattle-based regional administrator, is part of a broader Trump administration push to proceed with a permitting review for the Pebble Mine, a world-class deposit of gold, molybdenum and copper that — due to its sensitive location — is among the most contested mineral-development projects in Alaska history.

The proposed restrictions date to the Obama administration, and would have sharply limited the amount of wetlands and salmon streams that could have been damaged by disposal of mine wastes. The developer’s CEO — Tom Collier of Pebble Partnership — hailed the EPA action Tuesday as removing a “cloud of uncertainty” by reversing “outrageous federal government overreach.”

“The restrictions would have precluded any meaningful mineral development in the region — period,” said Collier, who credited Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy with encouraging the EPA to abandon the proposal.

The Army Corps of Engineers is now undertaking a permitting review scheduled to be completed next year. State permitting would take another few years, which could enable the mine to begin producing ore by 2026, according to Collier.

The EPA action brought a bitter response from a wide-ranging coalition of passionate opponents that includes commercial fishermen from Washington and elsewhere that join in the summer sockeye harvests, sport anglers, seafood processors, recreation companies, Native groups and environmentalists.

“This comes as we are wrapping up the second largest-recorded salmon harvest in Bristol Bay of 42 million salmon and counting, to feed not only our people but the world. Our people will continue to do whatever it takes to stop this mine,” said Alannah Hurley, executive director of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay.

Pebble was first proposed more than a decade ago, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, a longtime critic of the mine, on Tuesday accused the EPA of a “reckless action” that would threaten the Bristol Bay watershed and the fisheries and maritime economy it supports.

During the Obama administration, the EPA undertook a major review of the mine’s environmental impacts in response to a 2011 request from six Bristol Bay tribes. In 2014, the Seattle regional office used the authority vested by the Clean Water Act to propose tight restrictions that included a cap of 1,100 acres of wetlands, lakes and ponds that could be lost to development and the loss of no more than 5 miles of streams used by salmon or other seagoing fish.

“In simple terms, the infrastructure necessary to mine the Pebble deposit jeopardizes the long-term health and sustainability of the Bristol Bay ecosystem,” said the 2014 document released by the EPA’s Seattle regional office.

Northern Dynasty, the Canadian company that owns Pebble Partnership, contested the EPA’s 2014 finding in a lawsuit settled during the first year of the Trump administration, and allowed the project to proceed with federal permitting. The EPA action Tuesday rescinds the 2014 findings, which Dennis McLerran, who served as the agency’s Seattle-based regional administrator during the Obama administration, said were based on the best available science.

“What is happening now is the decision-making process is being politicized and removed from the science,” McLerran said in a Tuesday interview.

The permits likely will face legal challenges.

“I think litigation is inevitable,” said Taryn Kiekow Heimer, a senior advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposes the Pebble Mine."

Border Patrol tried to fire him for lying about gun incident. Now he's Trump’s DHS spokesman,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-tried-to-fire-him-for-making-stuff-up-now-he-is-the-dhs-spokesman,"The top Homeland Security spokesman, brought in to serve last month by acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, is a former Border Patrol agent whom U.S. Customs and Border Protection once attempted to fire for faking a crime against himself, according to three CBP officials with first-hand knowledge of the incident and a fourth who is also aware of it.

DHS acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Media Operations Jose “Lu” Maheda was terminated by Border Patrol a year into his service during the 1990s. Since then, as one official put it, he has “failed up,” getting his job back and eventually becoming a regional Border Patrol spokesman. And now he is the top spokesman for the 240,000-person department because of his connection to McAleenan.

“The guy’s a proven liar and can’t testify in court and yet he’s a spokesman for DHS,” charged one CBP official who worked with Maheda at the time of the incident. “He is 100% a McAleenan sycophant.”

Under the 1972 Giglio v. United States decision, a witness whose integrity has been called into question cannot testify in court.

While working at the Border Patrol station in Nogales, Arizona during his first year on the job in 1996, Maheda left his loaded gun on the front seat of his work vehicle and set out on foot.

“While he was out — and unbeknownst to him — a supervisor came across the car and saw the” firearm, the official said. “He [Maheda] had failed to secure it, and it was just laying there, and that’s when the supervisor saw it and was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve got to get this out of here.’ So the supervisor pulled the gun out. When Lu got back to the vehicle, he saw the shotgun was missing and didn’t realize the supervisor had taken it. So what he did was, he bust the window out, then went back and reported the shotgun stolen.”

A second official who worked with Maheda at the time confirmed the set of events, as did a third.

“He had a longarm go missing from his Border Patrol four-wheel drive so he busted the window out and made a notification that it was stolen, when it was in fact that an agent had just played a joke on him when he left his door unlocked,” said the third person, who also worked in Tucson at the time.

“There was no squirming out of that one. They had him dead to right,” the first official said.

Another source, a union official with secondhand knowledge of the incident, said the supervisor took the gun out of the vehicle to “safeguard” it, not as a joke. Maheda “broke the window and reported it was stolen,” he said.

While DHS does not comment on specific employee personnel actions, a DHS official provided the following information.

""Over 20 years ago, we can confirm that there was an allegation and subsequent full investigation,"" the official said. ""The employee was afforded due process and since then, the employee has had an exemplary record being promoted throughout the ranks without ill effect.""

Maheda was served termination paperwork a day after the incident. He fought the termination with the help of the National Border Patrol Council and kept his job on what the union official described as a “technicality” because he was issued a termination notice on the last day of routine year-long probation period.

The third official with first-hand knowledge of the incident said the move to provide him the termination paperwork the day after may have been intentional because it gave him a way to fight the decision, since the letter should have been served immediately.

“There were all these rumors that his brother, who was a BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit) agent that was very well thought of — that somebody may have been looking out for the family with that clerical mistake,” the official said.

At the time, Border Patrol agents in their first year could be fired for any reason without being able to appeal the decision or respond to the chief patrol agent’s concerns. A union representative at the time “argued that he was technically no longer on probation because his regular shift had ended before they fired him” and therefore the probation period was technically up, and was able to get an arbitrator to agree, according to the first CBP official. Maheda was reinstated and went to work for the union.

At a certain point in his career at DHS, Maheda began to have ""direct interface"" with McAleenan, who would eventually promote him to his current position.

The third official said Maheda was reprimanded during his work for the internal Border Patrol headquarters division during the 2000s for having “abused travel all over the country basically to install flat screen TVs.”

“He got transferred out of that branch during a bottom-up review that was done by the Border Patrol headquarters staff, led by then Operations Chief Kevin Oaks,” said this source said.

""The United States Border Patrol often conducts reviews and assessments of programs and personnel assignments. During Chief Kevin Oaks’ tenure, the United States Border Patrol restructured several programs and divisions within the Headquarters element, resulting reassignments of multiple personnel and program responsibilities,"" the DHS official said.

The first official described Maheda's promotions as ""one of those things you just keep scratching your head"" over.

“The Department is proud to include a member of the United States Border Patrol within the Department’s Office of Public Affairs,"" said Andrew Meehan, Acting Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. ""Border Patrol agents have a unique and first-hand knowledge of the impact of the crisis on the southern border and continue to provide thoughtful guidance on how to communicate those challenges to the public.”"
DOJ and FBI Show No Signs of Correcting Past Untruths in Their New Attacks on Encryption,https://www.eff.org,"['Andrew Crocker', 'Nate Cardozo', 'Stephanie Lacambra', 'David Ruiz']",07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/doj-and-fbi-show-no-signs-correcting-past-untruths-their-new-attacks-encryption,"Last week, Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray chose to spend some of their time giving speeches demonizing encryption and calling for the creation of backdoors to allow the government access to encrypted data. You should not spend any of your time listening to them.

Don’t be mistaken; the threat to encryption remains high. Australia and the United Kingdom already have laws in place that can enable those governments to undermine encryption, while other countries may follow. And it’s definitely dangerous when senior U.S. law enforcement officials talk about encryption the way Barr and Wray did.

The reason to ignore these speeches is that DOJ and FBI have not proven themselves credible on this issue. Instead, they have a long track record of exaggeration and even false statements in support of their position. That should be a bar to convincing anyone—especially Congress—that government backdoors are a good idea.

Barr expressed confidence in the tech sector’s “ingenuity” to design a backdoor for law enforcement that will stand up to any unauthorized access, paying no mind to the broad technical and academic consensus in the field that this risk is unavoidable. As the prominent cryptographer and Johns Hopkins University computer science professor Matt Green pointed out on Twitter, the Attorney General made sweeping, impossible-to-support claims that digital security would be largely unaffected by introducing new backdoors. Although Barr paid the barest lip service to the benefits of encryption—two sentences in a 4,000 word speech—he ignored numerous ways encryption protects us all, including preserving not just digital but physical security for the most vulnerable users.

For all of Barr and Wray’s insistence that encryption poses a challenge to law enforcement, you might expect that that would be the one area where they’d have hard facts and statistics to back up their claims, but you’d be wrong. Both officials asserted it’s a massive problem, but they largely relied on impossible-to-fact-check stories and counterfactuals. If the problem is truly as big as they say, why can’t they provide more evidence? One answer is that prior attempts at proof just haven’t held up.

Some prime examples of the government’s false claims about encryption arose out of the 2016 legal confrontation between Apple and the FBI following the San Bernardino attack. Then-FBI Director James Comey and others portrayed the encryption on Apple devices as an unbreakable lock that stood in the way of public safety and national security. In court and in Congress, these officials said they had no means of accessing an encrypted iPhone short of compelling Apple to reengineer its operating system to bypass key security features. But a later special inquiry by the DOJ Office of the Inspector General revealed that technical divisions within the FBI were already working with an outside vendor to unlock the phone even as the government pursued its legal battle with Apple. In other words, Comey’s statements to Congress and the press about the case—as well as sworn court declarations by other FBI officials—were untrue at the time they were made.

Wray, Comey’s successor as FBI Director, has also engaged in considerable overstatement about law enforcement’s troubles with encryption. In congressional testimony and public speeches, Wray repeatedly pointed to almost 8,000 encrypted phones that he said were inaccessible to the FBI in 2017 alone. Last year, the Washington Post reported that this number was inflated due to a “programming error.” EFF filed a Freedom of Information Act request, seeking to understand the true nature of the hindrance encryption posed in these cases, but the government refused to produce any records.

But in their speeches last week, neither Barr nor Wray acknowledged the government’s failure of candor during the Apple case or its aftermath. They didn’t mention the case at all. Instead, they ask us to turn the page and trust anew. You should refuse. Let’s hope Congress does too."

Reagan Calls African Delegates 'Monkeys' in 1971 Call With Nixon,https://www.usnews.com,[],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-07-31/ronald-reagan-calls-african-delegates-monkeys-in-call-with-then-president-richard-nixon,"Then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan speaks with a reporter in 1972. Tapes of Reagan's racist comments in 1971 were originally withheld by the National Archives to protect his privacy. Hulton Archive/Getty Images

On a phone call with then-President Richard Nixon, then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan can be heard disparaging ""monkeys"" from African countries.

The tapes , published in The Atlantic by Tim Naftali, the former director of Nixon's Presidential Library, reveal that Reagan, who later went to become the 40th president of the United States, called Nixon on Oct. 26, 1971 after the United Nations voted to recognize the People's Republic of China.

About six and a half minutes into the phone call, Reagan, a strong defender of Taiwan, seemingly references the way members of the Tanzanian delegation danced after the UN voted to seat the delegation from Beijing instead of Taiwan.

""Last night, I tell you, to watch that thing on television as I did,"" Reagan said to Nixon. ""To see those, those monkeys from those African Countries — damn them, they're still uncomfortable wearing shoes!""

Nixon can be heard laughing as Reagan speaks.

In another phone call later that day, Nixon discusses his conversation with Reagan with then-Secretary of State William Rogers. About 30 seconds into the call, Nixon references Reagan's words.

""As you can imagine,"" Nixon said to Rogers, ""there's [a] strong feeling that we just shouldn't, as [Reagan] said, he saw these ... cannibals on television last night, and he says, 'Christ, they weren't even wearing shoes, and here the United States is going to submit its fate to that,' and so forth and so on.""

Naftali said in The Atlantic that the conversations were recorded by Nixon and later became the responsibility of the Nixon Presidential Library, which he directed from 2007 to 2011. However, when they were released by the National Archives in 2000, Naftali alleges that Reagan's racist comments were withheld to protect the former president's privacy.

In 2018, Naftali requested Nixon's conversations with Reagan be reviewed and the Archives released the complete tapes two weeks ago."
Trump Pick to Oversee Federal Lands Doesn’t Want the Government to Have Any,http://nymag.com,['Matt Stieb'],07-31-2019,2019,7,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/trump-pick-to-oversee-federal-lands-doesnt-want-any.html,"A ridge in Bears Ears National Monument, which the Trump administration reduced by 201,876 acres. Photo: George Frey/Getty Images

With around 640 million acres in the bank, the federal government controls about 28 percent of the land in these United States, with the bulk of that lying in the West: Over half the ground in Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Alaska, and Oregon is under federal oversight. But the president’s new appointee for Bureau of Land Management, the office that oversees most of that property, isn’t too keen on the government’s role in managing land.

Earlier this week, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt made Wyoming native, attorney, and Reagan administration alum William Perry Pendley the acting director of the BLM. Since serving in the Gipper’s Energy and Interior departments, Pendley has sued Interior on behalf of an oil prospector, tried to slash protections for endangered species — including cutting laws protecting grizzly bears in national parks — and attempted to make it easier to build on federal land.

In addition to his political view on public lands — in 2016, he wrote in the National Review that “[t]he Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold” — Pendley has some personal relationships that add concerns to his nomination. The Washington Post explains:

Pendley’s legal ties, as well as his policy positions, have attracted scrutiny. Environmental groups are pressing Interior to formally recuse Pendley from any involvement in a court case in which he is still the counsel of record representing an aging businessman, Sidney Longwell and his small company Solenex.

Solenex purchased a 6,247-acre lease in northwest Montana in 1982 during the Reagan administration for about $1 an acre. Longwell wants permission to build a six-mile service road and bridge over the Two Medicine River on lands considered sacred by the Blackfeet Tribe. Interior wants to cancel the lease. He would use the road to bring in drilling rigs and other oil exploration equipment.

“The Department’s career ethics professionals are working closely with Mr. Pendley and will advise him as necessary,” an Interior official said.

Pendley has also blasted former Interior secretary Ryan Zinke for not doing enough to open up public lands to private development. In another article for the National Review published in 2017, Pendley criticized Zinke for not reducing national monuments at the rate he deemed necessary: “Instead of doing as asked [by the Trump administration], Secretary Zinke recommended decreasing the size of only four of the most blatantly illegal national monuments while leaving the boundaries of all the others standing with mollycoddle language, which will soon get stricken by environmentalists.” That Zinke reduced only two national monuments wasn’t enough: Pendley rejected that Zinke proposed to make the Badger-Two Medicine preserve in Montana a national monument, an area Solenex wanted to explore for drilling.

Earlier this week, President Trump nominated John Ratcliffe to become the new director of National Intelligence, despite Ratcliffe’s consistent doubt in the efficacy of the intelligence community’s findings on Russia. That the administration has proposed another nominee to deregulate and dismantle the department he runs should now be expected as the norm."
Department of Energy Authorizes LNG Exports from the Gulf LNG Liquefaction Project in Mississippi,https://www.energy.gov,[],,,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-authorizes-lng-exports-gulf-lng-liquefaction-project-mississippi,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy today issued an order to Gulf LNG Liquefaction Company, LLC (GLLC) approving exports of domestically produced liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Gulf LNG Liquefaction Project, which will be located in Jackson County, Mississippi, near the city of Pascagoula. The Gulf LNG Liquefaction Project, owned 50-percent by Kinder Morgan’s Southern Gulf LNG Company, LLC, will be built at the site of the Gulf LNG Terminal, an existing import terminal owned by Gulf LNG Energy, LLC.

“This announcement advances the Trump administration’s commitment to energy security here at home and for our friends abroad,” said Secretary Rick Perry. “Increased amounts of U.S. LNG on the world market benefit the American economy, American workers, and consumers and help make the air cleaner around the globe.”

Under the order signed, GLLC will have authority to export up to 1.53 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas as LNG from the proposed Gulf LNG Liquefaction Project. GLLC is authorized to export this LNG by vessel to any country with which the U.S. does not have a free trade agreement (FTA) requiring national treatment for trade in natural gas, and with which trade is not prohibited by U.S. law or policy. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authorized GLLC to site, construct, and operate the Project on July 16, 2019.

“The U.S. is in another year of record-setting natural gas production,” said Steven Winberg, Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy. “I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing its part to bring about an efficient regulatory system that allows for additional U.S. energy to find its way into the global market.”

Including today’s announcement, the Department of Energy has approved 34.52 Bcf/d of exports in the form of LNG and compressed natural gas to non-free trade agreement countries. Of this approved amount, approximately 14 Bcf/d is in various stages of operation and construction, with four export projects currently operating, and two more expected to come online later this year.

Increased natural gas production and LNG exports from the U.S. continue to enhance global energy security while stimulating domestic economic development and job creation. U.S. LNG export capacity, currently at approximately six billion cubic feet per day, is set to grow to over 10 billion cubic feet per day by the end of 2020. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects a continued increase in domestic natural gas production, with an average dry natural gas production rate of 91.4 Bcf/d in 2019 and 92.8 Bcf/d in 2020, both new records.

Justice OKs Nexstar-Tribune Merger with Divestitures,https://www.broadcastingcable.com,['John Eggerton'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/justice-oks-nexstar-tribune-merger-with-divestitures,"Delrahim says he has been pleased with companies' cooperation

Nexstar and Tribune have settled with the Justice Department to get their proposed $6.4 billion merger approved.

The FCC must still complete its public interest review of the merger, which goes beyond antitrust issues.

Specifically, Justice filed a civil antitrust suit against the deal in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Wednesday (July 31) , but at the same time filed the settlement that, if accepted by the court and they almost always are, would resolve the suit bcause Justice says the spin-offs remedy the competitive harms--higher retrans and spot prices--that are alleged in the complaint.

Related: More Than 120 Nexstar Stations Dark on DirecTV

The broadcasters have agreed to divest TV stations in 13 markets to get that approval, which was based in part on the assertion that without those, the combined company ""would likely charge cable and satellite companies higher retransmission consent fees to carry the combined company’s broadcast stations, resulting in higher monthly cable and satellite bills for millions of Americans,"" as well as higher spot prices in the divestiture markets.

Justice has been looking at spot prices in TV advertising, including settling with Nexstar and other broadcast groups over their sharing of competitively sensitive information. That investigation stemmed from its review of Sinclair's effort to buy the Tribune stations.

Justice has concluded for the purposes of this and other mergers in the space that cable and digital are not sufficient competitors to be included in the relevant product market, meaning it is focused on the impact of deals on the TV spot market irrespective of the other outlets, which it says are not sufficient substitutes.

Nexstar and Tribune had already told the FCC it would be spinning off stations in most of those markets anyway, but in Indianapolis it had asked to be allowed to retain Tribune's existing pair of top four stations. That ask is now moot.

“Without the required divestitures, Nexstar’s merger with Tribune threatens significant competitive harm to cable and satellite TV subscribers and small businesses,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “I am pleased, however, that we have been able to reach a resolution of the Division’s concerns, thanks in part to the parties’ commitment to engage in good faith settlement talks from the outset of our investigation.”

That was in contrast to the government's view that Sinclair had been recalcitrant in negotiations over that broadcaster's aborted attempt to purchase the Tribune stations

The settlement also resolves challenges by the attorney's general of Illinois, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

The markets are Davenport, Iowa; Des Moines, Iowa; Ft. Smith, Arkansas; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Hartford, Connecticut; Huntsville, Alabama; Indianapolis, Indiana; Memphis, Tennessee; Norfolk, Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

Nexstar will have to sell either one of its stations, or one of Tribune's, in each of those markets.

""Nexstar now becomes the nation's largest broadcast group,"" said Adonis Hoffman, chairman of Business in the Public Interest, which consults broadcaster and others. ""In addition to the reward comes great responsibility to lead on the major challenges affecting the broadcast industry. The expectations have been raised both on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill where issues such as STELAR, retransmission, diversity and media ownership are still in play."""
Department of Energy Announces $14 Million for Fusion Energy Sciences Research,https://www.energy.gov,[],,,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-announces-14-million-fusion-energy-sciences-research,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $14 million in funding for 10 university-led research projects using the DIII-D National Fusion Facility. A major goal of the research is to develop methods of sustaining steady-state or continuous operation of fusion reactors, an essential step toward eventually making nuclear fusion a practical energy source.

“Fusion remains one of the world’s most promising potential sources of energy,” said Under Secretary for Science Paul Dabbar. “This research—aimed at achieving steady-state operation of fusion reactors—will be an important milestone on the road to sustainable energy from fusion.”

The research focuses on high-priority challenges in “magnetic confinement” of plasma (a hot mixture of ions and free electrons) on the pathway toward eventual development of a contained, self-sustaining fusion reaction. The research will be performed on the DIII-D tokamak, the largest magnetically confined plasma facility in the United States. DIII-D is a DOE Office of Science user facility in San Diego, operated by General Atomics.

Projects range from developing new means of controlling plasma instabilities, to improving diagnostics, to advancing understanding of the material erosion that takes place inside fusion reactors.

Projects were selected by competitive peer review under the DOE Funding Opportunity Announcement, “Collaborative Fusion Energy Research in The DIII-D National Program,” sponsored by the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences within DOE’s Office of Science. Total Fiscal Year 2019 funding is $6.7 million for projects lasting up to three years in duration, with outyear funding contingent on congressional appropriations.

EPA says cleanup of arsenic-laced Minneapolis Superfund site is mostly complete,http://www.startribune.com,"['Greg Stanley', 'Greg.Stanley Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/epa-says-cleanup-of-arsenic-laced-minneapolis-superfund-site-is-mostly-complete/513463092/,"After more than a decade of cleanup efforts and testing, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is ready to essentially shut down a Superfund site in south Minneapolis where industrial arsenic had contaminated the soil surrounding about 600 homes.

The East Phillips neighborhood site, near Hiawatha Avenue and E. 28th Street, has been on the EPA’s list of priorities under its Superfund program for years after extremely high arsenic levels were found in many of the yards surrounding an old rail line.

Remediation efforts have been almost entirely finished since 2011, when the EPA completed a $25 million project to dig up and replace most of the contaminated soil. A scheduled review conducted in April found that the soil poses no threat to humans or the environment and that it’s time to take the vast majority of the neighborhood off the priority list.

“The remedy is functioning as intended,” the review said.

The EPA plans to keep just nine properties on the cleanup list, where homeowners have refused to allow soil tests. The agency will continue conducting regular reviews until all nine are tested and remediated.

With the soil safe, there’s really no reason to keep the rest of the neighborhood on the list, said Cathy Villas-Horns, supervisor of the incident response unit for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.

1930s-1960s: Arsenic blows in from a neighboring pesticide manufacturer. 2000s: EPA scientists find high arsenic levels in local soil, begin excavating and replacing it. 2011: EPA announces most yards have been cleaned up.

“Except for those nine properties, the cleanup has been completed,” Villas-Horns said.

Regulators believe that wind carried the arsenic into the neighborhood over the course of three decades from a site where the now-defunct Reade Manufacturing Co. had been storing, producing and dumping an arsenic-based insecticide from the 1930s until the 1960s.

In the early and mid-2000s, the EPA and Agriculture Department tested the soil of more than 3,500 houses, day-care centers and parks, as well as a cemetery in the area, finding unsafe levels of arsenic in more than 600 properties. By 2011, the two agencies had spent more than $25 million, largely from federal economic stimulus money, tearing out the yards and removing at least 1 foot of topsoil in each of the contaminated properties. They poured in clean topsoil and reseeded each lawn with grass.

There were roughly 30 holdouts in 2011 — properties where owners refused to grant permission to test their lawns. Over the past eight years, the EPA has whittled that number down to the nine who continue to deny permission.

Minnesota has 25 sites on the EPA Superfund priority list, which serves as a roster of contaminated areas that are eligible for federal cleanup funding. It primarily helps EPA managers decide where to focus limited funds. The site’s removal from the Superfund list “does not in any way alter EPA’s right to take enforcement actions, as appropriate,” the agency said in a statement.

If more contaminants are found, the EPA could place the area back on the list.

The state keeps its own list of cleanup priorities for the Superfund sites in Minnesota, including the former Reade Manufacturing property itself, at 2800 Hiawatha Av. The EPA decision will not affect the state’s ongoing groundwater cleanup and monitoring efforts at that property, which is a now a business center, Villas-Horns said.

Neighbors still worry

Some residents expressed concern Wednesday about potential consequences of taking the neighborhood off the Superfund list, saying the area is far from clean.

“If anything deserved the designation of a Superfund site, this neighborhood did and still does,” said Brad Pass of the East Phillips Improvement Coalition.

Properties in the area, such as the former Roof Depot immediately west of the Reade site, are slated for redevelopment, Pass said. But the building and asphalt parking lots may have been built on top of potentially polluted soil, trapping contaminants there for years.

Once those structures are torn down, Pass said, he’s worried there may be arsenic underneath that is once again blown into the neighborhood.

“Although they have remediated certain lots, this is going to open up tremendous potential for spreading this arsenic all over the place,” Pass said."

In 2015, Cook and the TSA reached a settlement in a lawsuit with Sonya Labosco, a former air marshal supervisor who accused him of sexual harassment, physical assault and retaliation, North Carolina TV station Fox46 reported in October 2018. The settlement was reportedly worth six figures, the station reported, but it did not require Cook, who denied the accusations, to admit wrongdoing.

In an interview with the station, Labosco claimed that Cook had “held his hands over his erection in his pants” at a party hosted by another TSA employee in 2009 and “put his hand behind my neck and tried to kiss me on the mouth.” Cook also “said he ‘has eight inches of c― waiting on you any time you want it,’” Labosco told the station.

Labosco also alleged that Cook suggested he could help her “move up the ladder” in exchange for sexual favors and that he demoted her when she rejected his advances. Lobosco also said that Cook once “grabbed my arm, twisted it really hard, left fingerprints on my arm and tried to pull me out” of a meeting room because she didn’t leave quickly enough.

“He told me to get the f― out of the room. I better get the f― out now,” she told Fox46.

Cook denied wrongdoing after Labosco filed a federal lawsuit and a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the TSA said that it investigated Labosco’s claims but found them unsupported, Fox46 reported last year. The agency did reprimand him for cursing and said it found those actions “unacceptable.”

The EEOC, however, found that, “at a minimum, [Cook] placed his hands upon [Labosco] and grabbed her arm,” according to Fox46, which also reported that Labosco’s husband witnessed Cook’s attempt to kiss her.

A month after the claim was settled, Cook was promoted to a higher position inside the TSA, Fox46 reported. At the time, Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) called the promotion “outrageous” and said that people like Cook have “no business in our modern-day federal government.”

“TSA thoroughly investigated the allegations of physical misconduct when they were brought to its attention. TSA does not comment on personnel actions,” the agency told The Daily Beast in a statement last year.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to phone and email requests for comment.

Cook has previously served as an air marshal and a Border Patrol agent, and in various capacities across the federal government, including in Homeland Security’s counterterrorism units, according to McDonnell’s announcement email.

They are among those who need mental health care services more than ever -- veterans dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and other conditions. But the system that was supposed to help them has fallen behind, according to an Office of Inspector General report released last week.The report said veterans seeking outpatient mental health care at the New Mexico Veterans Affairs Health Care System, based in Albuquerque, faced longer than acceptable wait times -- in one instance as long as four months, according to the report. The OIG report also said the Albuquerque center saw high rates of clinical appointment cancellations and that staff did not make effective use of the electronic wait list system.New Mexico VA Health Services Director Andrew Welch, who oversees the hospital, said his office had been working to fix the issues before the OIS report was released July 23.""We recognize that we had some challenges with some of the scheduling things with our veterans,"" Welch said. A mental health summit held at the New Mexico Veterans Memorial in Albuquerque furthered the discussion on how to better meet the needs of veterans. Health care providers, representatives from congressional offices and nonprofit groups attended, including U.S. Navy veteran Ken O'Keefe, who served in the Vietnam War.O'Keefe said more could always be done to help veterans suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, or what he refers to as ""combat stress.""""When you send somebody to war, you don't get the same person back if you get them back at all,"" O'Keefe said.Welch said his office is working to resolve the reported issues by bringing in more staff and improving its Telemental Health program, which allows veterans to access care remotely by using technology -- a method particularly helpful for veterans who live in rural portions of the state.The VA also encourages any veterans who need to talk to someone to to call the Veterans Crisis Line at 1-800-273-8255."
Democratic senator vows to fight Trump Interior nominee after requesting perjury investigation,https://thehill.com,[],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455519-dem-senator-vows-to-fight-trump-interior-nominee-after-requesting,"A Democratic senator is working to block a Trump nominee from serving as the top lawyer for the Department of the Interior and calling for an investigation after the nominee appeared to lie to lawmakers during his confirmation hearing about the department's public records policy.

Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenDem senator vows to fight Trump Interior nominee after requesting perjury investigation Democrats raise questions about how Ratcliffe would approach election security On The Money: Fed poised to give Trump boost with rate cut | Parties unable to reach deal in Trump tax return lawsuit | New York opens investigation into Capital One data breach MORE (D-Ore.) is requesting a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into Daniel Jorjani, currently the top lawyer at Interior who was nominated to officially take over as solicitor for the department.

“Attempts by political appointees at the Interior Department to delay, stonewall and otherwise inhibit public and Congressional oversight are totally unacceptable,” Wyden said in a statement. “I cannot allow Mr. Jorjani’s nomination to proceed. I will object to any unanimous consent agreement to consider his nomination.”

Jorjani’s confirmation hearing was already a notable one, given that he was already connected to numerous issues being internally investigated by the Interior’s Office of the Inspector General.

The man nominated to lead that office, Mark Greenblatt, testified alongside Jorjani that day.

But during the hearing, senators became annoyed by Jorjani’s responses to their questions, particularly those that inquired about a new policy at Interior that allows political appointees to review public records requested through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Jorjani told lawmakers, “I myself don’t review FOIAs or make determinations.”

That comment has already spurred a request for an investigation from one environmental group, but Wyden’s letters asked both the Interior’s watchdog and the DOJ to investigate. They argue that cannot be true given Jorjani’s role overseeing FOIAs for the department.

Wyden, who pressed Jorjani for details on how the review process for political appointees works, say documents from the department show political appointees were given power “well beyond the written policy Mr. Jorjani cited.”

Interior said they believed Jorjani would still be confirmed.

""Dan Jorjani has a solid record of honorably serving the American people,"" spokeswoman Molly Block said in a statement to The Hill. ""The U.S. Department of the Interior is the only Department who has never had a Senate confirmed lawyer under the Trump Administration. Given this fact, we’re confident the Senate will prioritize the confirmation of this highly qualified individual who has been leading transparency efforts at the Department when they return in September.""

Jorjani is not just in hot water for his comments at the hearing but also for written responses he sent afterward, which repeatedly directed Wyden to get in touch with Interior’s congressional liaison for more information.

“I cannot a recall a nominee ever coming through this committee and responding to my requests for information by telling me to go ask somebody else,” Wyden said the day Jorjani was voted out of the Senate Natural Resources Committee.

All Democrats on the committee voted against Jorjani’s nomination.

Court documents allege that Emmit Marshall, 52, owner of the Alliance School of Trucking (AST), along with his co-defendant Robert Waggoner, 56, who served as the school’s director, recruited eligible veterans under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.



Marshall and Waggoner convinced veterans to enroll in their school by telling them “they could collect housing and other fees from the VA without attending the programs,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California.



Marshall told FreightWaves on July 31 that his trucking school is still open for business, but is no longer accepting veterans as students.



Knowing that the vast majority of veterans enrolled at AST did not intend to attend any portion of the programs the trucking school offered, which included a 160-hour Tractor Trailer and Safety class and a 600-hour Select Driver Development program, Marshall and Waggoner “created and submitted fraudulent enrollment certifications,” according to Marshall’s plea agreement.



Marshall and Waggoner also created student files that contained “bogus documents,” prosecutors allege.



Once AST became aware of the investigation, Marshall, Waggoner and others at the trucking school “removed fraudulent documents from student files, and Marshall later ordered that these files be destroyed,” Marshall’s plea agreement states.



Over a four-year period, court documents claim the VA paid AST approximately $2.3 million in tuition and fee payments for veterans who didn’t attend classes. The VA also paid around $1.9 million in educational benefits directly to veterans who did not attend classes at AST.



Marshall is scheduled to be sentenced on November 18. He faces a statutory maximum sentence of 100 years in federal prison. Waggoner is scheduled to go to trial on February 25, 2020.

DHS religious violence prevention task force leader warns of ‘flash to bang’ trend in U.S.,https://www.kcra.com,"['Mark Albert', 'Https', 'Www.Facebook.Com', 'Chief National Investigative Correspondent']",07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.kcra.com/article/dhs-warns-of-flash-to-bang-trend-in-us/28566439,"Advertisement DHS religious violence prevention task force leader warns of ‘flash to bang’ trend in U.S. ‘The first responder is the member of the community,’ he says Share Shares Copy Link Copy

In his first interview since being appointed co-chair of a new national task force to combat a rise in attacks against houses of worship, former law enforcement officer Paul Goldenberg warned of a startling increase in social media-fueled encouragement to commit violence, what he described as “flash to bang” behaviors that alert congregations can learn to spot. ""The next attack isn't necessarily going to be stopped by a SWAT team or a police officer. The first responder is the member of the community,” Goldenberg told the Hearst Television National Investigative Unit. Today, the Department of Homeland Security’s new task force for the Prevention of Targeted Violence Against Faith-Based Communities kicks off a nationwide listening tour composed of site visits to cities scarred by religious-based attacks or those areas that have successfully created ways to help prevent it. Goldenberg, who also led task forces focused on foreign fighters and cybersecurity during the Obama administration and who is currently a senior fellow at Rutgers University’s Miller Center for Community Protection and Resilience, says the task force plans to visit locations from coast to coast. A list of specific dates has not yet been released. ""We want to understand what are the tools, what are the resources, what are the best practices, what are the lessons learned, so we can keep our houses of worship safer,” Goldenberg said.Protecting the flock According to the official tasking order from Acting D.H.S. Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan, the 12-person task force will develop recommendations to keep houses of worship ""safe, secure, and resilient."" Walking in front of a church in Northwest Washington, D.C., recently, Goldenberg said he did not want to see armed troops in front of houses of worship in America. The National Investigative Unit last month showed how a first-of-its-kind private anti-terror network, funded by a millionaire philanthropist named Paul Miller, is seeking to train congregations in the U.S. and in Europe on how to prevent and respond to attacks on churches, synagogues, mosques and temples. The FBI says religious-based hate crimes are up 23 percent in the U.S. When asked about the rise in such attacks, Goldenberg responded: “More needs to be done across the board.” ‘Flash to bang’Goldenberg described a growing awareness in law enforcement circles of a concept known as “flash to bang.” “We now have a segment of our society that, through social media sites, are literally egging each other on from what's called flash to bang,” he said. “Flash meaning that they're sharing their ideologies … and others are egging them on and some of them, unfortunately, are going from flash to bang. They’re taking up arms ... They are entering these houses of worship and they are involved and engaged in mass killings unlike anything we have seen.” Goldenberg says the task force wants to stop the level of attacks against houses of worship across the Atlantic from coming here. ""The religious institutions in Europe are the canaries in a mine.""‘Canaries in a mine’ Chief Amrani Saad of the Belgium Federal Police knows that all too well. Saad is the highest-ranking Muslim law enforcement official in Europe and has helped investigate religious-based attacks in his country. “Law enforcement alone will never ever solve this issue of violence far right groups and so forth,” Saad said during an interview in June outside an Atlantic City, New Jersey, synagogue. “We are part of the solution, we are not the magical bullet or the solution to this issue.”Religious leaders, community leaders and family members must take part, he said. Recommendations from the DHS task force are due to the secretary of Homeland Security in 90 days. Know of innovative ways communities are using to try and prevent attacks on houses of worship?

US Defense Dept. to Experiment With Blockchain-Based Security,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Crypto Fan', 'Masao Akimoto', 'Mystellar Org']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-defense-dept-to-experiment-with-blockchain-based-security,"The United States Department of Defense (DoD) is pursuing blockchain solutions for cybersecurity as part of its digital modernization strategy.

The DoD released plans for blockchain tech in its four-year roadmap on July 12, entitled “DoD Digital Modernization Strategy: DoD Information Resource Management Strategic Plan FY19–23.”

According to the report, the DoD’s research branch, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is currently engaged in at least two exploratory blockchain projects focused on cybersecurity.

First, DARPA is experimenting with blockchain in order to construct a new — or improved — communication and transaction platform. Stated intentions for this platform include communications between units and headquarters as well as between intelligence officers and the Pentagon.

Second, DARPA is attempting to create an “unhackable code” with blockchain technology, citing blockchain’s ability to gather intel on bad actors who attempt to hack into databases.

DARPA’s blockchain workshop

As reported by Cointelegraph, DARPA previously announced plans to host a two-day blockchain workshop in February. DARPA was particularly keen on examining permissionless consensus protocols. The organization also noted that there were potentially valuable use cases for blockchain in data storage, saying:

“Technologies for distributed consensus protocols have been revolutionized by their prominent role in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. These technologies have dramatic implications for the security and resilience of critical data storage and computation tasks, including for the Department of Defense.”

In December 2018, DoD officials examined how blockchain technology could help emergencies responses in disaster situations in a presentation hosted by the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support’s Continuous Process Improvement."

Bobby Scott says the US Department of Agriculture concealed data showing that its recent proposed changes to the food stamp program could result in more than 500,000 low-income students losing free meals.

In a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue , Scott, a Virginia Democrat who's the chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, writes that the impact on school meal eligibility was not included in the Trump administration's formal proposal revising who qualifies for the food stamp program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Scott writes that ""the proposed rule will impact not only SNAP eligibility, but will also affect children's eligibility for school meal programs."" The program, Scott noted, ""allows schools to provide free meals to all students in high-poverty communities.""

The congressman writes that his committee's staff learned about the impact on school lunches in a phone briefing with USDA staff and requested that the department revise its proposal to include the estimate and restart the 60-day comment period.

He notes the USDA is required by law to include ""relevant scientific and technical findings"" in proposed rules and says the effect on school meals is an ""important technical finding that must be made public.""

Corn is America’s Largest Crop in 2019,https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Tom Capehart', 'Susan Proper', 'Economic Research Service In', 'Francisco M.', 'Ben Weaver']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/07/29/corn-americas-largest-crop-2019,"Posted by Tom Capehart and Susan Proper, Economic Research Service in Research and Science

Update: In July, USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) collected updated information on 2019 acres planted to corn, cotton, sorghum, and soybeans in 14 states. NASS previously collected planted acreage information during the first two weeks of June, with the results published in the June 28 Acreage report. Excessive rainfall had prevented planting at the time of the survey, leaving a portion of acres still to be planted for corn in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin; cotton in Arkansas; sorghum in Kansas; and soybeans in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. If the newly collected data justify any changes, NASS will publish updated acreage estimates in the Crop Production report to be released at noon ET on Monday, Aug. 12. It will be available online at www.nass.usda.gov/Publications, and the new numbers will be updated in this blog.

U.S. farmers have planted 91.7 million acres of corn in 2019.

Despite an unusually wet spring followed by an unusually cool June, America’s corn farmers planted even more than they did last year. U.S. farmers have planted 91.7 million acres of corn in 2019, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). That’s about 69 million football fields of corn and 3 percent more corn than last year, far more acres than the next largest crop, soybeans.

USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) publishes a monthly Feed Outlook report that analyzes supply and demand data to provide information on expected prices, production, exports, and feed uses for corn and other feed grains. The following is just some of the information available.

Corn farmers faced one of the most challenging planting seasons in recent memory, and while the corn did get planted, farmers planted much of it later than usual. In early July, 57 percent of the crop was reported to be in good or excellent condition, while last year 75 percent was reported good or excellent by that time. Based on the late start to the crop and the continued cool weather, USDA is forecasting slightly lower yields than last year. At present, however, USDA forecasts that corn supplies will be sufficient to meet demand because farmers have plenty of corn stored from last year’s crop. That ear of corn on the cob you may enjoy at a summer picnic is just one of many uses of corn. Here are a few more:

About a third of America’s corn crop is used for feeding cattle, hogs, and poultry in the U.S. Corn provides the “carbs” in animal feed, while soybeans provide the protein. It takes a couple of bushels of American corn to make corn-fed steak; by some estimates, a beef cow can eat a ton of corn if raised in a feedlot. Both dairy cows and beef cows also consume silage, which is fermented corn stalks and other green plants.

Just over a third of the corn crop is used to make ethanol, which serves as a renewable fuel additive to gasoline. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires that 10% of gasoline be renewable fuel, but you can find E15 (15 percent ethanol) or E85 (85 percent) ethanol in some areas, particularly in the Midwest.

The rest of the corn crop is used for human food, beverages, and industrial uses in the U.S., or exported to other countries for food or feed use. Corn has hundreds of uses. It is used to make breakfast cereal, tortilla chips, grits, canned beer, soda, cooking oil, and bio-degradable packing materials. It’s the key ingredient in the growing medium for life-saving medicines including penicillin. Corn gluten meal is used on flower beds to prevent weeds.

America’s biggest customers are Mexico, South Korea, Japan, and Colombia. U.S. white corn is particularly prized in Mexico and Colombia as a high quality food ingredient, while Japan and South Korea pay a premium for high quality, USDA-inspected feed corn for poultry and beef.

Why does corn have the most acres of any major crop in the U.S.? It can be grown in nearly every State in the U.S. Seed companies provide hybrid, organic, and bio-engineered varieties that are specially bred to be the best for different soil and weather conditions. Seed companies have developed different corn varieties for different end uses, including feed corn, sweet corn, white corn, and popcorn.

You can learn more about corn from a variety of USDA sources. ERS maintains a feed grains database with historical information on production, trade, prices, livestock feed demand, and many other data items. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) researches insect and weed pests, and new crop varieties. The World Agricultural Outlook Board, part of the Office of the Chief Economist, coordinates economic analysis from across USDA to provide monthly reports on the supply and demand of corn and other crops, while the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and ERS also publish more detailed analysis of specific issues like ethanol usage and foreign demand for feed and food corn and many other crops."
Lindsey Graham: 'Stunning' if DOJ declined to prosecute James Comey,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-stunning-if-doj-declined-to-prosecute-james-comey,"Sen. Lindsey Graham said it is ""stunning"" if Attorney General William Barr declined to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey for likely leaking classified information.

During an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, the Senate Judiciary chairman was asked to react a report Wednesday evening that focused on Comey's leak of one of his memos describing an interaction he had with President Trump.

""If Bill Barr decided not to prosecute on disclosing the memos, I accept his judgment. I’ve known him for 20 years,"" Graham said.

The South Carolina Republican said he has ""no desire"" for Barr to be like Robert Mueller, referring to his criticism of the former special counsel's prosecution of Trump's associates during the Russia investigation.

""I want him to do what he thinks is right by the law and not prosecute anybody if you don't think the case is there, because somebody else got mistreated is no reason to continue that practice,"" Graham said. ""If it’s true, and we will know pretty soon, it’s stunning, beyond stunning.""

Graham predicted an inspector general report will come out in a ""few weeks.""

The Hill reported Inspector General Michael Horowitz reached out to prosecutors about one of the memos Comey leaked to a friend, which detailed a conversation he had with Trump, after he was fired by Trump in May 2017. Although prosecutors found the watchdog's findings compelling, they decided against prosecution under classified information protection laws because of there being too much uncertainty surrounding Comey's intent. He has denied leaking classified information in his memos.

Comey is also a possible target of Horowitz's separate investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse. It is also likely that Comey's actions as FBI director will be scrutinized during the review of the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, being led by Barr and the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, John Durham.

Graham praised Barr's ""prosecutorial discretion,"" and looked ahead to the other internal investigations that could be news for Comey.

""And if he does bring a charge against Comey after doing this, I'd hate to be Comey,"" he said."
"Trump's trip to his Turnberry resort cost the State Department at least $233K, review finds",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/trump-turnberry-resort-cost-state-department-oig/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department spent at least $233,732 on President Donald Trump's July 2018 trip to his Turnberry resort in Scotland, according to a letter from the department's inspector general obtained by CNN.

The July 22 letter from Inspector General Steve Linick to Democratic Sens. Tom Carper of Delaware and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland details only the costs that were paid by the State Department and not reimbursed. Among the costs were more than $42,000 in overtime, more than $111,000 in hotels, more than $28,000 in rental cars and more than $51,000 in temporary duty costs, according to the letter.

The OIG review was not able to determine how much the resort gained in profit from the visit. The State Department spent $728 on three rooms for two nights at the Trump-owned property. According to the letter, the department said they were used by the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, his wife and his chief of protocol. The department said that the Trump Turnberry's rate was ""the lowest of all the hotels being utilized for this VIP visit"" and offered ""a fair and reasonable rate to the Government,"" according to document cited in the letter.

The Hill was the first to report on Linick's letter.

The State Department OIG review was prompted by a call for investigation made by the three Democratic lawmakers shortly after the President's trip. They also requested an inquiry from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General. The department OIG did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Monday.

A man’s immigration case is in limbo as officials decide if he’ll receive an order of deportation. Marco Aviles Gutierrez was just 5 when he arrived in the U.S. “I grew up here when I was a kid, and I’ve never been to Mexico,” he said. Now 26, Gutierrez has a mental disability, relying on his family for help. “I got my mom here,"" he said. “I’ve got nobody in Mexico who can take care of me.”He’s supposed to be protected under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program for people who were brought to the country illegally as children. Now, there’s an issue. His attorney, Genevra Alberti, said his case was closed, but a new order from the U.S. attorney general reopened it and many others by saying judges can’t administratively close cases. “This case really illustrates how messed up things are right now,” Alberti said. “Now we’re stuck in this position of what do we do with this case?” Alberti said they’ve been told since judges can’t close the case, the best option is accepting a deportation order from the Department of Homeland Security but not worrying about it since Gutierrez would be protected by DACA.“There’s no sense in having this order sitting there making his life miserable, wondering what’s going to happen,” Alberti said. “I think it’s not fair,” Gutierrez said. “I might not see my family no more.”For Alberti, it’s an example of quick policy changes creating issues for both the government and immigrants.“It’s insanity is really the best way to put it because literally on a daily basis, something else seems to happen,” she said. “He may ultimately have to return to a country that he does not know.” Gutierrez and Alberti expect to learn more in a late October court hearing. Gutierrez is taking life skills classes now and has hopes of one day attending the University of Missouri - Kansas City."
U.S. Department of Education wants to stop ‘student aid fraud scheme’ where parents give up custody through dubious guardianships,https://chicago.suntimes.com,['Jul'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/7/30/20747979/department-education-stop-student-aid-fraud-scheme-parents-give-up-custody-guardianships,"Federal and state officials say they want to close loopholes that allow families to get need-based financial aid they would not otherwise receive by giving up guardianship of their college-bound children.

The move, they say, could end “potential student aid fraud” when parents turn over guardianship of their children in hopes of obtaining a tuition break.

A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General said the office has recommended modifying the language on federal financial aid forms following disclosure of the tactic, first reported by ProPublica Illinois on Monday. The Wall Street Journal also published a story late Monday about the issue.

“What we can tell you is that we are aware of this issue and suggested to the Federal Student Aid office (FSA) that it add clarifying language to the FSA Handbook that would help close possible avenues for this type of potential student aid fraud,” the inspector general’s spokeswoman said in a statement.

The new language would aim to ensure students involved in this kind of guardianship no longer qualify for aid if they continue to receive medical and financial support from their parents.

The Inspector General’s Office was not aware of any prosecutions to date involving “this specific type of student aid fraud scheme,” the spokeswoman added.

Officials with the Illinois attorney general’s office said Tuesday they also “have concerns” about the practice and will contact the state agency that administers a need-based grant “as we look into the matter further.”

State lawmakers also called for reforms.

ProPublica Illinois reported that dozens of suburban Chicago families, and perhaps many more, have given up legal guardianship of their teenage children to qualify for federal, state and university aid.

The parents — including lawyers, educators and a doctor — turn guardianship of their children over to relatives or friends sometimes months before they turn 18. By doing so, the children can then declare themselves financially independent and qualify for aid they would not otherwise receive.

Andy Borst, director of undergraduate admissions at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said he is glad the practice has been exposed. The university first alerted the Department of Education to these cases in July 2018.

“I’m pleased that this issue has been brought to light and is being discussed widely,” Borst said. “I am hopeful that additional action can be taken to close this loophole.”

While ProPublica Illinois identified close to four dozen families in the northern suburbs of Lake County alone that filed similar petitions for guardianship, the practice appears to be more widespread. An attorney who has filed petitions in Lake County said she has also filed similar cases in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Will and McHenry counties.

ProPublica Illinois is continuing to investigate.

Illinois lawmakers on Tuesday also called for an examination of any state laws or rules that allow wealthy families to take advantage of the Illinois Monetary Award Program, or MAP, grant. Some 82,000 students were eligible for the grant last year but did not receive it because there wasn’t enough money. The grant, up to about $5,000, is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis.

“It looks like theft from taxpayers and theft from students and families who legitimately deserve need-based financial aid,” said state Sen. Pat McGuire, D-Joliet, who chairs the Senate higher education committee.

McGuire said he plans to contact Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office, the Illinois attorney general’s office and the Illinois Student Assistance Commission, which administers the MAP grant, to look for ways to close any loopholes.

If that doesn’t work, he said, he will consider filing new legislation.

“It’s especially galling because the legitimate need for MAP is proven by the fact that not everyone who applies for it gets it,” McGuire said. “And even those who get it, in many cases, still are required to take out loans and work more hours per week than is advised to afford college.”

State Sen. Cristina Castro, D-Elgin, said she shared McGuire’s concerns.

“It is particularly troubling,” she said. “You think of how we’ve increased MAP funds, but we always run out.”

Castro said she was disappointed to read that one of the parents identified by ProPublica Illinois who had given up guardianship of her teenager was an assistant schools superintendent.

“That was mind-boggling,” she said. “Those are people who should and are able most of the time to pay for that education. And that’s troubling that they would go to great lengths not to.”

The students involved in these cases have gone on to be accepted at public universities and private colleges across the Midwest and as far away as California, according to their social media accounts and student newspapers.

A spokesman for the University of Missouri on Tuesday said officials have decided to pull university-based financial aid if they are able to confirm the student “misrepresented their financial situation for the sole reason to get need-based aid when they otherwise would not be eligible.”

The university’s financial aid office continues to investigate.

So far, the spokesman said, it has found “an extremely small number” of cases.
