Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr.'s hugely inappropriate weekend,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/ivanka-trump-donald-trump-jr/index.html,"Ivanka Trump, traveling with her father in Asia, sought to play the role of a sort of shadow secretary of state. She attended a series of bilateral meetings between the US and foreign powers at the G20. She was part of the photo-op following the President's 20 steps into North Korea with dictator Kim Jong Un. ( And she made it awkward !) She tried to edge into a conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, IMF chairwoman Christine Lagarde and British Prime Minister Theresa May on the sidelines of the G20.

""You probably saw that Ivanka Trump was -- she's done a fantastic job, and also a fantastic job in getting jobs for a lot of people within our country -- almost 10 million people,"" Trump told the media during a news conference over the weekend in Osaka, Japan.

Donald Trump Jr., for his part, was making news of his own. During Thursday's debate, he retweeted this tweet regarding California Sen. Kamala Harris' racial identity: ""Kamala Harris is implying she is descended from American Black Slaves. She's not. She comes from Jamaican Slave Owners. That's fine. She's not an American Black. Period."" ( Don Jr. later deleted the retweet , which had shared the tweet with the comment, ""Is this true? Wow."" His spokesman told The New York Times that it was a misunderstanding.)

Within a few days, then, you had two children of the President of the United States making huge plays on the national and international stage -- one acting as a sort-of diplomat and the other as the chief driver of what could be a second attempt to paint a black Democratic candidate for president as exotic and other.

None of that is normal. Nor is it at all appropriate.

The seeds of this sort of weekend have been growing for a while now -- ever since the President found a loophole in the Federal Anti-Nepotism Act that allowed him to appoint both Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, to senior roles in the White House. (Ivanka, Jared and Don Jr. were all officials on Trump's presidential transition team, too.) The law, put into place after John Kennedy named his brother, Bobby, as attorney general, has been interpreted to only apply to federal agencies, which the White House is not. And in truth, the roots were even growing before that -- when Trump refused to put his assets in a blind trust -- instead delegating Don Jr. (and another son, Eric) to run the company in his stead. (It's not at all clear that the President avoids talking about the health of his business with his two sons.)

Trump has never made a secret of his belief and trust in his children over, well, everyone else. He kept them close to him in his businesses and his reality TV world; Ivanka and Don Jr. were regularly presences on ""The Apprentice"" and ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" -- playing the right-hand man (and woman) to ""Mr. Trump.""

Nor has he made it hard to figure out that he views Ivanka as a first among equals when it comes to his offspring. ""If she ever wanted to run for president,"" Trump told The Atlantic's Elaina Plott earlier this year . ""I think she'd be very, very hard to beat.""

All of which makes the fact that Trump appointed Ivanka and her husband to senior -- yet amorphous -- roles in the White House all the more troubling, and predictive of a moment like the one we saw over the weekend. (Trump told Plott that he had no idea what Ivanka would do as a job at the White House; ""So I didn't know,"" he said. ""I'm not sure she knew."")

Sidebar: Ivanka isn't the only member of her family who likes to play at being secretary of state -- often to the chagrin of the actual secretary of state. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently recounted a series of episodes in which the first son-in-law was acting as a sort of top diplomat -- including one time where Kushner was having dinner with Mexico's foreign secretary without Tillerson's knowledge. Step back and consider what we are talking about here: We have two people, both of whom are related (by blood and by marriage) to the President of the United States and neither of whom have been confirmed by the Senate (or anyone else) to their current roles, acting as quasi-official diplomats for our country. And a President who not only condones this behavior but encourages it!

And that's not to mention that stateside, the eldest son of the President is stoking birtherism conspiracies against one of the leading Democrats running to unseat Trump.

The conclusion is simple yet startling: Trump runs the country like a family business -- treating those related to him differently than everyone else. The problem -- among a series of issues -- with a setup like this is that we are NOT talking about a family business, we are talking about the United States government and, in the case of Don Jr., the campaign to reelect (or not) the President in 17 months' time.

Allowing Ivanka and Don Jr. (and Kushner) to be free radicals of sorts in the chemistry of government is a dangerous experiment. When you have Ivanka acting as secretary of state, what does that mean for how our allies (and our enemies) perceive us? Do they take the word of the actual secretary of state (I see you, Mike Pompeo!) or do they see Ivanka as closer to the President? And what happens if/when Ivanka and Pompeo aren't on the same page when it comes to the message they are sending to a country or the broader international community?

Yeah. Not good. And because Trump is Trump, none of this is going to change, either."
The trade war is over — and China won,https://www.marketwatch.com,['Howard Gold'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-trade-war-is-over-and-china-won-2019-07-01,"The great U.S.-China trade war is all over but the shouting.

In a meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to resume trade talks that had broken down in May.

Trump will lift some restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.’s ability to do business with U.S. companies and will postpone tariffs he threatened to impose on an additional $300 billion annually in Chinese imports. In exchange, Xi agreed China will buy more U.S. agricultural products. Details will be spelled out later.

This deal — the second time President Trump gave in to China’s demands and ended restrictions on a major Chinese technology company that had been accused of threatening U.S. national interests — effectively marks the end of Trump’s trade war with China.

Why? Because it shows the president won’t go to the wall to fundamentally change the U.S.’s trade relationship with the world’s second-biggest economy. The Chinese president has clearly calculated his American counterpart is unwilling to do anything that would threaten his support among key constituencies, like farmers, as the 2020 election looms. (President Trump also has backed down big time from his bellicose talk on North Korea and now appears ready to tacitly accept Pyongyang as a nuclear power.)

That means, I believe, that the current tariffs will continue but no new ones will be imposed. China will buy more U.S. agricultural products — although some U.S. farmers will find other countries already have muscled them out of the Chinese market. We may well see a bigger deal in coming months, which the Dealmaker-in-Chief will undoubtedly proclaim a great victory, cheered on by his hard-core supporters

But China will not rein in its state-owned enterprises. It will not curtail its Made in China 2025 initiatives in cutting-edge technologies like robotics, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence. Global supply chains will remain largely intact and thousands of manufacturing jobs will not flow back to U.S. shores. China under President for Life Xi will continue to become the most advanced surveillance state the world has ever seen, and it will keep hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims from Xinjiang in “re-education” camps for as long as it wishes.

Wall Street has long expected a truce in which the U.S. agreed not to add new tariffs to the $250 billion a year on which it now imposes a 25% levy, but the big concessions on Huawei were clearly not in the market. That should give this bull market a new shot of adrenaline. I expect the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.77% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.44% (which opened with big gains Monday morning) to continue to hit new highs in coming weeks.

Trump’s big concessions to Xi pleased powerful interests hurt by the tariffs. The heads of the National Retail Federation and Semiconductor Industry Association both praised the new cease-fire. ”Trump said he made the decision to allow Huawei to buy U.S. products at the request of American ‘high tech companies,’” CNBC reported.

Meanwhile, national security hawk Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) fiercely denounced the deal on Twitter. “If President Trump has agreed to reverse recent sanctions against Huawei he has made a catastrophic mistake,” the senator tweeted. On CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” another hawkish Trump cheerleader, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), called the Huawei deal “clearly a concession.”

“To be blunt about it, I think the Chinese will see the United States as having blinked a bit,” former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Monday morning. “I think the takeout message from Osaka will be…President Trump really wants a deal,” the China expert and fluent Mandarin speaker concluded.

National security officials from several countries have long warned of Huawei’s deep ties to China’s People’s Liberation Army and its critical role in building next-generation 5G wireless technology, which could become the backbone of the global information economy in the 21st century. Administration officials scrambled to assure everyone that Huawei will still be barred from any activities that imperil national security.

But remember that in June 2018, the Commerce Department lifted a ban on selling components to ZTE Corp. ZTCOY, +3.51% 763, -2.38% 000063, +4.21% which had been accused of violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea, and paid over $1 billion in fines. That also came after a personal appeal from President Xi to President Trump.

Meanwhile, Huawei’s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, is fighting extradition from Canada to the U.S. on fraud charges. The U.S. government alleges she helped trick financial institutions into violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. Huawei has denied the allegations. If the charges against her are dropped, that will only make President Trump’s capitulation official.

But we don’t have to wait that long. We’ve had two cave-ins on major Chinese companies in one year. We don’t need an umpire to call strike three to declare this ballgame is over.

"In whirlwind 100 hours, the President shows the world his 'Trump First' foreign policy",https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/us-diplomacy-100-hours/index.html,"(CNN) All the world's a personal political stage for President Donald Trump, who has just orchestrated the most eccentric 100 hours in the history of modern US diplomacy.

His trip to Asia was as much a ""Trump First"" endeavor as it was formally rooted in his ""America First"" doctrine, since many of the President's moves and on-the-fly decisions appeared most aimed enhancing his own position back home with the 2020 election looming.

As the face of America abroad, Trump palled around with dictators , elevated his blood relatives over his foreign policy officials and staged a historically audacious photo op by walking onto the soil of America's last Cold War rival North Korea in an episode that in the short term is likely to do more for his reelection hopes than global peace.

Trump's weekend was a sign of how American foreign policy has now mostly become an expression of his unrestrained character, personal hunches, non-strategic instincts and sudden changes of mind. It revealed as never before how the new US approach to the world is often confusing and lacks internal coherence.

And it again showcased the President's open admiration of global strongmen who squelch democracy, as he boasted of his great friendships with men such as Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump appeared highly satisfied with his work abroad, which showed how he has turned the US away from its traditional role as a force for global stability into an agent of unpredictability -- a transformation Trump promised on the campaign trail in 2016.

""So many amazing things happened over the last three days. All, or at least most of those things, are great for the United States. Much was accomplished!"" Trump wrote in a late night Sunday tweet after getting home to the White House.

While foreign policy traditionalists and Trump's critics are horrified about how he handles national security, the President's behavior is often interpreted by supporters as evidence that someone is standing up for US interests overseas and that conventional approaches, which they blame for disadvantaging America, are being shattered.

On the policy side, The New York Times reported that the administration may be contemplating a deal to ""freeze"" North Korea's nuclear program -- a huge reversal that would mirror the Iran nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew. Tehran, meanwhile, is blaming his walkout for its decision to bust limits on the enrichment of low grade uranium imposed under the Obama-era agreement, further raising already alarming risks of a war.

Trump also backed down on his policy on the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei -- saying it did not represent a ""great national emergency"" -- even though his team has spent months warning US allies not to use its technology in new 5G networks, citing the firm's alleged links to Chinese intelligence. The move appeared designed to ease the trade war he started with Beijing -- and boosted markets, always a politically appealing result for the President.

Many foreign policy experts believe the President cannot afford to go into the election with tariffs still causing pain for US consumers -- and with Chinese retaliation targeting farmers into Midwestern states that form his political power base.

Trump's personal diplomatic blitzkrieg is also an indication of how the President plans to use his position and huge global influence to boost his 2020 hopes by creating powerful political imagery that is quickly embraced by the conservative media machine at home as evidence of great strength and statesmanship.

On a weekend that shattered most remaining taboos of American foreign policy, Trump stepped into North Korea alongside Kim and proclaimed it a ""great honor"" to stand alongside one of the cruelest tyrants of the current age . American warnings about the North's gross human rights abuses, political executions and concentration camps didn't get a mention.

He hinted at his main motivation -- making a media splash -- in a tweet on Monday morning.

""It was great to call on Chairman Kim of North Korea to have our very well covered meeting. Good things can happen for all!"" Trump wrote.

In other eye-opening moments at the G20 summit in Japan and in South Korea, Trump took potshots at the press while alongside Kim and Putin -- ignoring murders of scores of journalists in Russia. Trump also mocked those who think he should defend US democracy by joking with Putin that he should not ""meddle"" in the 2020 election. It was just the latest occasion when the President has trampled the assessments of his own intelligence agencies about Russian interference in 2016 in front of the man who is accused of playing in the election to help him beat Hillary Clinton.

Putin's crooked grin said everything about a man who has made damaging the West's reputation and democratic institutions his life's work after becoming embittered at the fall of the Soviet Union while a KGB officer in East Germany.

Trump led the rehabilitation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, saying it was a ""great honor"" to be with a ""friend of mine"" and refused to blame him for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi -- ignoring assessments by the UN and his own intelligence agencies that the assassination was linked to the royal court.

The President's daughter Ivanka Trump caused one of the biggest stirs of the President's trip. Despite having no official diplomatic role beyond her efforts to elevate women in business, Trump nudged into photo ops and conversations with world leaders.

In one of the most startling episodes of the weekend, Ivanka Trump appeared in an official White House video to offer a readout of talks between the President and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Last week, Ivanka Trump's husband Jared Kushner, who also has no previous foreign policy experience, was in Bahrain trying to sell the administration's new peace plan -- part of his vast and often mysterious foreign policy portfolio.

Both of them have been heavily criticized given that their foreign policy roles open them to accusations of blatant conflicts of interests given their wide business interests in the Middle East and Asia.

While Ivanka Trump was stealing the spotlight, some of Trump's official aides took a back seat over the weekend, none more so than national security adviser John Bolton, who was in Mongolia rather than the Korean peninsula when the President met Kim and other North Korean officials who have objected to his hawkish line on negotiations with the North.

Speculation is rising in Washington over Bolton's position -- since two weeks ago the President also repudiated another of his hardline positions -- by pulling back from a strike on Iran to avenge the shooting down of a US drone."
What Trump Did in Osaka Was Worse Than Lying,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['David A. Graham', 'Staff Writer At']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/on-trumps-bullshit/593062/,"That seemed highly unlikely, so another reporter followed up:

Trump: Well, it has been something that they’ve done for a long period of time. I mean, you know, there aren’t that many ways you’re going to get people to schools. So this is something that’s been done. In some cases, it’s been done with a hammer instead of velvet glove. And, you know, that’s part of it … It is certainly a primary method of getting people to schools. Reporter: And is it—does it relate to the policy that you’re going to unveil that you just floated? Trump: It relates to everything we’re doing. And you’ll be hearing about it in—over the next couple of months.

Two things are clear: First, Trump has no idea what he is talking about. Second, Trump will not have a plan for busing, whether in four weeks or in two months. It’s not that he didn’t watch the debate, and for a moment, the president seemed to come close to grasping the conflict over school integration (“In some cases, it’s been done with a hammer instead of velvet glove”), but for the most part, he betrays no grasp of the complicated issue of busing. If he did, he wouldn’t be promising a plan, because it’s almost impossible to imagine any federal plan that would be in keeping with this political ideology.

Read: ‘If you want, I’ll go on’: Trump’s rambling news conference

Another similar moment occurred at the end of the press conference, when a reporter asked Trump about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s judgment that “Western-style liberalism” is obsolete. Putin was, of course, referring to the idea of republican governance developed in Europe and America. This is language that would be familiar to Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon. Trump, however, apparently believed it referred to governments on the West Coast of the United States:

Well, again, he may feel that way. I mean, he sees what’s going on. And I guess, if you look at what’s happening in Los Angeles, where it’s so sad to look; and what’s happening in San Francisco and a couple of other cities which are run by an extraordinary group of liberal people—I don’t know what they’re thinking.

It is not merely that Trump is ignorant of issues about which one expects the president of the United States to be at least somewhat literate—though that is clearly the case. By promising a plan in four weeks, or baiting Bay Area liberals, Trump is attempting to hide his ignorance in the face of questions he does not understand.

The bigger problem is that Trump’s answer is obviously false, Trump knows that it’s obviously false, and he doesn’t care. (“It relates to everything we’re doing,” is one of Trump’s tells, a claim that is both so grandiose and so lazy as to reveal what’s actually happening.) This is what makes it “bullshit,” in Frankfurt’s sense, rather than simply lying. He is just making things up to suit his purpose. The proof is that he does this repeatedly."
Exclusive: Democrats investigating whistleblower claims Pompeo's security picked up Chinese food and his dog,https://www.cnn.com,['Michelle Kosinski'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/pompeo-democrats-whistleblower-claims/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democrats on a key House congressional committee are investigating allegations from a whistleblower within the State Department about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his family's use of taxpayer-funded Diplomatic Security -- prompting agents to lament they are at times viewed as ""UberEats with guns"".

Congressional investigators, who asked for the committee not to be named as they carry out their inquiries, tell CNN that a State Department whistleblower has raised multiple issues over a period of months, about special agents being asked to carry out some questionable tasks for the Pompeo family.

In April, for example, an agent was asked to pick up Chinese food—without Pompeo in the car. The whistleblower said this led agents to complain that they are now serving as ""UberEats with guns,"" which has created a buzz within the department, according to multiple Democratic congressional aides who cited the whistleblower.

On another occasion, the whistleblower told aides, a Diplomatic Security special agent was given the job of picking up the Pompeo family dog from a groomer.

And CNN has seen a document given to the committee aides by the whistleblower showing that in January, Diplomatic Security was asked by a person in Pompeo's office to pick up his adult son from Union Station in Washington and bring him to the family home.

Lon Fairchild, the special agent in Charge of the Diplomatic Security Service, did not deny that the specific trips, such as the dog or the takeout food, were carried out by agents, but said in a statement, ""I was head of Secretary Pompeo's security detail since his first day on the job. At no point during my service did he or any member of his family ask me or any member of my team to act in any way that would be inconsistent with our professional obligation to protect the Secretary 24-hours a day, 7-days a week.""

A former senior Diplomatic Security official told CNN such tasks would not be appropriate—especially without the Secretary himself in the car at the time—unless some specific threat was identified that necessitated those trips. For example, they said when former Secretary of State Warren Christopher started in the job, he had hoped his agents would go get groceries for him, but had to be told that that's not what they do.

The Diplomatic Security Service is the law enforcement and security arm of the State Department tasked with protecting US diplomacy and diplomats worldwide and securing the integrity of US travel documents.

While protecting the security of the secretary of state is an important task for the service, there are concerns that agents may have been asked to carry out inappropriate tasks while assigned to Pompeo.

According to the Code of Federal Regulations, a federal employee ""shall not encourage, direct, coerce, or request a subordinate to use official time to perform activities other than those required in the performance of official duties or authorized in accordance with law or regulation.""

It is unclear if Pompeo requested the allegedly improper arrangements or whether they were made by someone on his staff without his knowledge.

But the whistleblower said there is a culture within Diplomatic Security to try and please the secretary and avoid upsetting him.

Former government ethics czar Walter Shaub told CNN ""sending subordinates to run personal errands for you is the very definition of misuse of position.""

Concerns about Susan Pompeo's security arrangements

Those personal-seeming tasks might be eye-catching, but congressional investigators say the State Department whistleblower told them the bigger issue causing concern among some agents is the question of why Pompeo's wife, Susan, has her own security detail, assigned to her in 2018, even while she is at home in the United States.

""There is a lot of confusion among agents over this, over why this is justified,"" one aide told CNN. ""Because according to this source they have seen nothing to indicate it is justified. In fact just the opposite. It's their understanding there was no finding of a high-enough level threat to merit this detail."" The whistleblower told these investigators that multiple special agents and supervisors within Diplomatic Security understood that a formal threat assessment had not been carried out, under longtime standard operating procedure, and that there is no specific threat against Susan Pompeo

Furthermore, the whistleblower told aides that shortly after Susan Pompeo received her personal security detail, in July 2018, agents were verbally told not to use her callsign—which is ""Shocker""—over the radios or publicly. The reason, according to one aide, citing the whistleblower, was that ""they knew it wasn't kosher.""

CNN has viewed an email from within the State Department confirming that she has an agent assigned to her, along with her callsign. The assistant secretary overseeing Diplomatic Security, Michael Evanoff, was included in the correspondence. The subject line says ""Shocker Detail.""

The former senior Diplomatic Security official who asked not to be identified said that such a full-time detail for a spouse is unusual and would only be assigned once a formal process was followed, assessing the need for such security. They said that the risk investigation would be performed by Diplomatic Security's Protective Intelligence and Investigations Division, in the Office of Threat and Intelligence Analysis. The former official told CNN this protocol has existed within Diplomatic Security for decades. And that in this person's lengthy tenure at Diplomatic Security, no spouse was ever given a security detail for more than a short, specific period of time.

One congressional aide told CNN that under the current administration, ""We have a lot of concerns over how things are being conducted within Diplomatic Security. There is a lack of transparency.""

A State Department spokesperson insisted that a threat assessment for Susan Pompeo was carried out by the Protective Intelligence and Investigations Division, but would not tell CNN when that happened.

""The provision of a protective detail to Mrs. Pompeo is expressly authorized by federal law. In this case, Diplomatic Security determined that the threat warranted the provision of such a protective detail to Mrs. Pompeo and began providing it as of July 28, 2018.""

In a statement, Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Michael Evanoff said, ""The Diplomatic Security Service has been protecting the spouse of the Secretary of State since the 1970s as the security threat dictates. We are a federal law enforcement agency, and this is an integral part of our core mission. Today the security threats against Secretary Pompeo and his family are unfortunately very real. The Diplomatic Security Service is proud to protect the Pompeo family from those who would harm the Secretary of State and the United States.""

Concerns about how Trump admin officials have used government resources

These questions about Pompeo are the latest in a slew of ethics allegations surrounding Trump administration Cabinet secretaries and their use of government resources.

Former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt left his position after a series of ethical questions about his security team; the former head of Health and Human Services, Tom Price , resigned after a scandal over his use of private planes; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was assailed for extravagant taxpayer-funded furniture purchases . Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke stepped down amid probes of his real estate dealings and conduct in office. And Former Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin left that job under an ethics cloud after a damning inspector general report criticized him for improperly accepting gifts and misrepresenting travel plans.

The aides said another whistleblower has come forward, who worked on the State Department's executive seventh floor where the secretary of state and top aides are based—telling them that employees there have been told not to put information concerning Susan Pompeo into official emails, so that it would not be preserved in required recordkeeping.

The role Susan Pompeo has played within the State Department and when the secretary travels is another area of concern to congressional aides, Diplomatic Security officers and multiple sources within the State Department and the CIA, which Pompeo previously led.

Several sources told CNN when Susan Pompeo accompanies the secretary on certain trips she has not only had a dedicated special agent to tend to her, but also a State Department staffer.

They said that ahead of a recent trip to Kansas, during which she accompanied her husband, she had at times chaired meetings on trip logistics at the State Department, which raised eyebrows, including of senior State officials.

One person familiar with the situation called it ""the worst kept secret at State,"" telling CNN, ""[Secretary Pompeo] takes her on ... trips, has separate meetings, requiring control officers, motor pool assets, security, and time. It was especially brazen during the shutdown when people were actually called into the embassy while furloughed. Just one more thing killing morale at the department."""
Defense Department to ban beer and pizza? Mandatory keto diet may enhance military performance,https://www.militarytimes.com,['Mark D. Faram'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/07/01/defense-department-to-ban-beer-and-pizza-mandatory-keto-diet-may-enhance-military-performance/,"— The controversial ketogenic or “keto” diet may be the future of the military, some defense officials say.

Service members, and Navy SEALS especially, may have to forgo beer and burritos for skinny cocktails and avocado salad (forget the tortilla chips) if a proposal from Special Operations Command gains momentum.

While a nutritionally enhanced future could eventually be put into effect for all branches, the SEALS and other underwater dive-mission specialists might be the first groups targeted for the change in nutritional guidelines.

Lisa Sanders, the director of science and technology at U.S. Special Operations Command, presented an Ohio State University study that recommends the nutritional change based on the keto diet, which is high in fat and low in carbohydrates. The diet works to deprive the body of glucose needed for energy and forces it to burn stored fats instead. The study was conducted on the university’s Army ROTC cadet population.

“One of the effects of truly being in ketosis is that it changes the way your body handles oxygen deprivation, so you can actually stay underwater at depths for longer periods of time and not go into oxygen seizures,” Sanders said at the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference last month.

Discussion of new dietary guidelines for service members comes at a time of growing concern about obesity in the military and its potential threat to readiness.

The possibly controversial change for the military is not without problems, not the least of which are questions about whether the military has the legal and ethical authority to control and monitor a service member’s diet 24/7.

Daily ketosis testing?

Service members are familiar with physical training in boot camp and their routine Physical Fitness Tests, but are they ready for daily dietary ketosis testing?

For the keto nutritional plan to be successful, it has to be followed strictly, and that includes after-hours and weekends. Even a service member on leave would possibly face a restricted diet because it simply takes too long for the body to readjust and function in the ketosis stage after a weekend of dietary backsliding and binging on pizza, burritos, and beers.

The keto diet requires the body to be in a constant state of ketosis. Daily urine or blood tests using strips are necessary to measure glucose or ketone levels.

Revamping MREs?

For the diet to be implemented laterally across the military, produce choices and meat quality at military dining facilities across the world would have to change significantly, not to mention the high-carb and sugar content of MRE’s. The popular pepperoni pizza MRE would be a thing of the past. Although one benefit of formulating a new high-fat ration is that it would be lighter weight to carry.

“You can carry even more calories because fats weigh less, which is an advantage,” said Kinesiologist Jeff Volek, a professor at Ohio State University’s Department of Human Sciences and author of the study.

On military bases, the dietary change could result in future dining facilities serving Ezekiel bread, zucchini “pasta spirals” to replace pasta, mashed cauliflower as a substitute for potatoes and rice, and avocado-heavy salad bars replacing soft-serve ice cream machines and dessert bars.

No fries with that at the DFAC

In addition to the regulatory and privacy questions about the proposed dietary change, there are also economic questions. Not only would DFACS and the military have to change, military households would have to follow suit as the diet requires higher quantities and quality of vegetables, fats, and proteins throughout the day.

If a keto meal plan became the required diet of the military’s future, some say military budgets, salaries and allowances may also have to rise to meet the economic demands required to follow the dietary guidelines on duty and off. But Volek, author of the study, disagrees.

“The ketogenic diet is high in fat, which is less costly,"" Volek said. The majority of the diet is based on fat, and fat calories can be very cheap. “Meats, eggs, fish, chicken, cheese, butter, seeds, nuts, and non-starchy vegetables are the basis of the diet. Fat is the key or primary nutrient.”"
Homeland Security admits it’s using abhorrent conditions at detention centers to deter migration,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/dhs-oig-homeland-security-report-el-paso-detention-center-conditions-used-to-deter-migration-9b0420b7e70b/,"Poor conditions including overcrowding, flu outbreaks, and a lack of clean clothes are just par for the course at an El Paso border station, according to a report released Monday by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General. In the report, border patrol argues that these conditions are necessary to stem the flow of migrants to the United States.

The report, first obtained by NBC News, detailed the conditions during a May 7 tour of a border station in the El Paso sector and found that only four showers were available for 756 immigrants. Additionally, over half of the immigrants were being held outside in the Texas heat, while the immigrants inside were being kept in cells at over five times their capacity. One cell meant for a maximum of 35 people held 155 adult males with only one toilet and sink. The cell was so overcrowded that the internal temperatures reached over 80 degrees and the men were unable to lay down to sleep.

While border patrol processing centers are only meant for temporary stays of up to 36 hours, some migrants at this facility in El Paso reported stays of over 30 days.

“With limited access to showers and clean clothing, detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks,” the report said.

None of this information, however, was new to DHS. The agency had the information about the conditions at this border patrol station for months and described it in the report as “chaos.” In spite of this, nothing was done. In fact, the report clearly outlines that the poor conditions thousands are facing at the hands of the U.S. government are actually the desired outcome.

“[Border Patrol] recognize[s] they have a humanitarian issue with detaining single adults for so long, but believe if they do not have a consequence delivery system, either prosecution or ICE detention, the flow will increase,” the report states, laying bare the Trump administration’s true motives: maintaining horrible conditions at border patrol facilities is necessary to deter immigrants from coming to the United States.

This logic on deterrence isn’t exactly anything new. The Obama administration began its expansion of family detention in 2014, and migrant children and families were routinely subject to freezing cold holding cells — nicknamed “hieleras” or “ice boxes” in Spanish. For example, in 2013 when 18-year-old Alexy Luis Lopez complained to officers about the temperature, one told him that maybe he should “think two times before trying to cross again.”

“Border Patrol seems to think these brutal conditions, and the human suffering that results, will deter immigration, but the fact is that many of these people are fleeing persecution and violence, reuniting with family, or are themselves U.S. citizens,” said James Duff Lyall, an attorney with ACLU of Arizona, back in 2015. “These policies and practices serve no legitimate purpose, violate the U.S. Constitution, and offend basic American values.”

What is different this time around, however, is the severity of the conditions and the government’s insistence on this being the state of things.

“This is not unavoidable,” R. Andrew Free, a civil rights and immigration lawyer from Nashville, told ThinkProgress. “This is not something that is coming as a surprise to CBP leadership either. This is a phenomenon that they are well aware of. They even called it ‘chaos’ and are choosing to continue it.”



The government hasn’t kept its position on the conditions of immigration detention quiet. Immigration attorneys allowed inside a Border Patrol facility near El Paso in Clint, Texas last week, reported children taking care of other children and living in soiled clothing. Lawyers for the federal government argued before the Ninth Circuit Court on June 18 that agencies like CBP have no responsibility to provide toothbrushes, toothpaste, and soap to migrant children in their care.

“It’s within everyone’s common understanding, that if you don’t have a toothbrush, if you don’t have soap, if you don’t have a blanket, it’s not safe and sanitary,” U.S. Circuit Judge A. Wallace Tashima said. “Wouldn’t everybody agree with that? Do you agree with that?”

“Well, I think it’s…. I think those are… there’s fair reason to find that those things… may be part of safe and sanitary…” Department of Justice attorney Sara Fabian responded.

“Not maybe! Are… a part. What do you mean maybe? You mean there are circumstances when a person doesn’t need to have a toothbrush, toothpaste and soap? For days?” asked Tashima.

“What you’re saying is that the agreement is so vague that it’s almost unenforceable,” Tashima said.

“To some extent, yes, your honor,” Fabian conceded.

Under a 1997 court judgment referred to as the Flores settlement, the U.S. government is required to provide a certain level of humane care to children in its custody, including that any facility must be “safe and sanitary.” Flores requires that immigrant children “accompanied” by parents have to be released within 20 days. The administration has argued that the order is too restrictive and must be overturned so that more families could be detained together for longer. Implicit in that position is that indefinite family detention will also serve as a deterrence.

There is no evidence, however, to suggest the administration’s assertion that failing to provide humane accommodations within detention facilities deters migration.

Since news of the conditions at several facilities became public, there has been a steady drop in the number of apprehensions at the border. While the administration is taking credit for the decrease through its border policies and tough stance on Mexico, it is in line with historic patterns of migration, which tend to decrease in the summer months due to the heat."
Democrats running out of options to stop Trump from moving two USDA offices,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Jenna Portnoy', 'Reporter Covering Virginia', 'Maryland', 'D.C.

(Erik S Lesser/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

Members of Congress representing many of the D.C.-based federal workers whose jobs are about to be reassigned or moved to the Midwest are running out of ways to try to stop the Trump administration from relocating those offices.

Democratic lawmakers have written a flurry of letters, bills and amendments in a race to block the measures before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, with little success.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue last month finalized plans to move about 550 jobs at two scientific agencies in the Agriculture Department from Southwest Washington to the greater Kansas City region.

In a separate move, the administration has threatened to furlough and possibly lay off 150 workers at the Office of Personnel Management, the federal workforce’s human resources agency, if Congress blocks the administration’s plans to eliminate the department.

Proponents of the changes say they want to streamline operations, save taxpayer money, spread the economic effects of federal jobs beyond the nation’s capital and bring workers closer to the people they serve.

Opponents of the USDA’s move, including Democratic lawmakers and unions representing federal workers, say the agencies will hemorrhage talent because many scientists and researchers would rather quit than move their families 1,000 miles from the District.

[Perspective: Stark choice for USDA employees: Move to Kansas City or lose your job]

Capital region lawmakers say both of the administration’s proposals are part of a long-standing Republican campaign, bolstered by President Trump, to paint federal workers as unnecessary bureaucrats.

“In the White House, there is, among some people, a real disrespect for federal employees, animated by their disrespect for the government generally,” House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), whose district includes part of Prince George’s County, said in a brief interview. “So if you’re hostile to government, you’re then . . . hostile to those who work in government.”

Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), who represents most of Fairfax and Prince William counties, said an “unrelenting assault” on benefits, compensation, hiring, workers’ rights, workplace conditions and appellate rights started when Republicans took control of Congress in 2011.

“The Republicans, and especially the Trump administration, view the entire federal enterprise, federal workers, as part of the swamp, and anything they can do to diminish it, demean it, from their point of view is a good thing,” Connolly said.

He pointed to a March 2017 resolution spearheaded by Republican Jason Chaffetz of Utah, then the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, that would have deemed it unnecessary for federal agencies to be located in the District. The measure, called Divest D.C., advanced to the full House but never got a floor vote.

Current efforts appear to be moving ahead unabated, raising concerns among federal workers that the administration could try to replicate the plans across government.

“It seems like if they are successful here, this could just be the tip of the iceberg,” said Sandra Salstrom, a lobbyist for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union for federal workers. “We don’t know who’s next.”

Connolly is chairman of the House Oversight Committee’s panel on government operations, which in May held a three-hour hearing titled “The Administration’s War on a Merit Based Civil Service.”

The hearing focused on the administration’s plans to move most Office of Personnel Management functions into the General Services Administration, the government’s real estate and procurement arm. The plan also would shift leadership to the executive branch, raising worries that the agency could become politicized.

The OPM-GSA merger was the subject of a rally last week organized by federal worker unions across from the current OPM headquarters.

In addition to Connolly and Hoyer, Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), the District’s nonvoting delegate, took turns at the microphone in the shadow of a statue of Argentine independence hero José de San Martín.

Plans to move the USDA agencies — the Economic Research Service, a statistical agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which funds cutting-edge agricultural science — to Kansas City intensified Democrats’ frustration.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) of Montgomery County has tried to stop the USDA move through a bill and an amendment, and he sits on a committee that could block the leases on new office space if the contracts exceed a certain threshold.

He suggested the move was part of an ongoing effort by the administration to suppress scientific data on climate change.

“I will use every tool I have on both the Appropriations Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee to block this move,” he said in a statement.

The USDA Office of Inspector General began a review of the relocation in November at the request of Norton and Hoyer. The report is under review by the agency before its release to Congress and the public.

Kevin Hunt, a geographer and head of his union bargaining unit at the Economic Research Service, is a Missouri native but does not plan to move.

He said he is sad to leave what he considers a “dream job” that allows him to do research and publish in scientific journals, pays well and has promotion potential. His partner has a good job elsewhere, making it difficult to move.

Hunt said he believes the agency belongs in the District, where collaboration with other agencies is seamless.

“It’s not about Kansas City,” he said in a phone interview. “It’s about moving people who are established here and who are at the top of their game.”

Lawmakers have inserted language into multiple appropriations bills to block the administration from spending money to move workers in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.

However, the changes are on track to begin before the end of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30, which prompted Norton to suggest litigation as a next step. The basis for a legal challenge is unclear.

“I’ve got to be absolutely candid with you,” she told workers at the rally. “I am going to ask you to go into court. . . . I’m standing here this afternoon to say, ‘If we don’t beat them, I am sure that you will beat them. Keep fighting. We are there with you!’”

She added in an interview: “I think we have done everything we can do. We’re racing against the clock.”

Asked about litigation, an AFGE spokesman said they are pursuing collective bargaining to block or delay the moves.

Perspective: Stark choice for USDA employees: Move to Kansas City or lose your job

Federal Insider: These USDA employees face a stark choice: Move to Kansas City or be fired,https://www.inforum.com,['Washington Post'],,,,https://www.inforum.com/news/nation/2736650-Federal-Insider-These-USDA-employees-face-a-stark-choice-Move-to-Kansas-City-or-be-fired,"The Trump administration's plan to move two agencies from Washington D.C. to the Kansas City area includes a document with two blank boxes on it, sent to employees on June 13. Check one, it instructs: Accept the transfer by July 15 or ""be separated by adverse action procedures.""

That means getting fired, with an opportunity to appeal the dismissal through what could be an expensive process. Getting fired could also make it more difficult to find another federal job in an area where the government dominates.

Although a limited number of buyouts and early retirement opportunities will be available for what union officials expect to be fewer than 15 percent of those affected, and while some USDA employees might find work in government positions elsewhere in the Washington area, the disruption to employees generally will be substantial.

""Adverse action"" can have another meaning that goes beyond the affected employees and more broadly hits taxpayers, organizations and businesses. In addition to the big hassle for workers, relocations could have an adverse impact - a major brain drain - on the work of the two agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

listen live watch live

Union officials estimate a strong majority of employees will decline reassignment. If that happens, the work of the small but important agencies could be seriously upset. Even before Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Kansas City region as the new location, but after officials said the agencies would be moving out of Washington, department employees quit in droves, my colleague Ben Guarino reported last month.

""The current and projected attrition will curtail research data products that encompass commodity estimates, agricultural sector forecasts, food and farm economic and statistical indicators for U.S. agriculture, conservation, and food policy and markets,"" said Kevin Hunt, a 10-year USDA employee, speaking as acting vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 3403 representing research service staff.

What the government calls ""directed reassignments"" to a different city are ""very rare in the federal government. That's not something that is a common practice,"" said Joanna Friedman, a federal employment lawyer with the Federal Practice Group. ""This is unprecedented.""

When the Pentagon closed bases around the country starting in 2005, it forced many defense civilians to make a similar choice. ""We lost a lot of talent in geographic moves,"" said Jeffrey Neal, formerly the top personnel officer at the Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. ""A 20 percent take-up rate is typical.""

Not only are government transfers like the USDA's uncommon, but the size makes this one especially unusual. Typically, they are much smaller, said Neal, now a senior vice president with the ICF consulting firm. ""Years ago, people were more likely to move with their jobs,"" he added. ""With most people living in two-wage-earner households, it is far more difficult to just pack up and go.""

Many, perhaps most, affected USDA employees are considering a third option - quit and find new work.

""I will be unemployed beyond Sept. 30,"" which is the deadline for the Washington-based workers to report to the new location, Hunt said, ""unless I can find another job.""

Of the 547 employees the department wants to move for the two agencies combined, 253 are with the Economic Research Service, 77 percent of its 329-person workforce. An additional 294 are with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 93 percent of its 315-person staff. News of the move prompted a surge of support for the union. Employees at the National Institute voted 137-2 to join AFGE two weeks ago. Last month's vote at the economic service was 138-4.

When Perdue announced the moves to the Kansas City area, he said, ""We did not undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to enhance long-term sustainability and success of these agencies. The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run.""

But the USDA estimate of nearly $300 million in savings over 15 years is way off, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economics Association. Instead, it would cost taxpayers between $83 and $182 million, the analysis found. The USDA underestimated the true cost in part because it did not account for ""the lost value of research from staffers who resign or retire rather than move,"" the association reported.

A group of Democratic senators, including all four from Maryland and Virginia, has introduced legislation to keep the headquarters of the two agencies within the D.C. area.

Andrew Crane-Droesch, an economist with the research service, said he is not moving and is now looking for another job in the Washngton area. ""Definitely the choice we face is move to Kansas City or lose our jobs,"" he said. ""I'm certainly not happy. I love my job, but I can't move to Kansas City, and moreover, I don't want to even if I could.""

Like Crane-Droesch, these staffers ""have families, they are part of a community and they've been dedicated public servants,"" said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations. ""They deserve better than having such a radical and consequential do-or-die decision, which is hardly a fair choice, thrown at them at the last minute.""

18 senior Pentagon roles are currently filled by temporary officials or vacant,https://www.cnn.com,"['Barbara Starr', 'Cnn Pentagon Correspondent']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/pentagon-vacancies-list/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Eighteen of the most senior roles at the Pentagon lack permanent appointees, the Department of Defense confirmed to CNN on Monday, providing a complete list of positions currently being filled by temporary officials.

It is a reflection of the Department of Defense's ongoing struggle to establish an unprecedented transition plan aimed at ensuring continuity of leadership at the highest levels while there is still no confirmed secretary of defense.

The top priority is to get Mark Esper's nomination to the Senate Armed Services Committee so a confirmation hearing for the acting secretary of defense can be scheduled quickly. Esper stepped into the acting position following the dramatic implosion of Patrick Shanahan's nomination last month.

Due to federal regulations, Esper is expected to have to instantly step down as the acting secretary during that confirmation process, several officials have said. Government lawyers are looking to see if there are any loopholes that could keep him in the job through a confirmation vote, a defense official previously told CNN.

Still, it is now increasingly likely that Navy Secretary Richard Spencer will be named acting defense secretary for a brief period when Esper is formally nominated for the permanent role, making him the third acting defense secretary to serve under President Donald Trump.

DOJ issues plea to Congress in battle against fentanyl copycats,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-issues-plea-congress-battle-fentanyl-copycats/story?id=64068467,"Department of Justice officials on Monday expressed alarm over an approaching deadline that they argued could significantly roll back recent progress in combating the scourge of fentanyl copycats fueling the country's opioid crisis.

In a briefing with several reporters, the officials called on Congress to quickly pass legislation that would keep fentanyl knockoffs -- primarily produced by overseas distributors -- in a drug category on par with heroin, making it easier for the government to prosecute traffickers.

Joshua Lott/Reuters, FILE

Currently, the so-called ""fentanyl analogues"" are under an emergency ban that is set to expire in February without action by Congress.

""These potential adverse consequences of a lapse in scheduling of fentanyl-like substances goes beyond a simple return to the status quo,"" Amanda Liskamm, the director of Opioid Enforcement and Prevention Efforts in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, told reporters. ""We expect prosecutions charging substances under the temporary order to be affected, resulting in confusion and even potential trial losses. We are running out of time and if a solution isn't found, prosecutors will undoubtedly be hindered and drug traffickers will undoubtedly be helped.""

According to John Martin, the assistant administrator for the Drug Enforcement Administration, 29,000 of the 72,000 reported U.S. overdose deaths in 2017 were attributed to fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances.

In 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced plans to take aim at one of the leading sources of fentanyl abuse, the synthetic fentanyl that drug traffickers could import from overseas manufacturers either through the mail or in some cases transported across the U.S. southern border.

By making piecemeal chemical alterations to the overall structure of fentanyl, distributors were able to avoid some of the regulations that restricted other drugs listed under the Controlled Substances Act.

The emergency change assisted prosecutors in cases, such as an August 2018, 43-count indictment against two Chinese citizens who were charged with shipping fentanyl analogues to 37 U.S. states over a decade, linked to at least two deaths of Americans in Ohio.

""When a synthetic narcotic was banned, this criminal organization would use its chemical expertise to create an analogue of the drug with a slightly different chemical structure with the same or even more potent effect,"" Liskamm said, later adding that if the suspects were to be extradited to the U.S. to face charges, their prosecution could potentially be affected if the emergency scheduling lapses.

Lawmakers have, for the most part, been receptive to the idea of making the fentanyl-analogue scheduling permanent, under a bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson dubbed the ""Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act,"" or SOFA Act.

But some Democrats have recently raised concerns with the idea of a blanket re-scheduling for fentanyl-related substances and whether it could result in barriers for researchers examining the potential medically-related uses of fentanyl.

But Martin said that based on his interactions with the DEA's own interagency researchers, he thinks those concerns are overblown.

""I don't think it's going to impact [researchers] greatly at all,"" Martin said. ""They have some concerns but from where I'm sitting I think we're trying to eliminate the perception out there in the research community that it's going to be a hindrance for them to conduct research.""

In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday, multiple criminal justice reform groups including the ACLU and Drug Policy Alliance also spelled out their objections to the legislation -- arguing the approach would result in harsher sentences and unfair targeting of communities of color, while having little to no effect on deaths from overdosing.

""We believe the Committee is right to be concerned about fentanyl-related deaths, but this approach merely repeats the mistakes of the past by exacerbating our incarceration problem,"" the groups said in the letter. ""The Committee should move away from the belief that increased enforcement powers for the DEA will translate into reduced overdose deaths."""
A government investigation found that Homeland Security mistakenly admitted some 'potentially high-risk' travelers into the Global Entry program,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Graham Rapier'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/global-entry-program-admitted-potentially-high-risk-travelers-investigation-finds-2019-7,"An internal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security has found potentially significant flaws the Global Entry program that expedites the customs process for some international travelers arriving in the United States

According to a report by the DHS inspector general published the last week of June, US Customs and Border Protection's policies ""do not always prevent ineligible and potentially high-risk Global Entry members from obtaining expedited entry.""

In four cases, the investigation found that applicants were mistakenly considered low-risk and were approved for the program.

""This occurred because CBP officers did not always comply with policies when reviewing Global Entry applications nor do CBP's policies sufficiently help officers determine an applicant's level of risk,"" the partially redacted report said.

Additionally, the report found that some officers did not verify the receipts that Global Entry users receive from the program's kiosks when arriving in the country.

""Unless CBP officers authenticate kiosk receipts, someone could use a fake receipt to enter the United States,"" the inspector general wrote.

The agency suggested six fixes to shore up the program's security

In response to its findings, the report made six suggestions to close the loopholes and help maintain the $89 million Global Entry program's continued security.

Those recommendations include a new oversight of CBP officers at enrollment centers as well as ports of entry, analyzing the flaws outlined in their findings, updating the program handbook, and adding more self-inspection sheets for employees to monitor the program.

""Strengthening controls will help ensure compliance with policies and procedures, as well as effective operations,"" the report said. ""Until CBP addresses the vulnerabilities we identified, individuals intending to do harm or carry out criminal activities may exploit Global Entry.""

House Judiciary calls for DOJ inspector general investigation into discrimination claims at FBI Academy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-judiciary-calls-for-doj-inspector-general-investigation-into-discrimination-claims-at-fbi-academy,"Bipartisan leaders of the House Judiciary Committee called for the Justice Department’s inspector general to open an investigation into allegations of discrimination against women at the FBI Academy earlier this week following a federal lawsuit alleging that Quantico is run like a “good old boy network.""

Sixteen former female trainees at the FBI filed a lawsuit in late May claiming that they and dozens of other women had been sexually harassed, subjected to a hostile work environment and outdated gender stereotypes, wrongly kicked out of the training program, unfairly forced to resign or made to think that the continuing the training would be futile, suffered retaliation, and more.

And top members of the congressional committee tasked with overseeing the FBI called the allegations “disturbing” and said that, if true, “such conduct cannot be tolerated.”

The letter, signed this week by two Democrats and two Republicans — Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York and ranking member Doug Collins of Georgia as well as Karen Bass of California and John Ratcliffe of Texas — said they believed America’s diversity should be reflected by the FBI’s agents, emphasized that the FBI’s selection process should be free from bias, and called on DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to look into it.

“We must ensure potential agents not be deterred from applying because they fear the possibility of such treatment,” they wrote. “We believe these detailed allegations require an investigation into the FBI’s training and selection prices for new agents.”

A representative for the FBI told the Washington Examiner that the bureau is “unable to comment on litigation” but that “the FBI is committed to fostering a work environment where all of our employees are valued and respected.”

“Diversity is one of our core values, and to effectively accomplish our mission of protecting the American people we need people of different genders, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives,” the representative said.

The federal lawsuit filed by female former trainees in May is directed at the training policies at the FBI and the conduct of its instructors at its agent training facility in Quantico, Virginia. The lawsuit claims FBI training guidelines are “highly subjective” and that “the uneven power dynamic at the FBI Academy puts female trainees at a distinct disadvantage.” And the lawsuit claims the subjective guidelines lets instructors misrepresent scenarios and fail women.

The complaint also alleges that when one of the women told former FBI Director James Comey of the allegations, Comey denied that discriminatory behavior was occurring and “instead suggested she use her ‘pain’ to reflect on her strengths and weaknesses.”

Mark Morgan, a former deputy assistant director at the FBI and the new acting chief of Customs and Border Protection, is also mentioned in the lawsuit.

David Shaffer, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told the Washington Examiner the FBI Academy relies upon “a completely subjective system that allows instructors to give rise to their own biases and beliefs with no accountability and oversight.”

Shaffer said that a common dynamic is that when a female trainee explains or defends her actions to an instructor, she is viewed being argumentative while when a male trainee does he is seen as standing up for himself.

Statistics provided by the FBI show that 20% of the special agents who are brought into the FBI are female. For the 2019 cycle, the FBI says that women made up 32% of those in the special agent basic field training course and 36% of those who had applied to be special agents. The FBI says that its 2019 target for female applications had been 33%, and the numbers reflect improvements from the 26% of special agent applications in the 2018 cycle and 22% in the 2017 cycle.

The FBI says that the total number of those who make it through the entire FBI special agent process — including application, training, and graduation — has held steady at just 6%.

If the DOJ inspector takes up the issue of discrimination at Quantico, it wouldn’t be the first time. A 2003 inspector general report which looked into allegations of disciplinary double standards at the FBI uncovered instances of instructors making inappropriate comments towards some trainees.

When asked by the Washington Examiner whether the DOJ inspector general would be launching an inquiry following the request from congressional leaders, the watchdog office declined to say.

Shaffer said that an inspector general investigation “should be done of course,” but he said that Congress needed to take action too.

“They need to be doing their oversight of the agency and asking the hard questions — and not relying on the FBI to investigate themselves,” Shaffer said.

Crop Conditions Still Lag,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/crop-conditions-still-lag,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- Most of the corn and 92% of soybeans grown in the major producing states are now planted, with 94% of corn and 83% of soybeans emerged, according to the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress Report released Monday. But the condition of the corn crop varies widely.

Corn

The overall condition of the corn crop is about the same as last week—with 56% rated good to excellent in the top 18 corn producing states. Corn rated excellent jumped up by only one percentage point – to 9%. The trade expected an improvement in conditions from last week. One year ago, 76% of the corn crop was considered in good to excellent condition.

(Today’s U.S.-level report from the National Agricultural Statistics Service is no longer reporting corn planting progress, normally an indication that it’s nearly complete. But that’s not the case at the state level. Illinois reports 95% of corn planted as of June 30. Indiana reports corn planting “all but wrapped up for the season” but no number, and Ohio reports 91% of corn planted.)

Conditions in the eastern Corn Belt may have deteriorated. As of Sunday, Ohio’s corn was rated 31% good to excellent, down from 39% last week. Indiana corn is 39% good to excellent, down from 43%; Illinois is 42% good to excellent, down from 47%. Iowa’s crop improved slightly, from 62% good to excellent a week earlier to 64%. Nebraska corn is among the best, with 74% rated good to excellent, down slightly from 77% last week.

Soybeans

The nation’s crop is rated 54% good/excellent, unchanged from last week but below 71% at this time last year.

This crop, too, varies widely in condition. In Nebraska, it’s rated 74% good/excellent. Ohio’s bean crop is only 28% good to excellent; 23% (more than any other state) gets a poor rating.

Wheat

The winter wheat harvest is now 30% complete vs. a 48% five-year average for this time of year. As would be expected, Texas is nearing completion, with 81% harvested vs. an 82% average."
Would-Be Democratic Presidents Want to Make America a Sanctuary Country,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/06/30/would-be_democratic_presidents_want_to_make_america_a_sanctuary_country__140680.html,"WASHINGTON -- The star of Thursday night's Democratic presidential primary debate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was attorney general of California and, before that, district attorney for San Francisco. This put her in the vanguard of the Golden State's sanctuary state and sanctuary city policies.

Now, it seems, all the 2020 Democratic hopefuls -- and Harris in particular -- are trying to turn the United States into one big sanctuary country where crossing the border illegally is analogous to jaywalking.

That's why all 10 Democrats raised their hands Thursday night when asked if they wanted to make crossing the border without documentation a civil rather than criminal offense. They all also raised their hands when asked if they wanted to provide health care to unauthorized immigrants.

During the debate, Harris framed the practice of shielding undocumented immigrants from federal immigration enforcement this way: ""I know it as a prosecutor. I want a rape victim to be able to run in the middle of -- to run in the middle of the street and wave down a police officer and report the crime against her.""

It was a variation of an argument crafted earlier by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who as mayor of San Francisco pushed through the city's first sanctuary policy in 1985. It applied to undocumented migrants from El Salvador and Guatemala. The law, expanded to all undocumented immigrants by city voters in 1989, would make San Francisco safer, DiFi argued, because undocumented residents would not be afraid to report crimes to city police.

But as the policy expanded, it didn't just protect otherwise law-abiding immigrants -- hard-working adults who came here to work and raise a family. It also has shielded gang members and criminals who harm women and children, as Harris well knows.

San Francisco's 2013 Due Process for All ordinance prohibited local law enforcement from holding unauthorized immigrants for federal immigration officials unless the inmate had been convicted of a violent felony in the past seven years. What could go wrong? Many a career car thief or repeat drug offender has enjoyed the same protection as the rape victim Harris said she wanted to protect.

The most famous beneficiary was Jose Ines Garcia Zarate. After he served time for his seventh felony drug conviction, the feds sent Garcia Zarate to San Francisco on a 20-year-old marijuana charge. The district attorney inevitably did not pursue the moldy case, and so Garcia Zarate walked out on the street, where he found a gun used to kill Kate Steinle on a summer evening in 2015.

Please tell me: What country passes laws to protect career criminals and repeat offenders from being deported?

In his first term, President Barack Obama had a smarter take when he directed federal officials to target unauthorized immigrants who were ""violent offenders and people convicted of crimes.""

He expanded the Secure Communities program, piloted by President George W. Bush, which cross-checked fingerprints taken at local jails with immigration databases. It was a smart plan. In fiscal 2013, The Los Angeles Times reported, 82% of deported individuals had been convicted of a crime.

During the debate, however, Harris railed against Obama's use of Secure Communities because, well, ""The policy was to allow deportation of people who by ICE's own definition were non-criminals."" (Actually, that's also the definition of Thursday night's debate team, as they all said they'd like to make unauthorized border crossing a civil offense instead of a crime.)

Mark Krikorian of the pro-enforcement Center for Immigration Studies observed that Harris referred to rape as a ""real crime"":

""That's a standard sanctuary city line,"" says Krikorian. ""At this point, it's now Democratic Party orthodoxy that only people that have broken 'real' laws should be subject to deportation.""

And those crimes would have to be tried and convicted and have been committed recently to warrant removal. The ""tool in the toolbox"" of being able to deport an undesirable newcomer who's not supposed to be in the United States in the first place, Krikorian warned, would disappear.

What would happen if Democrats were to end criminal penalties for crossing the border? Does anyone think there would be fewer unauthorized immigrants or more? And would they be more law-abiding otherwise or less?

Fresh leadership churn at DHS agencies,https://thehill.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/450970-fresh-leadership-churn-at-dhs-agencies,"The leadership carousel at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) took another spin this week as the agency underwent fresh changes among officials tasked with enforcing immigration law.

Roughly 10 weeks after a purge of DHS leaders that included former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen Kirstjen Michele NielsenThe Hill's Morning Report - Trump touts handshake with Kim, tariff freeze with Xi Fresh leadership churn at DHS agencies Booker calls for hearings on reports of ICE using solitary confinement MORE, the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly resigned and the agency announced a new head of Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

And there are rumblings that acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan is not on solid ground. Some of President Trump Donald John TrumpThe billionaire exemption Former Bolton aide pushes back on report of nuclear freeze with North Korea US breaks record for longest economic expansion MORE’s allies and outside groups that favor stricter immigration laws are expressing frustration with McAleenan, suggesting further changes could be on the horizon as the president seeks to implement the right mix of loyalists and immigration hardliners to implement his agenda heading into 2020.

""I've made changes — very good changes,"" Trump told reporters this past week. ""We're moving some people around into different locations.""

McAleenan announced this week that Mark Morgan, previously the acting director of ICE, would move over to lead CBP in the wake of John Sanders's resignation.

Morgan, who led Border Patrol during the Obama administration, made clear in an interview with The Hill earlier this month that he intended to carry out Trump's policies.

Replacing Morgan at ICE is Matthew Albence, a 25-year law enforcement veteran who has held various roles in the Trump administration since 2017.

The president said he was aware there would be a change when Sanders announced his CBP resignation. But Trump did not say whether he asked Sanders to step down, and Sanders did not provide a reason for his resignation.

""I don’t know anything about it,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""I hear he's a very good man. I hear he's a good person. I don’t know him. I don’t think I ever spoke to him.""

Morgan and Albence's appointments follow Trump tapping Ken Cucinelli, an immigration hardliner and former Virginia attorney general, as the acting head of U.S. Customs and Immigration Services.

Trump also announced former ICE Director Tom Homan would return to the administration as ""border czar."" Homan has appeared regularly on Fox News to defend the president's policies, but it's unclear if or when he might return to government work or what his duties would entail.

Homan was sharply critical this week of McAleenan, suggesting he has not been supportive of Trump's agenda and has hindered ICE from doing its job.

The White House did not respond to questions about the recent shakeup at DHS, including whether Trump ordered the personnel changes.

The latest reshuffling came as House Democrats clashed over a bill to provide additional border funding and as Democratic presidential candidates made the treatment of migrants a central tenet of the party’s first two debates.

The president has often argued that congressional inaction is largely to blame for the surge in border apprehensions and poor humanitarian conditions for migrants. But the recent turnover atop DHS suggests growing impatience with that agency as well.

Any frustration by Trump with the agency’s performance could prove problematic for McAleenan.

Multiple advocates for Trump view McAleenan as a placeholder and have criticized him in recent weeks for failing to aggressively pursue the president's immigration priorities.

""He just basically has been a stumbling block for basically any enforcement that either CBP or ICE or USCIS wanted to do,"" said Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations for the immigration reduction group NumbersUSA.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

The Washington Post reported this month that McAleenan was uneasy with Trump's call for mass ICE raids to round up migrant families with deportation orders. McAleenan was said to have favored a more targeted approach.

Trump on June 22 postponed the raids for ""two weeks"" to give Congress time to attempt to pass legislation overhauling the country's asylum laws.

McAleenan denied in an interview with Fox News Radio on Thursday that he was the source of leaks to the media that jeopardized the raids, but wouldn’t say explicitly if there were any Trump policies that he disagreed with.

“That's not my role. I'm an operator, I'm a law enforcement professional, the president sets policy and we implement,” McAleenan said. “We implement in the best way we know how based on our operational experience.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about whether Trump planned to nominate the acting secretary for the role full-time.

Ur Jaddou, who was chief counsel to USCIS during the Obama administration, told The Hill that McAleenan's job has been complicated by the consistent turnover within his department.

""To have people at the top constantly changing and changing their direction on policy and how to approach things is completely disruptive which is why I call it chaos,"" she said in an interview.

Jaddou said she could not recall any comparable amount of turnover to what has taken place at DHS in recent months.

Andrew R. Arthur, who served in the former Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, was complimentary of McAleenan but was unsure of his long-term role. He described McAleenan as a ""very competent administrator"" and noted his wealth of experience from leading CBP.

McAleenan has been under additional scrutiny this past week as concerns over the administration's treatment of migrants gained a new sense of urgency.

Hundreds of children were moved from a detention facility in Texas after the Associated Press reported on poor conditions, including kids taking care of other kids and a lack of sanitation.

That same week, a photo went viral of a man and his daughter who drowned while trying to cross the Rio Grande River. Democrats seized on the image to decry the Trump administration's policies.

""In another administration an acting secretary would be out immediately,"" Jaddou said of the response to the photo. ""The person would not survive more than a day.""

McAleenan addressed the photo in a press conference Friday, calling the incident tragic and devastating, but deflected blame away from his own agency.

""This failure is not on the men and women of DHS, and definitely not on the outstanding border patrol agents, and CBP officers and ICE officers who have borne the brunt to the challenges and most of the criticism,"" he said.

McAleenan expressed appreciation for Congress for passing a funding package that includes $4.5 billion in resources for agencies responding to the influx of migrants.

Many Democrats panned the final version of the bill, saying it did not do enough to protect migrant children.

Still, McAleenan said the onus is on Congress to take further action, and he urged lawmakers to close immigration loopholes and approve changes to asylum laws.

""This situation should not be acceptable to any of us,"" McAleenan said. ""It should galvanize action and real debate based on what is actually happening on the border and why. And yet, here in Washington, we have collectively failed to act to address the drivers of the crisis."""
"VA Secretary Robert Wilkie reflects on a year spent trying to fix his vital, broken government agency",https://www.wcpo.com,[],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.wcpo.com/news/our-community/homefront/va-secretary-robert-wilkie-reflects-on-a-year-spent-trying-to-fix-the-va-hows-it-going-so-far,"Listen to this episode of Homefront in the podcast player above

CINCINNATI — In the 11 months since Robert Wilkie became United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs, he’s booted medical directors from their roles, visited individual VA centers to assess their weaknesses and created history by requesting and receiving the largest-ever budget for his department: $220 billion.

The problems facing the VA as he entered it were numerous and well-documented — long wait times for appointments, allegations of misconduct, overprescription of opioids, a poor work environment and improperly kept records that led to delayed GI payments, to name a handful of the most prominent. Many still linger.

However, during a recent visit to Cincinnati, Wilkie said the agency’s approval ratings are rising as it takes a series of new approaches to fight its longtime bugbears.

“Most of the issues in the VA — not here in Cincinnati — have nothing to do with the technical competence of the employees,” he said. “It had everything to do with leadership walking the post.”

As the face of new leadership, Wilkie has overseen the implementation of the MISSION Act, which allows veterans to see pre-screened private practitioners if the wait time at their local VA hospital or clinic is more than 39 days.

Wait times differ from need to need, but the average number of days elapsed between a request and appointment is 12 in Cincinnati, according to Wilkie. It’s exactly 39 at the clinic in Hamilton.

“MISSION was designated to make sure those numbers did not affect the veteran’s health,” Wilkie said.

He also hopes to deal more effectively than his predecessors with issues such as mental illness and addiction, he added. Although Wilkie has in other interviews partially attributed the high rate of veteran suicide to veterans not being in contact with their local VA, he acknowledged the agency’s responsibility to provide better-quality services and outreach. He’s invested $9 billion this year — more than any year before — in improving those aspects of the agency.

“We are not even at the Sputnik stage in this country when it comes to getting our arms around mental health issues,"" he said at the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans conference in late May.

He echoed that statement during his trip to Cincinnati, noting that providing nuanced mental health care has practical benefits alongside humanitarian ones.

“This is not a draftee army anymore,” he said. “These are all volunteers, and you have to take better care of them than you did in the draftee days, where it didn’t matter what the individual soldiers did (because) there were 10 coming in to replace them on any day.”

Only comprehensive culture change can be the real answer, he added. That could take a significant amount of time, and it means focusing on more than suicide prevention. It means emphasizing wellness, exploring supplemental forms of treatment such as yoga and training veterans to look out for one another.

Mental health should instead be a significant element of veterans’ everyday care, he said. And everyone else’s, too.

If that $9 billion is spent wisely, Wilkie said he thinks it’s possible the VA could lead the conversation on effective psychiatric treatment in the United States.

“We have a community-based system here,” he said. “We have a culture that promotes communication, and what I see across the country — today, sadly, the fourth new York City policeman (in three weeks) has sadly taken his life. We’ve seen suicide among teenagers spiking. So it’s not just veterans. It’s the entire country that needs to be brought into this.”

Despite years of setbacks, many of which still weigh on his agency, Wilkie said he has generally witnessed encouraging progress since he assumed his post in June 2018.

He hopes to see much more ahead.

“Most of my professional and political career, the VA has always been 16 or 17 out of 17 in terms of best places in the government to work,” he said. “We’re No. 6 now, and will likely be higher when the next ratings come out. So (those are) incredible steps forward, and I think it’s incumbent upon me, as someone who comes from the military — I was working for General Mattis when this offer came — to tell that story and encourage veterans to use the VA.

“This is a home for them with people who have served.”"
"DOJ probe expands beyond Boeing 737 MAX, includes 787 Dreamliner",https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Steve Miletich', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/federal-prosecutors-issue-subpoena-for-boeing-787-dreamliner-records/,"Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed records from Boeing relating to the production of the 787 Dreamliner in South Carolina, where there have been allegations of shoddy work, according to two sources familiar with the investigation.

The subpoena was issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ), the sources said. DOJ is also conducting a criminal investigation into the certification and design of the 737 MAX after two deadly crashes of that jetliner.

The 787 subpoena significantly widens the scope of the DOJ’s scrutiny of safety issues at Boeing.

The two sources who revealed the subpoena spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the inquiries.

A third source said a handful of subpoenas were issued in early June to individual employees at Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner production plant in North Charleston, South Carolina.

DOJ spokesman Peter Carr, in Washington, D.C., declined to comment Friday. A Boeing spokesman said, “We don’t comment on legal matters.”

It wasn’t clear if the subpoena served on the company was issued by the same prosecutors overseeing the 737 MAX investigation. But the third source, also speaking on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the inquiries, said the subpoenas to employees at the South Carolina plant came from the “same group” of prosecutors involved in the 737 MAX investigation, including DOJ trial attorneys Cory Jacobs and Carol Sipperly in the Fraud Section.

Boeing divides its Dreamliner production between the South Carolina assembly plant, which rolled out its first plane in 2012, and the sprawling Everett facility where it has built jets for decades. The 737 MAX is built in Renton.

Federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., have been looking into the development of the 737 MAX, including a new flight-safety control system known as MCAS, after one crash on Oct. 29 off Indonesia and another in Ethiopia on March 10. Those disasters killed 346 people and led to worldwide grounding of the plane.

The grand-jury investigation into the MAX has been cloaked in secrecy, but some of the Justice Department’s activities have become known as prosecutors issued subpoenas for documents. The Department of Transportation’s Inspector General and the FBI are working with the DOJ.

A Seattle Times story in March detailed how Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) managers pushed its engineers to delegate more of the certification process for the 737 MAX to Boeing itself. The Times story also detailed flaws in an original safety analysis that Boeing delivered to the FAA.

Allegations relating to the 787 Dreamliner have centered on shoddy work and cutting corners at the company’s South Carolina plant.

While there are differences in the 737 and 787 matters, prosecutors are likely looking into whether broad cultural problems run throughout the company, according to the third source and a person in South Carolina, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter.

That could include pressure to sign off on faulty work to avoid delays in delivering planes to customers, the source said.

The New York Times reported in April that the North Charleston plant has been plagued by production issues and weak oversight that threatened to compromise safety.

Production ran years behind schedule, due to manufacturing and supplier problems, before the plane entered service in 2011.

The newspaper, citing a review of hundreds of pages of internal emails, corporate documents and federal records, as well as interviews with current and former employees, described a culture that often valued production speed over quality. Confronting manufacturing delays at the plant, Boeing pushed its workforce to quickly turn out Dreamliners, at times ignoring issues raised by employees, the newspaper reported.

The Dreamliner, introduced in 2007 and billed as Boeing’s most important new plane in a generation, featured lightweight carbon-fiber fuselage and advanced technology.

Initially assembled just in Everett, it was popular with airlines, prompting Boeing to break ground on a second Dreamliner plant in 2009 in South Carolina, which has the lowest percentage of union members of any state in the country.

Last year the Everett plant produced 55% of the 145 Dreamliners that Boeing delivered, while the South Carolina factory delivered the rest. The biggest 787, the -10 model, is assembled only in South Carolina.

The entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 after two battery-overheating incidents: a battery fire on an empty 787 parked at the gate at Boston airport, then a smoldering battery on a flight in Japan that forced an emergency landing. The FAA lifted the grounding in April 2013 after Boeing modified the jets with beefed-up batteries, containment boxes and venting tubes.

In the 737 MAX investigation, prosecutors appear to be getting information from someone with inside knowledge of the plane’s development based on the questions they are asking, the third source said.

That investigation was opened after the first crash, a highly unusual step for prosecutors after one crash, prompting speculation that someone had come forward with information, the source said.

Still, prosecutors appear to be trying to figure out whether a crime occurred, given the general scope of their questions, the source said.

Prosecutors will be looking for any evidence of the “hallmarks of classic fraud” — misrepresentation to federal regulators and customers, one of the sources said, comparing the investigation to the Justice Department’s probe of Volkswagen that led to criminal charges in an emissions scandal.

In 2017, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to three criminal felony counts and agreed to pay a $2.8 billion criminal penalty as a result of the company’s scheme to sell diesel vehicles in the U.S. by cheating on emissions tests mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board.

Boeing has not been charged with any crime related to the 737 crashes or the 787 production."
DHS acting chief predicts up to 25 percent drop in border crossings after new Mexico agreement,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-dhs-chief-predicts-25-percent-drop-in-border-numbers-after-agreement-with-mexico,"The acting head of the Department of Homeland Security on Friday said that he expects the number of migrants apprehended at the border will be lower by up to 25 percent in June than in previous months after Mexico increased its enforcement measures.

“It’s become clear that over the past three weeks since the administration reached a new agreement with Mexico that we’ve seen a substantial increase in the number of interdictions on the Mexican southern border, and a sincere effort to address the transportation networks coming through Mexico,” Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan told reporters.

DEMS RUN LEFT ON IMMIGRATION: DEBATE FEATURES VOWS OF HEALTH CARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED, DEPORTATION CURBS

The U.S. and Mexico reached agreement this month on a deal that sees Mexico take “unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration” in exchange for the U.S. dropping proposed sanctions on Mexican imports.

McAleenan said the U.S. was looking to see Mexico increase its deployment of National Guard members to the border, and for the expansion of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) -- which allow for illegal immigrants to be returned to Mexico while their immigration proceedings are held.

""These initiatives are making an impact and we are now anticipating a significant reduction in border crossing numbers from June, as much as 25 percent when compared to the record level in May,” he said.

NEW LEADERS INSTALLED AT TOP IMMIGRATION AGENCIES AMID QUESTIONS OVER DHS SECRETARY'S FUTURE

Customs and Border Protection said that it encountered more than 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. NBC News reports that in 2018 there was a 17 percent decrease from May to June.

McAleenan also said the U.S. is working with Northern Triangle countries to deal with root causes of the migration crisis and increase efforts to tackle organized smuggling organizations in the region.

His remarks come a day after the House passed the Senate version of a $4.5 humanitarian aid bill. It passed after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed down from a push to include restrictions on immigration enforcement that could have scuttled the measure. Trump is expected to sign the bill early next week.

McAleenan thanked congressional leaders for getting the bill passed, and said that while it didn’t include everything DHS wanted in it -- specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention beds for single adults -- it “substantially addresses” the request for funding.

He also took issue with media reports that children at detention centers were not being given vital supplies while in detention, leading to an outcry from lawmakers on Capitol Hill about alleged conditions at the centers. He said that while he has testified for months about concerns over the ability of DHS to handle the vast number of migrants crossing the border, those calls received little attention. But he said that some reports were ""missing the story.""

""Contrary to the reporting, children in CBP custody at the border are receiving access to key supplies, including toothbrushes, appropriate meals, blankets, showers as soon as they can be provided, and medical screening,"" McAleenan said."
Elizabeth Warren says no wealthy donors as ambassadors in State plan,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/28/19102522/elizabeth-warren-state-department-plan-2020,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) just released her vision for how she would run the State Department from the Oval Office — and it’s a dramatic change from how President Donald Trump has handled America’s diplomatic corps.

In a Friday Medium post, Warren vowed to pursue a “diplomacy-first strategy” as president as opposed to conducting US foreign policy mostly through the better-funded Pentagon. To do that, she says, her administration would invest much more in the current and future diplomats that serve in roughly 270 posts around the world.

“American security and prosperity depend on robust diplomacy,” she wrote. “Our diplomats are the front line of our engagement with the world.”

Her piece details that she won’t allow wealthy campaign donors to become ambassadors, how she aims to double the size of the diplomatic corps while improving diversity in its ranks, and how she’d create a diplomatic equivalent of ROTC programs in universities, among other moves.

It makes sense for Warren to put out a vision like this. First, having a plan for every aspect of governance is kind of her thing. Second, her overall foreign policy views prioritize diplomacy over using the military. And third, the Trump administration has caused much heartburn at the State Department by proposing lower budgets and failing to nominate qualified people for key positions, although that’s starting to change.

But because it’s a relatively short Medium post, the senator’s State Department plan is lacking many details about how, exactly, she would turn her aspirations into reality. There’s no mention about how she’d fight a GOP-led Senate to spend more and confirm nominees, there’s no real connection (yet) with how these views intersect with her thoughts on defense and development, and no discussion of tradeoffs she might face while prioritizing the State Department’s revamp.

Still, offering a State Department plan makes her the leading candidate on the issue during the 2020 cycle (for now). And what she offers are some concrete proposals that would let Warren put her mark on one of America’s oldest governmental professions.

How Warren wants to fix the State Department

Warren’s plan comes down to three main proposals that, if enacted, would substantially change the way the State Department has been managed under Trump — and that represent something of a departure from how the department was run under President Barack Obama, too.

1) No wealthy donors become ambassadors

This is likely the part of Warren’s plan that will get the most attention. There’s a long tradition of presidents in both parties nominating some of their richest financial supporters to plum ambassadorial posts. In Obama’s second term, for example, he named 31 campaign “bundlers” — people who raised at least $50,000 for his campaign — as an embassy’s top diplomat.

“Nearly all of these bundlers ... serve in Western European nations or other highly developed and stable countries such as Canada and New Zealand,” the Center for Public Integrity reported in January 2017.

Trump continued the practice by nominating 14 inauguration donors — who gave on average about $350,000 — as ambassadors. What’s worse, the people he nominated for top embassy posts were less qualified than in administrations past, as the February chart from Axios below shows. (The nominated ambassadors also gave more money to his campaign, on average, than previous rich donors gave other presidents.)

Warren says that trend would end under her watch. “I’ll make my ambassadorial appointments based on only one thing: finding the most qualified person for the job,” she wrote. “I won’t give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers — period,” she continued, calling on other candidates to promise the same.

That said, it’s somewhat easy for Warren to make this pledge. She’s already not taking money from high rollers or speaking at big fundraisers, so her bench of wealthy supporters is already thin. Still, her vow, if enacted, would end a long-standing problem of pay-for-play at some of America’s most important embassies.

2) Revamp the diplomatic corps

Warren blames Trump for many diplomats recently leaving the government, but she also notes that’s been a problem for a while. “Years of hiring freezes and spending cuts have caused many talented diplomats to head for the doors,” she wrote.

So Warren proposes two ways to change that: double the size of the foreign service and improve the diversity in the diplomatic corps.

Those go hand in hand. Right now, America’s diplomats are mainly white and male. “[T]he Foreign Service is not sufficiently representative of the American people with respect to race, gender, socioeconomic background, and regional origin,” a May 2018 Congressional Research Service report noted.

That means there’s a vast, untapped pool of people around the country that may be interested in a diplomatic posting. To reach out to them, Warren says she’ll “dedicate recruiting resources to applicants from HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] and other minority-serving institutions, women’s colleges, and community colleges. And I’ll double the size of fellowships designed to recruit minority and low-income diplomats.”

She’ll also push for universities to have a ROTC-like program for diplomats as well as double the size of the Peace Corps.

Trump, meanwhile, has consistently proposed cuts to the State Deparment budget and recruited secretaries of state that seem intent on lowering diplomatic ranks. Multiple diplomats I’ve talked to since the start of this administration have consistently noted the poor morale among the corps and just how understaffed — and therefore overworked — they all are.

Warren’s changes, then, will certainly require tons of effort and a decent chunk of money (although surely a lot, lot less than the Pentagon spends). It’s unlikely she could completely alter the face of the US diplomatic corps in four or even eight years. But she seems intent on making structural tweaks quickly in hopes of long-term change.

3) Improve the lives of diplomats

Diplomats have to deal with two big institutional challenges. First, they work for a large, impersonal bureaucracy that doesn’t always let the best talent rise to the top. Second, their service in major cities around the world makes it harder to raise a family and strike a normal work-life balance.

Warren wants to alter all that.

She proposes creating a “core professional development curriculum” which would help diplomats improve in their jobs and prepare for more senior roles. That will help her make at least one Deputy Secretary — a position right under the secretary of state — a career ambassador, one of the corps’ top designations.

The senator also aims to “enhance workplace flexibility to retain a diverse workforce.” She’d do that, in part, by “expanding parental leave and preferential postings for new parents.” That means new mothers and fathers wouldn’t be penalized as much for starting a family in the hyper-competitive State Department. What’s more, raising a kid in a more developed country could make an upbringing easier than, say, growing up in a warzone.

None of this is to say Warren’s plan is perfect; no plan is. But even in a short Medium post, Warren has given more thought about what to do with the State Deparment than many (if not all) of her Democratic opponents. The question now is if any other presidential candidate — including Trump — can come up with a better plan in the months ahead."

Amid all the turmoil, some appropriators wonder whether the differences in the Democratic caucus are becoming too wide to bridge.

""I mean, you saw what happened in the border supplemental,” said Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), an appropriator on the Homeland Security subcommittee.

“There was no money for detention beds, there was no money for deportation, but people were afraid anytime they saw the word ICE,"" he said, referring to the position of progressives who remained dissatisfied with the bill.

On the other hand, Cuellar argued, moderates and red state Democrats did not want to seem soft on immigration, which could hurt their reelection chances.

Democrats would have an easier time passing the bill alongside other must-pass spending bills, Cuellar said, citing the strategy used to pass the Defense spending bill in the same group as the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education bill.

“My understanding is it's going to be difficult to go by itself. Not impossible, but difficult,” Cuellar said. “Because, you know, there's some extreme positions, so the best way is to pass it is to put it as part of a package.”

But Democrats have already passed 10 of the 12 appropriations bills, leaving only the largely non-controversial Legislative Branch bill as a possible partner. That measure was separated from an earlier package when controversy erupted over whether to increase congressional pay.

One potential option would be to tie the DHS bill to the defense authorization, but it’s unusual to pair spending bills with authorizing measures.

As of now, Democrats have no plans to put the DHS bill on the floor, according to a Democratic aide, but they are intent to keep trying to win over the caucus.

""We're certainly working to make sure that the whole caucus, as we always do, recognizes it's a good bill,"" said Rep.

Unlike the border supplemental, however, Democrats do not yet have to worry about their bill being overshadowed by a Senate compromise. The Senate has not introduced a single appropriations bill for fiscal year 2020.

But when it does, the DHS measure is sure to become a serious point of contention. In December, disagreements over that bill, and President Trump’s requested border wall funding, led to a 35-day shutdown, the longest in the country’s history."

TRUMP DELAYS PLANNED ICE RAIDS TO SEE IF CONGRESS CAN SOLVE BORDER CRISIS

""My primary responsibility is the safety of the men and women who go out there every day to protect the American people. And so it's just not true."" — Kevin McAleenan, acting DHS secretary

McAleenan was accused last week of leaking plans for raids scheduled by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a unit of the DHS, after supposedly expressing fierce opposition to the plan and allegedly ordering top officials to “stand down” on the operation.

The source also said Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

McAleenan also denied that anyone in his office leaked the information after host Laura Ingraham pressed further, saying that as the operation date nears ""you have to push information out into the field.""

""So tonight you're saying these rumors are wrong false and you did not do that?"" Ingraham asked.

""Absolutely not,"" McAleenan responded.

The acting secretary also commented on the Democratic presidential candidates advocating for decriminalizing illegal border crossings, saying it would ""further undermine our efforts at the border"" and increase the numbers of those crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

""Decriminalizing crossing between ports of entry when we know it's associated with criminal smugglers ... when they know they bring drugs behind those people that are crossing, it would just add to the problem,"" McAleenan said.

REGULATIONS: EPA found a 'typo' in its carbon rule. Why it matters,https://www.eenews.net,['Jean Chemnick'],,,,https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060678675,"When EPA released its Affordable Clean Energy rule last month, it appeared to leave Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories out of its cost-benefit analysis.

The regulatory impact analysis for the power plant carbon rule — posted on EPA's website on June 19, a few hours after the rule itself — included language strongly hinting that displaced Alaskan villages and flooded Hawaiian coastal infrastructure had never been part of the Trump administration's controversial accounting for the cost of climate change to the American economy.

That appears to have been a mistake.

A spokesperson for EPA called it a ""typo"" in an email last Tuesday and two days later reported that the ""typo"" had been corrected.

But how, exactly, the Trump administration arrived at its carbon cost estimates remains unclear.

Advertisement

The Trump administration has used the so-called interim domestic social cost of carbon estimates to justify the ACE rule and a handful of other administration regulatory actions over the last two years.

Before E&E News inquired about the issue, EPA's regulatory document stated that the estimates ""account for the direct impacts of climate change that are anticipated to occur within the contiguous 48 states.""

That sentence seemed to imply that carbon cost estimates — which environmental economists already criticize as artificially low because they exclude climate-related economic pain outside of U.S. borders — might also ignore impacts for two states and five U.S. territories.

If the line was an error, last year's proposed version of the ACE rule included it, too. And it caught the eye of analysts at New York University School of Law's Institute for Policy Integrity.

""The arbitrary limitation of EPA's 'domestic-only' focus is highlighted by the fact that the regulatory impact analysis reports that the social cost of greenhouse gas estimates actually only cover effects to the contiguous 48 states, meaning some of the most climate-vulnerable areas of the United States — Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, other island and maritime territories, and military bases located outside U.S. borders — are all omitted,"" wrote the Institute for Policy Integrity and partners, including the Union of Concerned Scientists and Natural Resources Defense Council, in comments to EPA.

Jason Schwartz, the institute's legal director, said EPA never responded and apparently didn't correct its copy.

The states and territories in question all have coastlines that would be affected by up to 3.2 feet of sea-level rise this century, according to last year's National Climate Assessment.

That peer-reviewed assessment by experts at 13 federal agencies estimated that more than $19 billion in Hawaiian infrastructure could be flooded due to sea-level rise. Puerto Rico's government has estimated it will cost almost $140 billion to recover from Hurricane Maria, and the NCA says climate change will make hyperactive hurricane seasons like 2017 more common.

Meanwhile, thawing glaciers, melting permafrost and erosion could damage Alaska's infrastructure and hydrology. Congress spent $15 million last year to move the village of Newtok's 350 inhabitants after they were displaced by coastal erosion. The Government Accountability Office says 30 other Alaskan villages face similar threats.

""We are warming faster than any other part of the country,"" said Andy Moderow, state director for the Alaska Wilderness League. ""Leaving Alaska out, if they did that, is just absurd.""

$1 a ton

The extent to which the architects of the interim domestic social cost of carbon, or SC-CO2, considered Alaska and Hawaii is still unclear. The administration has provided some information about how it developed the estimates it uses in rulemakings like ACE, but questions remain about key inputs and assumptions.

Critics say the three models that were used to develop the SC-CO2 — called DICE, FUND and PAGE — don't easily lend themselves to the kind of U.S.-only approximation of climate damages the Trump administration wanted for its rulemakings. They're tested and peer-reviewed to calculate global damages.

""They claim they're able to pull these domestic-only numbers out of the underlying models, but they don't really describe how they're doing that,"" Schwartz said.

The PAGE and FUND models don't include Alaska and Hawaii in the same region as the Lower 48 states. The PAGE model is based on the length of the world's coastlines, and the SC-CO2 assigns the United States a proportion. The DICE model relies on gross domestic product, so the Trump estimate has assumed the United States will see 10% of global climate damages in proportion to its global share of GDP.

The Obama administration used averaged results from the same three integrated assessment models for its global social cost of carbon, which underpinned scores of federal actions like the Clean Power Plan. Obama's last social cost of carbon estimated damages at $42 per ton of CO2 in 2020 and $70 by 2050.

But congressional Republicans complained that under Obama's global social cost of carbon, U.S. industry and consumers were being asked to pay for climate benefits in other countries. So Trump issued an executive order in March 2017 that interpreted a George W. Bush-era directive to limit estimates for benefits to the United States. The Trump administration's values also steeply discount losses decades in the future.

The end result is that the Trump administration's estimates are as low as $1 per ton in the ACE rule and elsewhere.

""They looked for two dials that would reduce the social cost of carbon as much as possible, they found them, and they turned them,"" said Michael Greenstone, a chief economist at the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama.

The lower the estimate for the cost of carbon, the costlier cutting carbon looks. Because it used the U.S.-only figures, the ACE rule's cost-benefit analysis showed the rule's relatively modest costs exceeded its benefits by nearly $1 billion over 15 years.

""The dream of all policy wonks is to have evidence-based policymaking where the evidence leads to the policy,"" said Greenstone, who is now an economics professor at the University of Chicago. ""This looks and smells an awful lot like evidence-based policymaking where you decide what the policy is going to be and then go back and make the evidence up.""

'Cream in your coffee'

In the Tuesday email to E&E News — in which the sentence about ""48 contiguous states"" was described as a ""typo"" — the EPA spokesperson said ""impacts occurring in Hawaii, Alaska, or U.S. territories are reflected to the extent they are included in the default versions of the integrated assessment models that are used to estimate the SC-CO2.""

A question about whether those states and territories were included in default versions of the models went unanswered.

""The vagueness of the U.S. government's answer to your question plus their earlier mistake seems to indicate that the government does not know,"" said Peter Howard, the Institute for Policy Integrity's economics director.

EPA has now ""corrected"" the line in its ACE document to read: ""The SC-CO2 estimates used in this RIA account for the direct impacts of climate change that are anticipated to occur within the United States.""

The SC-CO2 has also been used in Bureau of Land Management and EPA rules for wasted gas and leaked methane from oil and gas development. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2008 that federal agencies must assign a value to changes in greenhouse gas emissions from regulations.

Environmentalists say a domestic-only figure doesn't sufficiently capture impacts like mosquito-borne illnesses that spread around the world or disruptions to international supply chains. And it encourages other countries to disregard damages in the United States.

""If the pollution is going to spread around the world, like cream in your coffee, evenly and affect everywhere, then you have to account for the damage that's done everywhere,"" said David Doniger, senior strategic director of NRDC's Climate and Clean Energy program. ""We want the Chinese, we want the Europeans, we want everyone in the world who emits carbon pollution to care about and account for damage they're doing to us.

""The quid pro quo is we have to care about them."""
Trump campaign looks to gain support with Latino voters despite president’s harsh approach to immigration,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Josh Dawsey', 'Reporter Covering The White House']",06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-looks-to-gain-support-with-latino-voters-despite-presidents-harsh-approach-to-immigration/2019/06/29/41aa413e-9776-11e9-a027-c571fd3d394d_story.html,"Vice President Pence speaks during the launching of the “Latinos for Trump” coalition in Miami on Tuesday. (Cristobal Herrera/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

In an effort to buttress President Trump’s reelection chances, the Trump campaign is reaching out to an unlikely group: Latino and Hispanic voters.

In recent weeks, the campaign has made several hires to court these voters and placed targeted ads in Florida. Meanwhile, Trump conducted his first presidential interview with Spanish-language media giant Telemundo, and Vice President Pence flew to Miami on Tuesday to officially launch the “Latinos for Trump” coalition.

“All Americans everywhere draw inspiration from the Latino Americans’ steadfast love of liberty,” Pence said, appearing in front of a ballroom crowd.

The president’s aides and advisers said the effort to target Latino voters reflects the need to expand the president’s base of support beyond his most fervent backers to prevail again in key swing states such as Florida as well as a belief that Trump can make a compelling case based on the performance of the economy.

“It’s absolutely critical to his reelection to win over some Hispanic voters, and he can do it by being a little more open on some of these immigration issues. He doesn’t need a majority. He just needs to move the needle,” said Chris Ruddy, a longtime Trump friend. “He has too many people around him telling him to stick to the base when he owns the base.”

But Trump faces an enormous challenge given his fraught relationship with the Latino community that began when he launched his campaign in 2015 by disparaging Mexican immigrants and continues through his frequent warnings about the dangers posed by Central American migrants trying to enter the United States across the southern border.

For many of the president’s opponents, the outreach efforts are viewed as a cruel joke amid the backdrop of the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, his harsh attacks on immigrants and threats of deportation. Melissa Mark-Viverito, the interim president of the liberal Latino Victory Fund, said she expects a record number of Latino voters to show up at the polls to cast their ballots against Trump.



“Every day, it’s an onslaught against our community. We know we’re under attack. We know nothing good is going to come out of a second term of this administration,” she said. “It’s a slap in our face.”

Polling released this week by Telemundo underscored the challenge facing the campaign in attracting Latino and Hispanic voters. In the key swing state of Florida, 34 percent of Hispanic voters would like to see Trump reelected, while 56 percent would prefer to replace him with a Democrat, according to the survey conducted by Mason-Dixon Strategies.

The numbers were even less favorable to Trump in other states, although they are mostly solid Democratic territories.

In California, 26 percent of Hispanic voters would like to see Trump reelected, while 66 percent would prefer a Democrat. In Texas, 25 percent would like to see him returned to office, while 69 percent want a Democrat. And in the New York metro area, 19 percent want Trump reelected, while 73 percent prefer a Democrat.

Trump won 28 percent of the Latino vote in 2016, compared with more than 40 percent for George W. Bush in 2004 — though he essentially matched Mitt Romney’s 2012 total.

About 29 million Latino voters are now registered to vote, and almost 12 million voted in the 2018 midterm elections, according to the Pew Research Center.

Trump’s supporters say the president should frame his message around the economy and national security. Hispanic unemployment is at historic lows, and campaign officials say many Hispanic voters even appreciate the president’s tough immigration rhetoric. They declined to show data supporting that assertion, and some of the campaign’s early data indicates the president is in a disappointing spot among Latino voters, according to campaign officials who were granted anonymity to discuss the issue.

The campaign on Wednesday bought two full-page ads in the Miami Herald and the Nuevo Herald, making an economic argument for “Latinos for Trump.”

The ads also argued a point campaign officials often make. “President Trump is clear on immigration: Millions have followed the law to come to America, new immigrants should too,” the ad read.

But even some of the president’s supporters are skeptical about the campaign’s ability to attract more Latino voters.

Al Zapanta, who leads the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce, said he supported Trump in 2016 and is helping lobby for passage of the recent trade deal struck with Mexico and Canada. He has recently visited the White House for meetings with senior officials, he said, but not the president.

“The Republican Party has really missed the opportunity to bring in the Hispanic and Latino vote,” Zapanta said. “The party still hasn’t decided they really want to make that a reality.”

Zapanta said he believed Trump could secure more support and hoped he would. “I haven’t seen at this point that focus,” he said.

Officials have been trying to sell donors on the idea that Trump can be more competitive with Latino voters, with campaign manager Brad Parscale saying during a recent presentation at the Willard Hotel that the campaign expected to secure more support from the community, according to people familiar with his remarks.

The campaign recently hired a coalitions director to build support among Latino communities, and it has hired a national press secretary to handle Latino members of the media. Hannah Castillo, the coalitions director, is expected to hire at least a dozen people, campaign officials said. About two dozen community and political leaders in Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada and other states are on board, according to the campaign.

Also on board is Alex Garcia, the RNC’s Latino outreach director in Florida in 2018, to lead the Trump campaign in the state. Advisers are building advertisements to target voters in Spanish, and they have targeted particular communities in Florida for messaging.

In Venezuela, Trump and his aides see policies that are appreciated by Cuban Americans — even though the effort to oust President Nicolás Maduro has stalled, and Trump has grown frustrated.

Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, has cast his legal immigration plan as a messaging device to the Latino community, White House officials said. But the plan has picked up scant support while the president continues to use incendiary rhetoric.

Still, campaign aides said they believe there have been heartening signs. At an El Paso event, much of the crowd was Hispanic and in from New Mexico, officials said, giving the campaign hope they could play in a state where Trump lost by a large margin in 2016.

Ruddy said the campaign must do more to convince Latino news outlets to change coverage of Trump. “Only a handful of media outlets really control news to the Latino population, and they are almost entirely nonstop, anti-him,” he said.

Doug Deason, a prominent Trump donor, said he recently spoke with the president about Hispanic voters at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Deason said he encouraged the president to occasionally tweet about how much he loves Hispanic voters and what he has done for them.

“They’re just concerned. Does he like us? So he needs to make it really clear. I told him, you have to let them know you love them,” Deason said. “I know you love them, but you have to let them know.”

Trump seemed surprised, he said.

“He was shocked to hear that,” Deason said. Trump, according to Deason, then turned to Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and now a senior White House adviser, and said “You got that, Kellyanne?”

“She said, ‘Yes sir, I got it,’ ” Deason said.

Correction: An earlier version of this story innaccurately stated that Trump conducted his first presidential interview with Spanish-language media outlet Univision.

Roger Stone’s lawyers punch back at DOJ over charges of violating gag order,https://www.politico.com,['Darren Samuelsohn'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/27/roger-stone-lawyer-gag-order-1386122,"Former Trump adviser Roger Stone's lawyers argued he was within his First Amendment rights with his social media activity. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images legal Roger Stone’s lawyers punch back at DOJ over charges of violating gag order

Roger Stone’s lawyers swung back Thursday at federal prosecutors accusing the longtime Donald Trump adviser of violating a court-imposed gag order that could send him to jail.

In an 11-page reply, Stone’s attorneys argued their client was well within his First Amendment rights when he recently posted several times on social media his criticism of the press coverage surrounding his case.

Story Continued Below

A federal judge in Washington D.C. ordered Stone in February to cease commenting about the charges he’s fighting — which center around allegedly making false statements to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering — so as to not destroy the possibility of a fair trial in his case later this fall.

But the U.S. attorney’s office that took over the prosecution originally brought by former special counsel Robert Mueller last week flagged several Stone Instagram posts, including some questioning why the press wasn’t paying more attention to his lawyers' recent legal filings.

Responding on Thursday, Stone’s lawyers argue that he has indeed respected the court’s order and that the posts in dispute “are not ‘statements’, nor do they pose a danger to the fair trial concern which was (and is) the constitutional raison d’etre of the Order.”

Stone’s lawyers questioned the government’s focus on three specific social media posts, which they say “exhibits a willful blindness to the tens of thousands of hostile-to-Stone articles which have been authored by others about the ‘investigation’ and Stone’s ‘case;’ articles, animated cartoons, comments, editorials, television and radio programs, panels, celebrity ‘dark comedy’ readings of the Special Counsel Report, and even a comedic portrayal of Roger Stone by Steve Martin on Saturday Night Live which satirically portrayed Stone as a caricature of himself.” The SNL skit has tallied more than 4.4 million views on YouTube, the attorneys noted.

“The ‘prejudice’ to be concerned about is prejudice against Stone; his lonely voice presents no threat to a fair trial under this Court’s supervision. Of more concern should be the Washington Post’s unrelenting coverage of Roger Stone,” his lawyers argued.

The Stone lawyers’ combative response to the alleged gag order violations marks a far different tone than the one the defense took the last time Stone found himself in trouble on the same issue. In February, Judge Amy Berman Jackson restricted Stone’s public speech after he posted a photo of her on social media with what looked like gun-sight crosshairs.

During a hearing on the matter where he also faced the prospect of jail time, Stone apologized for the post. ""I let you down,” he told Jackson. “I let myself down. I let my family down. I let my attorneys down. I can only say I'm sorry. It was a momentary lapse in judgment. Perhaps I talk too much.""

Jackson ended that hearing by expanding the gag order on Stone — originally, he was allowed to discuss his case, so long as it wasn’t in the immediate vicinity of the Washington D.C. courthouse where he’ll go on trial Nov. 5 — to cover all speech about the case. The judge, an appointee of President Barack Obama, also gave him an ultimatum. ""No, Mr. Stone, I'm not giving you another chance,"" she said. ""I have serious doubts about whether you've learned any lesson at all. It is my job to make sure this trial does not devolve into a circus.""

The latest posts to potentially land Stone in trouble center around messages asking why several major news organizations didn't cover a recent filing his lawyers made arguing that the government did not independently verify that Russian operatives hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Stone posted several more articles touting his attorneys' work, tagging one, ""Funny, No @nytimes or @washingtonpost coverage of this development.""

Prosecutors have since filed a separate document refuting Stone's claims that the government didn't independently confirm that Russia was behind the DNC hack.

The government has also flagged a Stone comment, written on Instagram, about a May report in POLITICO describing Jackson's order to see an unredacted version of any still-secret portions of the Mueller report related to his case.

""The Judge has ruled but @Politico gets most of the story wrong because they are biased elitist snot-nosed fake news shitheads who's [sic] specialty is distortion by omitting key facts to create a false narrative. #rogerstonedidnothingwrong #rogerstone #fakenews,"" Stone's post said.

The Stone reply on Thursday argued that the at-issue posts only included headlines from other media backing up his arguments, but he never posted a link to the actual story. They explained that a Stone post from April that the government flagged to Jackson — drawing attention to a CNN story about the FBI refusing a public records request for emails to CNN — only raises a “rhetorical question.” And his post about the POLITICO story is simply criticism of that media outlet.

“The government’s offer of this posting reveals the government’s desire to tarnish Stone, not to try him here on the facts,” his attorneys wrote. “Stone’s language may be indecorous at times, but that does not obscure the content’s non-culpability under the Order. Criticism of the media is not a violation of the Order.”

More broadly, Stone’s attorneys argue that their client “is the most minor of participants” who generates far less media attention to his case compared with Mueller himself, Attorney General William Barr or many others pulled into the wider Russia probe.

“The 2,402 ‘likes’ of the June 18- 19 Stone postings are but a speck compared to the torrent of publicity, commentary and commotion generated by persons, publications and politicians over which, and over whom, Stone has no control,” his attorneys wrote. “Even witnesses who will be called to testify in this case are contributing to the cacophony.”

Here, the Stone attorneys cited Randy Credico, a New York-based political satirist and radio host whose contacts with WikiLeaks’ founder Julian Assange make him a central figure in the Stone case. Credico, named in the Stone indictment as one of the witnesses he attempted to intimidate, has said he’s received a subpoena to appear at the upcoming Stone trial.

Despite the defense’s unapologetic tone and the insistence that none of the Instagram posts ran afoul of Jackson’s gag order, the new filing indicates Stone has deleted the post attacking POLITICO as well as two of the other seven posts to which the government recently objected. No explanation was given for the deletions.

Jackson has yet to signal what her next steps will be — including possibly holding a public hearing — on the Stone gag order issue. In an order last Friday, she gave Stone’s attorneys until Thursday to file any response in writing “why the Court should not find that the defendant has violated the Court's order dated February 21, 2019 and his conditions of release.”

"U.S. Corn Acreage Way Above Trade Expectations, Market Falls, USDA/WASDE Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/us-corn-acreage-to-drop-to-record-low-usdawasde-says,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- The USDA sees the U.S. 2019 corn acreage nearly unchanged from its March estimate, according to its June Acreage Report released Friday.

As a result, the corn dropped 'limit down’ 25¢, basis the Sept. futures contract, while the soybean market moved up 11¢ per bushel, following the report.

Trade Reaction

Jack Scoville, PRICE Futures Group, says that USDA gave the markets another shocker today.

“Everyone was looking for more beans and less corn and got exactly the opposite. That is why the big reaction, and it is perfectly understandable. A 25¢ range in corn in less than 3 minutes is something. No one understands the corn planted and harvested area, as USDA had not shown that type of progress in the weekly data. The stocks reports are kind of friendly, but the planted area report is the headline and most likely not in a good way for a lot of traders and brokers. These are wild numbers. I do have one farmer who has been telling me that a lot of corn got planted early in the month, but even so, these numbers are hard to believe,” Scoville says.

Sal Gilbertie, Teucrium Trading, says that the USDA corn acreage estimate is telling.

“Farmers were clearly incentivized to plant corn in order to capture government benefits contingent on getting something into the ground this season. Look for the July WASDE to reflect a slightly improved corn balance sheet and to tighten the soybean balance sheet perhaps more than was anticipated prior to today’s acreage report,” Gilbertie says.

Gilbert adds, “Wheat disappearance reflects the healthy rate of wheat exports we’ve seen so far this year.”

Britt O’Connell, cash adviser for Commodity Risk Management Group, says that not a lot of people will believe today’s USDA corn acreage estimate.

“I don’t think anyone saw this coming. I doubt there is much belief in the published numbers. Trade is telling us that as well. Touched limit down and now trading down 17 to 18,” O’Connell says. “What a wild ride. At one point, we were up 14¢ to 15¢.”

The confusion is occurring because USDA starts March with planting intentions of 92.4 million acres. After a wet spring with delayed planting, the USDA takes 3.0 million corn acres out of production in its May WASDE, O’Connell says.

“That’s not a typical move, but nonetheless something that was very easy to rationalize and warrant. Today, USDA places planted acres at 91.7 million acres. Effectively saying that we planted all of the acres that we originally had planned,” O’Connell says.

A further dive into the numbers on a state-by-state look, points to states that have struggled tremendously – Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, to be planting either the same amount of acres of more than last year, O’Connell says.

“It simply doesn’t add up. This should be viewed as a buying opportunity on corn. Bean number could hold some water, with burdensome stocks continuing to loom over that market. Even with this bullish news in beans, they can only muster up a 10¢ rally.

Jason Roose, U.S. Commodities, says that today’s USDA Report continues to give shock waves in the grains.

“Last month the large drop in yield for corn, due to poor planting conditions, was considered friendly. The shock today, with an anticipated 4- to 5-million-acre drop in corn, was that USDA reduced corn acreage by only 1.1 million. But the soybean acre number was lowered by 4.6 million acres, with these numbers being shifted by the USDA. The large stocks on beans could be jeopardized. Weather will be watched closer now than most markets we have seen in modern times.”"
New leaders installed at top immigration agencies amid questions over DHS secretary’s future,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-leaders-installed-at-top-immigration-agencies-amid-questions-over-dhs-secretarys-future,"The Trump administration named new leaders Thursday to top immigration agencies amid a deepening crisis at the border -- and swirling speculation over the future of the Homeland Security secretary who oversees it all after he was accused of leaking a highly sensitive operation.

Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday announced that Mark Morgan, who was serving as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would be shifted over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to replace former Commissioner John Sanders, who abruptly resigned from his post this week. ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence was tapped to replace Morgan at that agency.

But bigger questions now surround McAleenan himself.

Two senior administration officials told Fox News that high-level discussions were underway with top administration and White House officials regarding McAleenan’s future in light of the accusations against him -- which the secretary strongly denies. The officials said there is uncertainty as to how much longer the secretary could remain in his post.

A White House official declined to comment on these claims when asked by Fox News.

DHS BOSS MCALEENAN ACCUSED OF OPPOSING, LEAKING PLANNED ICE RAIDS

McAleenan had come under fire after officials and other sources publicly, and privately, accused him of leaking details of planned ICE deportation raids. The report in question, which was published by Washington Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn in major cities.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff less than 24 hours before the story was published. The source also said that when the raids were in a planning phase, McAleenan was opposed and even ordered Morgan to call off the operation -- though Trump told him to proceed. The president, though, put the operation on hold after the leak amid talks with Congress.

One senior administration official told Fox News on Thursday that after the alleged leak, ""He’s lost the confidence and trust of both the workforce and his superiors, with no viable path to proceed with any confidence and credibility.""

The official lamented the state of morale at the department, saying: “DHS has devolved into chaos and employee morale is abysmal.”

Another senior administration official also told Fox News Thursday that McAleenan has “completely lost his credibility leading the Department.”

“I can’t imagine the White House has an interest in keeping him in place much longer when they know he opposes most of their immigration policies,” the official said.

McAleenan, though, has adamantly denied the leak claims. In an interview with Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio, he said: ""Categorically, I did not and would not leak details of a law enforcement operation.""

Meanwhile, one of the officials told Fox News that McAleenan spent several days in Guatemala this week for multilateral meetings with Central American allies, while other top administration officials negotiated on Capitol Hill for additional funding for the agencies as part of a major piece of legislation -- which has not yet cleared Congress.

The official told Fox News that “support for a spending package vital to the department coalesced, was debated, and voted on in his absence.” That official also said that McAleenan has been “cut out of the process.”

Another administration official noted that McAleenan was slated to host a press conference on Thursday afternoon on the supplemental spending bill. “It’s interesting that he is standing alone. This is him trying to save his job, and taking a victory lap on the supplemental bill when he has been absent for the last few days.”

The event, though, was later canceled."
"VA ordered fake appointments to cut waiting list, whistleblower says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whistleblower-says-va-ordered-fake-appointments-to-cut-waiting-list/2019/06/26/97e50648-9856-11e9-a027-c571fd3d394d_story.html,"Columnist

One day before Minu Aghevli testified at a House committee hearing about official Department of Veterans Affairs misconduct, she received a thick packet of documents that shook her life.

It amounted to a pink slip more than 170 pages long, including about 140 pages outlining reasons VA plans to fire her, according to Kevin Owen, her lawyer. The packet arrived on Monday. She testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli, 42, is a District native who has spent her entire 20-year career with VA. She is a clinical psychologist with a department opioid treatment program in Baltimore.

But the moniker that matters now for her is VA whistleblower. Aghevli has made disclosures that she said led department officials to dismiss her, despite her Gold VA Pins for excellent customer service.

Aghevli’s allegations are serious. They include phony-wait-list assertions of the type that have bedeviled VA since it was consumed by a scandal that broke in 2014. She also accused department officials of lying to Congress.

“In order to reduce the wait list, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic wait list by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,” she told the House Veterans’ Affairs subcommittee on oversight and investigations. “This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits. . . . The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.” Aghevli said she protested and did not do as instructed.

Other actions to seemingly reduce the number of veterans awaiting care, she said, included coding indigent patients as “care no longer needed” without confirming that.

When lawmakers demanded information about VA wait lists in September 2015, she said, “the VA deliberately sent these incorrect numbers to Congress.”

A VA statement said Aghevli’s proposed firing “is in no way related to any whistleblower activity. Rather, it is due to a number of serious clinical practice allegations against the employee.”

The Office of Special Counsel has moved to block Aghevli’ s firing while it reviews her case. This special counsel protects federal whistleblowers and is not related a better-known special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who led a probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections.

Aghevli is not alone in making recent allegations about VA misconduct. At the House Veterans’ Affairs oversight and investigations subcommittee hearing, Chairman Chris Pappas (D-N.H.) said the panel is investigating secret-wait-list charges made in a Federal Insider column last month by Jereme Whiteman, VA’s national director of clinic practice management.

Only whistleblowers and their advocates testified at the hearing. Pappas said VA officials would be invited to a later session.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie in a letter to the panel expressed disappointment that officials were not included this week. “When the committee holds a hearing to air criticisms of the Department, while simultaneously preventing the Department from participating to offer context and defend itself,” he wrote, “the Committee’s efforts risk appearing more like a political news conference than a hearing aimed at a balanced look at serious issues.”

Jeffery Dettbarn, an Iowa City VA Medical Center employee, said he had an “unblemished record before blowing the whistle on the improper mass cancellation of what turned out to be tens of thousands of radiology orders.”

The retaliation against him, he said, is a “banishment” from patient care as a radiologic technologist that began in July 2017 and continues. “My current situation is unbearable. . . . I am forced to forgo about one-third of my salary” because he no longer gets on-call pay. “But worst of all,” he added, “the VA won’t let me care for veterans.”

Dettbarn said VA has attempted to fire him and also filed “bogus complaints to my licensing agencies. . . . All these allegations were unfounded, but these attacks are incredibly damaging and threaten my professional livelihood.”

VA said complaints about his clinical performance were raised by other VA whistleblowers and the decision regarding his disciplinary action was made before his disclosures.

Charges such as these led Tom Devine, legal director of the advocacy group Government Accountability Project, to tell the panel that VA “remains a free-speech Death Valley for government witnesses. . . . Retaliation is ingrained in the culture” of the department. Forty percent of the 25 whistleblowers he represents are VA clients, he said, “an extraordinary number for an agency that comprises less than 20 percent of the executive branch workforce.”

A department statement said “there is no other agency in the federal government that puts more of a focus on the importance of protecting whistleblowers.”

Aghevli said the retaliation against her caused episodes of severe panic and prolonged tachycardia, an abnormally rapid heart rate. She is on medical leave. Testifying for the first time before Congress was nerve-racking. “I felt both horrified and heartbroken, but also relieved,” she said, to have told her story.

Getting a notice of proposed termination the day before her testimony, when she told her office about it weeks before, was “deliberately intimidating towards me,” she said in an interview, and an effort to frighten other whistleblowers.

Aghevli said she was removed from patient care in April, a few weeks after her complaint about a patient safety issue. She is eager to return to “my veterans.”

“I love my job and the veterans that I treat,” she told the subcommittee. “I can’t imagine any job I’d rather do.”

She might have to start thinking about that. VA doesn’t want her anymore.

House Dems Stiff-Arm DHS on Domestic Terror Funds,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin Banco', 'Betsy Woodruff', 'National Security Reporter', 'Political Reporter']",06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-dems-stiff-arm-dhs-on-domestic-terror-funds,"As white supremacist terror attacks have left dozens dead around the United States, the Department of Homeland Security has faced blistering criticism for its approach to the threat. Earlier this year, however, congressional Democrats declined to make more money available for the department’s efforts to thwart domestic terrorist attacks.

Their reason, in part: concern the Trump administration could use new money to target American Muslims instead of white supremacists.

It’s a complex episode of a messy fight between Trump’s Department of Homeland Security and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives—a fight with tens of millions of dollars at stake. And it didn’t have to happen.

When Trump came into office, his Office of Management and Budget didn’t ask Congress for money for a small grant program DHS used to fund efforts to counter domestic terrorism. A source familiar with the department’s efforts said there were concerns that some of the grants provided by DHS at the end of the Obama administration to help prevent attacks by homegrown violent extremists were inefficient and failed to address the threats adequately.

After two years without funding, DHS officials decided to go straight to congressional appropriators to request the money instead of going through the White House. Per one congressional source familiar with the request, they asked for more than $17 million—$10 million to offset the grant money that existed under the Obama administration, plus about $7 million more. They made the ask in recent weeks.

But House appropriators didn’t bite, and declined to include that money in a recent funding bill. They worried, according to half a dozen sources familiar with the talks, that DHS doesn’t have a cohesive strategy for fighting domestic terror—a concern a DHS official said is unwarranted. And the White House has yet to release a clear strategy document on the growing threat, instead just having officials characterize it in speeches and congressional testimony. Four of those sources specifically said that concerns about potential anti-Muslim programs informed Democrats’ reticence to provide the new funds.

And the request’s timing didn’t help. One Democratic aide said the committee had already written a bill funding the department for 2020 by the time the request came in. DHS submitted its request in the spring, the aide said.

“The department requested funding for these grants under the Obama administration, but there was a [concern] that under Trump [the grants] would be used in the new administration to fuel anti-Muslim programming and rhetoric,” a House Democratic aide told The Daily Beast.

“ The Trump administration’s emphasis has been placed on addressing the potential for violence by immigrants... But the primary threat facing us comes from people here who become radicalized by what they see online. ” — former DHS official John Cohen

A DHS official strongly disagreed with this characterization. “DHS is committed to protecting the homeland by working to prevent all types of violent extremism,” this official told The Daily Beast. “The department rejects the premise that its prevention programs have or would target Muslims.”

In testimony in front of Congress in June, Elizabeth Neumann, the assistant secretary for Threat Prevention and Security Policy, the division that oversees programs to prevent domestic terrorist attacks, said the tactics used by homegrown violent extremists make it “extremely difficult for law enforcement to detect and thwart potential attacks.”

The DHS request came as the Trump administration began to push a new strategy regarding security at the southern border. Over the past year, the White House and DHS have pushed for more resources to try to slow an influx of Central American migrants.

In May, the White House requested $4.5 billion in emergency border funding from Congress, more than $3 billion of which would go to humanitarian efforts. President Trump reportedly requested the additional funding for the border because the money the administration previously received from the Department of Defense came with several restrictions and limitations. The House voted Tuesday to approve the supplemental funding.

And over the weekend, Trump postponed nationwide raids to deport undocumented families after threatening to send Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents out on the streets if Democrats on Capitol Hill did not agree to changes in asylum law.

Meanwhile, Homeland Security has drawn criticism for its handling of election security and domestic terrorism issues. The Daily Beast reported the department this year shuttered a group within its intelligence arm focused on analysis of domestic terrorism. It also gutted two task forces focused on election security and foreign interference.

On top of that, headquarters has asked each Homeland Security component to send volunteers away from their day jobs and to the border. The department’s agency responsible for protecting America’s vital infrastructure—including election systems—struggled to initially fulfill the request and had to send out more than one request for volunteers. Democrats and other outside observers say the White House’s decision to prioritize border security over other core DHS missions leaves the country at risk.

“The Trump administration’s emphasis has been placed on addressing the potential for violence by immigrants and others outside of this country,” said John Cohen, the former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “ But the primary threat facing us comes from people here who become radicalized by what they see online. So, any effort to protect this nation has to focus on the domestic environment as opposed to being obsessed by that potential violence that feeds the administration’s anti-immigration agenda.”"
"In New Turf War, Treasury Dept. Seeks Control of Secret Service",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Alan Rappeport', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/secret-service-treasury.html,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is seeking to wrest control of the Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security and has been lobbying President Trump to back such a move, according to administration officials.

The discussions between the Treasury Department, the White House and high-ranking Secret Service officials have taken place over the past year and have intensified in recent months, as Mr. Trump has pressed homeland security officials to focus on stemming immigration and ousted some for failing to do so.

The president supports the idea of moving the Secret Service back to the Treasury Department, where it was housed until 2003, according to people familiar with the discussions. The agency, which had been part of Treasury for more than 100 years, was transferred as part of the Homeland Security Act, which sought to consolidate security agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Some senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been pushing back against the move, concerned about losing an agency that has cybersecurity and investigative components. The department, which oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is responsible for protecting the country against cyberattacks and ensuring election security, in addition to enforcing immigration law."
USDA reports large U.S. soybean sale to China ahead of Trump-Xi meeting,https://www.reuters.com,"['Karl Plume', 'Min Read']",06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-soybeans/usda-reports-large-us-soybean-sale-to-china-ahead-of-trump-xi-meeting-idUSKCN1TT2ET,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Friday reported a large soybean sale to China, an apparent goodwill gesture a day before the first meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in seven months.

The trade war has curbed exports of U.S. crops to China and looms over the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Japan. Expectations have dimmed that the world’s two biggest economies can ease tensions when Trump and Xi meet in Osaka on Saturday.

The USDA said Chinese importers bought 544,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans for shipment in the 2018/19 marketing year which expires Aug. 31. It was the largest U.S. soybean sale to China since late March, USDA data showed.

The USDA said in a statement the sale was new and not a change of destination of a previously announced sale.

The deal surprised some traders as soybean export premiums for late-summer shipments were unchanged this week, showing little evidence that a large purchase was occurring, and because recent large purchases have come only after talks between the two countries.

A sharp drop in China’s hog herd, which consumes most of the soybeans processed by the world’s largest pork market, due to a deadly hog disease called African swine fever has also reduced demand for the oilseed.

“To me it looks like a good faith purchase, which we’ve seen before, although in the past they came after the two presidents shook hands. Today it’s coming before they do so it may be trying to influence talks,” said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for INTL FCStone.

“All this comes against a backdrop of China having ample supplies of soybeans and talk of them delaying shipment of July beans into August because of the big supplies,” he said.

Beijing had agreed to buy nearly 14 million tonnes from American farmers over December to March during a temporary truce in the trade spat.

More than 8 million tonnes of those have already been shipped to China, but about 6 million tonnes, including Friday’s sale, still need to be delivered.

Trump said on Friday he hopes for productive talks but made no promises about a reprieve from escalating tariffs that have cast a shadow on global growth.

U.S. soybean exports to China have plunged by more than 80 percent since Beijing slapped steep tariffs on shipments last July. China, the world’s top soybean importer, is on pace for its smallest U.S. soybean imports in 11 years as importers there have increased purchases from South America, mainly from top exporter Brazil."

Whistleblower exposes $7 billion no-bid Defense Department contract,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/halliburton-whistleblower-on-exposing-7-billion-no-bid-defense-contract-2019-06-30/,"Last decade, when American was embroiled in the Iraq War, a high-ranking U.S. Army Corps of Engineers put her career on the line to stand up to some of the most powerful men in America. She believed that a major corporation had been benefiting from a collection of well-connected contracts that were costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse.

Although she was warned against it by supervisors, she blew the whistle on national TV in front of a Senate committee. ""My name is Bunnatine H. Greenhouse. I have agreed to voluntarily appear at this hearing,"" she addressed the committee.

Bunny Greenhouse was an unlikely whistleblower. In 2005, Greenhouse was the highest-ranked civilian at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

""When I took my oath of office it said that you will conduct the business of contracting impartially … and with preferential treatment toward none. I saw preferential treatment toward KBR,"" she told ""Whistleblower"" host Alex Ferrer in ""Bunny's War: The Case Against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.""

KBR was Kellogg Brown and Root — back then, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the oil services firm Halliburton. In the weeks prior to the invasion, Greenhouse learned that KBR was being considered for a massive no-bid contract known as Restore Iraqi Oil, or RIO.

""What was the size of this contract?"" Ferrer asked.

""Seven billion dollars,"" she replied.

What Greenhouse didn't know is that even more powerful forces may have been involved.

""A lot of attention fell on Dick Cheney, the vice president, and the fact was that he had been the head of Halliburton for … six years,"" Vanity Fair journalist Michael Shnayerson explained. ""So, the suspicion began to grow that perhaps Cheney was steering government contracts to KBR.""

A spokesperson for Dick Cheney told CBS News that the former vice president severed all ties with Halliburton and KBR in the summer of 2000 when he became candidate for vice president.

A representative for KBR said ""it's unfortunate that misinformation and myths about KBR's role in supporting the military in Iraq continue to be circulated. These assertions have repeatedly been shown to be false.""

For Greenhouse, biting her tongue was never an option. ""I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my professional career,"" she told the Senate committee.

A 2004 government report decided the RIO contract was properly awarded. But the Army eventually split up the contract and, as Greenhouse had requested from the beginning, opened it up to competition.

""Eventually, your enemies at the Army Corps of Engineers caught up with you,"" Ferrer commented.

""I felt that I was physically being threatened,"" Greenhouse replied. ""They set up a booby trap that caused me to fall,"" she added.

Born and raised in Rayville, Louisiana, Greenhouse and her six siblings grew up poor in the segregated south. Her parents instilled in her and her siblings a strong sense of morals, integrity and honor; no excuse for being less than the best. In the 1960s, she became the first African American teacher at the newly integrated Unity H.S.

In 1997, she accepted a job with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. She was hired by Lt. General Joe Ballard and was the first African American woman to become the head of contracting within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Greenhouse started to notice a ""good ole boys club"" forming again at USACE after her boss and mentor, Lt. General Ballard, retired in 2000. Then, in the weeks leading up to the Iraq War in 2003, she attended a top-secret meeting at the Pentagon to discuss details of the Restore Iraqi Oil contract. Present in the room were representatives of Kellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, Cheney's former employer.

Greenhouse was concerned about awarding KBR with the no-bid, 5-year contract and urged to accept other bids and limit the duration of the deal. But her objections were never addressed, and KBR received the contract. Later, it was revealed in a draft audit that the company had overcharged the government for fuel purchases by $61 million. She ultimately testified in front of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee.

Greenhouse was the highest-ranked civilian at the Army Corp and she was incredibly good at her job. Because the top brass at USACE couldn't actually fire her, which was a perk of having a high station in the government, they demoted her. When this happened, she was stripped of her security clearance and sent off to a remote cubicle somewhere; she was basically condemned to oblivion. After she filed her whistleblower lawsuit, someone placed a trip wire placed around her cubicle and she fell, permanently damaging her knee.

The Defense Authorization Act Of 2009 reformed some of the very contracting practices that Greenhouse had objected to five years earlier and it limited the duration of certain no-bid contracts.

Greenhouse filed a mixed case lawsuit against the Department of Defense and the Army Corps of Engineers. The whistleblower case claimed that Greenhouse had been retaliated against for speaking out and had faced discrimination based on race, age, and gender. In July 2011, she agreed to a settlement of $970,000.

Hard-liners inside and outside the Trump administration are pressing for the removal of President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary amid a rolling leadership purge that began in April and shows no signs of ending, according to five people in the Trump administration and four former Department of Homeland Security officials.

Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies, including former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, who might become the administration’s immigration czar.

Story Continued Below

Following the purge of three other immigration officials since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders, a McAleenan ally, said Monday that he’ll resign effective July 5. Sanders did not offer a public explanation for his resignation.

Several critics of the administration, including former DHS officials, have characterized the latest shakeup as another instance of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller seizing an opportunity to fill key immigration posts with allies. But one senior administration official said the president also agrees with these stances.

“The two issues the president is driving the train on at all times are trade and immigration,” the official said. “There is disbelief inside the administration that we can’t enforce the law and people are trying to find the right personnel who will do it and not look for ways out of it.”

Miller and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. The White House press office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McAleenan.

The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day and detained children are being denied basic necessities like toothbrushes and soap. Current and former DHS employees complain that the leadership turnover and attendant jostling for power have slowed the government’s ability to respond to what is now widely recognized to be a crisis.

“It’s awful for morale,” said one current CBP official. “Whoever’s going to be confirmed to acting [commissioner] next, we’re back to square one, getting a new person briefed. … It’s like starting all over in a transition.”

Homan suggested on “Fox & Friends” that this week’s planned ICE raids were delayed because McAleenan leaked information about them.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “In The Washington Post or in numerous media outlets, he does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue. You don’t tell the men and women of ICE, a day before they go out there and do this operation — ‘Look, this story was leaked.’ They gave the locations of the cities, the day it was supposed to start, how many targets.”

Homan spoke while sitting in front of a DHS seal, looking like a government official — something he has not been since June 2018. The seal was in a room set up in the basement of his Virginia home, according to two former DHS officials. Trump told Fox News on June 14 that Homan would be his new “border czar,” but Homan said a day later that the announcement was “kind of premature” and indicated that he hadn’t yet decided whether to take the job. An administration official said Wednesday that Homan has not yet been given a clear description of what the job would entail.

“Homan’s getting paid a lot better as border czar of Fox News than border czar of the White House,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-migrant National Immigration Forum. “And he kind of has the same job, to go on Fox News and carry the administration’s message.”

Several administration officials and hard-line immigration advocates have targeted McAleenan in recent days, arguing behind the scenes that he’s too liberal to run DHS because he served under President Barack Obama and has donated money in the past to Democratic candidates and organizations. Conservative media outlets, including the Washington Examiner, have run critical stories to amplify that narrative.

Brandon Judd, president of a union that represents Border Patrol agents and a Trump ally, also torched McAleenan in a Fox News op-ed over the weekend.

Judd — who has attacked McAleenan in the past for being insufficiently committed to Trump — said that if McAleenan did leak information about the raids, then he “was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm’s way in order to further his own agenda.”

“There is no question that the president is sensitive to the lack of progress in resolving this crisis at the border and frustrated with the pace of changes, and it has become increasingly evident that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is because Kevin McAleenan has been reluctant to take action that would more effective,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “A lot of ideas proposed have been bottled up by him and his front office.”

The Trump White House assumed McAleenan could work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to secure more funding and policy changes, since he’s worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Vaughan said. But “he has not been able to deliver on those things.”

Within the past month Trump installed a pair of vocal immigration hard-liners in key immigration positions, naming Mark Morgan acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Ken Cuccinelli acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Both had drawn the president’s attention by making provocative statements about immigration on Fox News; Morgan, for instance, said he could tell whether a migrant child would later join MS-13 merely by looking into that child’s eyes.

Morgan appears already on the move. POLITICO and other outlets reported Tuesday that he’s expected to be named the new acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, although the White House has not made an official announcement.

Cuccinelli, meanwhile, scored a coveted perk during his first month that his predecessor, Francis Cissna, never enjoyed. Trump designated him to be one of 10 officials to get a government-funded car to drive him from his Virginia home to USCIS headquarters.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3778/1155968404_6044370239001_6044253724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

A USCIS spokesperson confirmed that Cuccinelli had been granted the benefit, but said that he “is currently driving himself to the office.”

Both newly installed officials occupy new “principal deputy director” positions created at their respective agencies to allow them to serve in an acting capacity under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act — a bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that could circumvent the confirmation process.

Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and head of a conservative political action committee, would face a hard road to confirmation in the Senate because he backed challenges to mainstream Republicans in recent years, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Morgan would at the least face strong Democratic opposition.

“I think the White House is looking for a certain model,” said one current administration official. “Cuccinelli and Morgan have been on Fox every day. I don’t think you’ll ever see Sanders up there.”

The latest personnel shake-up happened just days after the administration caught flak for its treatment of roughly 300 migrant children at a Texas facility who were filthy, hungry, and largely unsupervised, according to lawyers who interviewed some of them.

Several conservative immigration advocates said the DHS shake-up was unrelated to the ensuing public outcry, and instead had been brewing for weeks. Moving Morgan to CBP sets the stage for the administration to now get rid of McAleenan, one advocate said.

“Things have not changed at DHS since Nielsen left,” said a top official at a restrictionist immigration organization. “I disagreed with them getting rid of Francis Cissna but right now, they are looking in the right place.”

But “having all of this churn and not having stable leadership makes it very difficult to address the problems,” said Leon Fresco, former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation. “Whenever you change a leader, you automatically lose a month as the person gets acclimated.”

Trump EPA OKs ‘Emergency’ Use of Bee-Killing Pesticide on 13.9 Million Acres,https://www.ecowatch.com,"['Jordan Simmons', 'Jordan Davidson', 'Gundry Md', 'The Revelator', 'Arcadia Power', 'Common Dreams', 'Deutsche Welle']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.ecowatch.com/emergency-trump-epa-pesticides-2638979880.html,"More than 40 percent of insects could go extinct globally in the next few decades. So why did the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last week OK the 'emergency' use of the bee-killing pesticide sulfoxaflor on 13.9 million acres?

EcoWatch teamed up with Center for Biological Diversity via EcoWatch Live on Facebook to find out why. Environmental Health Director and Senior Attorney Lori Ann Burd explained how there is a loophole in the The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act under section 18, ""that allows for entities and states to request emergency exemptions to spraying pesticides where they otherwise wouldn't be allowed to spray.""

In a press release sent to EcoWatch, the Center for Biological Diversity stated: The approval includes 2019 crops of cotton and sorghum in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Ten of the 11 states have been granted the approvals for at least four consecutive years for the same ""emergency."" Five have been given approvals for at least six consecutive years. If an occurrence is happening six years in a row, does that justify an emergency? ""This administration has been grossly abusing this exemption to allow the use of this one pesticide called sulfoxaflor on a vast acreage year after year,"" said Burd. Our biodiversity is at serious risk. For example, in Texas — where 5.8 million acres got emergency exemption to spray — more than 800 native bee species and eight species of bumblebees reside. It is also an important migration route for monarch butterflies. ""Monarch butterflies and eight species of bumblebees do overlap with Texas counties where there is sulfoxaflor spraying,"" said Burd. ""Even at subacute, very low doses, sufoxaflor will have a very dramatic effect on bumblebee reproduction."" The purpose of sulfoxaflor is to kill insects.

Farmers have only gotten away with spraying sulfoxaflor because they were granted emergency. The EPA has not approved the lethal insecticide sulfoxaflor to be used on sorghum because it is known to attract bees. At one point the EPA did allow the use of sulfoxaflor on cotton, however the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the approval — the result of a lawsuit brought to them by beekeepers. In a summary following the vacated approval in 2015, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit published conclusions: The panel held that because the EPA's decision to unconditionally register sulfoxaflor was based on flawed and limited data, the EPA's unconditional approval was not supported by substantial evidence. The panel vacated the EPA's unconditional registration because given the precariousness of bee populations, leaving the EPA's registration of sulfoxaflor in place risked more potential environmental harm than vacating it. Criticism has been raised by the fact-checking resource Snopes on the grounds that it is misleading to imply that Trump is the only one who's approved emergency exemptions for sulfoxaflor. EcoWatch asked the Center for Biological diversity to respond. ""This is not a new problem,"" said Burd. ""This has been going on for six consecutive years and we have not been in the Trump administration for six consecutive years."" So, yes, Trump's EPA did this, but ""this is by no means a new problem. Our pesticide registration and approval process is fundamentally broken. EPA's pesticide office is captured by industry and they are not doing their jobs protecting human health and the environment from these pesticides,"" said Burd.

EcoWatch asked Burd if there anything the public can do to stop these emergency approvals and prevent the use of toxic pesticides.

Burd suggested EcoWatchers consider signing a petition ""demanding that Trump's EPA stop rubber-stamping 'emergency' uses of pesticides that wreak havoc on our environment."" EcoWatchers can also help by getting involved with various groups working to protect the environment, choosing organic, refusing the use of pesticides at home, talking about not using them at work or at a homeowners association, supporting local ordinances going after pesticide issues, voting often or early and planting pollinator friendly gardens in rural and urban environments."
NYT: Mnuchin wants Secret Service back under the Treasury Department,https://www.cnn.com,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/politics/steven-mnuchin-wants-secret-service-under-treasury-department/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pushing to move the US Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security back under his department's control, according to The New York Times.

Citing administration officials, the Times reported that Mnuchin has been lobbying President Donald Trump, who has signaled that he supports the idea of handing control of the agency back to Treasury.

Mnuchin held talks this month about the move with senior Secret Service agents at the Treasury Department, the Times reported.

Mnuchin has been interested in the agency's cybersecurity and anticounterfeiting work, according to the Times.

Some senior DHS officials oppose the move, concerned about losing an agency with those components, the Times reports.

The FTC’s Qualcomm Case Reveals Concerning Divide with DOJ on Patent Hold-Up,https://www.ipwatchdog.com,['The Author'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2019/06/28/ftcs-qualcomm-case-reveals-concerning-divide-doj-patent-hold/id=110764/,"“For over a decade, the FTC and DOJ had worked both in parallel and together to address the potential competitive harms posed by patent hold-up. The recent divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this issue is a troubling development that creates uncertainty.”

On May 2, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) took the unusual step of submitting a Statement of Interest in the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) case against Qualcomm to take a position contrary to the FTC. The DOJ argued that “[b]ecause an overly broad remedy could result in reduced innovation, with the potential to harm American consumers, this Court should hold a hearing and order additional briefing to determine a proper remedy that protects competition while working minimal harm to public and private interests.” In response, the FTC informed the court that it “did not participate in or request” the DOJ’s filing, that it “disagree[d] with a number of contentions” made by the DOJ, and that the DOJ “misconstrues applicable law and the record.” In the end, the court agreed with the FTC and issued injunctive relief against Qualcomm without conducting the further remedy proceedings the DOJ advocated.

Underscoring the Divide

The public feuding between the two federal antitrust enforcement agencies about how to resolve a case litigated by one them was a remarkable spectacle. It also brought into focus a broader divide between the FTC and DOJ on the role of antitrust law in addressing patents that are essential to industry standards (SEPs) and subject to commitments to license on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.

Since being confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division in September 2017, Makan Delrahim has shifted the DOJ’s longstanding focus on the risks of patent hold-up—where SEP owners take advantage of large investments by companies to develop products using a standard to extract unreasonable, non-FRAND licensing terms—to address what he views as the greater risk of patent hold-out—which he defines as potential licensees colluding on issues such as licensing terms for SEPs. In a March 16, 2018 speech, Delrahim said that “hold-up is fundamentally not an antitrust problem, and therefore antitrust law should not be used as a tool to police FRAND commitments that patent-holders make to standard setting organizations” and offered his view that “implementer hold-out poses a more serious threat to innovation than innovator hold-up.”

Joseph Simons, the FTC Chairman, addressed this divide in a September 25, 2018 speech. While he noted that “[c]onsistency across the two federal enforcement agencies is . . . beneficial,” he observed that treatment of SEPs may be an area for “some potential inconsistency” between the agencies. He elaborated that “we agree with the Division that hold-out in the standard-setting process can raise serious concerns under antitrust law when such hold-out is the result of collusion among potential adopters/licensees. But we also believe that hold-up raises potential antitrust issues, as well.” Simons committed that the FTC “will continue our economically grounded and fact-based enforcement of the antitrust laws in this area.” Consistent with that approach, the FTC contended in a December 2018 filing in the Qualcomm case that “Qualcomm’s refusal to make SEP licenses available to competitors in breach of its voluntary commitments to standard-setting organizations is anticompetitive conduct.”

Although the DOJ submission in the Qualcomm case did not take a position on the merits, it appears to have been motivated by, and is consistent with, Delrahim’s efforts to downplay the potential for harm from patent hold-up. (Delrahim, who lobbied for Qualcomm, is reportedly recused from matters involving Qualcomm and did not sign the DOJ’s Qualcomm filing.) The DOJ filing highlighted the divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this important issue. It was not always so. For over a decade, the FTC and DOJ had worked both in parallel and together to address the potential competitive harms posed by patent hold-up. The recent divergence between the DOJ and FTC on this issue is a troubling development that creates uncertainty regarding what had been a consensus area of concern for the agencies.

The Roles of the DOJ and FTC

Before turning to how the DOJ and FTC have previously addressed patent hold-up, it is worth briefly examining the dual roles of the DOJ and FTC in enforcing the antitrust laws.

Among other statutes, the DOJ Antitrust Division is charged with criminal and civil enforcement under the Sherman Act and civil enforcement under the Clayton Act. The DOJ also provides guidance on the application of antitrust laws, including by issuing business review letters advising on how it may respond to particular proposed joint ventures or other business conduct.

The FTC was created with the passage of the FTC Act, which directs the agency to prevent “unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(2). As interpreted by the FTC, Section 5 of the FTC Act “encompasses not only those acts and practices that violate the Sherman or Clayton Act but also those that contravene the spirit of the antitrust laws and those that, if allowed to mature or complete, could violate the Sherman or Clayton Act.” Unlike the DOJ, the FTC does not conduct criminal enforcement.

The jurisdictions and roles of the FTC and DOJ thus overlap, including in merger reviews, investigations of anticompetitive conduct, and offering guidance on the antitrust laws. The agencies employ a “clearance” process to ensure that they do not undertake duplicative investigations that would, among other problems, subject targets to competing demands from the agencies and potentially lead to conflicting outcomes.

When it comes to the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property, both agencies have oversight responsibilities and they have collaborated to issue guidance on their shared approach to enforcement. For example, in 1995, the agencies jointly issued Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property setting forth their policy on antitrust treatment of licensing intellectual property.

The DOJ and FTC Have Traditionally Agreed on the Dangers of Patent Hold-Up

Over the course of more than a decade—across both the Republican Bush Administration and the Democratic Obama Administration—the DOJ and FTC both consistently recognized that SEPs present a danger of hold-up, and that this was a proper subject for antitrust agency enforcement.

As early as 2006, the DOJ warned of the dangers of patent hold-up in a business review letter to a standard-setting organization (SSO): “Once a particular technology is chosen and the standard is developed . . . it can be extremely expensive or even impossible to substitute one technology for another. . . . Thus, those seeking to implement a given standard may be willing to license a patented technology included in the standard on more onerous terms than they would have been prior to the standard’s adoption in order to avoid the expense and delay of developing a new standard around a different technology.”

In 2007, the DOJ and FTC partnered to issue a report called Antitrust Enforcement and Intellectual Property Rights: Promoting Innovation and Competition. The agencies described the “potential for ‘hold up’ by the owner of patented technology after its technology has been chosen by the SSO as a standard and others have incurred sunk costs which effectively increase the relative cost of switching to an alternative standard.” The agencies warned that this “power to extract higher royalties or other licensing terms” could harm consumers “if those higher royalties were passed on in the form of higher prices.”

In 2013, the DOJ partnered with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office on a Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments. The Policy warned of the risk that SEPs could be used “to pressure an implementer of a standard to accept more onerous licensing terms than the patent holder would be entitled to receive consistent with the F/RAND commitment.” A DOJ official explained that the Statement “was informed by over a decade of thinking by the [DOJ Antitrust Division], the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the PTO about standards-setting activities and the IP policies of standard-setting organizations (SSOs).” (Delrahim announced in December 2018 that the DOJ was withdrawing its assent to the Statement.)

Beyond issuing guidance, the DOJ also accounted for patent hold-up in enforcement. In 2012, when the DOJ closed its investigation of Google’s acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings and a consortium’s acquisition of Nortel Networks’ SEPs, it explained that it had “focused on whether the acquiring firms would have the incentive and ability to exploit ambiguities in the SSOs’ F/RAND licensing commitments to hold up rivals, thus preventing or inhibiting innovation and competition,” including by “seeking to prevent or exclude products from practicing those SEPs from the market altogether.”

For its part, the FTC has challenged hold-up through seven enforcement actions over two decades. Those include a 2005 consent order with Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) after the FTC accused it of monopolizing a market for low-emission gasoline by misrepresenting in state regulatory standard-setting proceedings that an approach to reducing emissions was in the public domain when Unocal was actively pursuing patents on the technology that would later allow it to charge hold-up royalties to its competitors.

A Cause for Concern

The DOJ’s turn away from its long-held position on the risks of patent hold-up is a cause for serious concern.

First, it is bad policy. In explaining the DOJ’s about-face, Delrahim has referred to a “so-called ‘hold-up’ problem in the context of SSOs” and contended that concerns with hold-up “rely on models devoid of economic or empirical evidence that hold-up is a real phenomenon.” But the DOJ’s prior recognition of the risks of patent hold-up was well supported.

U.S. courts have long recognized that SEPs pose a hold-up threat. In 2007, for example, the Third Circuit observed that “[t]o guard against anticompetitive patent hold-up, most [standards development organizations] require firms supplying essential technologies for inclusion in a prospective standard to commit to licensing their technologies on FRAND terms.” Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 313 (3d Cir. 2007). More recently, the Ninth Circuit explained that “[t]he development of standards . . . creates an opportunity for companies to engage in anti-competitive behavior” and that “[u]sing that standard-development leverage, the SEP holders are in a position to demand more for a license than the patented technology, had it not been adopted by the SSO, would be worth.” Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc., 795 F.3d 1024, 1031 (9th Cir. 2015); see also, e.g., Ericsson, Inc. v. D-Link Sys., Inc., 773 F.3d 1201, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“SEPs pose two potential problems that could inhibit widespread adoption of the standard: patent hold-up and royalty stacking”).

As to the economics of patent hold-up, the DOJ observed in a 2015 business review letter that the “economic bargaining model underlying claims of hold-up has been studied extensively and applied to the standard-setting context,” citing scholarship dating back decades. That conclusion echoed the views of the DOJ and FTC in their 2007 report that patent hold-up is simply a “variant of the classic ‘hold-up problem’.” The DOJ also noted in its 2015 letter that “litigated cases demonstrate the potential for hold up when owners of RAND-encumbered standards-essential patents make royalty demands significantly above the adjudicated RAND rate” and provided examples where licensors’ demands were on the order of about 170 to 230 times what courts determined were RAND rates.

Recognition of the dangers of hold-up is thus well supported as a matter of law and economics. To be sure, if competitors collude in an SSO to fix the terms on which they will license technology, antitrust enforcement would be appropriate. But simply because one can envision the possibility of an alternative form of anticompetitive conduct relating to standard setting does not mean that the DOJ should simply ignore the well-documented existence of another form of harm.

Second, the DOJ’s abrupt shift away from over a decade of guidance on hold-up creates uncertainty for the many industries that rely on standards. While the shift in policy has been cast as being motivated by a concern for fostering innovation, it threatens to have the opposite effect. Companies planning investments in standardized products now face greater uncertainty about whether they can count on established rules, particularly as articulated in the DOJ’s business review letters, to safeguard their ability to license SEPs on FRAND terms.

Third, that a change in administration has led the DOJ to turn away from a long-held, bipartisan approach plays into the perception that antitrust enforcement is increasingly a political tool. While there may be higher profile examples of the politicization of antitrust enforcement, any step that suggests that a change in administration, not law and economics, will lead to wholesale departure from existing antitrust policy is troubling."
Verizon is teaming up with the VA on a telehealth program,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Zachary Hendrickson'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-department-of-veterans-affairs-telehealth-partnership-2019-7,"Verizon partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a move that will give veterans who are also Verizon customers access to the VA's telehealth app VA Video Connect — which enables remote consultations with healthcare professionals — free of data charges via Verizon's 4G LTE network, per Health Data Management.

American Well

Here's what it means: The VA is doubling down on telehealth efforts to expand its reach among rural vets.

The VA conducted over 1 million telehealth consultations last year, and a strategic partnership with Verizon should help it reach its lofty telehealth goals. Six million unique patients received VA treatment last year — a difficult task given there are only 172 VA medical centers nationwide — and telehealth could effectively expand VA providers' reach: The VA aims for all of its care providers to be telehealth enabled by the end of fiscal year 2021, according to a 2018 Veterans Health Administration notice.

The VA is concerned that there are fewer care options for rural vets — but hopes 4G-powered telehealth could provide reinforcements. The VA's major telehealth investments are almost primarily geared toward addressing the needs of the 4.7 million US veterans living in rural areas: Rural veterans may need to travel great distances between their homes and points of care — a problem exacerbated by uncertainty around the 21% of rural hospitals currently facing closure. Also, 27% of rural vets don't use the internet at home, likely due in part to a lack of broadband coverage: Nearly 40% of individuals in rural communities don't have broadband access compared with 4% in urban areas, per The Conversation. Nevertheless, the VA has had success with telehealth in rural areas: Of the 1 million telehealth visits last year, over half were made by rural veterans.

The bigger picture: Verizon likely sees the massive VA patient base as a proof-of-concept for a larger telehealth play on the horizon.

Verizon isn't the only major telecom player interested in telehealth, but its superior 4G network could still give it the long-term edge. In addition to its partnership with Verizon, the VA has previously tied up with two other major players in the telecom space — T-Mobile and Sprint— on telehealth initiatives. However, Verizon performed better than the competition in terms of 4G mobile video streaming, and it also had the widest coverage area, according to insights from OpenSignal.

And free 4G access for veterans could be just the first step in a larger 5G telehealth play from Verizon.Of the three telecom providers linked up with the VA, only Verizon has a web presence fully dedicated to 5G in healthcare. As we've previously covered, 5G is the next step in mobile connectivity, and it's prepped to have a major impact on the efficacy and speed of digital health tools. I (Zach) think we could see Verizon leveraging 4G performance data from VA Video Connect in attempts to work out a more ambitious, paid contract to provide 5G digital health services to VA medical centers in the near future. However, Verizon will need to improve its 5G network before that point and could find itself competing with the reach of a potentially merged T-Mobile/Sprint.

Reporters erupt after DHS chief McAleenan walks out of presser after four questions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/reporters-erupt-after-dhs-chief-kevin-mcaleenan-walks-out-of-presser-after-four-questions,"Reporters erupted in frustration with Kevin McAleenan after the acting homeland security secretary abruptly departed a rescheduled press conference after taking only four questions amid crossfire over questions about his leadership.

After reading Friday from a prepared statement for 11 minutes, McAleenan opened the floor to questions. He took four of them over seven minutes then cut off the briefing and said ""thanks"" before exiting.

""This is ridiculous! We get no..."" one reporter in the front row yelled as McAleenan walked out.

""Seriously, Andrew, it's so unprofessional,"" another reporter said, directing her comment to the only DHS official still onstage, acting Public Affairs Assistant Secretary Andrew Meehan.

""Four questions and we haven't had a press conference in months,"" one person said, referring to McAleenan's installation in his current role nearly three months earlier.

""We'll be more engaging in the future,"" Meehan responded.

""Why don't we keep rolling and you keep answering our questions?"" one of the reporters asked.

Reporters immediately began asking a handful of additional questions before Meehan excused himself after four minutes of it.

McAleenan was accused by five current and former senior administration officials, in comments published by the Washington Examiner over the weekend, of attempting to sabotage a federal immigration operation by leaking details to a media outlet.

Since then, top officials at DHS and across the administration have used various press outlets, including the Washington Examiner, to try to undermine McAleenan by calling for him to resign and charging he is a liar for an alleged cover-up of what they claim was his own leak.

The Friday afternoon press conference was announced in an email from DHS around 9:30 a.m. The Washington Examiner, which received an invitation to attend the same event a day earlier, did not receive an invitation Friday.

On Thursday, the Washington Examiner reported that McAleenan was expected to lay the blame on Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Mark Morgan for the revelation in a Washington Post story of details about immigration raids. The report was published a half-hour before the Thursday briefing was scheduled to take place. Moments before it began, DHS abruptly called off the briefing.

A DHS spokesman claimed it was because the department did not want McAleenan's comments to interfere with Capitol Hill negotiations for supplemental border funding, even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had publicly announced nearly an hour before the briefing the chamber would pass the Senate's supplemental bill, according to reporters.

DHS had said Thursday the event would be used for McAleenan to discuss the ""supplemental funding request for DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the changes needed to the immigration legal framework to address the humanitarian and border security crisis.""

McAleenan did not address the leaks in his appearance Friday."
"Senate vote requires military, EPA to deal with harmful 'forever chemicals'",https://thehill.com,[],06-27-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450706-senate-vote-requires-military-epa-to-deal-with-harmful-forever,"The Senate passed a defense bill Thursday that would require an increased response from the government to harmful chemicals that have leached into water in at least 43 states.

Included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is language that would push the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set a national drinking water standard for a class of chemicals known as PFAS that have been linked with cancer and other health problems.

The EPA has said it will decide by the end of the year whether to regulate the chemicals that are so persistent in the environment they’ve been deemed “forever chemicals.”

PFAS is used in a staggering number of products, including firefighting foam, which the bill directs the military to stop using.

A move by Congress to force a drinking water standard would be significant and ultimately require local governments to keep PFAS in water below a certain level. Currently, the EPA recommends water contain no more than 70 parts per trillion of PFAS, but many states, tired of waiting for the EPA, have set more stringent standards far below that figure.

The bill also directs the Department of Defense to take more aggressive action on PFAS following accusation that the Pentagon was trying to weaken EPA regulations that would force the military to take on expensive cleanup costs now estimated at around $2 billion.

The bill pushes the Pentagon to finalize agreements with states for cleaning up PFAS contamination caused by the military largely through the use of firefighting foam. The military would have three years to phase out use of the foam.

Other provisions would also force the EPA to consider barring new uses of PFAS and require PFAS manufacturers to share data on their production.

But the Senate version does not make Superfund cleanup money available for places where PFAS has contaminated drinking water, something Sen. Tom Carper Thomas (Tom) Richard CarperOvernight Energy: Democratic debate takes heat for watered-down climate questions | Senate votes to force military, EPA to deal with 'forever chemicals' | Renewable energy production surpasses coal in US Senate vote requires military, EPA to deal with harmful 'forever chemicals' Hillicon Valley: Investigation finds federal agencies failed to address cyber vulnerabilities | Officials crack down on illegal robocallers | Warren offers plan to secure elections | Senators grill Google exec on 'persuasive technology' MORE (D-Del.) has been pushing for.

“The provisions we secured in this legislation will improve both the federal government’s understanding of and response to PFAS contamination. The Department of Defense’s use of firefighting foam containing PFAS is a significant source of this contamination,"" he said. ""The use of these chemicals in firefighting foam has undoubtedly saved lives, but the cruel irony is that those same life-saving chemicals can endanger lives when they wind up in a glass of drinking water.""

He added, ""While the provisions we included in this package are an important start, I am disappointed that we were unable to successfully include the legislation I introduced with Senator Capito that would designate PFAS as hazardous substances under the Superfund law, and I will continue to fight to ensure that important measure is enacted into law.”

Debbie Dingell Deborah (Debbie) Ann DingellSenate vote requires military, EPA to deal with harmful 'forever chemicals' California official blasts EPA head over car standard negotiations Democrats grill Trump officials over fuel standard rollback MORE (D-Mich.) has included such a measure to require the EPA to include PFAS under the Superfund law.

Environmental groups hailed the bill as an important first step in dealing with the growing PFAS problem.

“The first step to addressing this catastrophe is knowing where PFAS pollution is coming from and understanding how far it has spread. This legislation will go a long way in doing just that. Much more needs to be done to address the crisis, but monitoring the scope of PFAS pollution will lay the groundwork for further progress,” Scott Faber, with the Environmental Working Group, said in a statement.

The Senate version also includes a number of other environmental measures, including funding for research into carbon capture."
