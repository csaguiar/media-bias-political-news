Federal prosecutors signaled in a court document released on Thursday that it was unlikely they would file additional charges in the hush-money investigation that ensnared members of Donald J. Trump’s inner circle and threatened to derail his presidency.

In the document, the prosecutors said they had “effectively concluded” their inquiry, which centered on payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to buy the silence of two women who said they had had affairs with Mr. Trump.

The outcome appeared to be a legal victory for Mr. Trump, whom prosecutors implicated last year in directing the payments. Mr. Trump had denied the affairs and any wrongdoing, but his aides considered the inquiry a greater threat than even the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the election."
Trump: US warship destroyed Iranian drone in Strait of Hormuz,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-us-warship-iranian-drone-strait-hormuz,"A U.S. warship destroyed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz amid heightened tensions between the two countries, President Trump announced Thursday.

“The U.S. reserves the right to defend personnel, facilities, interests,” he said.

Trump said the USS Boxer took defensive action after the drone closed to within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down. The president called it the latest “hostile” action by Iran.

Marines on board took down the drone using electronic jamming equipment, U.S. officials told Fox News later Thursday.

The device, known as the Light Marine Air Defense Integrated System, deployed for the first time in January aboard the USS Kearsarge, the same class of warship as the USS Boxer.

Trump also called on other countries to condemn what he described as Iran’s attempts to disrupt the freedom of navigation and global commerce in the strategic waterway in the Persian Gulf region.

IRAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS COUNTRY 'HAD NO CHOICE' BUT TO BUILD MISSILES FOR DEFENSE

Chief Pentagon Spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman confirmed to Fox News in a statement: ""At approximately 10 a.m. local time, the amphibious ship USS Boxer was in international waters conducting a planned inbound transit of the Strait of Hormuz. A fixed wing unmanned aerial system (UAS) approached Boxer and closed within a threatening range. The ship took defensive action against the UAS to ensure the safety of the ship and its crew.""

The president said the drone threatened the safety of the American ship and its crew.

Meantime, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Thursday he had ""no information about having lost a drone today.""

The latest actions came amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran in the wake of the breakdown of the nuclear deal, as the secretive regime announced it exceeded the threshold of low-enriched uranium stockpile as agreed upon in the 2015 accord.

Iran’s state television said earlier Thursday that regime forces captured a foreign tanker with a crew of 12 accused of smuggling oil.

The tanker was seized by Revolutionary Guard forces on July 14 after getting intercepted south of Iran’s Larak Island in the strategic Strait of Hormuz amid allegations that the tanker was smuggling fuel from Iranian smugglers to foreign customers.

Iran recently shot down a U.S. drone that it said was flying over Iran. Trump called off a planned retaliatory airstrike at the last minute.

Trump Disavows ‘Send Her Back’ Chant as G.O.P. Frets Over Ugly Phrase,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Julie Hirschfeld Davis', 'Maggie Haberman', 'Michael Crowley']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/us/politics/ilhan-omar-donald-trump.html,"WASHINGTON — Nervous Republicans, from senior members of Congress to his own daughter Ivanka, urged President Trump on Thursday to repudiate the “send her back” chant directed at a Somali-born congresswoman during his speech the night before at a rally in North Carolina, amid widespread fears that the rally had veered into territory that could hurt their party in 2020.

In response, Mr. Trump disavowed the behavior of his own supporters in comments to reporters at the White House and claimed that he had tried to contain it, an assertion clearly contradicted by video of the event.



Mr. Trump said he was “not happy” with the chant directed at Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a freshman Democrat who is Muslim. At the rally Wednesday evening, he had been in the middle of denouncing her as an anti-American leftist who has spoken in “vicious, anti-Semitic screeds” when the chant was taken up by the crowd.

Pressed on why he did not stop it, Mr. Trump said, “I think I did — I started speaking very quickly.” In fact, as the crowd roared “send her back,” Mr. Trump paused and looked around silently for more than 10 seconds as the scene unfolded in front of him, doing nothing to halt the chorus. “I didn’t say that,” he added. “They did.”"
Congresswoman Maloney: Trump misled us in his economic report. I'm setting the record straight,https://www.cnn.com,"['Carolyn Maloney For Cnn Business Perspectives', 'Carolyn Maloney For']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/18/perspectives/trump-economic-report-carolyn-maloney/index.html,"Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney is vice chair of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

Every year, the public gets a window into the White House's views of the economy when the administration publishes the Economic Report of the President. Typically, it is a dense but interesting read, offering a data-driven assessment of the economy, and highly anticipated by economists, policymakers and others who care about economic policy. However, the Trump administration's 2019 report is a sharp departure from those of previous administrations.

This year's report misconstrues well-established facts, cherry-picks data, relies on economic theories widely rejected by mainstream economists and entirely omits critical subjects. I correct the record in the Joint Economic Committee Democratic response to the report, which is mandated by law, and was released Thursday.

The report claims full credit for economic conditions that President Trump mostly inherited from President Obama. At the time of President Trump's inauguration, the unemployment rate was 4.7% and trending down, while the economy had added jobs for 76 straight months. Moreover, the average monthly job growth during the last two years of the Obama administration was stronger than the first two years of the Trump administration. Even so, Trump implausibly has claimed that he has achieved an economic turnaround.

The Trump administration's economic forecast is also extremely optimistic compared to those of respected nonpartisan sources like the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office. It's The administration's estimates of real GDP growth of 3% or greater each year through 2024 are 50% higher than the Federal Reserve's and assume implausible legislative victories, such as the permanent extension of the personal income tax changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, in order to achieve its forecasts.

The report exaggerates the impacts of the Republican tax cuts, which mainstream economists have characterized as a short-term sugar rush and an unnecessary stimulus of an already-hot economy. While private investment increased in 2018, much of the gains may have resulted from changes in oil prices. Even with the boost from oil prices, private investment grew more slowly in 2018 than in 2011 or 2012. And the $1.9 trillion cost of the tax cuts will weigh on the economy for years into the future.

Many USDA workers to quit as research agencies move to Kansas City: ‘The brain drain we all feared’,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'July At Am', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/07/18/many-usda-workers-quit-research-agencies-move-kansas-city-brain-drain-we-all-feared/,"

Two research agencies at the Agriculture Department will uproot from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City in the fall. But many staffers have decided to give up their jobs rather than move, prompting concerns of hollowed-out offices unable to adequately fund or inform agricultural science.

About two-thirds of the USDA employees declined their reassignments, according to a tally the department released Tuesday. Ninety-nine of 171 employees at the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency, will not move. At the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio in scientific funding, 151 of 224 employees declined to relocate.

Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, warned that the hemorrhage of employees will devastate ERS and NIFA. “This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Payne said.

Workers who agreed to move must do so by Sept. 30, although USDA has not established permanent office space and has not said whether the agencies will be located on the Missouri or Kansas side of the Kansas City area. Workers who were asked to move but declined “will be separated by adverse action procedures,” per letters the employees received in June.

The department expects relocation numbers may “fluctuate” until the Sept. 30 cutoff, according to a statement provided by USDA. “These anticipated ranges were taken into account in the department’s long-term strategy, which includes both efforts to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA’s work.”

Tim Cowden, president of the Kansas City Area Development Council, which advocated for the relocation to Kansas City, said in a statement that “just over 36 percent of those given the option to relocate have accepted, which is very strong for any HQ relocation. We remain committed to working with all USDA employees interested in relocating to KC.”

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.), along with Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) and Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), was an early supporter of the move to Kansas City. Cleaver said in a statement he empathized “with not wanting to uproot your family.” But if the move “has to happen,” he said, “then Kansas City is the best place in America for these agencies’ new home,” because it can “fill the void with competent and qualified individuals.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told The Washington Post, “This kind of staff loss will completely gut the ERA and NIFA, and will ultimately prevent the USDA from conducting critical research that helps grow the food our families eat.”

Sonny Ramaswamy, the NIFA director from 2012 to 2018, said he was aware of $50 million in grants, slated to be distributed over the next three months, for research areas identified as priorities in the 2018 farm bill. Those grants would have funded studies into subjects as diverse as disease-resistant cotton in Mississippi and hail-damaged corn in Nebraska.

Now, that science is “not going to happen,” Ramaswamy said, because the planned move has disrupted the agency. A senior NIFA scientist familiar with the grants, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, confirmed that these grants are on hold and in danger of never being distributed.

NIFA, when fully staffed, employs about 400 people. As it becomes more diminished, the agency’s ability to review grant proposals, manage awards or hold grant recipients accountable is threatened, Ramaswamy said. He predicted tens of millions of dollars in grant funding will be in jeopardy. Most money earmarked for NIFA grants, if unspent, returns to the Treasury Department.

Katherine Smith Evans, the ERS administrator from 2007 to 2011, reviewed a list of employees who are leaving. Four of five economists working on bees and pollination at ERS have left or will leave, she said. Ten of 12 economists working on trade and international development have retired, already left or plan to do so. None of the farm finance and tax experts will remain with the agency. “I agree with people who say it will take 10 years to recover,” Smith Evans said.

Gale Buchanan, the USDA chief scientist and undersecretary for research, education and economics in the George W. Bush administration, said employees face “an almost impossible task” by trying to do their jobs with reduced numbers.

The decision process, he said, has been flawed. “I could live by whatever blue-ribbon committee recommended to do to address some of the concerns the secretary had,” Buchanan said. But, he added, “you don’t just pull an idea out of the air and, for some political reason, make a decision.”

The agencies were understaffed even before Tuesday’s tally of those who will not relocate. Employees at the agencies quit in large numbers before the department issued reassignment letters. In early June, vacancy rates at the agencies were about 20 to 25 percent.

“Both agencies already have experienced significant losses of skilled personnel, beginning back when the proposed move was announced,” Payne said. “The percentage of employees moving is even smaller when the denominator is the full staff level.” During fiscal year 2018, ERS had 320 employees. Unless a wave of new hires fills the deserted desks, by this fall, ERS will be half the size it was two years ago.

When Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the relocation in August, he said it would “provide more streamlined and efficient services.” A cost-benefit analysis released by the department in June suggests moving to Kansas City will save as much as $300 million over 15 years.

An organization of economists, the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, disputed the projected savings; the move may cost taxpayers money, the group said, because the analysis overestimated the expense of retaining the agencies in the capital and did not calculate the value of lost research.

"E.P.A. Won’t Ban Chlorpyrifos, Pesticide Tied to Children’s Health Problems",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/climate/epa-chlorpyrifos-pesticide-ban.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took a major step to weaken the regulation of toxic chemicals on Thursday when the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would not ban a widely used pesticide that its own experts have linked to serious health problems in children.

The decision by Andrew R. Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, represents a victory for the chemical industry and for farmers who have lobbied to continue using the substance, chlorpyrifos, arguing it is necessary to protect crops.

It was the administration’s second major move this year to roll back or eliminate chemical safety rules. In April, the agency disregarded the advice of its own experts when officials issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, a known carcinogen. Agency scientists and lawyers had urged the E.P.A. to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

In making the chlorpyrifos ruling, the E.P.A. said in a statement that the data supporting objections to the use of the pesticide was “not sufficiently valid, complete or reliable.” The agency added that it would continue to monitor the safety of chlorpyrifos through 2022."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez slammed U.S. CBP after a report of a secret Facebook group that made fun of dead migrants. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – After a week fielding racist attacks from President Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about the whereabouts of Border Patrol agents who threatened her in a secret Facebook group.

The intense and personal line of questioning Thursday happened as McAleenan appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to testify about his role in separating migrant children from their families and worsening conditions at the migrant detention centers along the southern U.S. border.

He was also asked several times about a secret Facebook group of current and former Border Patrol agents that contained more than 10,000 members and included posts mocking migrants and the deaths of children in custody and suggesting harm to Democratic lawmakers. After the group's existence was revealed by a ProPublica report, McAleenan announced DHS was investigating the ""disturbing"" and ""inexcusable"" posts.

""Did you see the posts planning physical harm to myself and Congresswoman Escobar?"" Ocasio-Cortez asked McAleenan. ""Yes,"" he answered. ""And I directed an investigation within reading the article.""

""Did you see the images of officers circulating photoshop images of my violent rape?"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""Yes I did,"" McAleenan responded.

McAleenan did not specifically say whether those Border Patrol agents were still on the job after Ocasio-Cortez questioned whether they were still ""responsible for the safety of migrant women and children.""

He said several agents have been put on administrative duties while the investigation continues, saying ""I don't know which ones correspond to which posts and we've ordered cease and desist orders to dozens of more.""

McAleenan shot back after Ocasio-Cortez asked about whether the separating of children and families led to a ""dehumanizing culture"" within Customs and Border Protection. ""We do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP,"" he said touting that the agency, ""rescues 4,000 people a year"" and is ""committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with.""

He said the posts were ""unacceptable"" but ""I don't think it's fair to apply them to the entire organization or that even the members of that group believed or supported those posts.""

The hearing came after days of President Trump attacking Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshmen Democratic lawmakers, all women of color who are critical of his administration and its policies.

CLOSE President Trump says he ""felt a little bit badly"" about the chants of ""send her back"" that erupted at his North Carolina rally. USA TODAY

It started Sunday when Trump sent a series of tweets suggesting Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., should ""go back"" to where they came from.

The House passed a resolution condemning the racist comments on Tuesday as the president faced widespread criticism over the remarks, which he doubled down on at the White House and on Twitter throughout the week.

He singled out the four women Wednesday evening during a rally in North Carolina and his supporters started chanting ""send her back"" as the president brought up Rep. Omar, who is originally from Somalia and became one of the first two Muslim women in Congress when she was elected in the 2018 midterms. Omar is a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Trump distanced himself from the chants on Thursday, saying, ""I disagree with it"" and ""I wasn't happy with that message.""

"After census debacle, White House to knock out senior Commerce official",https://www.politico.com,"['Nancy Cook', 'Margaret Harding Mcgill']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/18/white-house-earl-comstock-out-1600269,"Commerce policy director Earl Comstock clashed with Trump administration officials on a number of policy issues. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo White House After census debacle, White House to knock out senior Commerce official Senior Trump aides have sparred with the policy director for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over the census, 5G and other issues.

The White House is pushing a top aide to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross out of the Trump administration, the first round of house-cleaning after the 2020 census debacle and clashes over tech policy.

In recent months, Commerce policy director Earl Comstock has angered Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, White House lawyers, members of the National Security Council and officials at the National Economic Council, according to five current and former administration officials. The irritation extends to the highest staff level of the White House, several officials stressed, citing both Comstock’s handling of the 2020 U.S. census’s citizenship question and the internal debate over spectrum policy as key areas of disagreement.

Story Continued Below

One former administration official said he could not think of anyone who “had pissed off as many senior White House officials” as Comstock, who critics allege often tried to exceed his own authority as a top Commerce policy staffer. Comstock also clashed with officials across federal agencies, according to one administration official.

While officials said the process of forcing out Comstock through a firing or resignation is underway, the date of his actual departure remains unclear. He was at the agency until the end of the day on Wednesday.

The White House referred questions about Comstock to the Commerce Department. A Commerce spokesperson said “there is no truth to these rumors. Earl Comstock is an instrumental and valuable member of the Commerce team. He has a keen understanding of the functions of the federal government and has spearheaded multiple departmental initiatives as the deputy chief of staff for policy. Earl will continue to work tirelessly on behalf of the Secretary, the Department of Commerce and the American people.”

As Mulvaney has sought to exert greater control over federal agencies, Comstock’s performance has come under far greater scrutiny — similar to how the White House also has paid close to attention recently to top officials at the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services.

Comstock’s role in failing to put the citizenship question on the U.S. census was just the latest high-profile blow for him, since it’s an issue the president cares about deeply — adding to widespread views inside the White House that Commerce is not effectively executing the president’s agenda.

Administration officials said Comstock’s eventual departure is not necessarily a foreshadowing of Ross’s own tenure in the Cabinet — though the president has been frustrated over the past year with his Commerce secretary’s negotiating prowess in trade talks and the census question.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/1311/1155968404_6058082603001_6058083404001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

And Commerce officials don’t see Ross, an 81-year-old investor and longtime friend of the president, leaving imminently despite months of speculation and ongoing sparring with lawmakers. “He likes doing the job,” said a personal familiar with Ross.

Comstock, who acted as Ross’s sherpa during the confirmation process, clashed with other Trump administration officials on a number of policy issues, including spectrum and net neutrality.

A feud among Trump's advisers over 5G wireless — a technology crucial to U.S. competition with China over the future of the internet — spilled into public view in March, when Commerce raised concerns that FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's effort to free up more 5G airwaves for the wireless sector would interfere with the government's use of nearby airwaves for weather forecasting. The White House ultimately sided with the FCC in that debate.

But that did not end the internal infighting. Pai accused the department of “blocking our efforts at every single turn” during a Senate oversight hearing in June. He said the relationship between his agency and Commerce has deteriorated since David Redl abruptly resigned his post as head of Commerce’s NTIA in May.

Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with support from NASA, has raised concerns that using 24 GHz airwaves for 5G services could degrade weather forecasting systems’ ability to make predictions. The FCC concluded its auction of the airwaves in May.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in June warned Ross that a senior adviser “may be placing personal animosity ahead of our country's 5G goals.” Ross responded by saying officials had reached a “workable compromise” — an assertion the FCC denied. The issue also arose in a House hearing Tuesday on spectrum policy.

Comstock has not been in lock-step with the FCC in other policy areas. Early in his tenure at Commerce, he quietly opposed the FCC’s repeal of Obama-era net neutrality regulations by backing a congressional effort to restore the rules. The one-time Republican Senate staffer believes telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon need firm oversight, and had previously challenged the Obama-era rules in court because he did not believe they went far enough in reining in broadband providers.

US Treasury Secretary Says Cash Is Not Laundered As Much As Bitcoin Is,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Helen Partz', 'Jose Rafael Ruiz Estanga', 'Gary Cros', 'Duane Wood', 'Justin Connelly', 'Bitcoins', ""Alex 'Alcyone' Newman"", 'Online Date']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-treasury-secretary-says-cash-is-not-laundered-as-much-as-bitcoin-is,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the authority will be preventing Bitcoin (BTC) from becoming an “equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts.”

U.S. secretary of the treasury to closely monitor Bitcoin regardless of price

In a press briefing reported by CNBC on July 18, Mnuchin criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as they can be used for illicit purposes such as money laundering, adding that the department intends to enforce strong regulations on the space.

The official emphasized his own intent to closely monitor Bitcoin to prevent illegal activity regardless of its price, claiming that there are billions of dollars in Bitcoin and other crypto for nefarious activities.

Mnuchin believes that cash is not laundered like Bitcoin is

As Mnuchin clearly said that Bitcoin’s vulnerability to money laundering is the main reason for the Treasury to regulate it tightly, CNBC’s host Joe Kernen questioned his point in an interview on “Squawk Box” on July 18.

Kernen argued that Bitcoin and other existing currencies’ capabilities to be used for nefarious activities cannot be a reason for banning them, noting that “cash is laundered all the time.” Mnuchin did not back off from his position, replying that such a statement is not accurate.

The Secretary elaborated that the U.S. has the strongest anti-money laundering (AML) system in the world, adding that the government combats “bad actors in the U.S. dollar every day to protect the U.S. financial system.”

Following the interview, Kernen expressed sarcasm about Mnuchin’s idea that cash has not been laundered all the time, but the authorities are combating illicit activities in its system. He tweeted:

“‘the existing system has never been used for illicit activities but we're going to make sure crypto is isn't used for illicit activities like the current system.’ Got it.”

On July 15, Mnuchin expressed concern over Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency and its potential illicit use, noting that he is not comfortable with Libra cryptocurrency, which can be used for tax evasion, extortion, illicit drugs and human trafficking, among others."
Homeland Security has gutted programs aimed at stopping WMD terrorism,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-07-17/times-investigation-homeland-security-gutted-programs-aimed-at-stopping-wmd-terrorism,"The Trump administration has quietly dismantled or cut back multiple programs that were created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to help detect and prevent terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction, a Times investigation has found.

The retreat has taken place over the last two years at the Department of Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block potential chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

The changes, not previously reported, were made without rigorous review of potential security vulnerabilities, The Times found, undermining government-wide efforts aimed at countering terrorist attacks involving unconventional weapons, known as WMD.

More than 30 current and former Homeland Security employees and contractors voiced concern that the changes — including the cancellation of dozens of training exercises and the departure of scores of scientists and policy experts — have put Americans at greater risk.

“What we had done in the past was analytically based: Where are the threats? Where can we get the most return on the taxpayers’ investment for security?” said Paul Ryan, who until mid-2017 helped lead Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was merged with another office last year.

“We’re not as secure as we were 18 months ago,” said Ryan, a retired Navy rear admiral.

The cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, who has been appointed by President Trump to successive posts at Homeland Security, a long-troubled department that has seen waves of leadership changes and policy upheaval since 2017.

McDonnell declined through a Homeland Security spokeswoman to be interviewed for this report, and the department did not answer written questions submitted on June 27.

On July 15, the spokeswoman, Ruth Clemens, emailed a three-sentence statement, saying that the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads, “is focused on preventing WMD terrorism by working with federal, state, and local partners across the nation.”

It also said, “some programs were realigned or restructured to better address threats, remove bureaucratic redundancy, and fully align with [Trump’s] National Security Strategy.”

Trump pledged in that 2017 document to “augment measures to secure, eliminate, and prevent the spread of WMD and related materials … to reduce the chance that they might fall into the hands of hostile actors.”

Among the programs gutted since 2017, however, was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” whose specialists conducted dozens of drills and assessments around the country each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing “dirty bomb.”

Another Homeland Security unit, the Operations Support Directorate, had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The directorate participated in less than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year, according to internal Homeland Security documents.

Experts at Homeland Security’s National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center had worked with counterparts throughout the federal government to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

The center has been reduced to a shell: Its leadership is out and its staff has shrunk to three positions from about 14.

A separate Homeland Security component, the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

Also cut back was the use of specialized, mobile detection units to help protect large public events from nuclear and radiological threats. The deployments have helped train local and state responders for a potential emergency.

For the first time in years, Homeland Security did not send a unit to protect the NCAA Final Four college basketball championship in April in Minneapolis or to an annual hot air balloon festival last fall in Albuquerque.

Homeland Security also has halted work to update a formal “strategic, integrated” assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks.

The assessment had previously analyzed millions of potential WMD threat scenarios. Under a directive President George W. Bush signed in 2007, the assessment is supposed to be updated at least every other year to provide objective guidance for the government’s purchases of detection-related technologies and medications for use following an attack.

“These risk assessments are how we stay ahead of the game,” said a former Homeland Security official, one of many who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing a security clearance or other retaliation. “If we don’t keep updating those assessments, then we essentially lose the little bit of focus that we have on the problem and we really risk a strategic surprise.”

The risk assessments provide “an understanding of where to make investments that are targeted to reduce the risk of terrorism,” a current Homeland Security official added. If effective detection technologies are not put in place and if the right medications are not procured for the nation’s emergency stockpile, “that’s putting people at risk,” the official said.

Overall, more than 100 scientists and policy experts specializing in radiological and nuclear threats have been reassigned or left to take jobs unrelated to their expertise, The Times found, undermining the department’s ability to protect the nation from devastating attacks.

Similar turmoil has unfolded among those who had specialized in countering such biological threats as airborne spores of anthrax.

In the worst biological attack in U.S. history, letters laced with powdered anthrax spores were sent through the U.S. mail soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Five Americans were killed and 17 others were infected. In July 2008, an Army scientist, Bruce E. Ivins, killed himself after he learned he was about to be indicted for the anthrax deaths.

Current and former Homeland Security officials warned in interviews that cutting back training around the country could erode readiness among those who would first confront a WMD terrorism attack.

“You keep the country safe by empowering state and local first responders who are out and about 24/7, 365 [days a year],” said one former Homeland Security official.

“The real thing could happen tomorrow with no warning,” another former official said. “And the only practice our defenders are going to have is through these ‘red team’ studies and actual exercises. That activity is necessary to ensure even basic competence.”

The changes have undermined the U.S. government’s multi-agency commitment since 2006 to build and maintain a “global nuclear detection architecture,” according to the present and former officials.

The goal, specified in legislation, was a layered network — from locations overseas to inside U.S. cities — to detect and assist the seizure of radiological or nuclear materials that could be wielded by terrorists.

McDonnell has become a formidable figure at the Department of Homeland Security since Trump named him director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in early 2017. In May 2018, the president promoted him to be an assistant secretary of Homeland Security, heading the new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

Trump signed the legislation that formally merged the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was responsible for reducing the risk of radiological and nuclear terrorism, with the Office of Health Affairs, which had run BioWatch, the nation’s system for detecting potential airborne biological terrorism threats.

McDonnell has used broad discretion over the last two years to shift priorities and policies regarding WMD terrorism. Some of the changes are at odds with priorities authorized by formal presidential directives and by legislation enacted into law, The Times found.

The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center, for example, was established in 2006 under Bush, and affirmed by legislation signed by President Obama in 2010, to help counter smuggling of nuclear materials that could be used in an attack. It has now been effectively gutted.

Separately, the presidential directive that Bush signed in 2007 required Homeland Security to update the integrated assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks “not less frequently than every two years.” The directive remains in force, along with two related mandates, but the update is incomplete and is more than two years overdue, The Times found.

Michael Grossman, who collaborated with Homeland Security specialists during his six years as chief of the Los Angeles County sheriff’s anti-terrorism section, said any slippage in attention to the WMD threat concerns him, in part because regaining readiness would take time.

“If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready,” he said.

Current and former Homeland Security officials said they have struggled to grasp McDonnell’s rationale for cutting back training and other efforts intended to improve readiness, detection and tracing. They cited instances when specialists were removed from their areas of expertise in apparent retaliation for raising concerns about his policies.

Although the mobile detection units were deployed 70 or more times a year in response to requests from state and local officials, for example, McDonnell told subordinates he wants them used chiefly to support other Homeland Security operations and agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard.

Those agencies already have nuclear-detection equipment and procedures in place, according to congressional testimony and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

In 2016, Customs and Border Protection deployed specialized equipment to scan almost 100% of the cargo bound for and arriving at U.S. ports of entry, for example. It uses 1,400 giant radiation portal monitors to scan vehicles and cargo at land-border crossings, seaports, airports and mail facilities, the GAO reported that October.

Trump has repeatedly vowed to prevent terrorists from gaining access to unconventional weapons. In December, he said the “efforts will require close collaboration with and support to” the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency, based in Vienna.

But McDonnell has disbanded the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with the IAEA to help ensure dangerous nuclear material is seized overseas before it could be smuggled into the United States.

An IAEA official said “numerous” collaborations with Homeland Security over the years had bolstered nuclear security worldwide but that the joint efforts had come to a near-standstill.

“We hope that they would join in again,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

The Homeland Security division had participated in exercises with other IAEA member nations and helped generate “guidelines and best practices” that were adopted by 42 nations, according to one of McDonnell’s predecessors.

“This strategic partnership will continue to serve as a force multiplier for nuclear security efforts for years to come,” Huban A. Gowadia, then director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, told the House Homeland Security Committee in February 2015.

To aid the collaborations, Homeland Security embedded a specialist at IAEA headquarters for several years. McDonnell eliminated the position.

Asked about the now-canceled position, an IAEA spokesman said in an email that the specialist had assisted member states “in strengthening their efforts to detect nuclear and radioactive material.”

Officials participating in a program known as Securing the Cities, which was intended as Homeland Security’s last layer of defense against radiological or nuclear terrorism, also have raised concerns.

Securing the Cities was supposed to fortify defenses in five major urban areas — greater Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Long Beach; New York City and nearby Newark, N.J.; Chicago; and Houston.

Overall, Homeland Security has provided the cities with training assistance and direct financial grants totaling about $145 million for detection equipment from 2007 to mid-2018. (The Los Angeles-Long Beach area was made part of Securing the Cities in 2012.)

But a GAO report dated May 13 described “confusion and uncertainty” among city officials participating in the program. According to the report, the chaotic circumstances have arisen, in part, because McDonnell has said he wants Homeland Security to reduce its participation and let other federal agencies play a larger role.

The GAO report said, however, that the agencies McDonnell had cited — the FBI and the National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the Energy Department — didn’t intend to do so.

Homeland Security officials told the GAO “that they have not conducted any studies or analyses that would justify making changes to the program,” the report states.

“We asked, `Why are you making changes and what are these changes going to look like?’” David Trimble, the supervising analyst for the report, recalled in an interview. “The details were very light. [Homeland Security] couldn’t really provide us a road map of where they were going. We found no analysis behind it.”

McDonnell’s overall objectives are unclear.

According to congressional budget experts, $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for his office — went unspent. The unspent funds reflect indecision surrounding the shifted priorities and staff departures, current and former Homeland Security officials said.

On Dec. 18, dissatisfaction at the changes erupted at an “all-hands” staff meeting convened by McDonnell and attended by Kirstjen Nielsen, then-Homeland Security secretary, along with scores of subordinates from the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

A supervisor, responsible for ensuring that operational expenditures are based on validated needs, stood and voiced concerns about McDonnell’s leadership and asked Nielsen to intervene, according to people who were in the room.

McDonnell sat silently and did not respond.

Soon after, Nielsen’s office instructed a personnel official, Sharon M. Wong, to conduct a “workplace climate assessment” to elicit opinions from current and recent staff members. Many of those who spoke with The Times said they also shared their misgivings with Wong.

One official said he had raised concerns about McDonnell’s efforts to install BioDetection 21, a controversial nationwide system intended to replace BioWatch for detecting airborne infectious agents such as anthrax. The replacement technology McDonnell is backing failed repeatedly in field testing sponsored by Homeland Security scientific staff.

The Times disclosed the test results and McDonnell’s support for BioDetection 21 in February, prompting a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation that is ongoing.

In early May, after Nielsen resigned, Wong submitted her results to the office of the acting Homeland Security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, according to people familiar with the matter. The results have not been released publicly.

Although morale at Homeland Security has long ranked lowest of all federal departments, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office had routinely scored much higher, according to surveys conducted by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.

In 2014, the office ranked 11th among similar “subcomponent” offices. Last year, it ranked 415th — last among its peers."

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors' decision to end an investigation into hush money payments to women claiming affairs with Donald Trump relied at least in part on long-standing Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.

The Justice Department told a federal judge on Monday that it had ""effectively concluded"" its investigation into efforts to silence the women in the final months of the 2016 campaign, but did not explain why it had done so. Prosecutors have said the payoffs violated a federal law that restricts campaign donations.

A person familiar with the case, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, said it was unclear whether prosecutors made a determination that they had sufficient evidence to bring a case against Trump or anyone other than his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty last year. But the Justice Department's opinion that a president cannot be indicted factored into the decision to end the probe, the person said.

Federal prosecutors had repeatedly placed Trump at the center of the effort to silence pornographic actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal during the chaotic run-up to the 2016 election. Last year, they alleged in a court filing that Cohen had orchestrated illegal hush-money payments ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. And it revealed in unsealed court records on Friday that Trump participated in phone calls about the payments to Daniels.

The judgment by federal prosecutors in New York to take no further action in the wide-ranging inquiry tracks a decision earlier this year by former special counsel Robert Mueller, who cited the same Justice Department policy when he declined to make a determination about whether Trump's efforts to derail that investigation amounted to a crime.

The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded in 2000 that ""a sitting President is constitutionally immune from indictment and criminal prosecution."" That view has never been tested in court but is binding on federal prosecutors.

As in the Mueller inquiry, which outlined 10 instances in which Trump sought to thwart the special counsel's inquiry, documents revealed Thursday put then-candidate Trump in middle of a frantic effort to fend off damaging disclosures about his personal conduct just a month before the 2016 election.

In the documents, the FBI described a series of conversations in the days after a leaked Access Hollywood outtake showed Trump boasting about grabbing women by the genitals about preventing Daniels from airing her own claims of having had an affair with Trump years earlier.

Authorities laid out a timeline of emails, text messages and phone calls – some involving Trump himself – that ""concerned the need to prevent"" Daniels from going public with her story.

Trump denied knowledge of the payments after they became public. But the FBI told a judge it had obtained telephone records showing he participated in some of the first conversations about the scheme, which prosecutors have said violated federal campaign finance laws.

Federal prosecutors said in court filings last year that Cohen orchestrated payments to Daniels and McDougal, ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. The documents unsealed Thursday offer the first clear account of the extent of Trump's involvement in that effort, as the Republican nominee's campaign floundered just weeks before the election.

Ultimately, it was Cohen – not Trump – who was charged and convicted for the scheme. He is serving a three-year sentence in federal prison related to tax evasion and the hush-money scheme that amounted to illegal campaign finance violations. He also pleaded guilty to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign.

""Cohen's commission of two campaign finance crimes on the eve of the 2016 election for president of the United States struck a blow to one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency,"" prosecutors asserted prior to Cohen's sentencing.

In the same document, however, prosecutors indicated that Cohen was acting on behalf of Trump who they then-described in gauzy law enforcement vernacular as ""Individual 1.""

""The investigation is over,"" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said Thursday. He declined to address whether the current Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president blocked any further action contemplated by New York prosecutors.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

But from a federal prison in upstate New York, Cohen continued to claim that his conviction should not mark the end of an investigation that has long shadowed the White House.

""I and members of The Trump Organization were directed by Mr. Trump to handle the Stormy Daniels matter; including making the hush money payment,” Cohen said in a statement Thursday. “The conclusion of the investigation exonerating The Trump Organization's role should be of great concern to the American people and investigated by Congress and the Department of Justice.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the unsealed documents bolstered Cohen's assertions.

""The inescapable conclusion from all of the public materials available now is that there was ample evidence to charge Donald Trump with the same criminal election law violations for which Michael Cohen pled guilty,"" Schiff said.

Feds Say Former VA Employee Used Vets’ Ailing Kids to Scam Millions,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Lachlan Markay', 'Seamus Hughes']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/feds-say-former-va-employee-used-vets-ailing-kids-to-scam-millions,"A Department of Veterans Affairs employee used a network of shell companies to steal millions of dollars from a VA program to provide health services to children of veterans who are suffering from a debilitating spinal condition, federal prosecutors say.

The Justice Department lodged 23 federal criminal charges late last year against Joseph Prince, a former Veterans Affairs employee who prosecutors say used his position to steer almost $20 million in taxpayer money to companies run by family members and associates. Those companies then provided huge kickbacks to Prince, his wife, and other family members, the government alleges.

The previously unreported criminal case appears set to go to trial in Colorado in November. Prince has pleaded not guilty. An alleged co-conspirator, Roland Vaughn, initially did the same, but recent federal court filings indicate he is set to change that plea to guilty at a hearing early next month. Neither of their attorneys responded to requests for comment on the case.

Before he was fired late last year, Prince worked at a VA facility in Denver, where he oversaw a program that provides health benefits to the families of Vietnam and Korean War veterans with children who suffer from spina bifida, a debilitating spinal birth defect. Part of Prince’s job entailed counseling those families about the treatment options available to them through the VA. Prosecutors say he exploited that position of trust to steer patients to seven different home health agencies that subsequently kicked back money to Prince and his family.

The scale of the alleged fraud was extraordinary, according to data filed by federal prosecutors in search warrant affidavits. Of the $25.2 million the VA paid to home health agencies through the spina bifida program from June 2017 through June 2018, $18.9 million, or 75 percent, was paid to the seven companies implicated in the indictment against Prince.

Prince’s alleged scheme involved selling VA patients on home health services offered through the department’s spina bifida program. Certain services can be performed by family members and others without medical training provided they register with the VA ahead of time. Those services include basic assistance with daily tasks such as meal preparation and home care, but home providers can also be certified by medical professionals to help with bladder and bowel care often required for spina bifida patients. They can then submit invoices for services provided for reimbursement at a preset hourly rate.

According to the indictment, Prince sold patients on the benefits of doing that home health work themselves and recouping the hourly payments that the VA provided. He even allegedly encouraged them to falsely inflate the number of hours they worked, and falsely told some that there were minimum hourly billing requirements.

Prince then referred the patients to one of seven home health companies, assuring them that the companies could secure them the best reimbursement rates and assist with VA red tape. One of those companies was run by Prince’s wife. Others had reached pre-arranged deals with Prince under which he would steer them VA patients in exchange for referral fees. In many cases, Prince even sent patients prepopulated VA forms with his preferred home health agency.

Prince vouched for the companies’ track records even though, according to prosecutors, none were run by medical professionals. He used terms like “preferred,” “handpicked,” and “vetted,” and promised that the companies would assist with the red tape and would take the smaller fees than their competitors off of VA reimbursement checks.

In fact, the companies were taking huge premiums—paying home health caregivers between $16 and $20 per hour while filing for VA reimbursement at hourly rates between $86 and $141.

When patients found out about that discrepancy, they were livid. After receiving a regular statement of benefits from the VA, one beneficiary referred to a Prince-affiliated agency wrote to Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI) in April 2018. “Our daughter is in the Spina Bifida Program,” the unnamed parent wrote, according to documents filed in court. “The program has a provision to provide health care for her at home for the rest of her life. We were told that we would be paid for this. We signed a contract with a company that would take care of getting us paid, but they didn’t tell us that they got to keep 82% and pay us 18% for doing all the work. This is highway robbery.”

The scheme was extremely lucrative for both Prince and the home health agencies with which he worked. Prosecutors say his wife’s Advantage Home Health Agency alone received more than $4.3 million in VA payments as part of its work for the spina bifida program. Three agencies owned by Prince’s half-sister received more than $7.1 million.

Together, all seven agencies kicked back roughly $1.5 million to Prince individually, according to the indictment, and hundreds of thousands more to members of his family.

Some of the money went directly into Prince’s bank account, while some was paid to a consulting firm he owns. He used the funds to buy a house and a car, pay down student loans, fund plastic surgery procedures (for whom it’s not clear), and even to donate to his and his wife’s church, according to documents filed by federal prosecutors.

In an emailed statement, the church said Prince “has not been associated with our congregation for quite a while,” but that “we are saddened to learn of these allegations, and our prayers are extended to all who may have been victimized by the crime alleged.”

Prince was arrested last summer after an investigation by the FBI and the VA inspector general's criminal investigations division. The evidence against him appears to be considerable, due in large measure to the official record of his time at the VA. Because he worked in a call center, all of Prince’s phone conversations were recorded. And his emails were preserved as required under the Federal Records Act. Federal prosecutors have amassed an evidentiary record consisting of at least 6,000 printed pages and 1,414 audio files.

“Evidence at trial will include the testimony of numerous witnesses, including VA employees, at least 16 caregivers… as well as the playing of recorded phone calls between Mr. Prince and the beneficiaries, which will be time consuming,” according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have also filed more than 40 federal seizure notices on the bank accounts of those involved in the scam, hoping to get back nearly $3.2 million taken by Prince and his associates.

During questioning after his arrest, Prince denied any wrongdoing, and said “he thought he was providing more benefit to the beneficiaries and caregivers by sending them to companies that were going to pay them more for the same services.”

Privately, his tone was far different. The FBI recruited the owner of one of the implicated home health agencies to conduct a monitored phone call with Prince, during which he admitted receiving kickbacks from the agencies to which he referred patients. “It may not be” legal, Prince admitted.

“All it takes is one person to say something and that’s the end of it for everybody,” he added. But “everything is fine if nobody finds out.”"

"U.S. Justice Department may sue to block Sprint, T-Mobile merger: source",https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobileus/doj-may-sue-to-block-sprint-t-mobile-merger-cnbc-idUSKCN1UD23C,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has told T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp to wrap up a deal by the end of next week to sell assets that are to be divested as a condition of their proposed merger or face a lawsuit aimed at stopping the transaction, a source familiar with the deal said on Thursday.

T-Mobile and Sprint did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.

CNBC was the first to report the ultimatum.

In June, a group of U.S. state attorneys general filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York to block the merger of the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers, arguing that the proposed $26 billion deal would cost consumers more than $4.5 billion annually.

To win over the Justice Department, which is not involved in the lawsuit, T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed to a series of deal concessions, including selling the prepaid brand Boost.

The companies have been in talks for weeks to sell Boost to Dish Network Corp but are haggling over issues such as restrictions over who can buy the divested assets if they are sold in the future. T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom, which owns 63 percent of T-Mobile, are seeking to prevent them from going to a cable or technology company.

Sprint is controlled by Softbank Group Corp.

The companies told the court in late June that they were willing to refrain from closing the deal until after the state attorneys general case is completed.

The two companies have a July 29 deadline to complete the deal but are expected to extend it.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has given his blessing to the merger in principle and is expected to circulate a formal order within weeks."
Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area,https://www.npr.org,['Merrit Kennedy'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/07/17/742519999/future-of-key-farming-research-uncertain-as-2-3-of-usda-staff-say-they-wont-move,"Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area

Two vital research agencies at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are hemorrhaging staff as less than two-thirds of the researchers asked to relocate from Washington to the Kansas City area have agreed to do so.

When U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the planned new location of the research agencies last month, he said it ""will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders"" and ""increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture.""

But groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists call it a ""blatant attack on science"" that will ""especially hurt farmers, ranchers and eaters at a particularly vulnerable time.""

The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA's Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, said the relocation ""has resulted in catastrophic attrition at USDA's top research agencies.""

""Evidence suggests that the relocation of these agencies is an attempt to hollow out and dismantle USDA science that helps farmers and protects our food supply,"" the union added.

The USDA gave employees until just before midnight on Monday to notify their employers whether they planned to accept the relocation.

On Tuesday, a USDA spokesperson told NPR that at ERS, 72 employees accepted relocation and 99 declined or did not respond. At NIFA, the spokesperson said 73 accepted and 151 declined or did not respond. That means the total number that accepted is about 36% of those reported.

The USDA spokesperson said that these numbers may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the date employees are expected to report to the area, and employees can change their statuses until then.

They added that the USDA is working ""to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA's work.""

Last month, the USDA said that of the 644 jobs in the two agencies, 544 would be relocated and 100 would remain in the D.C. area. The numbers reported on Tuesday by the USDA do not appear to account for some 150 positions that the USDA initially announced would be relocated.

The department did not immediately respond to explain the difference, though the employees' union has reported high rates of ""retirements, employees securing new jobs, and employees choosing to be terminated."" A statement last month from three Democratic senators said that ERS had a vacancy rate of 20% and NIFA had a vacancy rate of 26.4%.

NIFA provides grants for research on agriculture-related science, and the ERS conducts research and analysis on topics such as outlooks on major crops and livestock, how much food is going to cost and whether U.S. households will be food secure.

It's not yet clear whether the research agencies will be located in Kansas or Missouri, according to The Kansas City Star.

Lawmakers from both states, including Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, have supported the move. ""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" the Republican said, as NPR's Frank Morris reported.

An ex-employee of ERS recently told Morris that ""efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale."" He said the way the agency is run has become increasingly partisan, and he resigned after the surprise announcement about relocations.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee told Morris.

Some of ERS' recent studies, as Morris noted, may be politically uncomfortable for the Trump administration:

""ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.""

Perdue said last month that the move would save the USDA some $300 million. That number has been met with skepticism by some analysts. The Agricultural & Applied Economics Association estimated the relocation would actually cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million, partially due to the lost value of the research from staffers who decide not to move."

House Democrats vote to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt over census fight,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Sunny Kim Kevin Breuninger', 'Sunny Kim', 'Kevin Breuninger']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/17/census-fight-house-holds-ag-barr-commerce-secretary-ross-in-contempt.html,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr delivers opening remarks at a summit on ""Combating Anti-Semitism"" at the Justice Department in Washington, July 15, 2019.

House Democrats on Wednesday voted to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas related to President Donald Trump's push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The resolution passed by a vote of 230-198. It marks the latest escalation in the fight between Democrats, who say their oversight duties require launching a slew of subpoenas and requests for information from the Trump administration, and Trump, who has vowed to fight ""all the subpoenas"" from the House.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee last month voted to recommend that the entire House hold Barr and Ross in contempt for ""refusing to comply"" with their subpoenas for information about the census controversy.

""It begs the question: What else is being hidden from the American people?"" Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said in a press release at the time.

Ross responded in a statement Wednesday, saying, ""House Democrats never sought to have a productive relationship with the Trump Administration, and today's PR stunt further demonstrates their unending quest to generate headlines instead of operating in good faith with our Department.""

""It is an unfortunate fact that there are some who would like nothing more than to see this Administration fail whatever the cost to the country may be,"" Ross said. ""Preferring to play political games rather than help lead the country, they have made every attempt to ascribe evil motivations to everyday functions of government.""

The White House also responded after the decision, calling it a ""ridiculous and yet another lawless attempt to harass the President and his Administration.""

Trump had asserted executive privilege over the documents requested by the committee. A Commerce Department official told Cummings in a letter at the time that Trump's hand was forced because Oversight had set an ""unnecessary"" and ""premature"" contempt vote ""rather than allowing the Department to complete its document production.""

Trump abandoned his bid to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census last Thursday, just a few weeks after the Supreme Court blocked the question. Chief Justice John Roberts said Ross' reasoning for adding the citizenship question was ""contrived"" and not ""genuine."" Trump himself said the reasoning for the question on the census was for redistricting purposes.

Instead of gathering the data through the census, Trump said he would order federal agencies to give the Commerce Department all records related to information regarding how many citizens and noncitizens live in the United States.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed concern about sending one of his top arms control negotiators, Andrea Thompson, to head a U.S. delegation meeting with Russia’s deputy foreign minister this week after it was revealed that she had failed to disclose her ties to the boyfriend of Russian foreign agent Maria Butina.

So Pompeo dispatched his deputy, John Sullivan, to lead the delegation instead. The delegation, which now includes Sullivan, Thompson and other senior U.S. officials, is attending the strategic security dialogue in Geneva, where American officials are set to talk with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov about arms control, including what sort of arrangement might replace the International Nuclear Forces treaty that the Trump administration scuttled earlier this year.

Thompson’s presence at the meeting raised concern in some quarters of the administration after the Washington Post reported last month that she had not disclosed her personal and financial ties to Paul Erickson, the veteran GOP operative who worked with Butina to establish a Kremlin backchannel to the Trump campaign in 2016.

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a private letter to the State Department in recent days regarding Thompson’s “apparent failures to disclose required and material information to the SFRC during her nomination process,” according to Juan Pachon, Menendez’s communications director on the committee.

A State Department spokesman confirmed receipt of the letter, but declined to comment on Pompeo’s last-minute decision to send Sullivan to Geneva, or on whether the department was satisfied with Thompson’s disclosures during her confirmation process.

Thompson failed to alert her superiors that Erickson officiated her 2017 wedding, according to two U.S. officials, and did not disclose during her Senate confirmation that her husband, David Gillian, a retired Australian Army officer, had wired Erickson $100,000 for an allegedly fraudulent investment scheme in which Gillian and others were allegedly defrauded by Erickson -- a transaction laid out by the FBI in court filings.

The failure to disclose could have serious repercussions for Thompson, former officials said, though it is not necessarily fatal to her career.

“All senior officers have to report on their finances and any connections to overseas interests. Diplomatic Security should review her clearance,” said John Sipher, who spent nearly three decades working in the CIA’s clandestine service, including a stint in Moscow. “When Erickson and Butina were all over the news, she should have reported her connection. At the very least it now puts the administration in a bind where critics can question her competence, professionalism and judgment.”

At the time of her wedding and her then-fiance’s investment in Erickson’s business four months prior, Thompson was working as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. A year later, in April of 2018, she was confirmed by the Senate as undersecretary for arms control and international security.

At the time, Gillian was complaining to Erickson that he hadn’t seen the promised return on his investment, the FBI said, and received what agents described as a “lulling payment” of $5,000 -- intended to allay Gillian’s concerns -- on March 29, 2018, the month after Thompson’s Senate Committee hearing and the month before her confirmation vote.

Thompson’s alleged failure to disclose her relationship with Erickson, who was by then the subject of national news stories detailing his relationship with Butina, during her Senate confirmation has raised anxiety among Russia hawks in the Trump orbit who fear that Thompson, one of the last remaining acolytes of the president’s first national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, is insufficiently hard-headed and enters this week’s talks in a compromised position.

One of these officials said that Thompson’s failure to disclose her connection to Erickson indicates that her “judgment is in question.”

“She either didn’t understand what she was doing … or she did and she tried to conceal it,” this person said.

Flynn was pushed out of the administration in February of 2017 after news reports indicated he had misled senior White House officials about the substance of his conversations with Russian officials during the transition period. He stands accused of lying to the FBI about the nature of those interactions, though he has suggested that investigators tricked him into making false statements.

In March of 2017, Thompson filed a public financial disclosure report after joining the vice president’s office. Prosecutors in the Erickson case note that her then fiancé, Gillian, had wired $100,000 to Erickson on February 28, 2017. That was just days before her paperwork was submitted, but neither Erickson’s nor Butina’s role in the presidential campaign had yet been reported.

A subsequent financial disclosure would have been due in May 2018, according to a source in the vice president’s office, but by then, Thompson was at the State Department.

In the interim, Erickson became the subject of national headlines when reports surfaced that he had made overtures to the Trump campaign offering to establish a backchannel to the Kremlin. Erickson was engaged in a romantic relationship with Maria Butina, who has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an unregistered Russian agent.

Throughout the 2016 campaign, prosecutors argued, Butina, a 30-year-old graduate student, worked to forge relationships with influential Republican political organizations, including the National Rifle Association, in an attempt to create backchannels to the Russian government. She worked both to organize trips for influential GOP operatives to visit Moscow and to get access to government officials for Russian delegations visiting the U.S.

A former GOP operative and fundraiser, Erickson was indicted in February on fraud charges in February and pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege that he swindled upwards of $2 million from investors for three business propositions, including one to invest in a chain of elder care facilities, and did not spend the money on any of them.

Though the charges were not directly related to Erickson’s relationship with Butina, the FBI alleged that “some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina."""

"Protesters vent anger at NY mayor, U.S. DOJ after chokehold decision",https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Allen', 'Min Read']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-garner/protesters-vent-anger-at-ny-mayor-us-doj-after-chokehold-decision-idUSKCN1UC2HX,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several hundred people took to the streets of New York on Wednesday to protest the U.S. Department of Justice’s decision not to bring charges against a New York City policeman in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man in 2014.

The demonstrators also vented their anger at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who has declined to fire Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the five years since Eric Garner died in police custody.

De Blasio told reporters on Wednesday that he was surprised to learn that the Justice Department would not bring charges and that he regretted delaying the start of disciplinary proceedings against Pantaleo for years at the DOJ’s request.

“You can do something about it,” said Takiema McKiver, 30, from Queens, responding to de Blasio’s comments. “You can’t just say that you can’t do something about police brutality. You’re the mayor; this is your city.”

De Blasio, who is running for his party’s presidential nomination, said New York City’s police commissioner would decide by August whether to punish or fire Pantaleo.

The officer has been on desk duty since he was seen in bystanders’ cellphone videos putting Garner in a prohibited chokehold and wrestling him to the ground on July 17, 2014. Garner is heard in the videos of the incident saying “I can’t breathe!” at least 11 times shortly before he died.

The death of Garner, 43, who was initially approached by police because they suspected him of illegally selling untaxed cigarettes, touched off a nationwide furor and helped give rise to the Black Lives Matter movement.

In announcing that it would not bring charges against Pantaleo, Justice Department officials said they could not conclusively determine whether Pantaleo willfully committed misconduct, which must be established to prove that he violated Garner’s civil rights.

“We asked for (Pantaleo) to be prosecuted. We asked him to be fired. We asked for it. Now we’re demanding he gets fired,” Garner’s daughter, Emerald, said at the demonstration.

Protesters chanted “Hey hey, ho ho! Pantaleo has got to go!” and “I can’t breathe!” as they were addressed by civic rights activists. The crowd later marched to NYPD headquarters in Lower Manhattan, where they laid down cardboard coffins.

Filmmaker Spike Lee mingled in the throng, accompanied by a camera operator, but declined to speak to a Reuters reporter.

Pantaleo was the latest example of an American law enforcement officer to avoid criminal liability in killings of unarmed black men."
Treasury Department bureaucrats risk jumpstarting Islamic State resurgence,https://thehill.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/453525-treasury-department-bureaucrats-risk-jumpstarting-islamic-state,"It has now been 21 months since Kurdish forces, backed by U.S. Special Forces and U.S. air support, moved into Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State. Earlier this month, I spoke at a Rojava Centre for Strategic Studies conference in Amudeh, Syria, exploring the Islamic State’s enablers, after which I had the opportunity to visit Raqqa as the local administration’s guest.

To enter Raqqa is to be overwhelmed by destruction. Thousands of former residents remain in tents at a camp alongside the road outside Ayn Issa. Most would like to return to their homes just 45 minutes’ drive away, but Raqqa remains largely destroyed. Driving into town requires passing the shells of apartment buildings stretching miles. Local authorities have given a face lift to Naim Square, where the Islamic State executed prisoners and mounted their heads, and rebranded it Freedom Square. The buildings facing the square, however, remain bombed out.

There are signs of life in the center of town: wedding dresses, children’s toys, and sweets sold in shops surrounded by rubble. Children played soccer in a stadium once used as the Islamic State’s chief prison. Graffiti on the stadium wall cursed the Islamic State and expressed love for Taylor Swift Taylor Alison SwiftPoll: Michelle Obama most admired woman in the world Treasury Department bureaucrats risk jumpstarting Islamic State resurgence Warren signs Taylor Swift's Equality Act petition MORE. Unexploded ordnance slows recovery, as workers clear rubble by hand, and tempers are short. The biggest obstacle to Raqqa’s recovery, however, lies in Washington rather than Syria: The U.S. Treasury Department has been sitting on the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) waiver for the Syrian Democratic Council for four years.

Opposition groups in Syria can be an alphabet soup of acronyms but, in short, the Syrian Democratic Council is the umbrella organization for pro-American Syrian Kurdish militias like the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the all-female Women’s Protection Units (YPJ), and the Syrian Democratic Forces.

When I first visited northeastern Syria in January 2014, U.S. diplomats had refused to talk to the Syrian Kurdish opposition out of deference to Turkey. The United States reconsidered its position due to both Kurds’ effectiveness against the Islamic State and Turkey’s double-dealing on terrorism. The United States began talking to the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), the political wing of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in December 2015, and almost immediately, the SDC applied for a U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) waiver so that they could hire American companies to participate in reconstruction and so that they could spend their own money in the United States. The SDC does not ask for handouts: one of the biggest differences between my most recent trip and my first is that the oil derricks between Qamishli and the Tigris River are now operating but absent a waiver, the SDC cannot legally spend money in the United States or elsewhere.

It is unclear whether inertia or a misguided strategy motivates OFAC to sit for years on the pending SDC waiver: The group is pro-Western and cooperates closely with Washington. The Treasury Department previously granted the Syrian National Council, the political arm of the Free Syrian Army, a waiver even though extremists and terrorists have infiltrated the Free Syrian Army. In contrast, U.S. military members in Syria trust the SDF more than local partners in Iraq or Afghanistan; there has not been a single instance of SDF men or women turning on American mentors.

The Treasury Department’s inaction not only handicaps diplomacy but also undercuts U.S. strategy.

Isolating Syrian President Bashar al-Assad remains a core U.S. interest. The Kurds dislike Assad: He voided citizenship papers Kurds need for school and employment, and imprisoned Kurdish activists. However, given Turkey’s support for Islamist radicals and its anti-Kurdish ethnic cleaning in areas of Syria the Turkish army occupies, Syrian Kurds fear Turkey more. Simply put, Treasury’s failure is pushing pro-American Kurds back toward Assad.

Numerous diplomats castigate the Iraqi government for its failure to reconstruct Mosul after it was damaged first by Islamic State conquest and then its liberation. Diplomats fear frustration could fuel Islamic State resurgence. The same is now true with Raqqa, where frustration is palpable. The only difference is that if Raqqa erupts, the blame will not be on a foreign government, but on the glacial pace of the U.S. government’s own bureaucracy.

Senior Trump administration officials confirmed Tuesday that the vast majority of Bureau of Land Management headquarters staffers must leave Washington by the end of next year under the Interior Department’s reorganization plan.

In a 17-page letter to lawmakers, Joe Balash, Interior’s assistant secretary for land and minerals, detailed how the administration plans to move 84 percent of the agency’s headquarters staff west of the Rockies by the end of 2020. The relocation, which The Washington Post first outlined Monday, will move all but 60 Washington-based staffers, a sweeping change to the agency that manages more than 10 percent of America’s land.

“This implementation plan will delegate more responsibility and authority down to the field, optimize services available to the American people, is demonstrably cost-effective, and will provide an increased presence closer to the resources the BLM staff manages,” Balash wrote to Sen. Tom Udall (N.M.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and environment.

A total of 27 leadership jobs will be relocated to Grand Junction, Colo., about 60 miles south of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s childhood home of Rifle, “as part of an initiative to establish the Headquarters,” Balash said. Colorado will receive more reassigned positions than any state — 85.

Seventy-four of the reassigned employees will report to BLM state directors instead of headquarters staff, he said, and staffers will be reassigned to states including Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.

Although Balash provided an estimated cost benefit of the reassignments — at least $50 million over 20 years — there was no analysis of the price of the actual move beyond $5.6 million for the first 27 employees who volunteer.

[Interior to move most of Bureau of Land Management’s D.C. staff out west as part of larger reorganization push]

Hours before Interior formally notified Capitol Hill of the move, Balash and Casey Hammond, the principal deputy assistant secretary of land and minerals management — who has been running the bureau on an acting basis since May — provided employees with details about the reorganization.

According to a participant in the employee briefing at the agency’s office in Southeast Washington, the tension in the room was palpable as employees questioned what the move would mean for those with two-career families or other obligations that might tie them to Washington. The staffer spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation.

When Hammond declared “There is no need to panic,” the participant said, several people in the audience laughed.

“This announcement is deeply unsettling, and has created a lot of uncertainty for us,” the participant said. “The best part of my job is my co-workers, and they are working to tear us apart for purely political reasons. I’m sick to my stomach.”

Hammond and Balash emphasized the relocation would save the government money because the cost of living was cheaper out West and the lease on the BLM’s main building, in Southeast Washington, was set to expire. But one employee suggested in the meeting that staffers’ pay will also decline once they relocate and urged colleagues to write their member of Congress, prompting applause.

Other employees embraced the reorganization, according to the meeting participant, asking how early they can leave Washington.

Balash also said that officials are looking to relocate staffers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, but the department has not done as comprehensive an analysis of those moves.

Several lawmakers have already embraced the reorganization plan, including Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Republican Reps. Rob Bishop (Utah) and Scott R. Tipton (Colo.). In a statement Monday, Bishop said that he would work with Bernhardt to place the staffers moving to Utah in the right place.

“The BLM personnel will be moved where they will have a greater impact on, and input by, the people who live in the regions where their influence is greatest,” Bishop said. “Not by bureaucrats from thousands of miles away.”

But critics of the plan such as Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), who chairs the House Subcommittee on Interior, environment, and related agencies, said in a statement that it made no sense for the administration to unilaterally reorganize an agency when the president has yet to nominate a permanent director for the BLM after more than 2 1/2 years in office.

“After my discussion with Secretary Bernhardt this morning, serious questions remain: What are the benefits to the Interior Department and to the American public? What problem will this move solve? Why is BLM singled out for this move? How much will the move cost?” McCollum asked.

“Assuming the goal is to improve efficiency, streamline operations, and improve lines of communication,"" McCollum added, ""perhaps Mr. Bernhardt should prioritize securing a permanent director — which BLM has lacked for the duration of this administration — before the Department spends millions of taxpayer dollars playing musical chairs with employees’ lives.”

Kate Kelly, public lands director for the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, questioned in an email why the administration would reassign nearly all of the bureau’s D.C. staff when 95 percent of them already work out in the field.

“The true impact of this move is to make the agency and its leadership invisible in a city where — like it or not — the decisions about budgets and policies are made,” she said. “The constant shuffling, shrinking and disassembling of BLM’s workforce will have long-term implications for the health of the agency.”

In a telephone conference with reporters later in the afternoon, led by Balash and Susan Combs, the assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, another reason for the move was offered: eliminating travel costs to the District for westerners who meet with BLM officials.

“The American public interested in BLM can talk to a decision-maker without having to travel to the east coast,” Combs said. “I think it’s a disservice to the American public if we’re not there to give an answer on the spot.”

But the officials offered no analysis of how often westerners travel to Washington to meet with decision-makers, and at what cost. Similarly, they offered no cost analysis of flights by decision-makers to the West.

It is unclear what sort of congressional authorization is required to carry out the administration’s plan. When a BLM staffer raised the issue on Tuesday, Hammond replied that the department had already received the $5 million needed to carry out the initial stage of the move in May.

According to a Senate Appropriations aide, longstanding spending law guidelines — including ones included in Interior’s current funding bill — require the department “to notify and seek congressional approval of reorganization efforts . . . for certain actions, and do apply to this relocation effort."""
EPA hails Trump's work on reducing air pollution,https://thehill.com,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453601-epa-hails-trumps-work-on-reducing-air-pollution,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pointed to a new study released Wednesday to emphasize what it characterized as the Trump administration’s achievements in decreasing air pollution.

The report showed that emissions from all six measured criteria air pollutants decreased between 2016 and 2018, the years Trump has been in office.

It hailed this as part of decades-long trend of falling pollution rates that began in 1970, when the Clean Air Act was implemented. The results of the annual national air quality report showed that the emissions of six key pollutants dropped by 74 percent in that time period. The pollutants measured do not include carbon dioxide or methane, known greenhouse gases.

A statement from EPA added that the U.S. economy has grown 275 percent since 1970.

The arguments echo President Trump Donald John TrumpAmash responds to 'Send her back' chants at Trump rally: 'This is how history's worst episodes begin' McConnell: Trump 'on to something' with attacks on Dem congresswomen Trump blasts 'corrupt' Puerto Rico's leaders amid political crisis MORE’s remarks last week from the White House that drew criticism from environmental groups for taking credit for long-term improvements in air quality that had little to do with his own administration’s actions.

“They are taking credit for long term improvements in air quality that are results of regulations we’ve had in place for many years,” said Gretchen Goldman, research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The way they frame it is we’ve mostly seen improvements of air toxics emissions, but at the same time they are doing that, they are changing policies that will actually make it worsen air toxics emissions.”

Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Paris climate deal since entering the White House.

The administration in the last year also replaced former President Obama’s Clean Power Plan for regulating emissions from power plants and revoked the “once in, always in policy,” which loosened regulatory compliance standards for certain sources of air pollution previously considered “major.”

“Despite EPA’s press release spin, reductions in air pollution during the Trump administration have stalled, while the Department of Energy estimates C02 emissions alone actually spiked in 2018, something Administrator Wheeler and his agency conveniently failed to mention, of course,” said Alex Formuzis, a spokesperson for the Environmental Working Group.

Critics say the damage from Trump’s policies are unlikely to be measured for some time.

“This is a long-term thing, you don’t see improvements and declines with a quick turn around, the way the process is, it’s a science based policy, often when you change a policy it’s years till you see the outcome, Goldman said.

Goldman pointed to the Obama administration’s 2015 ozone rule. Industry compliance results for that rule weren’t measured and released until this year.

“It’s going to be a while until we see the public impact of that but it’s 100 percent coming,” she said.

“America leads the world in keeping our air clean and our economy growing,” Barrasso, chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee, said in a statement.

“Unlike the previous administration who drove an environmental policy that suffocated rural America, this report reaffirms the environmental success of President Trump which includes clean air, clean water and cleaning up toxic land sites at a record pace across our country,” Braun said."
State Department bureaucratic bloat undercuts Syria and Islamic State strategies,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/state-department-bureaucratic-bloat-undercuts-syria-and-islamic-state-strategies,"AMUDEH, Syria — On the day I left Syria, Special Envoy James Jeffrey visited to try to sell local leaders on his proposal for a buffer zone between Syrian Kurds and Turkey. America’s Kurdish allies listened politely, but confused. For the past 11 months, Jeffrey has been the “special representative for Syria Engagement and special envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.” The Syrian Defense Forces were the tip of the spear to defeat ISIS and were largely successful. Their civilian counterpart, the Syrian Democratic Council, runs northeastern Syria generally with tolerance and efficiency on very little income. Schools operate, municipalities pick up garbage, and the region even boasts its own cellphone company.

To unravel that stability and security in a flawed attempt to appease Turkey is unwise. It is also not clear it is consensus U.S. policy.

Over the last several decades, special envoy positions have proliferated for the simple reason that the State Department bureaucracy can suffocate policy implementation. Under normal circumstances, the State Department is slow and unwieldy. The bureaucracy is byzantine and beset by petty turf fights that undercut cooperation to a common cause. Nor does every issue conform neatly to preexisting bureaucracy. The fight against ISIS, for example, initially involved Syria and Iraq (two different State Department desks), and coalition affairs mandated interactions with Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, among other countries.

Still, most State Department reform efforts single out the proliferation of special envoys that often impose a bureaucracy upon an existing bureaucracy. A 2001 Council on Foreign Relations’ Independent Task Force report , for example, called on the State Department to “Reduce appointment and use of special envoys.” A separate Brookings Institution report the same year also found negatives to outweigh positives regarding special envoys. “Such innovations may provide political cover against charges that the administration is ignoring a foreign policy issue critical to a vocal constituency,” Clinton administration National Security Council officials Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay wrote , “but they undercut the nation’s diplomatic establishment.”

Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson targeted the envoy positions in his anemic reform attempts, but his successor Mike Pompeo resurrected many positions. In September 2018, career Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne authored a Wilson Center report finding “the use of stand-alone special envoys or representatives should remain limited to a few roles of high importance and be well integrated into existing 'bureaus' and interagency structures. Otherwise, these ‘specials’ will likely add to the silos and bureaucratic infighting that have long complicated efforts to produce and implement a coherent foreign policy, and they can contribute to fragmented international policy.”

Back to Syria and Iraq: While Jeffrey is a special envoy, he is of equal rank to Joel Rayburn , deputy assistant secretary for Levant Affairs and special envoy for Syria. Add into the mix William Roebuck , deputy special envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and senior adviser to the special representative for Syria engagement who, grandiose title aside, acts as an informal ambassador often resident in northeastern Syria. Perhaps such special envoys were needed for the year plus in which Sen. Tim Kaine prevented a confirmation vote on the Trump administration’s pick to be assistant secretary of state for near Eastern affairs. But David Schenker assumed his post last month and so in theory should also oversee Levant policy.

It’s not just the State Department that is confused. Surveying senior Iraqi officials in Baghdad and Syrian Kurdish officials at a counter-ISIS conference in Amudeh, Syria, earlier this month, few officials had a clear notion of which American officials were in charge and whether the emphases of each interlocutor were personal or reflective of policy. In short, Iraqis and Syrian officials say some U.S. officials are pro-Turkish, others seem to emulate Lawrence of Arabia in their infatuation with Arab tribal politics, and others still are relatively seeking to make their voices heard.

The bottom line is Syria policy is broken, but the proliferation of diplomats taking charge only makes matters worse. Every additional envoy or diplomat working on Syria and Iraq gives Syrian and Iraqi officials a reason for confusion or an excuse to feign confusion. Five years ago, it may have made sense for the Obama administration to embrace a special envoy position to defeat the ISIS but, with that group no longer controlling territory, it makes far more sense to return to a more traditional State Department structure.

Certainly it is ironic that, for all the criticism that Trump made of President Barack Obama and Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry during his campaign, Trump's team appears intent on replicating their bureaucratic bloat at the expense of effective policy creation and execution.

As far-fetched as that seems, even those who question the legal reasoning behind the seven-month-old lawsuit are perplexed why the Department of Justice on July 12 filed an 11-page motion to intervene on a very narrow aspect of the high-profile case. And the government asked with just a week’s notice to argue its position at a key hearing scheduled Friday in federal court (the court has not yet ruled on the request).



It’s a testament to the nation’s frayed political nerves that a DOJ filing littered with arcane tax and legal jargon is interpreted by some as payback from Washington, D.C.



The DOJ motion argued the city couldn’t use lost tax and lease revenues as the basis of its antitrust claim, which isn’t a main argument..."
EPA worker rights under White House assault,https://thehill.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/453710-epa-worker-rights-under-white-house-assault,"Last week, the Trump administration executed another step in its plan to dismantle the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Step one was appointing agency leaders who don’t support EPA’s mission. Step two was throwing out rules designed to protect the public from pollution and from climate change. Now comes step three: stripping EPA employees of rights and unilaterally changing employment conditions that are essential to maintaining a functioning workplace.

While running for office in 2016, Donald Trump told Fox News that, if elected, he would dismantle EPA to the point where there would be only “little tidbits left.” Unless Congress steps in, this goal will soon be in sight.

On July 8 – the same day President Trump Donald John TrumpAmash responds to 'Send her back' chants at Trump rally: 'This is how history's worst episodes begin' McConnell: Trump 'on to something' with attacks on Dem congresswomen Trump blasts 'corrupt' Puerto Rico's leaders amid political crisis MORE gave a fantastical speech boasting of “incredible” environmental achievements – his administration announced it was throwing out years of past agreements between EPA management and our union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and imposing new workplace edicts on two-thirds of the workforce as AFGE represents nearly 8,000 EPA workers.

These new workplace rules, which were not negotiated with the union and not agreed to by employees, will have far-reaching consequences on employees and the work that they do.

For instance, the new directive nearly eliminates the option for most employees to work from alternative work locations closer to where they live. For an agency that is supposed to be committed to reducing carbon emissions, minimizing commutes for its own employees should be a high priority. Over the past decade, EPA has steadily increased the availability of telework to the point where many employees rely heavily on that option – not only to reduce commute times, but to balance childcare and other obligations. With that option yanked away, many employees will choose other employment alternatives – especially any that are closer to home.

Additionally, the unilateral directive denies workers due process by limiting workers’ access to grievance procedures and preventing union representatives from meeting with employees and managers to resolve disputes. Denying workers due process in this way creates an untenable work situation for employees.

In the Bay Area, this action initially and primarily hurts the staff-level attorneys who work at EPA’s Pacific Southwest Regional Office (EPA Region 9) in San Francisco and are members of AFGE Local 1236. They handle mission-critical cases that include cleaning up Superfund sites, pursuing clean air and clean water cases in court, prosecuting environmental crimes, cleaning up oil spills, enforcing hazardous waste and toxic substances laws, and much more – all to protect the American public and the environment from diverse and complex environmental burdens and disasters. And they have been doing this vital work despite severe staffing and budget cuts over the past several years.

Unfortunately, the administration’s attack on our workplace rights and protections isn’t isolated to EPA. At agency after agency – Education, Health and Human Services, Social Security, Veterans Affairs – political appointees are hijacking the collective bargaining process in an attempt to force through anti-worker provisions. Many of these proposals mirror those contained in three executive orders President Trump issued in May 2018 that were subsequently ruled illegal by a federal judge.

The administration’s rejection of labor rights is part of a broader effort to silence federal workers and gut workplace rights. It is precisely these benefits that make it possible for many of those employees to stay at the EPA, working toward a cleaner and safer environment for all of us.

If the administration succeeds in enforcing these anti-labor directives, EPA and other federal agencies will have an even harder time recruiting and retaining employees who perform critical services on behalf of our country. That is clearly the intent of the Trump administration, which sees federal employees as the enemy.

As employees leave the agency, most are never replaced, and access to clean air and clean water and safe places for our families to live and play will steadily dwindle. We all need to let our senators and congressional representatives know that we value the work of the EPA and other federal agencies and ask them to intervene before the damage that is being done to EPA and other agencies across the government becomes permanent.

U.S. Sanctions Senior Myanmar Generals Over Rohingya 'Ethnic Cleansing',https://www.npr.org,['Merrit Kennedy'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/17/742538509/u-s-sanctions-senior-myanmar-generals-over-rohingya-ethnic-cleansing,"U.S. Sanctions Senior Myanmar Generals Over Rohingya 'Ethnic Cleansing'

Enlarge this image toggle caption Lynn Bo Bo/AP Lynn Bo Bo/AP

The State Department said it has issued sanctions to four top military leaders in Myanmar over what it called ""gross human rights violations"" during the ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Rohingya Muslim minority.

Targets of the sanctions include the military's commander in chief Min Aung Hlaing, his deputy Soe Win, Brig. Gen. Than Oo and Brig. Gen. Aung Aung. The sanctions, which were announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday, mean the leaders and their immediate families are barred from entry into the United States.

""With this announcement, the United States is the first government to publicly take action with respect to the most senior leadership of the Burmese military,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""We designated these individuals based on credible information of these commanders' involvement in gross violations of human rights.""

A U.N. fact-finding mission said last year that the military ""took the lead in killing thousands of Rohingya civilians, as well as forced disappearances, mass gang rape and the burning of hundreds of villages."" It recommended that Min Aung Hlaing and other top leaders be tried for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

A spokesperson for the Myanmar military, Brig. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, told The New York Times that the new travel ban won't have much effect on the leaders.

""It doesn't matter that they banned travel to the United States for the generals,"" said the spokesperson. ""But it does insult the Myanmar military's dignity.""

Pompeo's statement said that Min Aung Hlaing ordered the release of his men convicted of killing a group of Rohingya men in Inn Din, which was the subject of a Reuters investigation that won the Pulitzer Prize. ""The Commander-in-Chief released these criminals after only months in prison, while the journalists who told the world about the killings in Inn Din were jailed for more than 500 days,"" Pompeo said. He called it an ""egregious example of the continued and severe lack of accountability for the military and its senior leadership.""

Fortify Rights, a human rights organization based in Southeast Asia, said the sanctions alone are ""not sufficient but a step toward more justice and accountability.""

""It is the military as an institution which needs to be targeted,"" Mark Farmaner, director of the advocacy group Burma Campaign UK, said in a tweet. ""The military will not change its behavior because a small number of its members have reduced holiday options."""
"Sanders, Omar call for Labor Department investigation of all US Amazon warehouses",https://www.cnet.com,['Ben Fox Rubin'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnet.com/news/sanders-omar-call-for-labor-department-investigation-of-all-amazon-warehouses/#ftag=CAD0610abe0f,"Ben Fox Rubin/CNET

A group of 13 members of Congress on Tuesday asked the Department of Labor to investigate all of Amazon's US warehouses, citing a long list of concerns about working conditions, labor violations, injuries and mistreatment.

The group is led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic candidate for president, and Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The members are all Democrats except Sanders, who's an independent, and include prominent party members including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard.

In a statement Tuesday, Sanders called on the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration to open an investigation immediately and ""prosecute those responsible to the fullest extent of the law.""

""People who work for a company owned by the wealthiest person in America should not have to risk their lives, health or well-being on the job,"" he said, referring to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. ""They must be treated with dignity and respect.""

Amazon shot back Tuesday, saying Sanders has an open invitation to visit its warehouses ""but to date has never stepped foot in one of our buildings."" The company said if Sanders had seen the facilities, he'd have learned that the company already implemented multiple layers of safety protocols at its warehouses. That work includes monthly employee surveys of safety, more than 1 million hours of safety training last year, and $55 million in safety improvement investments in the past year.

""The allegations outlined in this letter are not an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings,"" Amazon said, adding that people as young as 6 can tour the buildings to see for themselves.

Sanders rejected Amazon's suggestion, saying in a tweet Tuesday afternoon he preferred surprise inspections be conducted by the Labor Department.

""I am not interested in a photo op at an Amazon warehouse,"" Sanders' tweet said. ""I am calling for Labor Department inspectors to come in, unannounced, and do thorough investigations of the facilities where hundreds of workers have told me about horrendous conditions and abuse.""

The congressional request continues long-running criticisms of how Amazon operates its warehouses, with years of news reports detailing employees being overworked, closely monitored and forced to move faster. While Amazon has faced heavy criticism in the press and from several members of Congress, a comprehensive government report on its warehouse conditions hasn't happened.

Now playing: Watch this: For these women, working at Amazon while pregnant ends...

Sanders' criticisms follow his repeated attacks against Amazon last year, when he called on the company to raise its minimum wage. When it did in October, he congratulated it for making that change.

The congressional group sent a letter requesting an investigation during Prime Day, Amazon's annual summer sale. In its fifth year, Prime Day has started to garner plenty of negative attention, with protests going on across the US and Europe on Monday.

On Wednesday, a Department of Labor spokesperson said: ""OSHA has confirmed receipt of the letter. The agency is still reviewing the letter at this time.""

I stand in solidarity with the courageous Amazon workers engaging in a work stoppage against unconscionable working conditions in their warehouses. It is not too much to ask that a company owned by the wealthiest person in the world treat its workers with dignity and respect. https://t.co/GxagHx70pb — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) July 15, 2019

Amazon said Monday that Prime Day has ""become an opportunity for our critics, including unions, to raise awareness for their cause, in this case, increased membership dues."" The company has often mentioned that it raised its minimum wage to $15 last year and offers a comprehensive benefits package that includes paid education, parental leave and opportunities for promotion.

Amazon's roughly 300,000 US employees aren't represented by unions.

In Tuesday's letter to OSHA, the members of Congress outlined several workplace problems they want investigated, including a report from Mother Jones that highlighted hazardous warehouse floor conditions that can cause long-term injuries. The group said they've heard hundreds of stories directly from people who worked for Amazon that present extremely poor conditions for employees, including high temperatures, closely monitored productivity that causes workers to avoid bathroom breaks for fear of falling behind, mental health issues, and calls for a faster pace that ultimately lead to injuries.

One former worker, a Navy veteran, said, according to the letter: ""There was a point where I would find myself crying on my shift ... I really felt like I just didn't wanna be alive anymore.""

""This work environment creates a high risk of physical injuries, a risk increased by Amazon's intentional disregard for the health and safety of their employees,"" the letter said.

In addition to Omar, Sanders, Gabbard and Ocasio-Cortez, Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Deb Haaland, Ayanna Pressley, Barbara Lee, Jan Schakowsky, Ro Khanna, Al Green, Debbie Dingell and Andy Levin joined the call for an investigation and signed the letter to OSHA.

You can tell this with Trump. He’s still somehow campaigning against Obama.” McCarthy was the EPA’s administrator from 2013 to 2017, and now teaches at the Harvard School of Public Health.

"Veterans Affairs abandoned 200,000+ health care applications this year",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/veterans-affairs-abandoned-200-000-health-care-applications-this-year/VR5zYSyyBn0LnTndnE2x1L/,"An arm of the Veterans Affairs Department in Atlanta eliminated 208,272 applications from across the country for health care early this year amid efforts to shrink a massive backlog of requests, saying they were missing signatures or information about military service and income, according to records reviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Veterans groups say the VA should have done more to communicate with the veterans before closing their applications, some of which date back to 1998. Troops face additional challenges in applying for VA health care, they said, as they grapple with reentry into civilian life, change addresses following overseas deployments and suffer from combat stress.

In the middle of the controversy is the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, the Atlanta office that oversees the process by which veterans seek access to the VA medical system. It and its parent agency have come under intense scrutiny in recent years for mismanagement and delays in providing medical care, presenting a thorny challenge for the administration of President Donald Trump, who focused on veterans’ care during his presidential campaign.

As of April, 8.8 million veterans were enrolled in the VA’s health care system, the agency’s records show. The VA said it enrolled 395,417 people in its health care system and rejected 98,897 in the fiscal year ending in September. Its backlog of pending applications totaled 317,157 in April, down from a high of 886,045 last year, according to records the VA sent the AJC.

That current backlog is still “way too high,” said Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based advocacy group. He suggested additional collaboration between the VA and veteran service groups could shrink it more.

“Something is not quite working right if we are not getting that number lower than it is,” he said. “We need to be working together to get that number down.”

Butler joined Adrian Atizado, deputy national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity based in Kentucky, in criticizing the VA’s efforts to reach the veterans before rejecting and closing their 208,272 applications.

The VA sent out one rejection letter to each of those applicants in 2016. In 2017, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers — including Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson — urged the VA to send the applicants an additional letter clarifying what missing information they needed to turn in. The lawmakers were responding to allegations that a coding error caused the VA to send veterans incorrect letters about what they still needed to submit.

The VA said it opted against sending an additional letter after its Office of Inspector General determined there was no such error and that the letters it sent in 2016 were appropriate and complied with federal law.

Isakson, who leads the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, was unavailable for an interview, according to an aide. But his spokeswoman said the VA took Isakson’s recommendation to have the inspector general review the issue and then briefed the senator’s committee about its decision to close the applications.

Atizado called the VA’s decision to send just one letter to the applicants in 2016 before closing their cases this year “quite unfortunate.”

“When we hear about the VA not taking a more thoughtful approach to a situation like this — when they only send one letter because they have an incomplete application — I think we all should be expecting our government and this administration to do better by our veterans,” he said.

The VA said veterans may reapply for health care. The agency said it is now striving to contact people about incomplete applications up to six times each with phone calls and letters. Its Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, meanwhile, has added 115 employees since July of 2016.

The 208,272 eliminated cases didn’t receive such treatment, though. That also has drawn renewed criticism from Scott Davis, a VA employee and whistleblower who testified before Congress in 2014 about problems at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, located off Clairmont Road.

“This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits,” Davis wrote in an article for the Washington Examiner in May.

Defending its decision, the VA pointed to a federal law that says applications that remain incomplete for a year cannot be approved.

“In accordance with federal law, VA closed 208,272 incomplete health care enrollment applications between January and February,” the VA said in a prepared statement. “It would have been illegal for VA to keep the applications open.”

Davis disputed that, saying the law doesn’t say anything about closing applications. In an interview, he accused the VA of “purging applications under a law that does not give them the authority to do so.”

Asked how many of the 208,272 applications the agency closed were from former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients and combat veterans, the VA told the AJC that the newspaper would have to file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for that information. The AJC did that last month and its request is still pending.

Lindsey Graham reveals three areas of 'deep dive' after DOJ inspector general report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-reveals-three-areas-of-deep-dive-after-doj-inspector-general-report,"Lindsey Graham laid out three areas he wants to explore as part of his ""deep dive"" inquiry into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after the conclusion of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

During an interview Wednesday evening, Fox News host Sean Hannity asked the South Carolina Republican senator where he plans to go with his investigation. Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said there are questions he wants to ask former FBI Director James Comey and his deputy Andrew McCabe.

""I'd want to ask Comey, what did you tell the president in January of 2017, 'Here is the dossier, I can’t verify it, but I want you know about it,'"" Graham said. ""And he used the same document and told the court that it was reliable on four different occasions. I want to know when McCabe reaffirmed again that without the dossier that there would be no warrant.""

He was referring to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants filed by the FBI to surveil onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Four FISA warrant applications and renewals were filed from October 2016 through June 2017 against Page. Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel of the Russia investigation in May 2017, after President Trump fired Comey.

The applications relied heavily on the unverified dossier about Trump's ties to Russia compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele and Fusion GPS shopped the research around to various government figures, including one skeptical State Department official, as well as the media in the run-up to the 2016 election.

McCabe has accused Republicans of mischaracterizing his testimony about the dossier.

Graham said he also wants to know what exactly former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopolous told the FBI.

""I want to find out, did Papadopoulos tell them upfront that, you know, if I was working with the Russians that would be a crime. I would never do that,"" Graham said. ""I want to know a bunch of things things.""

Papadopolous pleaded guilty October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in federal prison late last year and is now on supervised release."
State Department looking at redirecting Central American aid to Guaido,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/state-department-northern-triangle-funding-guaido/index.html,"(CNN) A State Department spokesperson confirmed to CNN Wednesday that the State Department is looking to redirect some funding originally designated for the Northern Triangle -- Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- to embattled Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido.

""Working with Congress, we are exploring reprogramming some of the funding towards promoting democracy in Venezuela, including supporting the interim Guaido government and National Assembly,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

The United States and dozens of other nations have backed Guaido in his bid to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. However, almost six months after the US recognized the opposition leader, Maduro remains in power.

""Our programming, existing and planned, is targeted to address the Venezuela crisis. We are investing in good governance, human rights, technical assistance for the Guaido government, independent media, and civil society,"" they said. ""The principle objective of our funding for Venezuela aligns with our principle policy objective: to restore democracy to Venezuela.""

The spokesperson said that none of the funding being reprogrammed is humanitarian assistance; it all falls under development assistance. They noted that the State Department ""regularly adjusts funding as priorities evolve"" and that it is ""technical process tied to our strategic planning so that we spend taxpayer dollars responsibly and in line with Administration priorities.""

Trump’s New Top Labor Official Is Expected to Advance an Anti-Labor Agenda,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Noam Scheiber', 'Glenn Thrush']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/business/economy/patrick-pizzella-labor-department.html,"Congressional Republicans, members of their staffs and conservative activists regularly flew first class to Saipan, an island just north of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. They slept at the beachfront Hyatt Regency, and dined on fresh Japanese cuisine.

US Treasury has 'serious concerns' Libra could be used for terrorism,https://www.engadget.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/15/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-us-treasury-department-concerns/,"According to Mnuchin, the US has been at the forefront of regulating entities that provide cryptocurrencies. It has also seen cryptocurrencies exploited to support illicit activities including cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, human trafficking and more. Still, Mnuchin said the US ""welcomes responsible innovation, including new technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system and expand access to financial services.""

""With respect to Facebook's Libra and other developments in cryptocurrencies, our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse,"" Mnuchin said. He noted that Facebook (and any other cryptocurrency providers) will have to meet the same safeguards as traditional financial institutions, including those put in place by the Anti-Money Laundering Council, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Bank Secrecy Act.

That should come as no surprise to Facebook. While it's likely prepared to meet those standards, it will have to navigate pushback like this from the Treasury Department and the President himself, who claims cryptocurrencies are ""highly volatile and based on thin air."" Some lawmakers have called for Facebook to halt Libra's development, and others want to block all big tech companies from providing cryptocurrencies. Facebook is scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing tomorrow, and it has said it won't launch Libra until all of the regulatory issues are addressed."
EPA’s New ACE Rule: A Win for Common Sense,https://www.realclearenergy.org,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2019/07/17/epas_new_ace_rule_a_win_for_common_sense_110459.html,"Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule to reduce carbon emissions from the nation’s fleet of coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule is replacing the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan.

The new rule is legal and sensible, adjectives that do not describe the Clean Power Plan. Many people might have forgotten that the Clean Power Plan was so bad that 27 states opposed it, and the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the rule (the stay is still in effect). The Clean Power Plan would have been expensive and would have given EPA too much control over each state’s electricity supply.

The reaction from opponents of the ACE rule has been predictable. Among other things, they say the new rule will not reduce carbon dioxide emissions as much as the old rule. That might seem like an important point, but it deliberately fails to tell the full story.

According to EPA’s analysis, the Clean Power Plan would have reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 50 million tons in 2025, and the ACE rule will achieve reductions of as much as 30 million tons. However, it’s really not much of a difference at all. Global anthropogenic GHG emissions total about 49 billion metric tons, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Therefore, the two rules would reduce global GHG emissions by either 0.10 percent (Clean Power Plan) or 0.06 percent (ACE rule). The difference between these two is indistinguishable from a climate change standpoint.

In addition, the rest of the world continues to use coal to support economic growth. Last year, coal demand in China was six times greater than U.S. coal demand, according to the International Energy Agency. Even “green” Europe used more coal than the U.S. As a result, from 2017 to 2018, worldwide GHG emissions increased by 560 million tons, an amount ten times greater than the reductions that would have been achieved under the Clean Power Plan.

Our point is that arguing about the insignificant differences between the new rule and the old rule are not going to lead to a workable solution to climate change. Neither are campaigns to eliminate the U.S. coal fleet.

Now, Congress is stepping in",https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2019/07/16/fought-good-fight-revere-veteran-shocked-congress-cared-about-his-home-loan-rejection-over-legal-marijuana-job/kPnw9QCisvNtgvUshzwXeJ/story.html,"It was validation for the 35-year-old disabled Army veteran from Revere. He never imagined that anyone would care that the Veterans Administration had rejected his home loan application in January, just as his family was set to move, because the VA disapproved of his job managing a marijuana store.

The US House of Representatives passed your amendment, said the caller from Representative Katherine Clark’s office. Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.

But now, the House had shown it agreed that the veteran should have received his earned benefit. On Friday, it passed a measure banning the VA from considering veterans’ income from state-approved cannabis industries as a reason to deny them their benefit of a low-rate home loan guarantee with no money down.

“I’m blown away — I can’t believe it,” said the veteran, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his military relationship. “It’s cool because we fought the good fight and something really went the way it should go.”

In January, after the veteran’s house purchase fell through at the last moment because of the VA’s rejection, he contacted his congresswoman, Clark. She filed the amendment to ban the VA’s practice as part of the larger defense budget. Separately, she sent a letter, signed by 20 lawmakers, to the VA requesting more policy details in light of the veteran’s case. The letter noted that more than 211,000 people work in the legal cannabis trade nationwide, which generates $11 billion in sales per year.

“The cannabis industry is a growing part of our economy and no one, let alone our veterans, should be penalized for being part of it,” Clark said in a statement Friday after the House vote. “The passage of this amendment ensures that our service members receive the benefits they deserve while modernizing the policies of the VA.”

The VA did not respond to a request for comment, but previously said it would reply directly to the lawmakers.

Because the Senate had already passed its version of the defense budget, a joint committee will determine whether the measure will be included in the bill that lands on President Trump’s desk.

The Revere veteran’s experience highlights one of the many ways that veterans and others can get caught between federal marijuana prohibition and states that have legalized pot.

Some veterans have reported a loss of benefits or being labeled unemployable as a result of consuming marijuana or working in the legal marijuana industry. Many veterans who find medical relief from pot say they’re financially overburdened and medically underserved because the VA doesn’t discuss or cover the drug as it does with other medications, including opioids.

The Revere veteran started working in the cannabis industry after finding that medical marijuana helped ease his chronic pain resulting from tearing both shoulders in a military training exercise. The cannabis also allowed him to get off opioids, he said, which made him “a shell of myself.”

Last year, he became the assistant manager of a marijuana retailer, now one of the state’s 22 pot shops. He loves helping patients find relief. The job gives him fulfillment that he’d missed since the Army.

In January, when he learned why the VA rejected his home loan, the veteran vented to his coworkers. One of his colleagues connected him to a mortgage company that helped him secure a reduced-rate home loan that he could afford.

The veteran and his family are no longer crammed into a tiny apartment or his parents’ home. Last week, they moved into their new house: a yellow four-bedroom in Dracut with a sunroom, white countertops, and a huge backyard perfect for his three children.

“It’s a dream come true,” the veteran said. “It’s a bigger, better, beautiful house. Maybe everything happens for a reason.”

"Controversial agency relocation slammed as attack on science by lawmakers, employees",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/agriculture-usda-blm-move-dc-climate-trump-protests-science-e8e534ec12fc/,"Employees and Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on the Trump administration’s plans to relocate hundreds of positions within two agencies outside of Washington, D.C. — a move some see as an effort to clamp down on science.

While the planned moves of both the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and parts of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) differ in their scope and rationale, resistance to both plans has shaped up similarly.

Critics are expressing concern over the motivations behind the efforts, which would lead to a mass-exodus of agency experts unwilling to relocate. This would spur a science brain drain in line with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on reports and research from within his own government.

“These decisions… are meant to displace seasoned scientists and regulators who have honorably served Republican and Democratic Administrations alike,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) in a statement to ThinkProgress responding to both the BLM and USDA relocation plans. Van Hollen sits on the Interior and Environment Appropriations subcommittee.

Responsible for administering public lands, BLM has become a battleground under the Trump administration as the White House has rolled back the boundaries of national monuments and advocated for fossil fuel drilling on U.S. acreage.

Now, the bureau is sparking controversy again. Administration officials confirmed this week that the overwhelming majority of BLM positions in D.C. are set for relocation. Around 84% of BLM staffers will be asked to relocate by the end of next year to areas outside of the nation’s capital, mostly to western states.

That announcement comes a month after Secretary Sonny Perdue mandated that over 500 USDA employees move en masse to Kansas City — located in both Missouri and Kansas — by Sept. 30, and gave them a deadline of July 15 to respond.

In the case of BLM, the Interior Department (DOI) plans to concentrate many of the positions in Grand Junction, Colorado, in addition to a range of western states stretching from Arizona to Alaska. Joe Balash, DOI assistant secretary for land and minerals, called the decision “demonstrably cost-effective” in a July 16 letter to Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), ranking member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and Environment.

The Trump administration argues that the move would both cut expenses and shift workers closer to the public lands they focus on, an argument supported by many Republicans including Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), who sits on the Natural Resources Committee.

But Democrats immediately raised objections. Udall said he had “serious reservations” about the move, as did his subcommittee counterpart in the House, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN). Democrats in both chambers of Congress indicated this week that they feel the plan is largely an effort to push out the D.C.-based senior staff who do not want to relocate.

Many of those employees are experts in their field, including scientists. “It’s a way for them to get rid of a lot of professional staff here in Washington,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) in a statement.

Many BLM employees are already located in other parts of the country and support for moving the bureau has been somewhat bipartisan over the years. But the latest push for relocation by the Trump administration coincides with a heated clash between USDA and its employees.

Given until this past Monday to make their decision, scores of USDA workers have opted out of moving. Of the employees with the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), more than half declined to relocate, according to Politico.

ERS workers in particular argued that the move would disrupt their work and efforts to publish important scientific reports. NIFA, meanwhile, is responsible for grant funding that touches climate, economic, and agricultural work that uses D.C. as a home base.

Many USDA employees have also argued that the move is politically motivated. ERS has recently released reports critical of Trump’s escalating trade war with China and its impact on farmers.

Experts also worry the move is a warning shot with implications for climate science. An investigation by Politico last month found that USDA has repeatedly sought to bury studies showing the danger of climate change. That report noted that some scientists see the ERS move as a foreshadowing of wider repercussions for research that doesn’t align with the administration’s broader “energy dominance” agenda.

USDA workers have fought through their union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), to dispute the move, but the department has rejected those efforts. Moreover, there is concern that other departments could face similar moves, like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, both of which are under DOI’s jurisdiction.

But Democrats asserted that they are looking into measures to combat the relocations, emphasizing that the move could be costly to taxpayers in addition to dramatically shifting the wealth of knowledge offered by current government staffers.

Lawmakers indicated they might seek to halt the relocation by blocking its funding in the upcoming appropriations bill that covers both the DOI and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A group of senators, including Van Hollen, have meanwhile introduced legislation to keep ERS and NIFA in the D.C. metro area, a move that was made before the BLM move was announced.

“This Administration is acting to undermine the subject-matter experts at many of our federal agencies,” said Van Hollen, who added that his office would “continue to use every tool available to push back against these actions.”

This article has been updated to note that only USDA would be impacted by the Senate legislation due to timing."
