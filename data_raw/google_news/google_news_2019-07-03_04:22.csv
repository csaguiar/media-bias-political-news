"Trump and R.N.C. Raised $105 Million in 2nd Quarter, a Sign He Will Have Far More Money Than in 2016",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Annie Karni', 'Maggie Haberman']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/politics/trump-fundraising.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee said on Tuesday they had raised $105 million in the second quarter of this year, outraising President Barack Obama in the equivalent period during his 2012 re-election campaign and signaling that Mr. Trump will have far more resources than he did in 2016.

The campaign and the committee said that they had a combined $100 million in cash on hand, and that they had raised more money online in the second quarter than in the first half of 2018. Mr. Trump and his committees raised $54 million, they said, and the Republican National Committee raised $51 million, money that can be plowed into television and digital advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts and other activities related to the 2020 election.

While Mr. Trump may be trailing the Democratic front-runners in the polls, his second-quarter numbers were a reminder that as an incumbent, he has advantages that were unavailable to him as an untraditional, first-time candidate in 2016.

Mr. Trump rose to the presidency with fewer staff members and less money than his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This time, he will have the Republican Party’s fund-raising mechanism, as well as the powers of the presidency, bolstering his raw personal appeal to his base, even as he tries to present himself as the outsider to the political establishment that he once was."
Judge blocks Trump policy keeping asylum seekers in detention pending cases,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-blocks-trump-policy-keeping-asylum-seekers-in-detention-pending-cases,"The Trump administration cannot categorically detain asylum seekers while they pursue their cases, a federal judge in Seattle ruled Tuesday, bringing a temporary halt to a policy announced by Attorney General Bill Barr in April.

U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman said those who are detained after crossing the border are entitled to bond hearings. Barr's order had instructed immigration judges to no longer offer the bond hearings for illegal immigrants caught crossing the border, although Barr preserved the option for the DOJ to effectively offer exceptions on a case-by-case basis.

Barr's determination did, however, affect even asylum seekers who had shown at an initial screening that they had a so-called ""credible fear"" of persecution or torture in their home countries, which often poses the most substantial hurdle in the asylum process. Applicants who successfully demonstrate a credible fear, according to federal immigration law, are those who have a ""significant"" chance of proving eligibility for asylum on that basis at their final asylum adjudications.

The Trump administration's move came in response to a growing humanitarian crisis at the border, as immigration courts that process asylum claims reported a backlog of more than 800,000 cases -- with many asylum applicants staying in the U.S. even after their claims have been denied.

NADLER SAYS BORDER SECURITY OFFICIALS SHOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR 'CHILD ABUSE'

According to a White House fact sheet, only 12 out of 100 migrants who claim asylum will have their claim granted on average, while around half of all migrants who make a ""credible fear"" claim ""and are subsequently placed in removal proceedings do not actually apply for asylum.""

The issue has been front-and-center in the 2020 presidential primary. On Tuesday, Cory Booker said that as part of a broader immigration plan, he would create ""a presumption of liberty for immigrants by reforming the bond process in immigration court.""

Pechman effectively agreed with Booker, saying that migrants who have entered the U.S. and been detained here are entitled to the Fifth Amendment's due-process protections, including ""a longstanding prohibition against indefinite civil detention with no opportunity to test its necessity.""

Immigrant rights advocates including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project sued to block the policy, which was due to take effect July 15.

""The court reaffirmed what has been settled for decades: that asylum-seekers who enter this country have a right to be free from arbitrary detention,"" Matt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, said in a written statement. ""Thousands of asylum-seekers will continue to be able to seek release on bond, as they seek protection from persecution and torture.""

WHAT OTHER RESTRICTIONS HAS THE TRUMP ADMIN PROPOSED ON ASYLUM SEEKERS?

For the past 50 years, the government has given asylum-seekers bond hearings before immigration judges where they can argue that they should be released because they are not flight risks and pose no threat to the public, the groups told the court. The process gives the asylum-seekers an opportunity to reunite with relatives in the U.S. and to find lawyers to handle their asylum claims, making them more likely to succeed.

The Trump administration's new policy would end that practice, keeping between 15,000 and 40,000 immigrants in custody for six months or more without requiring the government to show that their detentions are justified, in violation of their due process rights, the groups argued. Typically, close to half of asylum-seekers who are granted bond hearings are released from custody.

""The Court finds that Plaintiffs have established a constitutionally-protected interest in their liberty, a right to due process which includes a hearing before a neutral decisionmaker to assess the necessity of their detention, and a likelihood of success on the merits of that issue,"" the judge wrote.

In her order, Pechman said the government must provide a bond hearing to any immigrant who has demonstrated that they have a credible fear of persecution or torture if returned to their home country within seven days of a request. The asylum-seekers must be released if not granted a hearing within that time frame, she said.

Pechman also said the burden must be on the government at such hearings to show that keeping asylum-seekers in custody is necessary because they pose a flight risk or a danger to the public.

“The court forcefully rejected the Trump administration’s bid to arbitrarily jail asylum-seekers without a hearing,"" Michael Tan, senior staff attorney, ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement. ""Try as it may, the administration cannot circumvent the Constitution in its effort to deter and punish asylum-seekers applying for protection.”

The Trump administration last year rolled back an Obama-era expansion of potential asylum justifications, which extended protections to those alleging domestic abuse or gang-related attacks back home. White House officials said at the time that those categories were prone to abuse and expanded asylum law beyond its original intent.

In a memorandum issued in April, Trump gave his deputies 90 days to propose regulations so that all asylum applications are adjudicated within 180 days, except for those representing exceptional circumstances. The White House also moved to restrict asylum applicants from receiving work permits and proposed a fee for asylum applicants.

Donald Trump's July 4 spectacle just keeps getting more and more absurd,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/donald-trump-july-4/index.html,"(CNN) When President Donald Trump initially announced his plan to take over the usually non-partisan July 4 celebration in Washington way back in February, I wrote a piece with this headline "" The utter absurdity of Trump's July Fourth bash .""

Boy if I had only known!

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

""Big 4th of July in D.C. 'Salute to America.'"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning. ""The Pentagon & our great Military Leaders are thrilled to be doing this & showing to the American people, among other things, the strongest and most advanced Military anywhere in the World. Incredible Flyovers & biggest ever Fireworks!""

With the festivities now only days away, the full picture of what Trump has planned is coming into focus. And boy, oh boy, is it over the top. Among the plans:

* There will be tanks (M1 Abrams) other armored vehicles. ""You've got to be pretty careful with the tanks because the roads have a tendency not to like to carry heavy tanks so we have to put them in certain areas but we have the brand new Sherman tanks and we have the brand new Abrams tanks,"" Trump said on Monday. ( Sherman tanks haven't been produced since 195 7 .)

* There will be a flyover by the plane that is Air Force One. (It is only technically called ""Air Force One"" when the President is on board, which he won't be.) The Navy's ""Blue Angels"" will also be performing a flyover.

* There will a ground stop at Washington Reagan National Airport from 6:15 p.m. to 7:45 p.m. and then again from 9 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. to accommodate the flyovers and fireworks, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

* Trump will deliver a speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

The argument for this sort of over-the-top display with an exorbitant but indeterminate (as of yet) cost is simple: America is great. July 4 is when we celebrate our breaking free from British oppression. Why wouldn't we make a big to-do over it?

""Do you know the Fourth of July is a celebration of this country's independence, are you aware of that?"" White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway asked a reporter on Tuesday morning in response to his question about the planned celebration. When the reporter replied in the affirmative, Conway said this: ""You are? You know what happened July 4, 1776? OK. Because it doesn't sound like you're even talking about the patriotism that undergirds it.""

The dynamic, as Conway and the White House see it, is simple: If you are questioning why Trump is using July 4 to put on a show of military might, you simply don't either understand what it means to be an American or you don't love your country properly.

Which is, uh, well, problematic.

There's a reason that no president before Trump has turned July 4 into, well, what Trump is turning it into. And that reason isn't that they didn't love America enough or understand what makes this country great.

Instead, they understood that there is a very fine line between patriotism and nationalism. (FWIW: Patriotism is, according to Merriam Webster , a ""love for or devotion to one's country."" Nationalism is a ""sense of national consciousness exalting one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on promotion of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or supranational groups."")

Everyone draws that line differently. But I return to the fact that lots of past presidents -- Republicans and Democrats -- have had the chance to do something like Trump is planning on July 4 and taken a pass, choosing instead to keep the day entirely devoid of any sort of political statement. Was that unpatriotic? Or was it a recognition that putting tanks and other military equipment in and around Washington, DC sends the wrong sort of message to both our allies and our enemies?

The parading of military has long been the stuff of dictators and authoritarian regimes -- from Iran to North Korea to Russia. The leaders -- military and civilian -- in the United States have avoided that sort of thing because, well, the strongest guy in the gym doesn't need to go around telling everyone how strong he is. It's understood. Yes, we have massive military might. But we also believe in diplomacy, avoiding military conflicts at all costs and using force as only a last resort.

Trump doesn't seem to grasp that nuance. Or he grasps it and either doesn't care or doesn't agree.

Either way, the images coming out of Washington, DC, on Thursday night will send a very different message to the country and the world than ever before on July 4. Trump knows that -- and is thrilled about it. I'm not so sure the rest of us should be."
Trump to hold campaign rally on day of Mueller testimony,https://thehill.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/451461-trump-to-hold-north-carolina-rally-on-july-17,"President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP senators press Pompeo on Boeing satellite sales to China Trump touts low black unemployment, criminal justice reform on anniversary of Civil Rights Act Trump says Mueller 'must' stick to report's findings during testimony MORE plans to hold a campaign rally in North Carolina later this month as he seeks to buoy his reelection bid in a key battleground state.

The president is set to headline a rally in Greenville, N.C., on July 17, his reelection campaign announced Tuesday night. Trump won the Tarheel State by about 3.5 points in the 2016 election and is seeking to shore up support in the area.

The rally is scheduled for the same day as former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerTop Republican considered Mueller subpoena to box in Democrats Kamala Harris says her Justice Dept would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump for obstruction Dem committees win new powers to investigate Trump MORE's testimony on Capitol Hill. Mueller's highly anticipated appearance before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees follows a subpoena from House Democrats.

""President Trump looks forward to returning to North Carolina and sharing the successes of the Trump presidency,"" Michael Glassner, the Trump campaign's chief operating officer, said in a press release.

""North Carolina has one of the hottest economies in the nation, and that is directly attributable to the pro-growth, deregulatory policies of this administration. With one of the largest military populations in the nation, President Trump is eager to talk directly to the military men and women who have made this country the greatest on earth,"" he added.

The president has already come out swinging against the July 17 hearing and could use the rally to push back on Mueller's testimony, which the president has claimed is part of Democrats’ attempt for a “do-over” of the 2016 election.

The Mueller hearing is expected to focus on several aspects of the former special counsel's sprawling report released earlier this year, which detailed dozens of contacts between the Trump campaign and Kremlin-linked figures and 10 “episodes” of possibly obstructive behavior regarding ongoing probes into Russia's election meddling.

“Robert Mueller is being asked to testify yet again. He said he could only stick to the Report, & that is what he would and must do. After so much testimony & total transparency, this Witch Hunt must now end. No more Do Overs. No Collusion, No Obstruction. The Great Hoax is dead!” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.

Beyond a presidential battleground, North Carolina is also home to one of the most widely watched Senate races in 2020, as Sen.

Neither the Trump campaign nor Tillis’s office immediately responded to a request for comment from The Hill regarding whether Tillis would appear at the rally with Trump."
DOJ says citizenship question being dropped from 2020 Census: NY attorney general's office,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-says-citizenship-question-being-dropped-from-2020-census-ny-attorney-generals-office,"The New York attorney general’s office said Tuesday the Justice Department has decided to print the 2020 Census without the citizenship question sought by the Trump administration, ending a contentious legal dispute over an issue that could soon affect the makeup of Congress and the Electoral College.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that the question couldn't be added for now, but left open the possibility that additional arguments could change its mind. Civil rights groups argued that the Trump administration's reasons for including the question were merely pretextual efforts to discourage illegal immigrants from responding to the Census.

Population counts from the Census are used to apportion House seats among the 50 states, and a new electoral map based on the Census will be in effect for the 2024 presidential election. States receive votes in the Electoral College equal to the number of members in their congressional delegation, counting both House and Senate seats.

In a tweet on Monday, Daniel Jacobson, who worked in the White House Counsel’s Office under President Obama, said a trial attorney at the Justice Department told him that ""the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process"" without the citizenship question.

""We won,"" Jacobson wrote.

In a statement to Fox News, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tied the decision to the Supreme Court's ruling.

“I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census,"" Ross said. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

For his part, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., issued a less-than-celebratory statement calling for answers, even as he praised the decision to scrap the citizenship question.

""I am encouraged that Administration officials dropped President Trump’s unconstitutional plan to postpone the Census just because he lost the Supreme Court case,"" Cummings said. ""The Trump Administration put our country through more than a year of wasted time and squandered resources—all in the service of an illegal attempt to add a discriminatory question based on a pretext.""

Cummings continued: ""The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce must now turn over all of the documents our Committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, added, ""The exclusion of the citizenship question from the census is a victory for our democracy and for fair representation of all communities in this country.""

President Trump had tweeted that he had asked lawyers if the count can be delayed until the Supreme Court can reevaluate the matter, based on additional evidence supporting the administration's justifications for adding the citizenship question.

The Supreme Court, in its ruling last week, did not prohibit a citizenship question out of hand but dismissed the administration's provided rationale as insufficient.

However, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Fox News on Tuesday that the Supreme Court was unlikely to change its mind. Clarke's team successfully challenged the Trump administration on the use of the citizenship question in federal court in California, and was one of several groups to bring such lawsuits.

“The Supreme Court’s ruling left little opportunity for the administration to cure the defects with its decision to add a citizenship question and, most importantly, they were simply out of time given the impending deadline for printing forms,"" Clarke said.

Experts agreed that any delay could gum up the U.S. Census Bureau's finely calibrated timetable for the 10-year count. Monday was the deadline to start printing the 600 million documents that will be mailed to 130 million households for next April's census count.

CAL THOMAS: CENSORING THE CENSUS IS ABOUT POLITICS, NOT THE LAW

For months, the Trump administration had argued that the courts needed to decide quickly whether the citizenship question could be added to the 2020 census because of the looming deadline.

""I think it's very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal,"" Trump told reporters Monday. ""There's a big difference to me between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.""

Former President Barack Obama's administration didn't ask the citizenship question in the 2010 census. The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.

""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,"" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told Fox News.

From a logistical standpoint, any delay ""would be a nightmare,"" said John Thompson, who served as Census Bureau director during Obama's second term.

The bureau already has been in the process of signing almost 250 office leases across the U.S. and has hired 1,500 specialists partnering with community organizations to encourage people to participate in the census. More than 170,000 recruits already have filled out applications for the almost half-million positions being created for the count. The bureau has helped set up more than 1,500 committees nationwide working to get everyone to respond.

Furthermore, Congress would have to change the law for the count to be delayed because Title 13 of the U.S. Code mandates that it take place on April 1, 2020, Thompson said.

""I don't think there's any ambiguity, but I'm not a lawyer,"" Thompson said.

Fewer people are expected to fill out the questionnaires using paper than in years past because the bureau for the first time is relying on most respondents to use the Internet to answer questions. Still, printed postcards and letters are to be sent out next March reminding residents it's time to answer the questionnaire, and those who don't respond digitally are expected to be mailed paper questionnaires.

As recently as last week, the Trump administration's solicitor general wrote in court papers that the Census Bureau needed to finalize the questions by June. Any changes to the paper questionnaire after June would impair the bureau's ability to conduct the count in a timely manner, wrote the solicitor general, Noel Francisco.

More than two dozen Democrats in the U.S. Senate last week sent a letter urging Ross to drop any further pursuit of the citizenship question because it would delay the bureau's ability to conduct the count.

""The 2020 Census is less than half a year away, and any unnecessary delay in operations would impact the ability of the Census Bureau to count every person in our country,"" the letter read.

Bipartisan bill aims to stop child pornography trafficking on Defense Department's network,https://www.cnn.com,['Anna Laffrey'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/house-bill-defense-department-network-child-pornography/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill that would crack down on the use of the Department of Defense internet network for trafficking child pornography.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified over 5,000 individuals, several of whom are affiliated with the Defense Department, who subscribe to child pornography websites in an investigation called ""Project Flicker."" A subsequent inquiry by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service tagged hundreds of Defense Department affiliates as suspects in child pornography cases, according to a news release.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, and Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, would help the Defense Department stamp out use of its computers and network to access and share child pornography. The legislation would bolster training, improve technical capacities and require collaboration with both law enforcement and social service providers.

Spanberger, a former federal agent who worked on child exploitation and child pornography cases, called the abuse and exploitation of children through pornography ""horrific crimes.""

""The notion that the Department of Defense's network and Pentagon-issued computers may be used to view, create, or circulate such horrifying images is a shameful disgrace, and one we must fight head on,"" Spanberger said in a statement.

Exclusive: Democrats investigating whistleblower claims Pompeo's security picked up Chinese food and his dog,https://www.cnn.com,['Michelle Kosinski'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/pompeo-democrats-whistleblower-claims/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democrats on a key House congressional committee are investigating allegations from a whistleblower within the State Department about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his family's use of taxpayer-funded Diplomatic Security -- prompting agents to lament they are at times viewed as ""UberEats with guns"".

Congressional investigators, who asked for the committee not to be named as they carry out their inquiries, tell CNN that a State Department whistleblower has raised multiple issues over a period of months, about special agents being asked to carry out some questionable tasks for the Pompeo family.

In April, for example, an agent was asked to pick up Chinese food—without Pompeo in the car. The whistleblower said this led agents to complain that they are now serving as ""UberEats with guns,"" which has created a buzz within the department, according to multiple Democratic congressional aides who cited the whistleblower.

On another occasion, the whistleblower told aides, a Diplomatic Security special agent was given the job of picking up the Pompeo family dog from a groomer.

And CNN has seen a document given to the committee aides by the whistleblower showing that in January, Diplomatic Security was asked by a person in Pompeo's office to pick up his adult son from Union Station in Washington and bring him to the family home.

Lon Fairchild, the special agent in Charge of the Diplomatic Security Service, did not deny that the specific trips, such as the dog or the takeout food, were carried out by agents, but said in a statement, ""I was head of Secretary Pompeo's security detail since his first day on the job. At no point during my service did he or any member of his family ask me or any member of my team to act in any way that would be inconsistent with our professional obligation to protect the Secretary 24-hours a day, 7-days a week.""

A former senior Diplomatic Security official told CNN such tasks would not be appropriate—especially without the Secretary himself in the car at the time—unless some specific threat was identified that necessitated those trips. For example, they said when former Secretary of State Warren Christopher started in the job, he had hoped his agents would go get groceries for him, but had to be told that that's not what they do.

The Diplomatic Security Service is the law enforcement and security arm of the State Department tasked with protecting US diplomacy and diplomats worldwide and securing the integrity of US travel documents.

While protecting the security of the secretary of state is an important task for the service, there are concerns that agents may have been asked to carry out inappropriate tasks while assigned to Pompeo.

According to the Code of Federal Regulations, a federal employee ""shall not encourage, direct, coerce, or request a subordinate to use official time to perform activities other than those required in the performance of official duties or authorized in accordance with law or regulation.""

It is unclear if Pompeo requested the allegedly improper arrangements or whether they were made by someone on his staff without his knowledge.

But the whistleblower said there is a culture within Diplomatic Security to try and please the secretary and avoid upsetting him.

Former government ethics czar Walter Shaub told CNN ""sending subordinates to run personal errands for you is the very definition of misuse of position.""

Concerns about Susan Pompeo's security arrangements

Those personal-seeming tasks might be eye-catching, but congressional investigators say the State Department whistleblower told them the bigger issue causing concern among some agents is the question of why Pompeo's wife, Susan, has her own security detail, assigned to her in 2018, even while she is at home in the United States.

""There is a lot of confusion among agents over this, over why this is justified,"" one aide told CNN. ""Because according to this source they have seen nothing to indicate it is justified. In fact just the opposite. It's their understanding there was no finding of a high-enough level threat to merit this detail."" The whistleblower told these investigators that multiple special agents and supervisors within Diplomatic Security understood that a formal threat assessment had not been carried out, under longtime standard operating procedure, and that there is no specific threat against Susan Pompeo

Furthermore, the whistleblower told aides that shortly after Susan Pompeo received her personal security detail, in July 2018, agents were verbally told not to use her callsign—which is ""Shocker""—over the radios or publicly. The reason, according to one aide, citing the whistleblower, was that ""they knew it wasn't kosher.""

CNN has viewed an email from within the State Department confirming that she has an agent assigned to her, along with her callsign. The assistant secretary overseeing Diplomatic Security, Michael Evanoff, was included in the correspondence. The subject line says ""Shocker Detail.""

The former senior Diplomatic Security official who asked not to be identified said that such a full-time detail for a spouse is unusual and would only be assigned once a formal process was followed, assessing the need for such security. They said that the risk investigation would be performed by Diplomatic Security's Protective Intelligence and Investigations Division, in the Office of Threat and Intelligence Analysis. The former official told CNN this protocol has existed within Diplomatic Security for decades. And that in this person's lengthy tenure at Diplomatic Security, no spouse was ever given a security detail for more than a short, specific period of time.

One congressional aide told CNN that under the current administration, ""We have a lot of concerns over how things are being conducted within Diplomatic Security. There is a lack of transparency.""

A State Department spokesperson insisted that a threat assessment for Susan Pompeo was carried out by the Protective Intelligence and Investigations Division, but would not tell CNN when that happened.

""The provision of a protective detail to Mrs. Pompeo is expressly authorized by federal law. In this case, Diplomatic Security determined that the threat warranted the provision of such a protective detail to Mrs. Pompeo and began providing it as of July 28, 2018.""

In a statement, Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Michael Evanoff said, ""The Diplomatic Security Service has been protecting the spouse of the Secretary of State since the 1970s as the security threat dictates. We are a federal law enforcement agency, and this is an integral part of our core mission. Today the security threats against Secretary Pompeo and his family are unfortunately very real. The Diplomatic Security Service is proud to protect the Pompeo family from those who would harm the Secretary of State and the United States.""

Concerns about how Trump admin officials have used government resources

These questions about Pompeo are the latest in a slew of ethics allegations surrounding Trump administration Cabinet secretaries and their use of government resources.

Former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt left his position after a series of ethical questions about his security team; the former head of Health and Human Services, Tom Price , resigned after a scandal over his use of private planes; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was assailed for extravagant taxpayer-funded furniture purchases . Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke stepped down amid probes of his real estate dealings and conduct in office. And Former Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin left that job under an ethics cloud after a damning inspector general report criticized him for improperly accepting gifts and misrepresenting travel plans.

The aides said another whistleblower has come forward, who worked on the State Department's executive seventh floor where the secretary of state and top aides are based—telling them that employees there have been told not to put information concerning Susan Pompeo into official emails, so that it would not be preserved in required recordkeeping.

The role Susan Pompeo has played within the State Department and when the secretary travels is another area of concern to congressional aides, Diplomatic Security officers and multiple sources within the State Department and the CIA, which Pompeo previously led.

Several sources told CNN when Susan Pompeo accompanies the secretary on certain trips she has not only had a dedicated special agent to tend to her, but also a State Department staffer.

They said that ahead of a recent trip to Kansas, during which she accompanied her husband, she had at times chaired meetings on trip logistics at the State Department, which raised eyebrows, including of senior State officials.

One person familiar with the situation called it ""the worst kept secret at State,"" telling CNN, ""[Secretary Pompeo] takes her on ... trips, has separate meetings, requiring control officers, motor pool assets, security, and time. It was especially brazen during the shutdown when people were actually called into the embassy while furloughed. Just one more thing killing morale at the department."""

(Mike Segar/Reuters)

Senator Ted Cruz on Monday sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking for the creation of a process that would allow DHS to accept donations meant for migrants in U.S. custody.

Currently, no such process for collecting a distributing privately donated aid exists, which has caused generous citizens who have offered supplies to overcrowded migrant-detention facilities to be turned away.

Curz called on Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan to “establish and publicize a process for accepting donations from charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, and NGOs to aid individuals in CBP custody.”

DHS facilities are at “peak or beyond peak capacity,” Cruz said, because of the “crisis on our southern border.” Even with the $4.6 billion in emergency humanitarian aid approved by Congress to address the influx of migrants at the border, the Department can surely accept the “generosity of the American people” as well, he said.

A Texas state lawmaker first drew attention to the donation issue when he revealed that he’d tried to donate items to a Texas detention facility and was told by a Border Patrol representative, “We don’t accept donations.”

“It just befuddles me and I think it’s just heartbreaking to know that there’s so many people that want to help, and that help is being denied for no definable reasons that anybody’s been able to communicate,” Democratic state representative Terry Canales said."
U.S. states sue EPA for stricter asbestos rules,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Stempel', 'Min Read']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-asbestos-lawsuit/us-states-sue-epa-for-stricter-asbestos-rules-idUSKCN1TW3N6,"(Reuters) - Ten U.S. states and Washington, D.C. sued the Environmental Protection Agency to begin working on rules to tighten oversight of asbestos, and reduce the health risks that the substance poses to the public.

The attorneys general from California and Massachusetts, Xavier Becerra and Maura Healey, said on Monday they are leading the case, after the EPA denied the states’ petition that it collect more data on asbestos.

A spokesman for the EPA and its administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said the agency does not discuss pending litigation.

Asbestos is a carcinogen once used widely in fireproofing and insulation. Many companies stopped using it by the mid-1970s after it was linked to mesothelioma and other types of cancer.

Federal law still allows limited uses of asbestos, and Congress in 2016 amended the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to create a process for regulating the substance. Symptoms from asbestos exposure can take decades to surface.

“Asbestos is a known carcinogen that kills tens of thousands of people every year, yet the Trump administration is choosing to ignore the very serious health risks it poses,” Healey, a Democrat, said in a statement.

“There’s too much at stake to let the EPA ignore the danger that deadly asbestos poses to our communities, including to workers and children,” added Becerra, also a Democrat.

Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington state joined the lawsuit.

The EPA has said protecting people from asbestos exposure is a priority, including through an April rule giving it power to review asbestos products that were no longer on the market before they could be sold again in the United States.

In denying the states’ petition, the EPA determined that it was already aware of all current uses of asbestos, and had the essential information needed to assess the risks, according to the Federal Register.

But the states believe this denial was arbitrary and capricious, and violated the EPA’s obligations under the TSCA.

The lawsuit was filed late on Friday in the federal court in Oakland, California.

It is one of many lawsuits by Democratic-controlled or Democratic-leaning states challenging policies by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, including the rolling back of some environmental protections.

The case is California et al v Environmental Protection Agency et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-03807."
These USDA employees face a stark choice: Move to Kansas City or be fired,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/01/these-usda-employees-face-stark-choice-move-kansas-city-or-be-fired/,"

Columnist

The Agriculture Department is offering employees a rare choice: accept a forced transfer to a post 1,000 miles away or be fired.

The Trump administration’s plan to move two agencies from the District to the Kansas City area includes a document with two blank boxes on it, sent to employees on June 13. Check one, it instructs: Accept the transfer by July 15 or “be separated by adverse action procedures.”

That means getting fired, with an opportunity to appeal the dismissal through what could be an expensive process. Getting fired could also make it more difficult to find another federal job in an area where the government dominates.

Although a limited number of buyouts and early retirement opportunities will be available for what union officials expect to be fewer than 15 percent of those affected, and while some USDA employees might find work in government positions elsewhere in the D.C. area, the disruption to employees generally will be substantial.

“Adverse action” can have another meaning that goes beyond the affected employees and more broadly hits taxpayers, organizations and businesses. In addition to the big hassle for workers, relocations could have an adverse impact — a major brain drain — on the work of the two agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Union officials estimate a strong majority of employees will decline reassignment. If that happens, the work of the small but important agencies could be seriously upset. Even before Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Kansas City region as the new location, but after officials said the agencies would be moving out of the District, department employees quit in droves, my colleague Ben Guarino reported last month.

“The current and projected attrition will curtail research data products that encompass commodity estimates, agricultural sector forecasts, food and farm economic and statistical indicators for U.S. agriculture, conservation, and food policy and markets,” said Kevin Hunt, a 10-year USDA employee, speaking as acting vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 3403 representing research service staff.

What the government calls “directed reassignments” to a different city are “very rare in the federal government. That's not something that is a common practice,” said Joanna Friedman, a federal employment lawyer with the Federal Practice Group. “This is unprecedented.”

When the Pentagon closed bases around the country starting in 2005, it forced many defense civilians to make a similar choice. “We lost a lot of talent in geographic moves,” said Jeffrey Neal, formerly the top personnel officer at the Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. “A 20 percent take-up rate is typical.”

Not only are government transfers like the USDA’s uncommon, but the size makes this one especially unusual. Typically, they are much smaller, said Neal, now a senior vice president with the ICF consulting firm. “Years ago, people were more likely to move with their jobs,” he added. “With most people living in two-wage-earner households, it is far more difficult to just pack up and go.”

Many, perhaps most, affected USDA employees are considering a third option — quit and find new work.

“I will be unemployed beyond Sept. 30,” which is the deadline for the District-based workers to report to the new location, Hunt said, “unless I can find another job.”

Of the 547 employees the department wants to move for the two agencies combined, 253 are with the Economic Research Service, 77 percent of its 329-person workforce. An additional 294 are with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 93 percent of its 315-person staff. News of the move prompted a surge of support for the union. Employees at the National Institute voted 137-2 to join AFGE two weeks ago. Last month’s vote at the economic service was 138-4.

When Perdue announced the moves to the Kansas City area, he said, “We did not undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to enhance long-term sustainability and success of these agencies. The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

But the USDA estimate of nearly $300 million in savings over 15 years is way off, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economics Association. Instead, it would cost taxpayers between $83 and $182 million, the analysis found. The USDA underestimated the true cost in part because it did not account for “the lost value of research from staffers who resign or retire rather than move,” the association reported.

A group of Democratic senators, including all four from Maryland and Virginia, has introduced legislation to keep the headquarters of the two agencies within the D.C. area.

Andrew Crane-Droesch, an economist with the research service, said he is not moving and is now looking for another job in the D.C. area. “Definitely the choice we face is move to Kansas City or lose our jobs,” he said. “I’m certainly not happy. I love my job, but I can’t move to Kansas City, and moreover, I don’t want to even if I could.”

Like Crane-Droesch, these staffers “have families, they are part of a community and they’ve been dedicated public servants,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations. “They deserve better than having such a radical and consequential do-or-die decision, which is hardly a fair choice, thrown at them at the last minute.”

Whistleblower: Mike Pompeo Treats Security Detail Like “UberEats With Guns”,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Condé Nast', 'Bess Levin', 'Tina Nguyen', 'Vanity Fair', 'Nicole Sperling', 'Bess Levi', 'Eric Lutz']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/mike-pompeo-whistleblower,"If there’s one thing that unites Trump administration officials, it’s their well-documented belief that abusing government resources is a right, and that the purpose of their time in office is to enrich themselves as much as possible. That means a treasury secretary who sees no issue with using a government plane to get a better shot of the solar eclipse; a HUD secretary who dropped $31,000 on a new dining set for his office; a transportation secretary who promotes the family business that has paid her millions; a former VA chief who thought it was totally fine to take his wife on a taxpayer-funded European vacation; a former Health and Human Services secretary who spent $400,000 on private jets; and a former EPA administrator whose deluge of grift included directing his staff to “find reasons for [him] to travel to Oklahoma, so [he] could be in his home state for long weekends at taxpayers’ expense.” Oh, and a current secretary of state who allegedly views his security detail as his own personal concierge.

CNN reports that Democrats “on a key House congressional committee” are investigating claims from a State Department whistleblower who’s raised “multiple issues” over several months about Mike Pompeo and his family’s use of taxpayer-funded Diplomatic Security. Those issues allegedly include:

Tasking an agent with picking up Chinese food (without Pompeo in the car), leading to internal complaints by staff whose job it is to protect the secretary that they are effectively “UberEats with guns.”

Assigning a special agent to pick up the Pompeo family dog from the groomer.

Telling an agent to pick up Pomepo’s adult son from Union Station in D.C. and drop him off at home.

Lon Fairchild, the special agent in charge of the Diplomatic Security Service, did not deny that any of the personal errands—which former government ethics official Walter Shaub called “the very definition of misuse of position”—were carried about by his staff, but said in a statement, “I was head of Secretary Pompeo’s security detail since his first day on the job. At no point during my service did he or any member of his family ask me or any member of my team to act in any way that would be inconsistent with our professional obligation to protect the Secretary 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.” (A former senior official in the DSS told CNN the tasks would be inappropriate unless “some specific threat was identified that necessitated those trips.” Former secretary of state Warren Christopher had apparently wanted his agents to pick up groceries for him but was told that wasn’t their job, which one would think was obvious.)

In addition to the issue of Pompeo allegedly viewing protective agents as personal assistants, and a culture within Diplomatic Security “to try and please the secretary and avoid upsetting him,” there are reportedly also questions among agents as to why Pompeo’s wife, Susan, was assigned her own personal detail beginning in 2018, including when she is home in the United States:"

Ground Truthing USDA’s June Acreage Report,https://www.fb.org,"['Credit', 'U.S. Department Of Agriculture']",,,,https://www.fb.org/market-intel/ground-truthing-usdas-june-acreage-report,"The 2019 growing season will go down as one of the most challenging planting seasons on record due to spring flooding and persistent rainfall across the Midwest. Planting progress for corn and soybeans was historically delayed, i.e., Crop Planting Delays Reach Historic Levels Resulting in High Levels of Uncertainty for 2019, and current expectations are for prevent plant crop insurance claims to exceed $1 billion and reach a record-high of 10 million acres.

USDA’s June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates recognized the challenges faced in the 2019 crop year and adjusted corn planted acreage down to 89.8 million acres, a reduction of 3 million acres from the department’s March estimate, and also reduced the crop yield from 176 bushels per acre to 166 bushels per acre.

USDA reversed course in its annual survey-based June Acreage Report. For the 2019/20 crop year, USDA indicated corn planted area at 91.7 million acres, up 3% or 2.6 million acres from prior-year levels, and down only slightly from March intentions of 92 million acres planted. Importantly, USDA’s June corn acreage estimate was up from the June WASDE projection and well above the average pre-report estimate of 86.6 million acres. Figures 1 and 2 highlight USDA’s corn acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

Following continued declines in new-crop soybean prices – due to substantially lower Chinese demand – USDA revealed soybean acres planted at 80 million acres, down 9.2 million acres, or 10%, from 2018 and down 4.6 million acres from March intentions. Soybean plantings in 2019 are expected to be the lowest since 2013, and plantings are expected to be lower in all 29 soybean-producing states. Figures 3 and 4 highlight USDA’s soybean acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

USDA Will Reinterview

It is an understatement to say USDA’s report surprised the corn market. New-crop corn futures fell by more than 19 cents and represented a $2.6 billion-reduction in the value of new-crop corn (based on WASDE production estimates). USDA acknowledged as much, indicating that 83% of the intended corn acreage had been planted at the time of the survey – well below the 10-year average.

In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the crop size and planted area, USDA announced that it will resurvey farmers in advance of the August 12 Crop Production report. Farmers in 14 states will be reinterviewed to determine their planted area of corn, soybeans and sorghum. Figure 5 identifies the states subject to acreage resurveys.

State Farm Bureau Perspective

To provide some additional perspective on corn and soybean acres planted, remaining to be planted or prevented from being planted, state Farm Bureaus in the reinterview region were contacted to get their ground-level perspective. Their responses follow.

Illinois – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 5%

A central Illinois farmer reported to me over this past weekend, that he had one field he originally planned to plant to corn, then was prevented-planting of corn on that field, and now he has just finished planting soybeans on that field. [Market Intel note: The planting of soybeans may have been motivated by the planting requirement associated with the Market Facilitation Program.]

Indiana – Corn Acres Up 3% and Soybean Acres Down 11%

Farmers in Indiana have given up on the hope of getting any more corn planted and did so several weeks ago. Prevent planted acres are all around the state, particularly in central and southern Indiana, where farmers have experienced rainfall far above normal. Corn can be seen in the state just popping out of the ground to knee high. Anticipated yields at this time will be far less than the 10-year average for farmers.

Kansas – Corn Acres Up 8% and Soybean Acres Down 1%

While a majority of intended Kansas corn acres have been planted, many of those acres went in during and after the USDA Risk Management Agency’s late planting period. In a few counties, up to 25% of the crop was either prevented from being planted or the planted corn is now under water.

The bulk of intended soybeans in Kansas are in or going in but a significant portion is later than intended; an early frost could be devastating.

Kansas grain sorghum planting is wrapping up, and it is suspected that at least in some areas of the state, forage crops may be substituted for intended grain sorghum acreage.

The Kansas cotton crop went in extremely late and estimates are that only about 50% to 60% of intended acres got planted this spring.

All crops are behind and will require near optimal temperatures and measured amounts of precipitation throughout the growing season. Again, an earlier than normal frost could be devastating.

Michigan – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 9%

There were a lot of acres planted over the weekend in central Michigan, but anything planted to corn recently will go to silage, not grain. The large dairy presence and need for forage in this area has caused a lot of farmers to keep planting corn with no intention of harvesting it for grain. Based on some informal surveys done a few weeks ago, I would estimate that around 65% of originally intended acres were planted to corn for grain.

Soybean progress is harder to estimate because there were still soybeans being planted over the weekend. It varies quite a bit across the state but the southeast and central [parts of the state] are probably the hardest-hit areas. Our media staff is creating a member survey that will go out tomorrow to help give us a better idea of actual acreage.

I think one thing that would help make USDA’s resurvey more accurate is if they give clear direction on how farmers should report prevent plant acreage, especially prevent plant land that gets planted to corn as a cover crop for silage.

Missouri – Corn Acres Down 3% and Soybean Acres Down 9%

Extreme flooding along the Mississippi, Missouri and internal state tributaries has wreaked havoc with corn planting in Missouri. Some land is still either covered or partially covered with water and will not be planted. April and the first half of May corn plantings were detrimentally impacted by frequent heavy rains causing thousands of acres to be replanted and/or forcing many farmers to leave undesirable stands due to the lateness of the season. Corn planted the last 10 days of May and into the first three weeks of June had better stands. 25-30% of the corn is normal, 50% is intermediate with very uneven stands and 20-25% is replant.

Ohio – Corn Acres Down 6% and Soybean Acres Down 6%

It is tough to nail down how accurate the latest USDA planting report is. Some of our economists don't believe it is super far off, but if we ask our farmers they claim much less has been planted. They are not thrilled to see the price slide with this latest report.

I was in Ottawa County in northwest Ohio yesterday and their Soil and Water in the county estimates that only 4% of the corn was planted and 30% of their beans. I would say that is definitely worse than most, but many of the surrounding counties experienced very serious planting issues as well. During my drive through northwest Ohio yesterday I saw a lot of weeds and barren fields.

If Ohio does not have a record for prevented plant acreage I will be surprised. And for crops that are planted, they are weeks behind, struggling to come up or already in need of replant. And how much can be replanted at this point? Probably not much.

South Dakota – Corn Acres Down 9% and Soybean Acres Down 22%

It looks like South Dakota will set the record for prevented planting acres by far. As always, there are differences around the state, but it sounds to me that on average the state will only be around 60% planted. On our farm, we were right at 50%. Some areas of the northeast part of the state are 80% to 90% percent planted. Down by Mitchell and Chamberlain areas, and between Pierre and Huron, some producers couldn't plant anything at all. There are some areas where you can drive several miles and not see a planted field.

Summary

USDA currently projects corn acres at 91.7 million acres, up 3% from prior-year levels, and soybean acres at 80 million acres, down 10% from 2018. However, given the historical delays in planting at the time of USDA’s acreage survey, USDA announced intentions to resurvey farmers in advance of the August Crop Production report. Feedback from state Farm Bureaus confirms the need to resurvey crop acreage, points to potential yield issues due to unfavorable growing conditions and supports a more substantial reduction in corn acres planted."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence abruptly canceled a planned trip to New Hampshire on Tuesday after being called back to the White House for an unspecified reason, White House officials said.

Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, told Reuters there was no emergency after news reports that the vice president’s plane was called back for an “emergency.”

“The vice president was called back to the White House but there’s no cause for alarm and we’ll reschedule the trip soon,” Short said.

Short said Pence’s plane never actually left Washington.

The White House would not say what issue arose to keep Pence in place. A senior administration official said there was no medical issue involving Pence or President Donald Trump.

“Something came up that required the vice president to remain in D.C. There is no cause for concern. Everybody’s fine,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters.

Pence had been scheduled to fly to Manchester, New Hampshire, to speak with former patients and others at the Granite Recovery Center, an addiction treatment facility, his official schedule showed."

Here’s How the New Tax Law Is Working,” by WSJ’s Richard Rubin and Anthony DeBarros: “In the aggregate, the tax-filing season looked the same as it did the year before, with 79% of taxpayers getting refunds averaging $2,879, down only slightly from 80% and $2,908. But those totals mask some significant variation by income, according to newly released IRS statistics from tax returns filed through May 23.

“These preliminary tallies provide the first hard data from the government about the actual refunds, deductions and taxes reported at different income levels in the new system. … The fresh data shows that while refund statistics barely budged for lower- and middle-income workers, real movement occurred toward the upper end of the income distribution. Average refunds for taxpayers making between $100,000 and $250,000 dropped 10%, while average refunds for those between $250,000 and $500,000 rose by 11%.” WSJ

2020 WATCH -- “Trump and R.N.C. Raised $105 Million in 2nd Quarter, Outdoing Obama,” by NYT’s Annie Karni and Maggie Haberman: “Mr. Trump and his committees raised $54 million, they said, and the R.N.C. raised $51 million. The campaign officials did not say how many individual donors had contributed, or how many gave money in increments of $200 or less. The official report, which will include spending, will be filed with the Federal Election Commission on July 15.” NYT

“Staffers said the Vermont senator has received more than 1 million individual contributions this year, and 45 percent of his donors are under the age of 40. He also transferred $6 million from previous campaign accounts, his aides said. Sanders' average donation was $18, less than his $27 per person contribution that became a rallying cry for him in 2016. More than 99 percent of the donations were $100 or less, his campaign said.” POLITICO

“The independently backed documentary details Buttigieg’s rise to national attention, chronicling his stops on the campaign trail. Crews have already begun filming at several of Buttigieg’s campaign events, and attended the first Democratic debate in Miami to gather footage. … Sources say its future is contingent on the outcome of Buttigieg’s campaign.” Axios

-- FIRST PERSON … KATELYN BURNS for POLITICO MAGAZINE: “I’m Trans. The 2020 Candidates Don’t Know How to Pander to Me”: “The trans voting population isn’t large enough to swing an election or contribute significantly to a campaign’s bottom line. As a trans person, it’s easy for me to forget that these candidates aren’t competing for my vote as much as they’re trying to appeal to the woke progressives who have recently taken up the cause on behalf of the trans community.

“Incoherent promises might play well with the progressive base, but I’ve yet to hear a candidate effectively speak out about trans issues beyond calling out Trump’s trans military ban. Selling campaign Pride merchandise is one thing, but offering material plans to roll back Trump’s attacks on our community would be so much more compelling. Under this administration, my community has lost educational protections, protections in homeless shelters and the ability to serve in the military. Additionally, if we lose at the Supreme Court this fall, we stand to lose employment protections, and if a recently proposed administration rule is finalized, health care protections.” POLITICO Magazine

MARKEY BECOMES A MARK … STEPHANIE MURRAY in Boston: “‘That’s a Senate seat waiting for someone to take it’: The left targets Ed Markey,” by Stephanie Murray: “Recent polling shows Markey’s support among Massachusetts Democratic and unenrolled voters is a little shakier than he would like. … The senator’s favorability rating is an anemic 38 percent, with 25 percent of voters expressing an unfavorable view of him. More than a third of voters are either undecided (22 percent) or have never heard of him (14 percent), a bad omen for a pol who’s been in Congress for more than 40 years. …

“Markey isn’t the only incumbent in the state’s all-Democratic delegation looking over his shoulder. The well of pent-up progressive talent is also generating a handful of House primary challenges, including to longtime Reps. Richard Neal and Stephen Lynch, and four-term Rep. Joe Kennedy III.” POLITICO

THE POLICY PRIMARY -- “How Cory Booker would ‘virtually eliminate’ immigration detention,” by Ted Hesson: “Booker would phase out the use of private detention centers over a three-year period.

“Booker also proposes winding down detention contracts with state and county jails over the same three-year period. Under Booker’s plan, most immigrants would be monitored using ‘alternatives to detention.’ Immigration and Customs Enforcement currently uses various detention alternatives in a limited manner, including ankle bracelets, bonds, and check-ins by phone and in person.” POLITICO

DOJ pushes Congress to permanently close loophole for knock-off fentanyl,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Clare Hymes'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doj-pushes-congress-to-permanently-close-loophole-for-knock-off-fentanyl/,"The Department of Justice is calling on Congress to enact into law a temporary order from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classifying fentanyl-like drugs as controlled substances. The 2018 order, which closed a legal loophole in U.S. drug laws that make Americans vulnerable to what are essentially knock-off versions of the opioid, was imposed on an emergency basis for two years and is set to expire in February 2020.

The drugs were previously able to dodge federal law due to their chemical makeup, which has slight modifications from the fentanyl compound. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is about 100 times stronger than morphine, and its analogues can be even more potent.

""From a policy and regulatory perspective, fentanyl-like substances need to be permanently scheduled as a class,"" said Katie Crytzer, the acting deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice. At a briefing with reporters Monday, she called the classification an ""urgent and necessary first step.""

John Martin, assistant administrator at the DEA, cited statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing more than 70,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2017. Nearly 48,000 of those deaths were caused by opioids, with approximately 29,000 stemming from use of fentanyl or fentanyl-like substances, Martin said.

If the government's current order expires without a plan in place to set permanent controls, Crytzer said, ""the department, its prosecutors and law enforcement would enter relatively unknown territory."" Crytzer said a lapse could have a serious impact on any ongoing or impending prosecutions.

According to the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, there were 863 federal defendants in fiscal year 2018 whose principal charge was related to fentanyl. However, the office only began including fentanyl analogues in their tracking as of October 2018.

The illicit substances are engineered to skirt and exploit gaps in U.S. drug laws, and largely enter the U.S. from foreign sources like Chinese criminal organizations, Mexican cartels and other traffickers. Officials say the analogues coming in from China are more potent, but traffickers from Mexico bring larger quantities of the drugs into the country.

""I can personally tell you how savvy these drug traffickers are,"" said Amanda Liskamm, director of opioid enforcement and prevention efforts in the deputy attorney general's office. ""When there is a gap in U.S. law they take full advantage of it, which results in more drugs and more deaths.""

Officials say the 2018 order has led to a ""significant decrease"" of fentanyl-like substances on the streets, and law enforcement is hoping that a more permanent continuation of the blanket classification will keep it that way. They noted that since the temporary emergency order has been in effect, law enforcement has only encountered three new fentanyl-related substances. Before the order, there were new analogues being discovered on a monthly basis.

Although Congress has been vocal on working to curb the opioid epidemic, they have yet to mark up the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act, or SOFA Act, which would permanently close this particular gap. Some hesitancy stems from concerns about how blanket scheduling could affect researchers, but Martin said that DOJ and DEA are working on an intergovernmental solution that benefits the researchers.

""They have some concerns but from where I'm standing, or sitting, I think we're trying to eliminate I guess the perception out there in the research community that it's going to be a hindrance for them to conduct research,"" Martin said. ""We absolutely don't want that perception to be there."""
Vintage EPA photos reveal what US waterways looked like before pollution was regulated,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aylin Woodward'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/vintage-epa-photos-reveal-us-waterways-before-pollution-was-regulated-2019-6,"Just over 50 years ago, Ohio's Cuyahoga river caught fire.

The disaster prompted a public outcry that in part led to the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. The EPA was charged with regulating the country's polluted air and waterways, among other environmental objectives.

Soon after its founding, the agency dispatched 100 photographers to capture the US' environmental issues as part of a photo project called Documerica. The photographers took about 81,000 images, more than 20,000 of which were archived. At least 15,000 have been digitized by the National Archives, and the images now function as a kind of time capsule, revealing what states from California to New York looked like between 1971 and 1977.

Many of the photos were taken before the implementation of rules meant to keep water and air free of contamination.

Vandal lists 'Putin' as 45th president on Eden Park monument,https://www.cincinnati.com,"['Cameron Knight', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/crime/crime-and-courts/2019/07/02/vandal-lists-putin-45th-president-park-monument/1625192001/,"CLOSE

The plaque in Presidential Grove in Eden Park was recently vandalized. (Photo: Used with permission)

A vandal has listed ""Putin"" as the 45th President of the United States on an Eden Park monument, park officials confirmed Monday.

A political statement writ in Sharpie got attention on Reddit Monday when someone posted a photo of the plaque in the park's Presidential Grove.

The simple lists of presidents ended with ""45 Putin,"" presumably referring to Russia President Vladimir Putin.

Trees have been planted in honor of each president at Presidential Grove since 1882. Many presidents handpicked the species of tree planted in the grove to represent them.

It's unclear when the vandalism took place, but the actual 45th President Donald Trump and Putin made headlines together last week at G-20 summit in Japan.

Trump was criticized for appearing to joke about Russia's meddling in the 2016 election with Putin.

Trump turned to Putin and wagged his finger with a smile.

""Don't meddle in the election, president,"" Trump said as cameras clicked and reporters shouted questions. Putin laughed.

Rocky Merz, business services division manager for the Cincinnati Park Board, said Monday he was aware of the vandalism and that it would be cleaned up Tuesday.

He explained Trump's nameplate was not damaged or removed from the plaque because the nameplates are only added at the end of a president's term. That president's tree is also planted at that time.

Merz said the plaque there has been vandalized many times over the years, and the targets have been presidents on both sides of the aisle.

Trump administration drops bid to put citizenship question on 2020 Census,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'Tara Bahrampour', 'Ann E. Marimow', 'The Washington Post', 'This Story Was Originally Published At Washingtonpost.Com.']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/2020-census-will-not-include-citizenship-question-doj-confirms/,"WASHINGTON – The Trump administration has dropped plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, the Justice Department said Tuesday, just days after the Supreme Court described the rationale for the question as “contrived.”

The decision was made after officials determined that there would not be enough time to continue the legal battle and meet the printing deadlines for the census questionnaire, according to people familiar with the matter.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Tuesday that “I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.”

The decision to eliminate the question was a victory for civil rights advocates concerned that the query would lead to an inaccurate count of immigrant communities that could skew political representation and federal funding.

“In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, the government had no choice but to proceed with printing the 2020 census forms without a citizenship question. Everyone in America counts in the census, and today’s decision means we all will,” said Dale Ho of the American Civil Liberties Union, the lawyer who argued the Supreme Court case.

The fate of the question has been the subject of legal and political wrangling since March 2018, when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced he planned to add it to the decennial survey, sparking a half-dozen lawsuits from states, cities, civil rights groups and others.

Advertising

Just last week, President Donald Trump responded to the Supreme Court’s ruling temporarily blocking the question by saying he would seek to delay the census to give administration officials time to come up with a better explanation for why it should include a citizenship question.

Trump expressed disbelief again on Monday that the question could not be included and told reporters at the White House, “I think it’s very important – to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal? I think there’s a big difference, to me, between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.”

Instead of a delay, government lawyers by email notified those challenging the planned Census question of the administration’s decision to proceed without it.

The Census Bureau has started printing the questionnaires without the question, Ross said. He added that his “focus, and that of the bureau and the entire department, is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

Soon after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration, Justice Department officials said privately they determined they would have no choice but to drop the question from the 2020 census.

That is because the printer had a deadline that was merely days away, and officials knew there was no way that the court process could resolve favorably for them before that deadline, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss still pending litigation.

When Trump tweeted that he would explore delaying the census, some Justice Department officials were left scratching their heads, they said, because such a move would be legally impossible.

The White House asked the Justice Department how it might be able to add the question, including by possibly delaying the census, and the department explained that it wasn’t realistic or tenable, given time constraints and the Supreme Court’s ruling, said a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke under condition of anonymity because the person wasn’t authorized to speak about it publicly.

“I have to think that sanity prevailed with respect to the incredible disruption to our representational democracy that delaying the census would have caused,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee. “I doubt anyone at the Justice or Commerce departments could figure out how to overcome the constitutional and statutory hurdles.”

Critics of the question, including some inside the Census Bureau, said it could cause an undercount of millions of people in immigrant communities who would be afraid to return the form, leading to an inaccurate that could skew representation and apportionment in favor of Republican areas.

The government had said it needed the question in order to enforce the Voting Rights Act, and Ross initially told Congress he decided to add it in response to a December 2017 request from the Justice Department. But documents uncovered in the lawsuits suggested Ross was pushing for it months earlier, and that he pressed the Justice Department to issue the request.

In the Supreme Court’s splintered ruling Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that federal agencies must offer “genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” He was joined in by the court’s four liberal justices.

Data from the census, which every U.S. household is required to fill out, is used by businesses and by the government to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars in federal spending per year; it is also used to determine Congressional apportionment and redistricting. The form that goes to all households has not included a question related to citizenship since 1950.

Thomas Wolf, of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said Tuesday that the push to include such a question would have a lasting impact.

“Even if the citizenship question is dead, it has left damage in its wake. The question has not only distracted necessary attention for over a year from other key aspects of census preparation, but also raised widespread fears about the safety of participating in the census,” Wolf said in an e-mail.

“The administration must refocus its attention immediately on making sure that every person in this country is counted. It can start by launching a nation-wide advertising campaign to ensure everyone that no citizenship question will appear on the 2020 Census.”

The notice from the government came just hours before lawyers were scheduled for a conference call in a separate case in Maryland also challenging the Census question.

Judge George Hazel, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland in Greenbelt, was one of three federal judges who ruled earlier this year against the question, saying Ross violated administrative law and the enumeration clause of the Constitution by proposing to ask the citizenship status of household members on the form.

Advertising

The issues before Hazel were different from those heard by the Supreme Court. The government’s path to adding the question had become more difficult in May after new evidence emerged showing a deceased Republican redistricting strategist had been in touch with some administration officials over adding the question.

The strategist, Thomas Hofeller, was author of a 2015 study that found adding the question would likely help Republicans and white voters in subsequent redistricting decisions; he had also been in touch with a census official about adding a citizenship question to the form, according to files found on hard drives belonging to him.

Hazel had ruled that plaintiffs had not provided sufficient evidence for charges that the government had conspired or intended to discriminate when it added the question, and plaintiffs had appealed.

After the Hofeller evidence emerged, however, Hazel said the new evidence merited further consideration, and a federal appeals court returned the case to his court. The Maryland case could have tied up the question in a separate legal battle that might have eventually reached the Supreme Court in its own right.

During the call with Hazel on Tuesday, government lawyers did not explain why the citizenship question was pulled off the table, said Denise Hulett, senior counsel with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who also was on the call.

She said Hazel asked for a written stipulation by Monday in the case before him that the Commerce Department “has given up its fight entirely” to include the question in the 2020 count.

Shankar Duraiswamy, the lead attorney in the Maryland case, called the Trump administration’s reversal Tuesday a victory for American democracy.

“A citizenship question would have risked a massive undercount in areas with large numbers of Latinos and immigrants, depriving them of their right to equal political representation and fair share of federal funding,” he said in an email.

A Fountain Inn family is calling for help from the Department of Veterans Affairs before they end up without a home. Jacob Skelly served five years in the military, including a tour in Iraq. His time in the service ended when he was honorably discharged and diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He, his wife Autumn and their three kids now live in Fountain Inn. In large part, they rely on the money he collects the first of each month from the VA. ""He's 100 percent disabled, he's on a lot of medications and that's his money for our family,"" said Autumn, inside the family's home Tuesday. They checked their bank account Monday, but didn't find a check. Each month, it comes on the first. ""Find out didn't get paid,"" Skelly said. Nervous, they called the VA for answers. Autumn said she believes they were hacked and said the VA told them the account number for where that check had been deposited changed. ""They did an open investigation, but they told us that it could be six-eight weeks until we hear anything back,"" she said. Skelly said that isn't soon enough. ""By the time we could get that check, we could be evicted. We could lose our vehicles. We have three kids, food and the water bill and the electric bill, all the important things.""She says her husband was distraught, frantically making calls.""He was on the phone with them and he was, like 'What am I supposed to do?' He just started crying and they had no answers for him,"" she said. She's wondering how they were hacked. They want the VA to help and take measures so this doesn't happen to anyone else.

EPA challenges Flint over staffing at water treatment plant,https://www.mlive.com,['Ron Fonger'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2019/07/epa-challenges-flint-over-staffing-at-water-treatment-plant.html,"FLINT, MI -- More than three years after the city’s water crisis was recognized as a national emergency, Flint still doesn’t appear to have hired enough employees to insure its water treatment plant is properly operated, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says.

But a city spokeswoman says it’s the federal agency that “simply has its facts wrong.”

In a June 26 letter to Mayor Karen Weaver and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, the EPA asks “what the city will do to demonstrate that the Flint (plant) has the necessary, capable and qualified personnel on board so that the (Dort Highway plant) is properly operated at all times.”

Reports from treatment plant operators to the state have shown an operator trainee quit, causing inadequate staffing; that employees have been scheduled to work up to 80 hours per week; and that workers are fatigued “due to low staffing and long work weeks.”

Defiant mayor will fight 'unwarranted' oversight of Flint water system ""This man-made crisis occurred because the state, over the stringent objections of the city and its people, imposed its misguided policies on the people of the city of Flint,"" Weaver's letter says. ""The city is committed to remediating and recovering from this crisis ... However, this proposed (order) does nothing to substantively further the city's recovery and instead appears to be retaliatory and punitive.""

City spokeswoman Candice Mushatt said administrative changes at EPA during the past several months have led to erroneous information in the letter.

“These concerns were addressed and discussed originally with EGLE ...,” Mushatt said in an email to MLive-The Flint Journal. “As a result and through our regular voluntary agreement tracking meetings with EGLE and reporting this information to the EPA during monthly calls, we were able to address those concerns.”

“The resolution through the city’s (Department of Public Works) director, was to implement a four-foreman schedule, which will limit overtime to one shift,” she said. “A new operator foreman was trained and a day shift operator was also assigned as foreman.”

In a Monday, July 1, posting on its web site, EGLE said a resolution to accept funding and pay for the continued training of plant operators was also headed to the Flint City Council at its next meeting, that operator trainees who passed written exams last month must next take physical exams, and that all foremen who took a certification exam on May 30 passed.

Flint to keep contractor at water plant after city staff fail operator exams ""The city intends to begin a new recruitment process to hire an internal, permanent (operator in charge),"" Weaver wrote in a June 11 letter to Eric Oswald, director of DEQ's Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance Division.

Flint’s staffing at the treatment plant has been a federal concern since the EPA issued an order in January 2016, spelling out required actions for the city water system.

In her June 26 letter to Weaver, Cheryl Newton, EPA’s deputy regional administrator, said Flint has worked to try to resolve its staffing issues but appeared reluctant to hire additional staff “for fear of having to lay them off when the (water system) becomes more automated.”

“However, the city has yet to demonstrate that this requirement has been met on a continuous basis,” Newton’s letter says of staffing issues. “While the city continues its efforts to hire and train staff, the ability to provide adequate coverage on an ongoing basis is an EPA concern.”

In 2017, EPA also raised what it called “continued and significant concerns” that too few people were working in the water system and asked the city for a plan “to ensure ... the necessary, capable and qualified personnel” are hired.

Mushatt said the city expects to respond to the Newton letter this week."
Department of Homeland Security must be ready to combat new and emerging threats,https://thehill.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/451345-department-of-homeland-security-must-be-ready-to-combat,"The threats America faces today are vast, evolving, and from new adversaries. We must take steps to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the agency tasked with identifying these threats and preventing harm to our nation, is able to attack these threats head on.

While DHS may be our nation’s newest department, it by no means our most modern. The department was created in the chaos of 9/11 to respond to the rise of global jihadist operations. While DHS has largely found success in stopping those threats before they ever reach our shores, it must today be prepared to handle cyberhackers, rival nation-states, and transnational criminal organizations, in addition to global jihadists.

Rising powers are using asymmetrical attacks to weaken our leadership role and global influence. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all have state-sponsored programs designed to harm the United States. From satellites to social media, there isn’t an area free from intense competition.

For example, online influence efforts can destabilize our neighbors, affect migration flows and threaten the integrity of our elections here at home. China’s Belt and Road Initiative – infrastructure and investment initiatives across Europe and Asia – is holding our foreign partners hostage through cheap, state-back loans. Intellectual property theft means American innovation is being lifted straight out of our laboratories.

These threats either didn’t exist or weren’t on DHS’s radar when it was created in 2002.

Further, we are facing new challenges from terrorism at home and abroad. New technology has made online radicalization free, easy and anonymous. Acts of terrorism can be simple and viral. “Lone wolf” actors are difficult to identify and stop.

We need a department that can detect, prevent and respond to these emerging threats head on. To achieve this goal, recently I announced the American Security Agenda – a long-term effort by House Homeland Security Republicans to modernize and equip DHS for the threats of today as it prepares for the threats of tomorrow.

The American Security Agenda is founded on three pillars: giving DHS with the authority it needs to stay ahead of emerging threats; providing the department and its state, local and private sector partners with resources to deter terrorism; and improving the structure and management of DHS so that it can combat evolving threats.

Homeland Security Committee Republicans have already introduced five bills this in recent days. Their objectives range from securing our supply chains, identifying and mitigating transit threats, to combatting transnational security organizations.

However, these bills are just the start: more proposals are already in the works that we hope to introduce soon as part of our agenda.

This initiative imagines a DHS that is faster, smarter, and better equipped to preempt and combat rivals and adversaries across the globe. The American Security Agenda’s ultimate goal is the continued security of our homeland.

Rogers is ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee."
DOJ issues plea to Congress in battle against fentanyl copycats,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-issues-plea-congress-battle-fentanyl-copycats/story?id=64068467,"Department of Justice officials on Monday expressed alarm over an approaching deadline that they argued could significantly roll back recent progress in combating the scourge of fentanyl copycats fueling the country's opioid crisis.

In a briefing with several reporters, the officials called on Congress to quickly pass legislation that would keep fentanyl knockoffs -- primarily produced by overseas distributors -- in a drug category on par with heroin, making it easier for the government to prosecute traffickers.

Joshua Lott/Reuters, FILE

Currently, the so-called ""fentanyl analogues"" are under an emergency ban that is set to expire in February without action by Congress.

""These potential adverse consequences of a lapse in scheduling of fentanyl-like substances goes beyond a simple return to the status quo,"" Amanda Liskamm, the director of Opioid Enforcement and Prevention Efforts in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, told reporters. ""We expect prosecutions charging substances under the temporary order to be affected, resulting in confusion and even potential trial losses. We are running out of time and if a solution isn't found, prosecutors will undoubtedly be hindered and drug traffickers will undoubtedly be helped.""

According to John Martin, the assistant administrator for the Drug Enforcement Administration, 29,000 of the 72,000 reported U.S. overdose deaths in 2017 were attributed to fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances.

In 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced plans to take aim at one of the leading sources of fentanyl abuse, the synthetic fentanyl that drug traffickers could import from overseas manufacturers either through the mail or in some cases transported across the U.S. southern border.

By making piecemeal chemical alterations to the overall structure of fentanyl, distributors were able to avoid some of the regulations that restricted other drugs listed under the Controlled Substances Act.

The emergency change assisted prosecutors in cases, such as an August 2018, 43-count indictment against two Chinese citizens who were charged with shipping fentanyl analogues to 37 U.S. states over a decade, linked to at least two deaths of Americans in Ohio.

""When a synthetic narcotic was banned, this criminal organization would use its chemical expertise to create an analogue of the drug with a slightly different chemical structure with the same or even more potent effect,"" Liskamm said, later adding that if the suspects were to be extradited to the U.S. to face charges, their prosecution could potentially be affected if the emergency scheduling lapses.

Lawmakers have, for the most part, been receptive to the idea of making the fentanyl-analogue scheduling permanent, under a bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Ron Johnson dubbed the ""Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act,"" or SOFA Act.

But some Democrats have recently raised concerns with the idea of a blanket re-scheduling for fentanyl-related substances and whether it could result in barriers for researchers examining the potential medically-related uses of fentanyl.

But Martin said that based on his interactions with the DEA's own interagency researchers, he thinks those concerns are overblown.

""I don't think it's going to impact [researchers] greatly at all,"" Martin said. ""They have some concerns but from where I'm sitting I think we're trying to eliminate the perception out there in the research community that it's going to be a hindrance for them to conduct research.""

In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday, multiple criminal justice reform groups including the ACLU and Drug Policy Alliance also spelled out their objections to the legislation -- arguing the approach would result in harsher sentences and unfair targeting of communities of color, while having little to no effect on deaths from overdosing.

""We believe the Committee is right to be concerned about fentanyl-related deaths, but this approach merely repeats the mistakes of the past by exacerbating our incarceration problem,"" the groups said in the letter. ""The Committee should move away from the belief that increased enforcement powers for the DEA will translate into reduced overdose deaths."""
Verizon is teaming up with the VA on a telehealth program,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Zachary Hendrickson'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-department-of-veterans-affairs-telehealth-partnership-2019-7,"Verizon partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a move that will give veterans who are also Verizon customers access to the VA's telehealth app VA Video Connect — which enables remote consultations with healthcare professionals — free of data charges via Verizon's 4G LTE network, per Health Data Management.

American Well

Here's what it means: The VA is doubling down on telehealth efforts to expand its reach among rural vets.

The VA conducted over 1 million telehealth consultations last year, and a strategic partnership with Verizon should help it reach its lofty telehealth goals. Six million unique patients received VA treatment last year — a difficult task given there are only 172 VA medical centers nationwide — and telehealth could effectively expand VA providers' reach: The VA aims for all of its care providers to be telehealth enabled by the end of fiscal year 2021, according to a 2018 Veterans Health Administration notice.

The VA is concerned that there are fewer care options for rural vets — but hopes 4G-powered telehealth could provide reinforcements. The VA's major telehealth investments are almost primarily geared toward addressing the needs of the 4.7 million US veterans living in rural areas: Rural veterans may need to travel great distances between their homes and points of care — a problem exacerbated by uncertainty around the 21% of rural hospitals currently facing closure. Also, 27% of rural vets don't use the internet at home, likely due in part to a lack of broadband coverage: Nearly 40% of individuals in rural communities don't have broadband access compared with 4% in urban areas, per The Conversation. Nevertheless, the VA has had success with telehealth in rural areas: Of the 1 million telehealth visits last year, over half were made by rural veterans.

The bigger picture: Verizon likely sees the massive VA patient base as a proof-of-concept for a larger telehealth play on the horizon.

Verizon isn't the only major telecom player interested in telehealth, but its superior 4G network could still give it the long-term edge. In addition to its partnership with Verizon, the VA has previously tied up with two other major players in the telecom space — T-Mobile and Sprint— on telehealth initiatives. However, Verizon performed better than the competition in terms of 4G mobile video streaming, and it also had the widest coverage area, according to insights from OpenSignal.

And free 4G access for veterans could be just the first step in a larger 5G telehealth play from Verizon.Of the three telecom providers linked up with the VA, only Verizon has a web presence fully dedicated to 5G in healthcare. As we've previously covered, 5G is the next step in mobile connectivity, and it's prepped to have a major impact on the efficacy and speed of digital health tools. I (Zach) think we could see Verizon leveraging 4G performance data from VA Video Connect in attempts to work out a more ambitious, paid contract to provide 5G digital health services to VA medical centers in the near future. However, Verizon will need to improve its 5G network before that point and could find itself competing with the reach of a potentially merged T-Mobile/Sprint.

This temporary office space which is located on the third floor, gives them a great view of their permanent facility.

Currently nearly forty employees are working from this new office location, all of which are employees of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, and will eventually move into the permanent facility in December 2020.

They have had a lot of success at recent job fairs, with getting lots of applicants, but Burton says they still have lots of openings.

“We have a lot of support staff, and a lot of positions that will be available in every department. Our IT is still doing a lot of interviewing and a lot of hiring, so pretty much opportunities in all areas.” USDA/APHIS NBAF Coordinator, Dr. Ken Burton says.

According to Burton, they plan to have more than eighty percent of their employees hired when they move to the permanent facility."

Fresh leadership churn at DHS agencies,https://thehill.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/450970-fresh-leadership-churn-at-dhs-agencies,"The leadership carousel at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) took another spin this week as the agency underwent fresh changes among officials tasked with enforcing immigration law.

Roughly 10 weeks after a purge of DHS leaders that included former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen Kirstjen Michele NielsenThe Hill's Morning Report - Trump touts handshake with Kim, tariff freeze with Xi Fresh leadership churn at DHS agencies Booker calls for hearings on reports of ICE using solitary confinement MORE, the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) abruptly resigned and the agency announced a new head of Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

And there are rumblings that acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan is not on solid ground. Some of President Trump Donald John TrumpGOP senators press Pompeo on Boeing satellite sales to China Trump touts low black unemployment, criminal justice reform on anniversary of Civil Rights Act Trump says Mueller 'must' stick to report's findings during testimony MORE’s allies and outside groups that favor stricter immigration laws are expressing frustration with McAleenan, suggesting further changes could be on the horizon as the president seeks to implement the right mix of loyalists and immigration hardliners to implement his agenda heading into 2020.

""I've made changes — very good changes,"" Trump told reporters this past week. ""We're moving some people around into different locations.""

McAleenan announced this week that Mark Morgan, previously the acting director of ICE, would move over to lead CBP in the wake of John Sanders's resignation.

Morgan, who led Border Patrol during the Obama administration, made clear in an interview with The Hill earlier this month that he intended to carry out Trump's policies.

Replacing Morgan at ICE is Matthew Albence, a 25-year law enforcement veteran who has held various roles in the Trump administration since 2017.

The president said he was aware there would be a change when Sanders announced his CBP resignation. But Trump did not say whether he asked Sanders to step down, and Sanders did not provide a reason for his resignation.

""I don’t know anything about it,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""I hear he's a very good man. I hear he's a good person. I don’t know him. I don’t think I ever spoke to him.""

Morgan and Albence's appointments follow Trump tapping Ken Cucinelli, an immigration hardliner and former Virginia attorney general, as the acting head of U.S. Customs and Immigration Services.

Trump also announced former ICE Director Tom Homan would return to the administration as ""border czar."" Homan has appeared regularly on Fox News to defend the president's policies, but it's unclear if or when he might return to government work or what his duties would entail.

Homan was sharply critical this week of McAleenan, suggesting he has not been supportive of Trump's agenda and has hindered ICE from doing its job.

The White House did not respond to questions about the recent shakeup at DHS, including whether Trump ordered the personnel changes.

The latest reshuffling came as House Democrats clashed over a bill to provide additional border funding and as Democratic presidential candidates made the treatment of migrants a central tenet of the party’s first two debates.

The president has often argued that congressional inaction is largely to blame for the surge in border apprehensions and poor humanitarian conditions for migrants. But the recent turnover atop DHS suggests growing impatience with that agency as well.

Any frustration by Trump with the agency’s performance could prove problematic for McAleenan.

Multiple advocates for Trump view McAleenan as a placeholder and have criticized him in recent weeks for failing to aggressively pursue the president's immigration priorities.

""He just basically has been a stumbling block for basically any enforcement that either CBP or ICE or USCIS wanted to do,"" said Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations for the immigration reduction group NumbersUSA.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

The Washington Post reported this month that McAleenan was uneasy with Trump's call for mass ICE raids to round up migrant families with deportation orders. McAleenan was said to have favored a more targeted approach.

Trump on June 22 postponed the raids for ""two weeks"" to give Congress time to attempt to pass legislation overhauling the country's asylum laws.

McAleenan denied in an interview with Fox News Radio on Thursday that he was the source of leaks to the media that jeopardized the raids, but wouldn’t say explicitly if there were any Trump policies that he disagreed with.

“That's not my role. I'm an operator, I'm a law enforcement professional, the president sets policy and we implement,” McAleenan said. “We implement in the best way we know how based on our operational experience.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about whether Trump planned to nominate the acting secretary for the role full-time.

Ur Jaddou, who was chief counsel to USCIS during the Obama administration, told The Hill that McAleenan's job has been complicated by the consistent turnover within his department.

""To have people at the top constantly changing and changing their direction on policy and how to approach things is completely disruptive which is why I call it chaos,"" she said in an interview.

Jaddou said she could not recall any comparable amount of turnover to what has taken place at DHS in recent months.

Andrew R. Arthur, who served in the former Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, was complimentary of McAleenan but was unsure of his long-term role. He described McAleenan as a ""very competent administrator"" and noted his wealth of experience from leading CBP.

McAleenan has been under additional scrutiny this past week as concerns over the administration's treatment of migrants gained a new sense of urgency.

Hundreds of children were moved from a detention facility in Texas after the Associated Press reported on poor conditions, including kids taking care of other kids and a lack of sanitation.

That same week, a photo went viral of a man and his daughter who drowned while trying to cross the Rio Grande River. Democrats seized on the image to decry the Trump administration's policies.

""In another administration an acting secretary would be out immediately,"" Jaddou said of the response to the photo. ""The person would not survive more than a day.""

McAleenan addressed the photo in a press conference Friday, calling the incident tragic and devastating, but deflected blame away from his own agency.

""This failure is not on the men and women of DHS, and definitely not on the outstanding border patrol agents, and CBP officers and ICE officers who have borne the brunt to the challenges and most of the criticism,"" he said.

McAleenan expressed appreciation for Congress for passing a funding package that includes $4.5 billion in resources for agencies responding to the influx of migrants.

Many Democrats panned the final version of the bill, saying it did not do enough to protect migrant children.

Still, McAleenan said the onus is on Congress to take further action, and he urged lawmakers to close immigration loopholes and approve changes to asylum laws.

""This situation should not be acceptable to any of us,"" McAleenan said. ""It should galvanize action and real debate based on what is actually happening on the border and why. And yet, here in Washington, we have collectively failed to act to address the drivers of the crisis."""
KC VA hospital head Kathleen Fogarty’s cover-up allegations,https://www.kansascity.com,[],,,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/health-care/article231768708.html,"Director of Kansas City VA Hospital has history of cover-ups from her previous job at Florida VA hospital Kathleen Fogarty, director of the Kansas City VA Hospital, has withheld information of a Veterans Affairs Police altercation with patient Dale Farhner, who died two days later. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK Kathleen Fogarty, director of the Kansas City VA Hospital, has withheld information of a Veterans Affairs Police altercation with patient Dale Farhner, who died two days later.

The leader of the Kansas City VA Medical Center has been under fire for withholding information about a patient’s death, allegedly at the hands of Veterans Affairs Police.





That secrecy seems to be a pattern.

Years earlier, that leader, Kathleen Fogarty, was also accused of cover-ups at her previous job as head of a Tampa, Florida, VA hospital.

A patient’s daughter there dubbed her “the VA queen of cover-ups” in 2014, after Fogarty authorized staff to install a hidden camera in the patient’s room. Fogarty was also accused of cutting veterans’ access to care outside the VA system to save money and denying she was doing it.

The incidents raise new questions about her administration’s handling of the death of Dale Farhner in Kansas City.





Farhner, a 66-year-old veteran from Kingston, Missouri, had hernia surgery at the Kansas City VA hospital in May 2018. The surgical wound became infected, and he was driving himself to the hospital’s emergency room three days later when a VA police officer confronted him for driving the wrong way in the parking lot. The ensuing altercation left Farhner nearly comatose, according to internal VA documents leaked to USA Today. He died two days later, but the documents reportedly made no determination about whether his death was due to injuries inflicted by VA Police.

The Star learned about Farhner’s death last year through an anonymous tip and filed a Freedom of Information Act request that revealed that the VA has documents, audio and video related to the incident. But the VA has repeatedly refused to provide them — or any other any information about the incident — to The Star, to members of Congress and even to Farhner’s family, which has since filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the agency.

Randall Barnett, the president of Vietnam Veterans of America’s Kansas City branch, has said it smacks of another cover-up.

“If they weren’t at fault or didn’t feel through their investigation they were somewhat at fault, why would they cover everything up?” Barnett asked. “Or try to cover everything up?”

The Star asked to talk to Fogarty this past week about her time in Tampa and the Farhner incident, but Kansas City VA spokesman Vernon Stewart provided only written responses via email.

“Federal law enforcement officials have already fully investigated this matter and determined that VA acted appropriately in its interaction with the veteran,” Stewart said. “VA will cooperate fully with any additional official investigations.”

Hidden camera

According to an interview she gave with a Florida public radio station in 2015, Fogarty started her career as a dietitian at the Kansas City VA in 1986.

She rose through the ranks over several decades and in 2011 became director of the James A. Haley VA Medical Center in Tampa — one of the nation’s largest VA hospitals.

The hidden camera controversy struck soon after.

The incident centered on Joseph Carnegie, a 79-year-old Korean War vet with severe brain damage.





According to an investigation by the VA’s inspector general — the agency’s internal watchdog — Carnegie’s nearly 400-day stay in the hospital was marked by tension. His family repeatedly accused the staff of poor care, and staff members increasingly suspected his relatives were sabotaging his care to set them up.

VA supervisors began discussing whether to hide a camera in the room — a question that eventually was elevated all the way to the executive level. According to meeting notes uncovered by the inspector general, there was disagreement among the hospital’s leaders, until Fogarty herself authorized it.

Carnegie’s relatives thought the new smoke detector in his room looked a little odd, and a maintenance man confirmed there was a camera in it. That set off a public controversy first reported by the Tampa Bay Times that drew the attention of then-U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, who requested the inspector general’s investigation.

The inspector general determined that the use of a hidden camera outside of a formal law enforcement investigation was very unusual at the VA, but in this case it was done out of legitimate concerns for patient safety.

“VA’s inspector general thoroughly reviewed this nearly seven-year-old matter, determining that ‘the patient received extensive, even exhaustive, high-quality care at (the Tampa VA Medical Center) … the patient’s family was aware of the (camera) when it was activated and began to record video images,’ and that use of the camera was ‘reasonable,’” Stewart, the Kansas City VA spokesman, said.

The Tampa Bay Times, however, found that in the aftermath of the camera’s discovery, hospital staff working under Fogarty untruthfully said that the camera was never intended to be hidden (internal memos showed it was), it was not recording (the investigation turned up 43 days worth of video) and that the family knew about the camera and signed a release authorizing it (it hadn’t).

In an editorial, the newspaper said Fogarty was responsible for “the hospital’s culture of defiance and non-responsiveness to public concerns.”

When Fogarty was tapped to temporarily take over the VA’s troubled Southwest region in 2014 amid a crisis over falsified patient wait times, Carnegie’s daughter told The Arizona Republic she was “disgusted.”

“To send the VA queen of cover-ups to Phoenix — it’s just a spit in our face,” said Natalie Carnegie, who could not be reached for comment for this story.

Budget balancing

In the radio interview, Fogarty said she had no regrets about the hidden camera because “the decision was made for the safety of that patient.” But she also said that if faced with a similar situation she would use an overt camera, not a hidden one.

In 2015 Fogarty took the job as director of the Kansas City VA Medical Center, which she described as a homecoming and a chance to serve at a smaller, less hectic hospital. Her salary — about $190,000 a year — is roughly the same as what she was making in Tampa Bay.

The following year USA Today included her in a list of VA administrators “transferred to new jobs despite concerns about the care provided to veterans at the facilities they were previously managing.”

The news organization cited Tampa Bay Times reporting that showed Fogarty “cut veterans’ access to outside care to help overcome a multimillion-dollar deficit as director of the Tampa, Fla., VA, in 2011 and repeatedly denied publicly that she was doing it.”

Stewart said USA Today’s story was “flat-out false and repeating it to your readers would be irresponsible.”

“When Director Fogarty became director of the Tampa VA Medical Center in 2011, she inherited a nearly $48 million budget deficit,” Stewart said. “She balanced the budget by using commonsense management principles such as not filling unneeded positions and eliminating unnecessary overtime and travel. Under Fogarty’s leadership, the facility expanded its services to Veterans, and the blueprint she developed for managing the resources remains in place at the VAMC today.”

That’s not what she told the Arizona Republic.

“In her interview last week, Fogarty said she balanced the Tampa VA budget in three years by reducing the time veterans spent in non-VA hospitals,” the newspaper wrote in an article published Nov. 27, 2014.

At least one VA spokeswoman who worked under Fogarty at the Tampa VA denied in 2011 that there even was a deficit — a claim the St. Petersburg Times wrote was “contradicted by the facility’s own budget records.”

The Farhners’ lawsuit is still in its early stages. Their Kansas City attorney, James LaSalle, said the VA had not released any information to the family in response to an administrative complaint they had to file before they could sue.

The agency also has not provided information about what happened between Farhner and police to former U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill and current U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, who both requested it.

LaSalle said the VA could be forced to hand over the investigative documents revealed by The Star’s records request during the suit’s discovery phase, but he had no timeline for when that might happen.

“I know that once it moves to litigation,” LaSalle said, “that stuff is evidence at this point.”"
House Judiciary calls for DOJ inspector general investigation into discrimination claims at FBI Academy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-judiciary-calls-for-doj-inspector-general-investigation-into-discrimination-claims-at-fbi-academy,"Bipartisan leaders of the House Judiciary Committee called for the Justice Department’s inspector general to open an investigation into allegations of discrimination against women at the FBI Academy earlier this week following a federal lawsuit alleging that Quantico is run like a “good old boy network.""

Sixteen former female trainees at the FBI filed a lawsuit in late May claiming that they and dozens of other women had been sexually harassed, subjected to a hostile work environment and outdated gender stereotypes, wrongly kicked out of the training program, unfairly forced to resign or made to think that the continuing the training would be futile, suffered retaliation, and more.

And top members of the congressional committee tasked with overseeing the FBI called the allegations “disturbing” and said that, if true, “such conduct cannot be tolerated.”

The letter, signed this week by two Democrats and two Republicans — Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York and ranking member Doug Collins of Georgia as well as Karen Bass of California and John Ratcliffe of Texas — said they believed America’s diversity should be reflected by the FBI’s agents, emphasized that the FBI’s selection process should be free from bias, and called on DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to look into it.

“We must ensure potential agents not be deterred from applying because they fear the possibility of such treatment,” they wrote. “We believe these detailed allegations require an investigation into the FBI’s training and selection prices for new agents.”

A representative for the FBI told the Washington Examiner that the bureau is “unable to comment on litigation” but that “the FBI is committed to fostering a work environment where all of our employees are valued and respected.”

“Diversity is one of our core values, and to effectively accomplish our mission of protecting the American people we need people of different genders, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives,” the representative said.

The federal lawsuit filed by female former trainees in May is directed at the training policies at the FBI and the conduct of its instructors at its agent training facility in Quantico, Virginia. The lawsuit claims FBI training guidelines are “highly subjective” and that “the uneven power dynamic at the FBI Academy puts female trainees at a distinct disadvantage.” And the lawsuit claims the subjective guidelines lets instructors misrepresent scenarios and fail women.

The complaint also alleges that when one of the women told former FBI Director James Comey of the allegations, Comey denied that discriminatory behavior was occurring and “instead suggested she use her ‘pain’ to reflect on her strengths and weaknesses.”

Mark Morgan, a former deputy assistant director at the FBI and the new acting chief of Customs and Border Protection, is also mentioned in the lawsuit.

David Shaffer, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told the Washington Examiner the FBI Academy relies upon “a completely subjective system that allows instructors to give rise to their own biases and beliefs with no accountability and oversight.”

Shaffer said that a common dynamic is that when a female trainee explains or defends her actions to an instructor, she is viewed being argumentative while when a male trainee does he is seen as standing up for himself.

Statistics provided by the FBI show that 20% of the special agents who are brought into the FBI are female. For the 2019 cycle, the FBI says that women made up 32% of those in the special agent basic field training course and 36% of those who had applied to be special agents. The FBI says that its 2019 target for female applications had been 33%, and the numbers reflect improvements from the 26% of special agent applications in the 2018 cycle and 22% in the 2017 cycle.

The FBI says that the total number of those who make it through the entire FBI special agent process — including application, training, and graduation — has held steady at just 6%.

If the DOJ inspector takes up the issue of discrimination at Quantico, it wouldn’t be the first time. A 2003 inspector general report which looked into allegations of disciplinary double standards at the FBI uncovered instances of instructors making inappropriate comments towards some trainees.

When asked by the Washington Examiner whether the DOJ inspector general would be launching an inquiry following the request from congressional leaders, the watchdog office declined to say.

Shaffer said that an inspector general investigation “should be done of course,” but he said that Congress needed to take action too.

“They need to be doing their oversight of the agency and asking the hard questions — and not relying on the FBI to investigate themselves,” Shaffer said.

Elizabeth Warren says no wealthy donors as ambassadors in State plan,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/28/19102522/elizabeth-warren-state-department-plan-2020,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) just released her vision for how she would run the State Department from the Oval Office — and it’s a dramatic change from how President Donald Trump has handled America’s diplomatic corps.

In a Friday Medium post, Warren vowed to pursue a “diplomacy-first strategy” as president as opposed to conducting US foreign policy mostly through the better-funded Pentagon. To do that, she says, her administration would invest much more in the current and future diplomats that serve in roughly 270 posts around the world.

“American security and prosperity depend on robust diplomacy,” she wrote. “Our diplomats are the front line of our engagement with the world.”

Her piece details that she won’t allow wealthy campaign donors to become ambassadors, how she aims to double the size of the diplomatic corps while improving diversity in its ranks, and how she’d create a diplomatic equivalent of ROTC programs in universities, among other moves.

It makes sense for Warren to put out a vision like this. First, having a plan for every aspect of governance is kind of her thing. Second, her overall foreign policy views prioritize diplomacy over using the military. And third, the Trump administration has caused much heartburn at the State Department by proposing lower budgets and failing to nominate qualified people for key positions, although that’s starting to change.

But because it’s a relatively short Medium post, the senator’s State Department plan is lacking many details about how, exactly, she would turn her aspirations into reality. There’s no mention about how she’d fight a GOP-led Senate to spend more and confirm nominees, there’s no real connection (yet) with how these views intersect with her thoughts on defense and development, and no discussion of tradeoffs she might face while prioritizing the State Department’s revamp.

Still, offering a State Department plan makes her the leading candidate on the issue during the 2020 cycle (for now). And what she offers are some concrete proposals that would let Warren put her mark on one of America’s oldest governmental professions.

How Warren wants to fix the State Department

Warren’s plan comes down to three main proposals that, if enacted, would substantially change the way the State Department has been managed under Trump — and that represent something of a departure from how the department was run under President Barack Obama, too.

1) No wealthy donors become ambassadors

This is likely the part of Warren’s plan that will get the most attention. There’s a long tradition of presidents in both parties nominating some of their richest financial supporters to plum ambassadorial posts. In Obama’s second term, for example, he named 31 campaign “bundlers” — people who raised at least $50,000 for his campaign — as an embassy’s top diplomat.

“Nearly all of these bundlers ... serve in Western European nations or other highly developed and stable countries such as Canada and New Zealand,” the Center for Public Integrity reported in January 2017.

Trump continued the practice by nominating 14 inauguration donors — who gave on average about $350,000 — as ambassadors. What’s worse, the people he nominated for top embassy posts were less qualified than in administrations past, as the February chart from Axios below shows. (The nominated ambassadors also gave more money to his campaign, on average, than previous rich donors gave other presidents.)

Warren says that trend would end under her watch. “I’ll make my ambassadorial appointments based on only one thing: finding the most qualified person for the job,” she wrote. “I won’t give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers — period,” she continued, calling on other candidates to promise the same.

That said, it’s somewhat easy for Warren to make this pledge. She’s already not taking money from high rollers or speaking at big fundraisers, so her bench of wealthy supporters is already thin. Still, her vow, if enacted, would end a long-standing problem of pay-for-play at some of America’s most important embassies.

2) Revamp the diplomatic corps

Warren blames Trump for many diplomats recently leaving the government, but she also notes that’s been a problem for a while. “Years of hiring freezes and spending cuts have caused many talented diplomats to head for the doors,” she wrote.

So Warren proposes two ways to change that: double the size of the foreign service and improve the diversity in the diplomatic corps.

Those go hand in hand. Right now, America’s diplomats are mainly white and male. “[T]he Foreign Service is not sufficiently representative of the American people with respect to race, gender, socioeconomic background, and regional origin,” a May 2018 Congressional Research Service report noted.

That means there’s a vast, untapped pool of people around the country that may be interested in a diplomatic posting. To reach out to them, Warren says she’ll “dedicate recruiting resources to applicants from HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] and other minority-serving institutions, women’s colleges, and community colleges. And I’ll double the size of fellowships designed to recruit minority and low-income diplomats.”

She’ll also push for universities to have a ROTC-like program for diplomats as well as double the size of the Peace Corps.

Trump, meanwhile, has consistently proposed cuts to the State Deparment budget and recruited secretaries of state that seem intent on lowering diplomatic ranks. Multiple diplomats I’ve talked to since the start of this administration have consistently noted the poor morale among the corps and just how understaffed — and therefore overworked — they all are.

Warren’s changes, then, will certainly require tons of effort and a decent chunk of money (although surely a lot, lot less than the Pentagon spends). It’s unlikely she could completely alter the face of the US diplomatic corps in four or even eight years. But she seems intent on making structural tweaks quickly in hopes of long-term change.

3) Improve the lives of diplomats

Diplomats have to deal with two big institutional challenges. First, they work for a large, impersonal bureaucracy that doesn’t always let the best talent rise to the top. Second, their service in major cities around the world makes it harder to raise a family and strike a normal work-life balance.

Warren wants to alter all that.

She proposes creating a “core professional development curriculum” which would help diplomats improve in their jobs and prepare for more senior roles. That will help her make at least one Deputy Secretary — a position right under the secretary of state — a career ambassador, one of the corps’ top designations.

The senator also aims to “enhance workplace flexibility to retain a diverse workforce.” She’d do that, in part, by “expanding parental leave and preferential postings for new parents.” That means new mothers and fathers wouldn’t be penalized as much for starting a family in the hyper-competitive State Department. What’s more, raising a kid in a more developed country could make an upbringing easier than, say, growing up in a warzone.

None of this is to say Warren’s plan is perfect; no plan is. But even in a short Medium post, Warren has given more thought about what to do with the State Deparment than many (if not all) of her Democratic opponents. The question now is if any other presidential candidate — including Trump — can come up with a better plan in the months ahead."
This is not the way to move USDA agencies out of Washington,https://thehill.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/451238-this-is-not-the-way-to-move-usda-agencies-out-of-washington,"The public debate over the announced move of the USDA Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture has focused on whether a move is sensible. Equally important is how this move has been planned and implemented.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue George (Sonny) Ervin PerdueThis is not the way to move USDA agencies out of Washington American farmers can't afford this administration's climate apathy Overnight Energy: New EPA rule could expand officials weighing in on FOIA requests | Trump plan to strip conservation fund gets bipartisan pushback | Agriculture chief downplays climate concerns MORE announced on June 13 that the 80 percent of staff at the two agencies will move to Kansas City by the end of September. He justified the move as putting the agencies closer to their agricultural constituency and as saving taxpayer money. I am one of the agricultural economists who wrote a critique of the USDA cost-benefit analysis, finding two major costs that were omitted from the USDA justification.

Our critique has been cited widely for disputing the USDA claim that the move would save taxpayer money. Two flaws in the measurement of costs drove our findings. The first was that the USDA analysis inflated the cost of remaining in Washington, D.C. It identified Kansas City as the least expensive place to locate outside of Washington that met its relocation criteria.

ADVERTISEMENT

By failing to compare this to the least expensive place inside Washington, they stacked the deck. The USDA real estate cost estimate would fall by $57-92 million in current 2019 dollars if it had compared sites outside the Beltway to the kind of alternatives that the General Services Administration would have identified in the District of Columbia, had it been asked to do so.

The second big cost we identified — and the one that turned the bottom line to a negative for taxpayers — resulted not from where these agencies are located, but rather from how the whole move process is being managed. This is the cost to the nation of lost research output when highly skilled researchers quit. On June 26, officials from the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents staff at both agencies, announced that internal surveys indicate that 80 percent of ERS researchers plan to resign or retire rather than move.

Even if half to three-quarters of relocating ERS and NIFA employees were to depart, as our analysis assumed, rebuilding expertise and productivity would be no easy job. These employees are overwhelmingly Ph.D. holders. They are not local hires in the Kansas City area. They are experts recruited in a national market. To attract replacements, the ERS and NIFA will have to compete with universities, research institutes, corporations and other federal agencies. Based on how competitive is the Ph.D job market in agricultural economics, we estimated that it will take four years of hiring 75-100 researchers annually to rebuild those agencies. Most of the new hires will be newly minted Ph.Ds, so they will need several years each to build the expertise in national scale agricultural issues and analytical methods of the employees who are departing. We calculate the monetary value of the lost research that is either not conducted or that trainees conduct less efficiently at $141 million - 203 million in 2019 dollars.

What is the value of agricultural and food research not conducted? I have written elsewhere about how much of what we know about America’s food comes from USDA research. Measuring economic values is tricky when markets are missing, and economists delight in quibbling over methods. Where we all agree is that there is a hidden cost when important work ceases to be performed.

Indeed, the very reasons that the United States government has formed agencies to perform research are that 1) this work would either not be done or not done equally well in the private sector, and 2) the benefits of the research work exceed its cost to taxpayers. So, when staff vacancies interrupt that research, taxpayers lose.

ADVERTISEMENT

Moving these agencies out of Washington, did not have to trigger a hemorrhage of expertise. We teach our undergraduate students that the functions of management are planning, implementation, and control. Had the consideration of an agency move begun as a planning process that engaged agency staff to weigh the benefits and costs of moving, they would have been aware, and they would have felt included and valued. Instead, they felt alarmed and alienated when Purdue announced on Aug. 8, 2018, that they would be relocated.

Many organizations with highly skilled employees make special efforts to retain experienced staff. A common way to do that while moving is to open a branch office and to entice seasoned employees to move with attractive incentives and time to work out the details.

Consider the gradual way that Amazon, which also relies upon a highly skilled workforce, is expanding into new facilities across the Potomac from where the USDA is extracting ERS and NIFA. Amazon is planning a ten-year buildup into its HQ2 in northern Virginia; USDA’s implementation approach was to give employees 32 days to decide and less than three months to pack up and move to Kansas City.

The sad truth is that if done right, the relocation of the ERS and NIFA outside of Washington, might have made sense for America’s taxpayers, farmers and food consumers. The plan’s failure to pass muster arises from the massive costs of alienating an expert workforce to the point that most quit. So far, about a quarter of ERS and NIFA employees are gone. The cost in lost staff and morale is high, but it is not too late to turn back.

We have reached the 11th hour. If Perdue wishes to hold on to USDA research capacity in agricultural markets, policy, and science, the time has come to cancel the relocation plan and stem the staff exodus. We may never know if moving these agencies outside Washington would have made sense for American’s taxpayers. What we do know is that as it has been managed, this move fails the benefit-cost test.

A judge is getting tired of the sniping in the Oracle wage and hiring bias case filed by the Labor Department: ‘Stop the invective communication’,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Benjamin Pimentel'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-labor-department-wage-bias-judge-order-2019-7,"A judge has ordered Oracle and the Labor Department to start talking in person or by phone, instead of trading accusations via email in a wage bias case in which the tech giant is accused of underpaying women and minority workers.

""I have mentioned this before — stop with the invective and contentious email communications, get on the phone or meet in person, and get these issues resolved,"" Richard Clark, an administrative law judge in San Francisco, said in a June 26 order.

Clark's order was in connection with a labor department complaint that said women and minority workers at Oracle lost out on at least $401 million in wages from 2013 to 2016 in what the agency portrayed as systemic discrimination that aso led to the hiring of few African-Americans and Hispanic workers. Oracle has denied the allegations.

The first hearing on the suit, which was filed in 2017, is scheduled to begin in December.

Heated tit-for-tat

Clark's order was based on a heated tit-for-tat between the two parties which began in May when, in the process of building its case, the labor department, through its Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, sent a letter to some Oracle employees asking if they would be willing to share their experiences related to the case.

""This lawsuit alleges Oracle unlawfully discriminated against its employees by suppressing the pay of its female, Black, and Asian employees,"" the letter which was cited in Clark's order said. ""Based on our analysis of Oracle's pay data, we have determined that these employees have been underpaid as much as 20% relative to their peers. We estimate that this discrimination cost these employees at least $600,000,000 in lost wages from 2013 to the present.""

The letter said the agency was looking to talk employees ""who were affected by this discrimination.""

""We want to hear what happened to you,"" the letter said. Among the employees the agency was specifically interested in reaching out to ""black and Asian employees employed in product development, particularly if Oracle used your prior salary to set your starting salary, placed you in lower paying positions than your peers or channeled you into lower paying positions throughout your career.""

Oracle blasts 'misleading statements'

The labor department's letter triggered an exchange the two parties. Oracle accused the labor department of making ""misleading statements"" in reaching out to its employees and of using ""bombastic rhetoric"" in its communications, according to Clark's order. The labor department fired back by accusing Oracle's attorneys of ""violating ethical rules"" and intimidating witnesses.

Clark said the issue could be addressed in in-person meetings or by phone, but he appears to have grown frustrated with what he described as ""gamesmanship"" by both parties.

He ordered Oracle and the labor department to hold a ""meet and confer process, which should be in person or voice communication and not email"" to resolve the issue of how they must communicate with potential witnesses in the case.

""An extraordinary amount of resources have been poured into this case,"" the judge wrote, stressing the need to resolve a case which has been dragging on for two years.

""It is time to move forward to a resolution,"" he wrote. ""If Oracle is discriminating against its employees, it needs to end, and the sooner the better. If Oracle is not discriminating against its employees, this litigation needs to end so the parties can move on.""

Oracle declined to comment. The Department of Labor could not immediately be reached for comment.

DHS acting chief predicts up to 25 percent drop in border crossings after new Mexico agreement,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-dhs-chief-predicts-25-percent-drop-in-border-numbers-after-agreement-with-mexico,"The acting head of the Department of Homeland Security on Friday said that he expects the number of migrants apprehended at the border will be lower by up to 25 percent in June than in previous months after Mexico increased its enforcement measures.

“It’s become clear that over the past three weeks since the administration reached a new agreement with Mexico that we’ve seen a substantial increase in the number of interdictions on the Mexican southern border, and a sincere effort to address the transportation networks coming through Mexico,” Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan told reporters.

DEMS RUN LEFT ON IMMIGRATION: DEBATE FEATURES VOWS OF HEALTH CARE FOR UNDOCUMENTED, DEPORTATION CURBS

The U.S. and Mexico reached agreement this month on a deal that sees Mexico take “unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration” in exchange for the U.S. dropping proposed sanctions on Mexican imports.

McAleenan said the U.S. was looking to see Mexico increase its deployment of National Guard members to the border, and for the expansion of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) -- which allow for illegal immigrants to be returned to Mexico while their immigration proceedings are held.

""These initiatives are making an impact and we are now anticipating a significant reduction in border crossing numbers from June, as much as 25 percent when compared to the record level in May,” he said.

NEW LEADERS INSTALLED AT TOP IMMIGRATION AGENCIES AMID QUESTIONS OVER DHS SECRETARY'S FUTURE

Customs and Border Protection said that it encountered more than 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. NBC News reports that in 2018 there was a 17 percent decrease from May to June.

McAleenan also said the U.S. is working with Northern Triangle countries to deal with root causes of the migration crisis and increase efforts to tackle organized smuggling organizations in the region.

His remarks come a day after the House passed the Senate version of a $4.5 humanitarian aid bill. It passed after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed down from a push to include restrictions on immigration enforcement that could have scuttled the measure. Trump is expected to sign the bill early next week.

McAleenan thanked congressional leaders for getting the bill passed, and said that while it didn’t include everything DHS wanted in it -- specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention beds for single adults -- it “substantially addresses” the request for funding.

He also took issue with media reports that children at detention centers were not being given vital supplies while in detention, leading to an outcry from lawmakers on Capitol Hill about alleged conditions at the centers. He said that while he has testified for months about concerns over the ability of DHS to handle the vast number of migrants crossing the border, those calls received little attention. But he said that some reports were ""missing the story.""

""Contrary to the reporting, children in CBP custody at the border are receiving access to key supplies, including toothbrushes, appropriate meals, blankets, showers as soon as they can be provided, and medical screening,"" McAleenan said."
Trump campaign looks to gain support with Latino voters despite president’s harsh approach to immigration,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Josh Dawsey', 'Reporter Covering The White House']",06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-looks-to-gain-support-with-latino-voters-despite-presidents-harsh-approach-to-immigration/2019/06/29/41aa413e-9776-11e9-a027-c571fd3d394d_story.html,"Vice President Pence speaks during the launching of the “Latinos for Trump” coalition in Miami on Tuesday. (Cristobal Herrera/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

In an effort to buttress President Trump’s reelection chances, the Trump campaign is reaching out to an unlikely group: Latino and Hispanic voters.

In recent weeks, the campaign has made several hires to court these voters and placed targeted ads in Florida. Meanwhile, Trump conducted his first presidential interview with Spanish-language media giant Telemundo, and Vice President Pence flew to Miami on Tuesday to officially launch the “Latinos for Trump” coalition.

“All Americans everywhere draw inspiration from the Latino Americans’ steadfast love of liberty,” Pence said, appearing in front of a ballroom crowd.

The president’s aides and advisers said the effort to target Latino voters reflects the need to expand the president’s base of support beyond his most fervent backers to prevail again in key swing states such as Florida as well as a belief that Trump can make a compelling case based on the performance of the economy.

“It’s absolutely critical to his reelection to win over some Hispanic voters, and he can do it by being a little more open on some of these immigration issues. He doesn’t need a majority. He just needs to move the needle,” said Chris Ruddy, a longtime Trump friend. “He has too many people around him telling him to stick to the base when he owns the base.”

But Trump faces an enormous challenge given his fraught relationship with the Latino community that began when he launched his campaign in 2015 by disparaging Mexican immigrants and continues through his frequent warnings about the dangers posed by Central American migrants trying to enter the United States across the southern border.

For many of the president’s opponents, the outreach efforts are viewed as a cruel joke amid the backdrop of the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, his harsh attacks on immigrants and threats of deportation. Melissa Mark-Viverito, the interim president of the liberal Latino Victory Fund, said she expects a record number of Latino voters to show up at the polls to cast their ballots against Trump.



“Every day, it’s an onslaught against our community. We know we’re under attack. We know nothing good is going to come out of a second term of this administration,” she said. “It’s a slap in our face.”

Polling released this week by Telemundo underscored the challenge facing the campaign in attracting Latino and Hispanic voters. In the key swing state of Florida, 34 percent of Hispanic voters would like to see Trump reelected, while 56 percent would prefer to replace him with a Democrat, according to the survey conducted by Mason-Dixon Strategies.

The numbers were even less favorable to Trump in other states, although they are mostly solid Democratic territories.

In California, 26 percent of Hispanic voters would like to see Trump reelected, while 66 percent would prefer a Democrat. In Texas, 25 percent would like to see him returned to office, while 69 percent want a Democrat. And in the New York metro area, 19 percent want Trump reelected, while 73 percent prefer a Democrat.

Trump won 28 percent of the Latino vote in 2016, compared with more than 40 percent for George W. Bush in 2004 — though he essentially matched Mitt Romney’s 2012 total.

About 29 million Latino voters are now registered to vote, and almost 12 million voted in the 2018 midterm elections, according to the Pew Research Center.

Trump’s supporters say the president should frame his message around the economy and national security. Hispanic unemployment is at historic lows, and campaign officials say many Hispanic voters even appreciate the president’s tough immigration rhetoric. They declined to show data supporting that assertion, and some of the campaign’s early data indicates the president is in a disappointing spot among Latino voters, according to campaign officials who were granted anonymity to discuss the issue.

The campaign on Wednesday bought two full-page ads in the Miami Herald and the Nuevo Herald, making an economic argument for “Latinos for Trump.”

The ads also argued a point campaign officials often make. “President Trump is clear on immigration: Millions have followed the law to come to America, new immigrants should too,” the ad read.

But even some of the president’s supporters are skeptical about the campaign’s ability to attract more Latino voters.

Al Zapanta, who leads the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce, said he supported Trump in 2016 and is helping lobby for passage of the recent trade deal struck with Mexico and Canada. He has recently visited the White House for meetings with senior officials, he said, but not the president.

“The Republican Party has really missed the opportunity to bring in the Hispanic and Latino vote,” Zapanta said. “The party still hasn’t decided they really want to make that a reality.”

Zapanta said he believed Trump could secure more support and hoped he would. “I haven’t seen at this point that focus,” he said.

Officials have been trying to sell donors on the idea that Trump can be more competitive with Latino voters, with campaign manager Brad Parscale saying during a recent presentation at the Willard Hotel that the campaign expected to secure more support from the community, according to people familiar with his remarks.

The campaign recently hired a coalitions director to build support among Latino communities, and it has hired a national press secretary to handle Latino members of the media. Hannah Castillo, the coalitions director, is expected to hire at least a dozen people, campaign officials said. About two dozen community and political leaders in Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada and other states are on board, according to the campaign.

Also on board is Alex Garcia, the RNC’s Latino outreach director in Florida in 2018, to lead the Trump campaign in the state. Advisers are building advertisements to target voters in Spanish, and they have targeted particular communities in Florida for messaging.

In Venezuela, Trump and his aides see policies that are appreciated by Cuban Americans — even though the effort to oust President Nicolás Maduro has stalled, and Trump has grown frustrated.

Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, has cast his legal immigration plan as a messaging device to the Latino community, White House officials said. But the plan has picked up scant support while the president continues to use incendiary rhetoric.

Still, campaign aides said they believe there have been heartening signs. At an El Paso event, much of the crowd was Hispanic and in from New Mexico, officials said, giving the campaign hope they could play in a state where Trump lost by a large margin in 2016.

Ruddy said the campaign must do more to convince Latino news outlets to change coverage of Trump. “Only a handful of media outlets really control news to the Latino population, and they are almost entirely nonstop, anti-him,” he said.

Doug Deason, a prominent Trump donor, said he recently spoke with the president about Hispanic voters at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Deason said he encouraged the president to occasionally tweet about how much he loves Hispanic voters and what he has done for them.

“They’re just concerned. Does he like us? So he needs to make it really clear. I told him, you have to let them know you love them,” Deason said. “I know you love them, but you have to let them know.”

Trump seemed surprised, he said.

“He was shocked to hear that,” Deason said. Trump, according to Deason, then turned to Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and now a senior White House adviser, and said “You got that, Kellyanne?”

“She said, ‘Yes sir, I got it,’ ” Deason said.

The US Department of Energy (DOE) has announced USD49.3 million in funding for nuclear energy research, facility access, crosscutting technology development, and infrastructure for 58 advanced nuclear technology projects in 25 states.

The NEUP was created in 2009 to consolidate the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy's university support under one programme (Image: NEUP)

The awards include USD25.8 million for some 40 university-led research and development projects plus USD1.6 million for seven university-led research reactor and infrastructure improvements under the Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP).

Five research and development projects led by DOE national laboratories and US universities will receive a total of USD4.5 million in funding to conduct research to address ""crosscutting nuclear energy challenges"" that will help to develop advanced sensors and instrumentation, advanced manufacturing methods, and materials for multiple nuclear reactor plant and fuel applications. These include a project led by Los Alamos National Laboratory to determine the feasibility of laser additive manufacturing for producing reactor components of a ferritic/martensitic steel with an engineered microstructure, which is earmarked for an estimated USD1 million of funding.

Two university-, one national laboratory- and three industry-led projects to investigate important nuclear fuel and material applications will receive support under the Nuclear Science User Facilities (NSUF) programme. DOE will support three of these projects a total of USD1.5 million in research funds, while supporting all six by more than USD10 million in facility access costs and expertise for experimental neutron and ion irradiation testing, post-irradiation examination facilities, synchrotron beamline capabilities, and technical assistance for design and analysis of experiments. Two of the NEUP projects will also be supported with USD3 million in NSUF access funds.

""DOE is looking to the future, and that's why we are investing in advanced nuclear technologies. Nuclear energy is a critical part of our all-of-the-above energy strategy, and early-stage research can help ensure it will continue to be a clean, reliable, and resilient source of electricity for a long time to come,"" said DOE Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Ed McGinnis said.

The DOE Office of Nuclear Energy has now awarded more than USD678 million through its university programmes since 2009, the department said.
