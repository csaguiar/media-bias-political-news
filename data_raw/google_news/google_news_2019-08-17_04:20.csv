By Friday afternoon, more than 70,000 tweets had been shared using the hashtag #EmptySeatMAGATour, many of which included footage and photos from Trump’s rally at the SNHU Arena in Manchester the night before.

Most footage from the event showed large crowds as the president spoke, though one tweet that went viral highlighted a video clip from MSNBC showing Trump delivering remarks with a number of empty seats off to one side of the stage.

Other critics used the specific images to swipe at Trump, who has a history of boasting about the size of his campaign rallies.

Trump keeps saying his rallies are full, but doesn’t look like it.



Wow, I would hate for #EmptySeatMAGATour to trend so people knew the truth.

Some sought to defend the president's crowd sizes during the rally Thursday night while pushing back on the trending hashtag Friday, pointing to other photos of the stadium where seating was filled.

Such a joke that #EmptySeatMAGATour somehow trends up at the top with like 5,000 total tweets...I’m sure it’s “organic”



Even funnier that lefties share pictures from before Trump took the stage to find a couple empty seats.

The left finds 12 seats out of 12k that are empty because secret service left them empty for security, then they run a fake hashtags like #EmptySeatMAGATour while there were literally 10k+ people watching the rally outside.

Police said the audience Thursday night for Trump's rally in New Hampshire was expected to reach as many as 11,000, a local NBC affiliate in Boston reported. The SNHU Arena has a capacity of 11,770.

The president sought to show off the large crowd that showed up at the rally Thursday night, sharing photos of the event later that night and pointing out the audience size.

"White House expected to move forward with plan to cancel foreign aid, teeing up fight with Congress",https://www.cnn.com,"['Jennifer Hansler', 'Manu Raju']",08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/politics/omb-rescission-package-foreign-aid-funding/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration is expected to put forward a plan to cancel billions of dollars in foreign aid funding by the end of this week, a senior administration official told CNN on Friday, teeing up a fight between the White House and Congress over the rarely used and controversial move known as rescission.

Bipartisan lawmakers and foreign policy advocates have spoken out publicly against the move to cancel funds to the State Department and US Agency for International Development, warning about their impact on US foreign policy priorities. Behind the scenes, congressional appropriators from both parties and State Department officials have lobbied the White House to back off the planned cuts, which could be up to $4 billion. The Trump administration has sought to decrease what it believes is wasteful spending and make foreign aid more conditional on support for US policies. White House officials believe they have the authority to cancel the funds without congressional approval.

The official told CNN that the Office of Management and Budget was working to finalize some of the terms of the rescission package, but they expect it to be made public at the beginning of next week. The official said the rescission includes money to the United Nations -- including some peacekeeping funds -- funding for the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, and cultural programs.

The official said the rescission package will not totally zero out the funding in the accounts. CNN reported on Wednesday that projects spearheaded by Ivanka Trump and Vice President Mike Pence , as well as global health funding, would be spared from cancellation. The official said it should come as no surprise that President Donald Trump's policy priorities would be exempt.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a typically staunch supporter of the President, and Republican Rep. Hal Rogers wrote to Trump Friday to express their concern over the proposed cancellation.

'A complete setup': Trump criticizes Tlaib for declining Israel's approval to see elderly grandmother,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Rebecca Morin', 'Published P.M. Et Aug.']",08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/16/trump-tlaibs-decision-not-visit-west-bank-a-complete-setup/2035386001/,"CLOSE Rep. Rashida Tlaib says she will not go to the West Bank to visit her grandmother, citing ""oppressive conditions."" Her decision comes after Israel granted her permission to enter the country. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump bashed Rep. Rashida Tlaib for declining Israel's approval to visit her grandmother in the West Bank, claiming that the Michigan Democrat's initial travel request was a ""complete setup.""

""Israel was very respectful & nice to Rep. Rashida Tlaib, allowing her permission to visit her 'grandmother.' As soon as she was granted permission, she grandstanded & loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel,"" Trump wrote in a tweet. ""Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately!""

In another tweet, Trump said Tlaib had ""obnoxiously"" turn down Israel's approval following the letter she wrote about wanting to see her grandmother. The situation was ""a complete setup,"" the president added.

""The only real winner here is Tlaib’s grandmother,"" Trump wrote in the tweet. ""She doesn’t have to see her now!""

Citing ""racist treatment"" and ""oppressive conditions,"" Tlaib, who is of Palestinian descent, announced Friday morning that she will not be going to the West Bank, hours after Israel said it would allow the progressive congresswoman to visit the occupied territory.

Tlaib, along with Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., had planned to travel to Jerusalem and the West Bank, among other stops, this weekend. Tlaib and Omar are the first Muslim women elected to Congress.

Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri in a statement on Friday granted approval for Tlaib to access the West Bank on humanitarian grounds to visit her grandmother. A letter that Tlaib also wrote requesting to see her grandmother was published by Deri's office. In the letter, Tlaib said she'd respect any restrictions and “not promote boycotts” while in the country.

However in a tweet following Deri's announcement, Tlaib said she was not going to travel to the West Bank and Israel because ""visiting my grandmother under these oppressive conditions meant to humiliate me would break my grandmother's heart.""

""Silencing me with treatment to make me feel less-than is not what she wants for me – it would kill a piece of me that always stands up against racism and injustice,"" Tlaib wrote in a statement.

Silencing me & treating me like a criminal is not what she wants for me. It would kill a piece of me. I have decided that visiting my grandmother under these oppressive conditions stands against everything I believe in--fighting against racism, oppression & injustice. https://t.co/z5t5j3qk4H — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) August 16, 2019

Deri in a tweet responded to Tlaib's statement, saying he approved her request ""as a gesture of goodwill on a humanitarian basis."" He also claimed that ""her hate for Israel overcomes her love for her grandmother."" Deri tagged Trump in the tweet.

Deri's decision also came less than 24 hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu barred Tlaib and Omar from entering the country. Netanyahu's announcement came hours after Trump tweeted that Israel should take that step and bar two sitting members of Congress from visiting the longtime U.S. ally.

The president has repeatedly attacked Tlaib and Omar, members of the ""Squad"" along with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.

Setting off a firestorm in Washington, in July, Trump tweeted that the four Democratic congresswomen should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."" All four lawmakers are U.S. citizens. Omar immigrated from Somalia when she was a child and is a naturalized citizen.

"Some jail staffers not cooperating with DOJ investigation into Epstein suicide, source says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Vandana Rambaran', 'Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News', 'Politics At Foxnews.Com. She Can Be Found On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/prison-personnel-refuse-to-cooperate-with-doj-investigators-digging-into-epstein-suicide,"Personnel at the New York City prison where accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide last week have not been initially cooperative with investigators from the Department of Justice, a federal source told Fox News Friday.

Attorney General William Barr sent two senior DOJ officials to personally visit the Metropolitan Correctional Center and speak with staff from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in order to gather information on Epstein's death after Barr said officials uncovered ""serious irregularities"" at the jail, a senior DOJ official told Fox News. The officials have been on site since Thursday and the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general are investigating conditions at the MCC.

NEW YORK MEDICAL EXAMINER: JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S DEATH WAS A SUICIDE BY HANGING

BOP officials from various regional offices have also been sent to the Manhattan facility to lend their expertise and insight. In addition, a separate BOP ""After Action Team"" went to MCC earlier this week in an effort to examine what happened the night Epstein died. The use of the ""After Action Team"" is part of BOP protocol whenever a ""significant event takes place at a prison.

Epstein was found dead in his cell on Aug. 10. Earlier Friday, New York City's medical examiner officially ruled the 66-year-old's death a suicide by hanging.

Fox News has also learned that 20 of 21 prison staff posts were filled between the hours of 4 p.m. and 12 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 9, the day before Epstein was found. Of those prison workers, six of them were working voluntary overtime. Between 12 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 10, 18 of 19 staff posts were filled. Of those 18 staffers, 10 were working overtime and all but one of those were doing so voluntarily.

Conspiracy theories swirled following Epstein's death, as many wondered how the wealthy financier could have been able to kill himself in a high-security facility just over two weeks after being placed on suicide watch, though officials later confirmed Epstein had been taken off suicide watch shortly before his death.

Correctional officers did not check in with Epstein for ""several hours"" before his death, despite being required to visit him every 30 minutes, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News earlier this week.

Jail guards on duty the night of Epstein's death are also suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were checking on inmates every half-hour as required, The Associated Press reported, citing several people familiar with the matter.

Two staffers have been placed on administrative leave and the MCC's warden has been reassigned pending an investigation.

Late Friday, Epstein's attorneys issued a statement decrying what they described as ""the harsh, even medieval conditions at the MCC.""

""It is indisputable that the authorities violated their own protocols,"" Martin Weinberg, Reid Weingarten and Michael Miller said. ""The defense team fully intends to conduct its own independent and complete investigation into the circumstances and cause of Mr. Epstein’s death including if necessary legal action to view the pivotal videos - if they exist as they should - of the area proximate to Mr. Epstein's cell during the time period leading to his death.

""We are not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical examiner,"" the statement concluded. "" We will have a more complete response in the coming days

"State Department officials berated staff, labeled some 'traitors,' report says",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/politics/state-department-officials-watchdog-report-political-retaliation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Top officials in the State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs subjected employees to ""disrespectful and hostile treatment,"" accusations of disloyalty, and retaliation, a long-awaited report from the department's watchdog agency found. The report also said the bureau's leadership ""did not take significant action"" to address these concerns.

""Nearly every employee interviewed by OIG raised concerns about the leadership of IO and the treatment of staff,"" according to the report released Thursday by the State Department Office of Inspector General.

The bureau's leaders labeled some employees ""traitors,"" if they felt they didn't support President Donald Trump. They berated others for following procedures, punished staff for not doing work the department's Office of the Legal Adviser had deemed ""inappropriate"" and targeted others for retaliation, in one case because of a staffer's ""relationship with the gay and lesbian community.""

'Six to eight hostile interactions per day'

""Although some IO employees reported that they had never witnessed Assistant Secretary Moley or Ms. Stull behave unprofessionally, the majority of employees OIG interviewed either directly experienced hostile treatment or witnessed such treatment directed at others,"" the report said. ""In fact, one IO employee told OIG that working with Ms. Stull involved 'six to eight hostile interactions per day.'""

Stull left the department in January 2019 ; Moley remains in his post. Moley participated in an interview with the OIG, but Stull declined.

The report cited numerous examples of Stull and Moley berating employees for following established department procedures for tasks ranging from sending briefings to booking travel accommodations.

'Inappropriate accusations of disloyalty'

Stull and Moley also ""made inappropriate accusations of disloyalty and made positive or negative comments about employees based on perceived political views,"" according to the report.

""For example, several career employees reported that throughout her tenure at the Department, Ms. Stull referred to them or to other career employees as 'Obama holdovers,' 'traitors,' or 'disloyal,'"" the report said. ""Other career employees told OIG that Ms. Stull accused them of being part of the 'Deep State' and that the Assistant Secretary accused them of 'undermining the President's agenda.'""

In one instance, the report noted, Stull ""expressed displeasure"" with a legislative affairs employee accompanying a delegation of the Congressional Black Caucus ""because it consisted of only Democratic members."" Stull accused the employee ""of trying to 'thwart' President Trump and undermine his agenda"" and many of the employee's job responsibilities were reassigned. That employee eventually left the State Department.

Retaliation

Moley and Stull retaliated against other employees as well, according to the report. Moley removed a principal deputy assistant secretary, a career diplomat, after she raised concerns about Stull's treatment of employees and conflict of interest.

Moley ""told the PDAS that he did not believe that her concerns about Ms. Stull were valid"" and ""it was obvious to him that she had problems working with Ms. Stull and that, therefore, the PDAS should be prepared to leave the bureau,"" according to the report.

In another instance, the OIG found that Moley had canceled the selection process for a deputy director position in order to support Stull's move to block the leading candidate for that post. Stull did not like the candidate's work with the UN agency that aids Palestinian refugees -- a point which Moley confirmed to the OIG. Stull also reportedly had a problem with that candidate's ""relationship with the gay and lesbian community,"" according to the report.

She criticized two career employees ""whom she believed had been insufficiently supportive of her position"" in a work dispute stemming from her time at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. She also attempted to remove work responsibilities from one of those employees for failing to assist her, despite the fact that what she had asked them to do was deemed ""inappropriate"" by the Office of the Legal Adviser.

Failure to address concerns

Despite concerns raised by both IO employees and State Department management, Moley did little to address them, according to the report. Moley told OIG ""that no employees had 'ever' raised concerns with him regarding morale or treatment of employees.""

However, the report said he had conversations with two undersecretaries in April and on June 13, 2018, and with Deputy Secretary John Sullivan on June 25, 2018 regarding the issues raised about his bureau. In each, he was advised to address the misbehavior.

In the June 13 meeting, he was directed to take several steps -- let all IO employees know about his commitment to inclusion, develop a staffing plan to address two IO departures, ensure that Stull had recused herself from all activities related to her prior work at the UN, and direct her to stop ""all further public engagement"" criticizing State Department employees.

Although Moley took some of these steps, the misconduct continued. The report noted that OIG continued to receive reports about ""hostile treatment of employees, allegations of disloyalty, and conflicts of interest"" throughout the course of its review.

'We won't stop until this culture of impunity is ended'

The watchdog recommended in its report that the State Department ""develop a corrective action plan to address the leadership and management deficiencies"" in IO within 60 days. It also noted the department should consider whether to take disciplinary action for the conduct described in the 34-page document. The State Department agreed with both of these recommendations, the report said.

Thursday's report presented the findings of one of two OIG investigations into political retaliation at the department. It was opened in June 2018 after members of Congress expressed concern to the State Department about allegations of Stull's vetting of career employees were reported by Foreign Policy Magazine.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel said Thursday that the report ""confirms what we feared: 'disrespectful and hostile' treatment of career employees at the State Department."" The New York Democrat urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to fire Moley.

""There is more to come, and I hope it comes very soon. The delays from the Department on this matter have been frustrating. The House Foreign Affairs Committee, along with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is conducting an independent inquiry on these matters, and we won't stop until this culture of impunity is ended and everyone responsible faces stiff consequences,"" Engel said in a statement."
DOJ files brief with Supreme Court opposing workplace discrimination claims by transgender workers,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Shannon Bream', ""Shannon Bream Currently Serves As Anchor Of Fox News Channel'S"", 'Fnc']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-files-brief-with-supreme-court-opposing-workplace-discrimination-claims-from-transgender-workers,"The Justice Department is signaling its opposition to providing federal protections for transgender employees who claim workplace discrimination.

In a brief filed Friday at the Supreme Court, the Trump administration is opposing the position taken by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which had been supporting a transgender employee in her lawsuit against a Michigan funeral home.

LINDSEY GRAHAM SLAMS DEM COLLEAGUES FOR BRAZEN WARNING TO SUPREME COURT

The justices will hear a pair of arguments Oct. 8 on whether the federal Civil Rights Act’s Title VII laws permit LGBTQ workers to sue for job discrimination. Federal courts have been divided on whether such protections apply, even though Congress did not specially mention that class of individuals when the law was passed more than five decades ago.

The cases involve challenges by gay men in Georgia and New York, and a separate case involving a Detroit-area funeral home that terminated a longtime employee after she began transitioning. Aimee Stephens first took her complaint to the EEOC, which ruled in her favor, as did a federal appeals court in Cincinnati.

The funeral home has argued in part that Congress was not thinking about transgender people when it included sex discrimination in Title VII.

In its filing with the high court on Friday, the Justice Department said the dispute is over the limits of the definition of “sex.”

“A transgender plaintiff therefore cannot prevail in a Title VII suit simply by showing that an employer relied on sex stereotypes,” said the administration.

The plaintiff must show that the employer treated similarly situated members of the opposite sex more favorably.

“Like any other plaintiff, a transgender person may use evidence of sex stereotyping in making that showing,” the DOJ wrote. “But the individual’s transgender status does not alter the legal standard. Here, Harris Homes did not discriminate against Stephens based on sex stereotypes in violation of Title VII. It terminated Stephens for refusing to comply with Harris Homes’ sex-specific dress code.”

Sources told Fox News that the Justice Department had been trying for weeks to get the EEOC to change its official position and support the new brief, but that a majority of commission members had refused.

It sets up an unusual dynamic of potentially having two federal entities opposing one another in court. It was unclear whether the EEOC would clarify its own legal position with the Supreme Court.

The Trump administration’s position is a setback for LGBTQ rights. Officials are also asking for courts to allow enforcement of its ban on transgender people joining the U.S. military to proceed."

Top State Department aide stays on despite 'hostile' behavior reports,https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/16/state-ig-report-fallout-1466639,"A new inspector general report detailed “disrespectful and hostile” treatment of career staffers in the State Department bureau of International Organization Affairs. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images foreign policy Top State Department aide stays on despite 'hostile' behavior reports Kevin Moley, an assistant secretary of State, was one of two officials taken to task in a new inspector general report that detailed 'disrespectful and hostile' behavior.

State Department employees are angry that a Trump administration political appointee appears set to keep his job after an investigation found evidence he’d acted abusively and ignored repeated warnings to shift his behavior.

Kevin Moley, an assistant secretary of State, was one of two officials taken to task in a new inspector general report that detailed “disrespectful and hostile” treatment of career staffers in the bureau of International Organization Affairs.

Story Continued Below

Yet there’s no sign that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo plans to oust him or that Moley will quit. The most the department’s top leadership has said so far is that it will “consider additional discipline” for Moley. High-level State officials also told the inspector general that Moley “has already been counseled regarding his leadership,” and that the department is preparing “a corrective action plan” for the bureau.

Moley’s continued presence could dampen already low morale within the bureau and raise questions about Pompeo’s commitment to accountability, current and former staffers said.

Some top Democrats in Congress agree.

“Mr. Moley should resign or be fired,” said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He added: “Ultimately, of course, the buck stops with Secretary Pompeo, who continues to employ Mr. Moley as part of his senior leadership team.”

New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also believes Moley needs to go, an aide said.

Deputies to Pompeo did not respond directly to a request for comment on whether the chief diplomat would fire Moley. The other official criticized in the report, Mari Stull, was a top adviser to Moley and has already left the State Department.

Moley did not reply to a request for comment for this report. But he sent the inspector general a lengthy response to the allegations in the report. He insisted for the most part that each situation was mischaracterized, or that he interpreted them in a different way. For others, he argued that he was not involved in or did not recall the incidents.

“The behavior attributed to me regarding raising my voice, berating employees and contributing to a hostile work environment does not represent the person I am or have ever been,” he wrote. Looking ahead, he insisted that he remains “committed to promoting a positive work environment.”

The current undersecretary of State for political affairs, David Hale, emailed the staff of the international organization affairs bureau on Thursday in light of the inspector general report's release. In the email, obtained by POLITICO, Hale assures staffers that the matter has his ""full attention"" and promises to hold a meeting with the bureau the last week of August.

The inspector general’s investigation into the bureau, which deals with institutions such as the United Nations, was based on more than 40 interviews and a review of thousands of emails.

It not only found a pattern of misbehavior, it also noted that Moley was repeatedly told to fix the problems, including by reining in Stull, the focus of a huge number of complaints.

Then-Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon, then-Acting Undersecretary Stephen Mull and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan all raised concerns with Moley. But according to the inspector general, Moley “did not take significant action to respond to such concerns.”

Moley and Stull are accused of targeting career government staffers because they suspected those staffers were disloyal to President Donald Trump. At least one staffer was unfairly stripped of duties and quit the department, the report says.

Career government staffers are expected to carry out the priorities of whoever is in charge of the White House, regardless of political party. Their existence allows for an accumulation of expertise in the government and assures some continuity between administrations.

But many Trump appointees came into office believing that a “deep state” exists within the government bureaucracy and that it is determined to undermine the new president.

Moley’s online bio lists him as having held several government positions in the past, including at the Department of Health and Human Services. He has a military background and also has engaged in humanitarian work. A former senior State Department official said Moley often presented himself as a “Bush Republican” not a “Trumpian.”

The inspector general’s report has sparked many conversations at Foggy Bottom, current and former State staffers said.

Several expressed frustration to POLITICO about Moley’s continued role. Some were confused because Pompeo recently fired another political appointee, Kiron Skinner, who ran State’s Policy Planning division, over claims of abusive behavior.

Others pointed out that the inspector general is still working on another investigation into political retaliation against career staffers. That probe includes an examination of claims against people who have held or still hold positions that report directly to the secretary — either Pompeo or his predecessor, Rex Tillerson.

Trump admin argues transgender workers aren't protected by civil rights law in new Supreme Court filing,https://thehill.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/457780-trump-admin-argues-in-supreme-court-filing-that-transgender,"The Trump administration on Friday filed a brief with the Supreme Court arguing that federal civil rights laws do not protect transgender workers.

The filing relates to the case of Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman who was fired as the funeral director of R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. in Detroit after she told owner Thomas Rost that she planned to transition from male to female and would be representing herself as a woman while at work.

In March 2018, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the funeral home had violated Title VII anti-discrimination laws in the decision, with the court ruling that “discrimination on the basis of transgender and transitioning status is necessarily discrimination on the basis of sex"" and therefore protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

However, in their court filing submitted Friday, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco and Department of Justice attorneys argued that the specific Civil Rights Act provision “does not bar discrimination because of transgender status,” meaning the Michigan funeral home was within its right to fire Stephens.

“In 1964, the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex. It did not encompass transgender status,” the brief reads. “In the particular context of Title VII — legislation originally designed to eliminate employment discrimination against racial and other minorities — it was especially clear that the prohibition on discrimination because of ‘sex’ referred to unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace.”

If the Supreme Court sides with the Trump administration, it would overturn the previous ruling by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, and mark a major blow to LGBT rights.

The move comes hours after the Log Cabin Republicans endorsed President Trump Donald John TrumpWarren unveils Native American policy plan Live-action 'Mulan' star spurs calls for boycott with support of Hong Kong police Don't let other countries unfairly tax America's most innovative companies MORE's 2020 reelection bid, reversing its decision four years ago when the conservative LGBT organization declined to endorse then-candidate Trump in 2016.

The group said Friday in its decision that Trump has helped advance LGBT rights through policies seeking to end the spread of HIV/AIDS as well as his push to get other countries to conform to modern human rights standards.

Trump has referred to himself as the “most pro-LGBT presidential nominee in the history of the Republican Party,"" but has come under fire for his transgender military ban, which reversed the Obama-era policy of allowing transgender individuals to openly serve in the military.

The ban was formally upheld by the Supreme Court earlier this year after facing multiple legal challenges."
Lawmakers demand VA fix emergency claims after report shows vets wrongly paid $53 million,https://thehill.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/457792-lawmakers-demand-va-fix-emergency-claims-after-report-shows-vets-wrongly-paid,"Lawmakers are demanding answers in the wake of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) watchdog report report that found $53 million in veterans' medical claims were wrongly denied over just a six-month period.

The bipartisan group of 35 lawmakers wrote VA Secretary Robert Wilkie Robert Leon WilkieVA to allow religious symbols at facilities Overnight Health Care: Court allows Trump abortion referral ban to take effect | GOP group launches M blitz against 'Medicare for All' | Star GOP lawyer raises constitutional concerns with surprise billing legislation VA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides MORE this week calling the VA inspector general's report ""damning"" and asking him to reconsider claims that should have been paid to veterans.

The inspector general report released last week showed that thousands of emergency care claims were denied between April 1 and Sept. 30 of 2017. An estimated 17,400 veterans were stuck paying medical bills totaling $53.3 million.

The watchdog report suggested one reason for the millions in rejected claims was due to the VA prioritizing speed over accuracy and offering incentives including overtime pay for claims processed quickly. The report found approximately 31 percent of denied or rejected claims were not properly processed.

“Facing a medical emergency can be stressful for any patient; however, the financial toll on veterans when VA erroneously denies or rejects payment can also be devastating,” the lawmakers' letter reads. “Nonpayment can bankrupt and destroy veterans’ credit histories. These administrative errors can remain with veterans for the rest of their lives.”

The recent findings followed a 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that detailed similar issues involving the VA.

In their letter this week, lawmakers questioned why past issues raised by the GAO had not been addressed.

“This is not new territory for the VA,” the lawmakers wrote. “More than five years ago, GAO found that VA’s weak oversight of emergency care claims adjudication could lead to inappropriate denial of claims. It is disappointing the department has not done enough to improve.”

India accuses Pakistan of stoking 'jihad' as Trump sides with New Delhi in territorial dispute,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-17-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/india-accuses-pakistan-of-stoking-jihad-as-trump-sides-with-new-delhi-in-territorial-dispute,"Pakistan is stoking terrorism against India in the wake of an administrative change in contested territory, according to a top Indian diplomat.

“One state is using terminology of jihad against and promoting violence in India,” Syed Akbaruddin, India’s ambassador at the United Nations, told reporters Friday. “All issues between India and Pakistan — as well as between India and any other country — will be resolved bilaterally, peacefully, and in a manner that behooves normal inter-state relations between countries.”

The envoy made that comment following a rare Security Council meeting on the tensions in Kashmir, a Muslim-majority border region that has driven the rivalry between nuclear-armed neighbors Pakistan and India. The closed-door consultations took place after India tightened control of the territory on the Indian side of the unofficial boundary that has divided the region for decades, a limited diplomatic victory for Pakistan, which is trying to rally international condemnation of the decision.

“The fact that this meeting took place is testimony to the fact that this is an internationally recognized dispute,” Maleeha Lodhi, the Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters after the meeting. “I think today this meeting nullifies India’s claim that Jammu and Kashmir is an internal matter for India.”

China bolstered Pakistan’s diplomatic position, backing the call for a Security Council session and criticizing India’s decision to rescind the semi-autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir and put the region on lockdown over the last two weeks.

“It’s obvious that the constitutional amendment by India has changed the status quo in Kashmir, causing tensions in the region,” Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters after the briefing.

India has implemented strict security measures since making the administrative change, cutting internet access and imposing a nightly curfew that police have enforced by shooting pellet guns at local residents. Akbaruddin defended those policies by noting that no one has died in the combustible territory since the central government revoked the semi-autonomous status of the region, and promised that the government would ""move towards normalcy” gradually.

“India remains committed to ensure that the situation there remains calm and peaceful,” he said.

Kashmir has been dubbed “the world’s most dangerous place,” as Pakistan and India have fought two full-scale wars, in addition to the Kargil Conflict of 1999, for control of the territory. But the region is also a hotbed of terrorist groups that operate with Pakistan’s tactic approval, which has diminished Western opposition to the move. The United States implicitly sided with India on Friday, echoing India’s rhetoric about the controversy in a summary of a phone call between President Trump and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan.

“The president conveyed the importance of India and Pakistan reducing tensions through bilateral dialogue regarding the situation in Jammu and Kashmir,” the White House press office announced.

In parallel, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s team highlighted the opportunities for U.S.-India cooperation in a readout of a meeting between Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan and Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in New Delhi.

“They also discussed our complementary visions of a free and open Indo-Pacific region and how best to advance our cooperation, including with like-minded partners,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Friday in a bulletin that made no explicit reference to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

The differing maneuvers by Chinese and American diplomats over the last week reflect the broader geopolitical stakes of the controversy, according to experts in South Asia policy. China regards Pakistan as a key partner in its effort to gain access to a strategically significant port, while the United States hopes that India will function as a counterweight to Beijing’s ambitions in the Indo-Pacific region.

“I think that the Kashmir issue in general over the past year has been a positive for the U.S. and a negative for China,” Jeff Smith, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, told the Washington Examiner. “What this did was, I think, underscore where the alignment stands now, with the U.S. sort of taking an India-friendly position that it's internal and China doing it's best to symbolically at least support Pakistan's decision, which earns it really no goodwill [with India].”

China’s envoy at the United Nations ended his criticism on a conciliatory note. “Both India and Pakistan are China’s friendly neighbors and we are all major developing countries,” Zhang said.

The remarks irritated India nonetheless, as Akbaruddin accused the Chinese and Pakistani diplomats of trying to “masquerade” as if they were expressing “the will of the international community” before putting the blame for any ensuing violence on China’s ally, Pakistan.

“We are saddened that terrorism is being fueled, language and incendiary talk of jihad is being mentioned by people who should know better,” the Indian diplomat said. “We stand ready to continue our efforts towards peaceful resolutions of all issues in an atmosphere free of terrorism and violence.”"
Justice Department Sides With LED ZEPPELIN In 'Stairway To Heaven' Copyright Case,https://www.blabbermouth.net,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/justice-department-sides-with-led-zeppelin-in-stairway-to-heaven-copyright-case/,"According to NBC News, the Justice Department filed a friend of court brief late Thursday supporting LED ZEPPELIN in the ""Stairway To Heaven"" copyright lawsuit.

Last September, a federal appeals court decided unanimously to overturn a jury's decision that LED ZEPPELIN's 1971 classic was not a rip-off of SPIRIT's song.

Michael Skidmore, the trustee of ""Taurus"" songwriter Randy ""California"" Wolfe's estate, had brought the claims more than four decades after ""Stairway To Heaven"" appeared on LED ZEPPELIN's untitled album, better known as ""Led Zeppelin IV"".

In its brief filed Thursday, the Justice Department said the trial judge got it right when he ruled that the only work subject to copyright protection was the sheet music, because the song was written before Congress changed the law in 1972, which gave protection to sound recordings.

In June 2016, a Los Angeles jury deliberated for about five hours before deciding unanimously in favor of LED ZEPPELIN.

The verdict in the LED ZEPPELIN case came down within 15 minutes of the jury's request to re-listen to both SPIRIT's ""Taurus"" and ""Stairway To Heaven"". They wanted to hear a section of each song twice, alternating from one to the other. They decided that what they heard wasn't substantially similar enough to call it copyright infringement.

Skidmore appealed, and in September, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decided a new trial was needed because the judge who presided over a 2016 trial had given erroneous and prejudicial instructions to the jury.

The court said the judge erred by telling the jury that common musical elements, such as ""descending chromatic scales, arpeggios or short sequences of three notes,"" were not protected by copyright. The court also said the jury should have been permitted to hear the album recording of ""Taurus"".

Plaintiff's attorney Francis Malofiy later claimed he lost his case on a technicality, insisting that it was unfair the jury was unable to listen to the sound recording of ""Taurus"" and instead was limited to hearing an expert performance of the registered sheet music.

Malofiy received over a hundred sustained objections and ""multiple admonishments"" during the ZEPPELIN trial, with the band's publishing company Warner/Chappell Music filing documents asking the judge to order the plaintiffs to pay over $613,000 in costs for defending against the lawsuit."
Advocates Slam New U.S. Labor Rule as ‘License to Discriminate’ Against LGBTQ Workers,https://www.snopes.com,['Bethania Palma'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/08/16/labor-rule-lgbtq-people/,"The U.S. Department of Labor in mid-August 2019 made public a proposed rule change that expands the field of employers who can use religion as a criterion for hiring and firing people while those employers still receive federal contracts. The proposal received harsh pushback from critics who say it will allow public dollars to be paid out to organizations that discriminate against members of the public.

Until now, the practice has been that, “If you want to work for the public, with public money, you have to be willing to employ the public,” Jennifer Pizer, law and policy director for Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal-advocacy organization, told The New York Times.

According to the Labor Department, the announcement by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), the agency’s civil rights division, is a rule change intended to protect the civil rights of employers. Per the agency, “The proposed rule would clarify that religious organizations may make employment decisions consistent with their sincerely held religious tenets and beliefs without fear of sanction by the federal government.”

We asked the department to clarify, and an agency spokesperson told us in an emailed statement that, “The exemption entitles an organization to take an applicant or employee’s religion into account when making employment decisions. It does not entitle an organization to take race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or veteran status into account.”

But advocates say the federal agency is protecting the religious rights of employers at the expense of their workers’ civil rights. Ian Thompson, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said in a statement that the new rule was an effort to “license taxpayer-funded discrimination in the name of religion,” vowing a legal challenge.

“Nearly one-quarter of the employees in the U.S. work for an employer that has a contract with the federal government,” Thompson’s statement read. “We will work to stop this rule that seeks to undermine our civil rights protections and encourages discrimination in the workplace.”

Naomi Goldberg, policy research director of the LGBTQ advocacy think tank Movement Advancement Project, told The New York Times that the new rule could put in jeopardy workers who are unmarried and pregnant, “workers who may not be coreligionists or who can’t sign a statement of faith, unmarried cohabiting workers and L.G.B.T. workers.”

The Washington Blade, a news outlet that focuses on LGBTQ issues, reported that the proposed rule undermines a 2017 declaration by the Trump White House that it would leave in place a 2014 executive order by the preceding Obama administration that protects LGBTQ people from workplace discrimination.

Others agreed.

“With this proposed regulation, the Trump administration is seeking to gut existing protections for LGBTQ people, women, and religious minorities, and we cannot stand idly by,” Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David said in a statement. “This regulation, which directly contradicts Trump’s earlier promise, is a broad and sweeping effort to implement a license to discriminate against people on the basis of their gender identity and sexual orientation.”

The public has 30 days to comment on the rule proposal after the date of publication. All comments must be submitted by Sept. 16, 2019."
E.P.A. Backtracks on Use of ‘Cyanide Bombs’ to Kill Wild Animals,https://www.nytimes.com,['Neil Vigdor'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/us/epa-cyanide-bombs.html,"The federal Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday withdrew its support for the continued use of so-called cyanide bombs to protect livestock from predators, reversing course amid strong opposition to the practice.

The E.P.A. administrator, Andrew R. Wheeler, said he was withdrawing an interim reauthorization for the use of M-44 devices, which are used to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals that prey on livestock. The agency, he added, would re-evaluate the highly criticized practice.

“This issue warrants further analysis and additional discussions by E.P.A. with the registrants of this predacide,” Mr. Wheeler said in a statement on Thursday. “I look forward to continuing this dialogue to ensure U.S. livestock remain well protected from dangerous predators while simultaneously minimizing off-target impacts on both humans and nonpredatory animals.”

The federal Department of Agriculture, along with its state counterpart agencies in Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, have relied on the M-44s for farming since the mid-1970s."
Sean Hannity: Sources say 'most explosive' part of DOJ review is about 'outsourcing of illegal intelligence-gathering',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-sources-say-most-explosive-part-of-doj-review-about-outsourcing-of-illegal-intelligence-gathering,"Fox News host Sean Hannity said his sources are telling him the most ""explosive"" finding in the Justice Department review on the origins of the Russia investigation has to do with illegal intelligence-gathering on American citizens.

Hannity first mentioned this during his show Thursday evening while speaking to the Hill's John Solomon, who said DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's soon-to-be-released report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses will find ""a lot more wrong than right"" and will be ""difficult"" for former top FBI officials such as James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok.

Hannity said there is some discrepancy between what he and Solomon expect in the watchdog report and the Justice Department inquiry being run by Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham, who are examining the behavior of the FBI and Justice Department for possible wrongdoing.

""I want to know who's going to be held responsible. Because If I lie to a court, and I premeditated a fraud on the court, I have a funny feeling there’s not a lawyer in the country that is going to save my sorry ass from being sent to jail. I’m just guessing, but maybe — I’m Irish, I'm pessimistic,"" he said.

""Let me ask you this. So, we both agree on those. You think there might be an IG report alone on leaking?"" Hannity added, to which Solomon agreed.

""And I’m expecting, from what my sources are telling me, Durham, Barr, and everybody else, to get to the origins of what is a counterintelligence investigation, which Andy McCarthy rightly points out in his new book, would mean Obama knew because the president has to sign off on it but that origins of this counterintelligence investigation, what did Obama know, when did he know it?"" Hannity said.

He was referring to former U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy, who is promoting his new book, Ball of Collusion, and Thursday on Fox & Friends accused Obama of improperly using counterintelligence powers and law enforcement to assist Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.

""But more importantly,"" Hannity continued, ""What will Barr, Durham, come out with in terms of — let's say the Barr-Durham report? ... Or whatever that ends up being. Because I hear that is where the single most explosive bit of information, outsourcing of illegal intelligence-gathering for the sake of circumventing American laws, took place, and a lot of people would be found in violation of spying on Americans against the law.""

Solomon warned that he did not want to get ahead of the Justice Department's findings, but did say that the Barr and Durham review will provide ""a much broader view"" of alleged spy tactics than what the IG report will show because they are not limited to what went on in the Justice Department.

Hannity later noted how there is ""a lot of activity"" in Europe tied to these investigative efforts, including the 16-hour interview conducted with British ex-spy Christopher Steele earlier this summer. He also suggested the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia were roped into the inquiry.

Steele's anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause."
Don't laugh: Trump’s idea of buying Greenland isn’t entirely wacky,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/dont-laugh-trumps-idea-of-buying-greenland-isnt-entirely-wacky,"President Trump’s idea of buying Greenland from Denmark probably has a slimmer chance of happening than hitting an iceberg at the equator. But the suggestion shows constructive, creative thinking, and it’s an intriguing idea.

At 836,330 square miles, Greenland is almost precisely the size of Alaska and California put together. It is rich in coal, zinc, copper, and iron ore. Perhaps even more important, it could have significant strategic military value by providing bases in the North Atlantic and particularly in the Arctic, where Russia repeatedly makes territorial claims (including to the North Pole itself) that are spurious but provocative and potentially destabilizing.

Granted, the United States already has a key military installation there, the Thule Air Base, which (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “includes a radar station that is part of a U.S. ballistic missile early-warning system. The base is also used by the U.S. Air Force Space Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command.”

There seems no danger of Denmark abrogating the treaty that gives the U.S. the right to operate Thule. But still, ownership makes things permanent, and of course it would allow the U.S. to create other bases in Greenland if needed.

The U.S. has intermittently expressed an interest in buying Greenland since 1867, and in 1946, President Harry Truman actually offered to purchase it for $100 million (the equivalent of $1.316 billion today).

While there is absolutely no sign that Denmark or the mostly autonomous Greenlanders themselves would be interested in becoming part of the U.S., it does make a certain sense for them. Greenland holds no military value for a nation as small as Denmark, which has no need to worry itself with “force projection” the way the U.S. does. And while the natural resources could be as valuable to Denmark as they would be to the U.S., Denmark right now spends nearly $600 million annually in subsidies to Greenland’s government. Ridding itself of those costs, plus getting a big lump-sump payment from its American allies to boot, could be a good deal for the Danes.

Each major time the U.S. has bought territory — the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Alaska in 1867, what are now the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1917 — has proved to be a good investment. This one might be just as wise.

The price would need to be negotiated. The wishes of Greenland’s current population should be considered. The structure of territorial governance would need to be worked out. These and other considerations might argue against the deal even if Denmark were willing to sell.

In sum, further consideration might show the purchase isn’t practical. We won’t know, though, until we explore and analyze the possibility. It is very much to Trump’s credit that he has an open mind about such a thing. Long-term American strategic interests could well benefit, so it certainly doesn’t hurt to take Truman’s idea off the ice and see if it will float."
Treasury is about to flood the market with debt to fund U.S.’s $1 trillion deficit — and that is a concern,https://www.marketwatch.com,"['Joy Wiltermuth', 'Markets Reporter']",08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-treasury-is-about-to-flood-the-market-with-debt-to-fund-a-1-trillion-deficit-heres-why-that-is-a-worry-2019-08-15,"There may be some limitations to the U.S. government’s borrowing, after all.

An anticipated surge of U.S. borrowing in the global debt markets in the second half of this year is starting to create concern as the Treasury is expected to ramp up its issuance of bills, notes and bonds to fund a soaring $1 trillion budget deficit.

The U.S. government’s budget gap has widened 27% as compared with the first 10 months of fiscal 2018, as spending has risen 8% and receipts have grown by 3%. The federal fiscal year runs October through September. The Trump administration recently forecast a $1 trillion full-year shortfall, while the Congressional Budget Office is slightly more conservative, putting it at $896 billion.

Last month the U.S. Treasury laid out its plans to borrow $814 billion between July and December, after the Trump administration and Congress agreed to a two-year postponement of the U.S. debt ceiling, ensuring no government shutdown or a federal default.

Not only does the Treasury needs to borrow to cover the fiscal deficit created by Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and the inability of Congress to agree on spending cuts, but Treasury needs to rebuild its cash balance which was run down to pay the governments bills when the debt ceiling was hit in May.

The coming deluge of Treasury issuance has stoked worries on Wall Street about whether there is enough liquidity in the system in the short term to meet the supply without pushing up short-term borrowing costs and inverting the yield curve even further.

U.S. dollar liquidity is deteriorating and “is reaching a point where it may require drastic action if measures aren’t taken to address it soon,” warned Gaurav Saroliya, director of macro strategy at Oxford Economics, in a note on Wednesday.

To illustrate the concern, Saroliya pointed to the higher costs already faced by London-based banks lending to one other overnight in dollars, the popular dollar Libor-OIS spread, which has climbed in anticipation of the Treasury glut hitting markets.

This chart shows the rise of the 3-month dollar Libor-OIS spread since May, even as U.S. Treasury cash balances at the Federal Reserve have dropped from about $400 billion to closer to $150 billion.

Oxford Economics International funding squeeze

As the Treasury restores its cash balance with the coming supply, Saroliya expects liquidity woes to worsen, particularly in a scenario where long-term Treasury notes are yielding less than shorter-dated debt.

“With Treasury issuance set to surge in the wake of the recent debt-ceiling deal, an inverted yield curve could create a significant issuance indigestion in the market,” Saroliya wrote.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury 10-year note’s TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.09% yield briefly fell below the 2-year note’s TMUBMUSD02Y, -0.89% yield, an inversion of the funding curve that has foretold past economic slowdowns.

Meanwhile fears of an economic recession rattled U.S. stocks Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.20% closing down 800 points, its biggest one-day fall this year, before some recovery on Thursday morning in the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, +1.44% .

Amid the stock-market rout, the chances of a half-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate in September rose to 30.4%. Markets are pricing in a 69.6% chance of a quarter-point rate cut next month.

Despite the rising Treasury debt issuance, investors globally have been buying U.S. government debt, pushing the 30-year U.S. bond TMUBMUSD30Y, +3.20% to a record low around 2% this week, as yields on many other developed-economy bonds are even lower, with about $15 trillion in debt now offered at negative yields.

Slowing global economic growth due to the U.S.-China trade war is resulting in central banks’ easing monetary policy, and an array of geopolitical risks from Brexit, to Italian political instability, to U.S. sanctions on Iran and violent protests in Hong Kong are encouraging investors into the safe haven of U.S. debt.

But in the short-term money markets, the coming flood of U.S. debt issuance may cause indigestion.

Bond dealers who underwrite the Treasury’s debt sales in the weekly auctions are already holding record amounts of U.S. Treasurys on their books as the fiscal deficit has increased. Now their need to borrow more cash in short-term money markets, using Treasuries as collateral, to buy even more government debt is pushing up short-term rates.

A key risk barometer, the U.S. “repo” market, where cash is borrowed overnight using Treasurys for collateral, has signaled that liquidity is tightening.

Repo rates have climbed recently in relation to what the Federal Reserve pay banks to hold excess reserves. The rate that lenders have charged for cash in the market for Treasury repurchase agreements was 2.22% on Tuesday, compared with the 2.1% that the Federal Reserve pays banks to hold excess reserves, known as the IOER rate.

See at WSJ.com: Rising repo rates fuel concern over mounting U.S. debt

Liquidity may also be tightening in the market for short term borrowing of U.S. dollars internationally, known as the “foreign repo pool” where non-U.S. investors keep cash balances with the Federal Reserve, and the rising costs of currency hedging given the strength of the U.S. dollar may make investing in U.S. Treasury debt less appealing, Saroliya noted.

China and Japan were by far the largest foreign holders of Treasury securities, as of July 16, in the most recent report of holders.

For Saroliya, it all boils down to the Federal Reserve needing to act to preserve liquidity, perhaps by cutting benchmark U.S. rates by another 50 to 100 basis points or through another round of quantitative easing or bond buying.

“And that needs to be immediate!” Saroliya urged.

Earlier this month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Cabana also warned that the historically high levels of Treasury securities held by dealers could pose problems when it come to issuing more debt.

This chart shows dealer holdings of Treasury debt rising between January and July, at the same time custody holdings at the New York Fed have declined.

“We are concerned that the U.S. banking system is nearing reserve scarcity,” Cabana wrote in a note to clients. Ultimately, he said opening the Treasury “floodgates” would likely “force the Fed to start expanding its balance sheet by year-end.”

To be sure, not everyone sees doom in the U.S. adding to the already $22.4 trillion national debt.

“A lot of Street commentators have highlighted the fact that there is going to be a huge amount of supply in the Treasury market, and how that is going to affect rates,” said Robert Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, in an interview with MarketWatch.

“When you look at the space though this is a market that most people want to own at some point, especially given the fact that there are $15 trillion of bonds in negative yields,” he said. “It makes the U.S. look really attractive.”"
Exclusive: VA whistleblower-protection worker asks for protection,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – All Brandon Coleman wanted was a meeting.

The onetime addiction counselor and Veterans Affairs whistleblower known for exposing poor care of suicidal veterans at the Phoenix VA hospital has been doing outreach to other VA whistleblowers since 2017 on behalf of President Donald Trump’s whistleblower-protection office.

This year, the office got a new leader, VA Assistant Secretary Tamara Bonzanto, so Coleman asked her for a few minutes to brief her on his efforts, including a new mentorship program for other whistleblowers.

""'Absolutely, Brandon, we can work that in,'"" Coleman recalled her telling him during an encounter in March. But the next day, he said a supervisor told him his program was being “put on hold” and he hasn’t heard from Bonzanto since.

Coleman told USA TODAY he has learned from colleagues in recent weeks that he has been excluded from meetings, his program is being eliminated, and he and dozens of other employees at the VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection are being asked to submit resumes and worry they could face possible demotion or worse.

Coleman – one of the highest-profile employees of the whistleblower office – has now requested protection from another federal agency that protects whistleblowers, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. In his request, which he also sent to members of Congress, Coleman described the work environment as ""toxic"" and said the office has turned into a ""Dumpster fire,"" according to a copy of his complaint sent July 31.

In interviews and written complaints reviewed by USA TODAY, three other employees who requested anonymity described Bonzanto as a leader who has cut herself off from employees and issued blanket orders without listening to front-line staff.

""We need help,"" Coleman said. ""How can you treat your employees the exact way we’re trying to protect employees from being treated?""

In response to inquiries from USA TODAY, the VA said Coleman's use of the terms ""toxic"" and ""Dumpster fire"" shows a ""critical disregard"" for the fact that problems at the office have been ""over two years in the making""and include a ""substantial backlog of cases.""

The agency said in a statement that Bonzanto is reorganizing the office to enhance communications with VA employees who report wrongdoing across the country and speed up investigations of the complaints.

The VA said leaders who conducted meetings to inform staff about the ""proposed realignment"" reassured them they ""will not lose their job or have their pay reduced.""

""OAWP has remained transparent with staff throughout the realignment process; solicited and received feedback; and responded to staff questions during multiple meetings and discussions,"" the VA said.

Hearing: Head of VA whistleblower office reassures lawmakers improvements are underway

The complaints from Coleman and his colleagues are the first to become public from inside the office. VA whistleblowers and advocates outside the agency have complained its operations have been ineffective and even vindictive.

VA whistleblowers drive push for change

Trump signed an executive order and later a law in 2017 creating the office to look into claims made by whistleblowers, protect them from retaliation and hold their managers accountable. Coleman stood behind Trump during the signing of the executive order.

Whistleblowing employees who have gone public to expose failures at the VA in recent years have played a critical role in driving a push for improvements at the agency. Health care workers revealed in 2014 that employees were keeping secret wait lists for appointments at the Phoenix VA and veterans had died while waiting.

Since then, they have come forward about the over-prescription of opioids to veterans in Wisconsin, equipment shortages in Washington, and dangerous conditions jeopardizing veteran care in Memphis, among other revelations.

In response to inquiries about Coleman's recent complaints, the VA said Bonzanto didn’t hear from him after he asked for the meeting in March, and his customer service duties ""will continue even after the office is realigned.""

After USA TODAY reached out to the VA for comment about Coleman's request for a meeting with Bonzanto, a senior official told his lawyer he could schedule an appointment.

""If employees have concerns, we encourage them to discuss them with OAWP leadership or provide specific examples so that we can address their concerns directly,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Unfortunately that didn't happen in this case.""

The whistleblower office has been under investigation by the VA inspector general for months and a report is expected in September. A Government Accountability Office report last year raised concerns about the independence of the office’s investigations of wrongdoing reported by whistleblowers.

The VA said Bonzanto’s reorganization is a key improvement she’s making to help address those concerns.

""The inspector general and congressional stakeholders have expressed the need for improvements at OAWP, and that’s precisely what VA Assistant Secretary for Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Dr. Tamara Bonzanto has been focusing on,"" the agency said.

Personal crusade

Improving the VA has been a personal crusade for Coleman, a former Marine with six children, including three Marines. For years, he has backed giving veterans more options for outside care paid for by the VA – a proposal Trump ultimately signed into law.

After Coleman reported in 2014 that suicidal veterans were neglected and left to walk out of the Phoenix VA, his bosses at the time accused him of misconduct and shut down his addiction-treatment program. It took nearly two years to settle the case and get Coleman's program reinstated. He went on to testify before Congress about his experiences.

Coleman was hired to do outreach for the whistleblower office and provide insights to managers on policies and programs.

The office quickly began taking in reports from VA employees – more than 1,000 in the first six months, including more than 200 alleging retaliation by VA bosses for speaking out about problems and dozens about potential threats to veteran health and safety. The office staffed up with more than 50 employees to triage and investigate the reports.

Coleman created the mentorship program, which paired a whistleblower with a senior leader to create and implement an improvement project at their VA hospital. The first pairing Coleman oversaw was in Shreveport, Louisiana, where social worker Shea Wilkes faced retaliation in 2014 after he revealed schedulers had been manipulating appointment wait times.

He partnered with Shreveport VA Director Richard Crockett last year to work on a hotline for employees to anonymously report problems. The VA hailed Coleman’s success in Shreveport last October and said it would ""serve as a model nationwide.""

But complaints about the office’s investigative division had been mounting, including allegations in the GAO report last July that the office allowed officials accused of wrongdoing to participate in investigations of the accusations.

An exciting day @DeptVetAffairs as Dr. Tamara Bonzanto is sworn in by @SecWilkie to lead our office. “This is a good day and it is my honor to welcome you,” Wilkie said. We look forward to sharing updates about the great work we’ll be doing for #Veterans under her leadership. pic.twitter.com/PWmJOBZx4u — OAWP (@VAOAWP) January 7, 2019

Bonzanto, who was previously an investigator with the House Veterans Affairs Committee, was brought in as a change agent in January.

Meanwhile, Coleman continued to vet new whistleblower applicants for his mentorship program – they had to submit resumes and do interviews to be considered. He said he had eight lined up when he approached Bonzanto to ask for the meeting in March.

Exclusive: Inside Trump's new VA office, early moves to help whistleblowers draw praise

After the program was put on hold, Coleman has continued to triage incoming calls from whistleblowers. When he was excluded from the reorganization meetings last month, he said he started receiving calls from colleagues reluctant to report problems because of fear of retaliation from their bosses.

That’s when, Coleman said, ""It hit me.""

""I no longer feel confident referring whistleblowers to come to OAWP for help,"" he said. ""Something’s wrong with the office, and that’s why it was time to come forward. This needs to be fixed.""

"The Trump Justice Department’s war on progressive prosecutors, explained",https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/16/20807544/william-barr-larry-krasner-philadelphia-trump-justice-department,"President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice seems to have a new enemy: progressive prosecutors.

The latest volley from the Justice Department came after a shooting in Philadelphia injured six police officers. William McSwain, the federal prosecutor who heads the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, released an unusual statement on Thursday in which he blamed the shooting on Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a progressive prosecutor who has made it his mission to end mass incarceration and the war on drugs.

“We’ve now endured over a year and a half of the worst kinds of slander against law enforcement — the DA routinely calls police and prosecutors corrupt and racist, even ‘war criminals’ that he compares to Nazis,” McSwain claimed in the statement. “This vile rhetoric puts our police in danger. It disgraces the Office of the District Attorney. And it harms the good people in the City of Philadelphia and rewards the wicked.”

The day before, McSwain went on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show to blast Krasner in light of the shooting of six police officers.

The shooting suspect, Maurice Hill, had a long criminal record and was able to get a gun and shoot police officers, so this might seem like an attempt to cast blame — although Hill also has a federal criminal history and was known to the feds, so it’s not clear why Krasner’s office would be any more to blame than McSwain’s.

But this goes beyond one shooting. McSwain’s and Krasner’s offices have actually been clashing since last year, usually with McSwain criticizing Krasner for an individual case, leading Krasner to fire back.

McSwain’s concern appears to be a philosophical disagreement with Krasner’s approach and criminal justice reform in general. On Fox News, McSwain claimed that due to Krasner’s progressive policies, “homicides and shootings have skyrocketed” since Krasner took office in 2018. (In fact, the number of homicides so far this year is roughly in line with the previous two years, and is down roughly 25 percent since 2007.)

These criticisms of progressive prosecutors go all the way to the top of Trump’s Justice Department — to Attorney General William Barr. Earlier this week, Barr criticized progressive prosecutors in a speech to police. He didn’t name Krasner or any other prosecutor, but he argued that “the emergence in some of our large cities of district attorneys that style themselves as ‘social justice’ reformers, who spend their time undercutting the police, letting criminals off the hook, and refusing to enforce the law,” is “demoralizing to law enforcement and dangerous to public safety.”

The goal of the Justice Department here is, it seems, to undermine criminal justice reform. Barr, who helped write a report titled “The Case for More Incarceration” when he was attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, has long been critical of efforts to pull back punitive criminal justice policies, from aggressive policing to longer prison sentences. McSwain, as a US attorney, is helping his boss get the word out by targeting Krasner, who’s widely known in criminal justice circles as a reformer.

One of the problems for Barr is his office actually doesn’t have much power in the overall criminal justice system, because most of the system’s work happens at the local and state levels. That makes local district attorneys like Krasner, who effectively decide who goes to prison and what they’re charged for in local and state systems, uniquely powerful. But since Barr has limited influence on what local prosecutors do, he’s trying to use his bully pulpit — and seemingly that of his underlings — to fight against a rise in prosecutors using their unique powers for reform.

Krasner, for his part, doesn’t seem fazed, dismissing McSwain’s criticisms in a statement to Vox.

“The US attorney is not a political elected office,” he said. “I’m surprised that William McSwain would seek to detract from the great collaborative work of law enforcement last night — for which bipartisan leaders in City Hall just minutes ago had nothing but praise, and rightly so — for his own political agenda and personal gain.”

He added, “Thank you for your question, but I will not be part of a distraction from the serious work before law enforcement in Philadelphia, which is to fully investigate this assault on our police officers and neighbors, and to bring the perpetrator — and any co-perpetrators — to justice.”

Progressive prosecutors are key to criminal justice reform — and the Trump administration knows it

Typically, discussions of the criminal justice system focus on lawmakers, prisons, the police, and maybe judges. Rarely, however, is the most powerful actor in this system mentioned: the prosecutor.

Prosecutors are enormously powerful in the US criminal justice system, in large part because they are given so much discretion to prosecute cases however they see fit. For example, after Krasner was elected and took office in 2018, he sent out a memo ordering his office to, among other policy changes, not charge people for the possession of marijuana, offenses related to drug paraphernalia if the case is about marijuana, and prostitution if the sex worker has two or fewer convictions.

So marijuana and prostitution remain illegal in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, but the city’s district attorney said that he would ignore those aspects of the law — and it was completely within his discretion to do so.

Prosecutors make these types of decisions all the time: Should they bring the type of charge that will trigger a lengthy mandatory minimum sentence? Should they bring a charge that’s only a misdemeanor? Should they strike a deal for a lower sentence, but one that can be imposed without a costly trial?

Courts and juries do, in theory, act as checks on prosecutors. But in practice, they don’t: More than 90 percent of criminal convictions are resolved through a plea agreement, so by and large, prosecutors and defendants — not judges and juries — have almost all the say in the great majority of cases that result in incarceration or some other punishment.

In this sense, the Justice Department is right: Local prosecutors are very powerful, and some of them, including Krasner, really are using their power to undermine existing laws that they see as far too punitive.

But there’s nothing illegal or scandalous about this. Prosecutors have always had this type of discretion. It’s just that before, the discretion was used to try to obtain the most punitive prison sentences possible — sometimes contrary to what even the judges overseeing such cases would have preferred — during an era when “tough on crime” politics and incredibly harsh sentences for even low-level violations, from drugs to theft, were popular.

In fact, John Pfaff, a criminal justice expert at Fordham University, has found evidence that prosecutors have been the key drivers of mass incarceration in the past couple of decades. Analyzing data from state judiciaries, he compared the number of crimes, arrests, and prosecutions from 1994 to 2008. He found that reported violent and property crime fell, and arrests for almost all crimes also fell. But one thing went up: the number of felony cases filed in court.

Prosecutors were filing more charges even as crime and arrests dropped, throwing more people into the prison system. Prosecutors were driving mass incarceration.

In recent years, though, voters have increasingly come around to a vision that the criminal justice system has become too punitive. America incarcerates more people than any other country in the world — even more than totalitarian countries like Russia and China — and there are big racial disparities throughout the system.

That’s led to calls for reform. Notably, polls show both liberals and conservatives support at least some reforms. Even Trump, who ran on a “tough on crime” platform, signed criminal justice reform into law with the First Step Act.

But Barr has long been critical of these efforts. He was an architect of mass incarceration, helping promote more punitive criminal justice policies at the federal and state level in the 1990s. He also criticized President Barack Obama’s Justice Department for its investigations of abusive police departments and efforts to discourage aggressive policing practices that disproportionately hurt minority communities, while praising Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for pursuing harsher prison sentences against drug offenders. He’s critical of legalizing marijuana, and has argued that the criminal justice system does not treat people differently based on race.

McSwain echoed the sentiment. “Criminals are the winners in this story,” he said on Fox. “Mr. Krasner makes no bones about this. He’s not even pretending to be a prosecutor. He calls himself a public defender with power. It’s almost like letting the fox into the henhouse.”

The Trump administration says crime will skyrocket under progressive policies. That’s not backed by the evidence.

In his speech earlier this week, Barr warned that the results of less punitive criminal justice policies “will be predictable: more crime; more victims.” This seems to be the core basis for his support of “tougher” criminal justice policies.

The evidence, however, suggests that harsher criminal justice policies do not actually keep people safer.

A 2015 review of the research by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that more incarceration — and its abilities to incapacitate or deter criminals — explained about 0 to 7 percent of the crime drop since the 1990s, though other researchers estimate it drove 10 to 25 percent of the crime drop since the ’90s.

Another huge review of the research, released in 2017 by David Roodman of the Open Philanthropy Project, found that releasing people from prison earlier doesn’t lead to more crime, and that holding people in prison longer may actually increase crime.

That conclusion matches what other researchers have found in this area. As the National Institute of Justice concluded in 2016, “Research has found evidence that prison can exacerbate, not reduce, recidivism. Prisons themselves may be schools for learning to commit crimes.”

Similarly, other research suggests that more aggressive policing strategies, such as stop-and-frisk, don’t significantly reduce crime (although by disproportionately hassling black and brown communities, they do reduce faith in police among minority neighborhoods). In fact, recent studies indicate that more targeted policing approaches, when coupled with social service programs and public health interventions in a way that fixates on the very few individuals at risk of violence, are much more effective for combating crime and murders.

To this end, a recent report by the Brennan Center for Justice concluded, “Between 2007 and 2017, 34 states reduced both imprisonment and crime rates simultaneously, showing clearly that reducing mass incarceration does not come at the cost of public safety.” Other places that have pulled back aggressive policing and criminal justice policies, such as New York City after it halted stop-and-frisk, have seen crime continue to drop.

And since Krasner took office, the number of homicides (which is often used as a proxy for violent crime) has remained relatively flat. According to Philadelphia Police, there were 205 homicides from January 1, 2019, to August 15, 2019 — up slightly from 200 during the same period in 2017, before Krasner became district attorney, and down sharply from 257 during the same period in 2007.

The Justice Department and US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania did not return requests for comment and requests for evidence that criminal justice reform will lead or is leading to more crime.

The federal government plays a small role in criminal justice. The Justice Department may be trying to change that.

For Barr, the key concern may be that he’s seeing the system he helped build over the years start to change in a way he doesn’t like — and there’s not much, as attorney general, that he can do about it.

That’s because the federal government actually has a relatively small role in the US criminal justice system. Consider the statistics: In the US, federal prisons house about 12 percent of the overall prison population. That is, to be sure, a significant number in such a big system. But it’s relatively small in the grand scheme of things, as this chart from the Prison Policy Initiative shows:

One way to think about this is what would happen if Trump used his pardon powers to their maximum potential — meaning he pardoned every single person in federal prison right now. That would push down America’s overall incarcerated population from about 2.1 million to about 1.9 million.

That would be a hefty reduction. But it also wouldn’t undo mass incarceration, as the US would still lead all but one country in incarceration: With an incarceration rate of around 600 per 100,000 people, only the small country of El Salvador would come out ahead.

Similarly, almost all police work is done at the local and state level. There are about 18,000 law enforcement agencies in America — only a dozen or so of which are federal agencies.

It’s this dynamic that has led criminal justice reformers, such as liberal billionaire George Soros and the American Civil Liberties Union, to funnel resources into local and state policy changes, including by electing progressive prosecutors like Krasner and other district attorneys across the US.

But now those opposed to criminal justice reform, like Barr and McSwain, are fighting back. As McSwain put it to Carlson on Fox, “[Soros] realizes that he can’t do that through the normal democratic process. Normally, if you’re going to try to get criminal justice reform, you have to do it through the legislature, you have to get broad public support for the kind of changes that you want to institute. He’s taking what I would describe as an illegitimate, anti-democratic shortcut by trying to purchase DA elections, and then once the DA is in place, he or she doesn’t enforce the law — and, presto, you have criminal justice reform.”

The reality is that most voters, Democrats and Republicans alike, support at least some level of criminal justice reform, based on public surveys. And Krasner was democratically elected — on an explicit platform to reform the criminal justice system. That’s democracy at work.

For Barr and McSwain, though, the idea that the public might be turning against their views on these issues is apparently not something they’re willing to admit, and they’re now trying to rally the public to their side."
"New evidence shows why Steele, the Ohrs and TSA workers never should have become DOJ sources",https://thehill.com,[],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/457628-new-evidence-shows-why-steele-the-ohrs-and-tsa-workers-never-should-have,"One of the inevitable outcomes of the Russia case will be that the Department of Justice (DOJ) almost certainly will need internal reforms.

The first reform is the most obvious, given the unraveling of the Russia collusion narrative: a new set of rules governing when the FBI can investigate or spy on a First Amendment-protected political campaign during an election.

The FBI never should have been allowed to sustain a counterintelligence investigation into Donald Trump Donald John TrumpWarren unveils Native American policy plan Live-action 'Mulan' star spurs calls for boycott with support of Hong Kong police Don't let other countries unfairly tax America's most innovative companies MORE’s campaign based on hearsay from Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who helped to arrange a $25 million Australian government donation to the Clinton Foundation, and on a “minimally” verified dossier written by British spy Christopher Steele, who was working on the Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonThe Hill's Morning Report — Trump and the new Israel-'squad' controversy Colorado candidates vying to take on Gardner warn Hickenlooper they won't back down Trump seeks to project confidence on economy at New Hampshire rally MORE opposition-research team.

The second reform may be less visible but becomes painfully obvious, thanks to a series of internal DOJ investigative memos released this month that expose glaring issues with the handling, vetting and weighting of “confidential human sources.” That’s a fancy term for people — sometimes called “snitches” or informants, in street vernacular — who secretly provide evidence to law enforcement.

Some examples of the DOJ’s problems with informers fall outside the Russia case but mirror the same issues unmasked in the now-debunked probe of Trump.

Take, for example, the DOJ inspector general’s finding this month that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was paying other government officials at the Homeland Security Department’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to work as informants.

The IG spared few words in decrying the idiocy of allowing government security officers collecting a federal salary to double-dip into taxpayers’ money by receiving informant pay to report criminal activity they were required by their jobs to disclose.

Two agents and one supervisor “violated the DEA Confidential Source policy” by paying three TSA workers as informants, the report concluded. And one agent wrongly served as handler for a TSA informant with whom he was involved in a “personal relationship,” investigators found, exposing a problem dating to 2013.

“By establishing the TSA employees as paid Limited Use Confidential Sources, the DEA agreed to pay for information that the TSA employees were already obligated to provide to law enforcement,” the IG concluded.

ADVERTISEMENT

In other words, there should be a bright line: Government agents should stick to their jobs and leave the informing to private citizens.

That line similarly was breached in the minds of many when Bruce Ohr, then the DOJ’s assistant deputy attorney general, began collecting anti-Trump information on July 30, 2016, from former MI6 agent Steele and pushing it on the top levels of the DOJ and the FBI.

At the time, Ohr knew his wife, Nellie, and Steele worked for the Fusion GPS research firm on the same project to dig up Russia dirt on Trump, to help the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) win the 2016 election. Furthermore, Ohr told the FBI he knew Steele was a foreigner “desperate” to stop a Trump presidency, FBI memos show.

With his seniority inside DOJ, Ohr quickly got Steele’s information to the FBI’s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, and three top DOJ supervisors, despite the red flags.

Before long, Steele was working as a confidential informant for the bureau, and his dossier was used to secure a surveillance warrant targeting the Trump campaign weeks before Election Day.

When Steele got fired Nov. 1, 2016, by the FBI for leaking to the media, Ohr became a conduit for the bureau to keep getting information from Steele for months. Ohr met at least 12 times in late 2016 and 2017 with FBI agents to provide new intel from the British spy. In other words, Ohr transitioned from being a DOJ supervisor to a backdoor source for the FBI to receive information from a terminated source.

And he didn’t stop there.

Records released this week, thanks to litigation by the conservative group Judicial Watch, show the senior DOJ official took at least two research files from his wife and her Fusion GPS work and provided them to FBI agents investigating Trump. One alleged that unverified ties existed between the Trump organization and Russian mobsters; the other provided a timeline alleging wrongdoing by former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.

Nellie Ohr testified to Congress that some of her anti-Trump information came from foreign officials in Ukraine, including a parliamentary member highly critical of Manafort.

Examination of the Nellie Ohr documents given to the FBI shows some of her source material also came from former Ukrainian presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko and a lawsuit she filed against Manafort.

Why is that significant? Tymoshenko and Hillary Clinton had a simpatico relationship after the former secretary of State went out of her way in January 2013 to advocate for Tymoshenko’s release from prison on corruption charges.

So, Bruce Ohr became a conduit of information not only for intelligence from Clinton’s British opposition-researcher but also from his wife’s curation of evidence from a Clinton foreign ally and Manafort enemy inside Ukraine. Talk about foreign influence in a U.S. election!

ADVERTISEMENT

To Ohr’s credit, he disclosed his potential conflict of interest involving his wife to DOJ officials. To DOJ’s discredit, he was allowed to act as a source for both his wife and Steele anyway.

Ohr also didn’t get compensated as a paid informant, like the TSA workers. But documents show a curious thing happened during the time he began peddling the anti-Trump intelligence from his wife and Steele: His annual performance bonus doubled from about $14,000 in November 2015 to $28,000 in November 2016.

The blurred line between government official and informer/source didn’t stop with Ohr. Former FBI General Counsel James Baker also admitted he took dirt on Trump from DNC lawyer Michael Sussmann in summer 2016 and gave it to the agents investigating the Trump campaign.

The ultimate consequence — some might argue folly — of all these blurred lines is most easily exposed in an often overlooked document from the Russia probe.

I’ve written that the FBI kept a spreadsheet showing almost all of what Steele provided agents and Ohr on Russia-Trump dirt turned out to be unverified, disproven or nothing more than internet rumors. But when the FBI closed its paperwork on Steele in 2018, a professional intelligence analyst concluded in his human source validation report that the bureau assessed it had only “medium confidence” in Steele and that his intelligence could only be “minimally” verified.

In other words, his intelligence wasn’t very good. And yet, America spent nearly three years in turmoil only to learn that Steele’s Trump-Russia allegations — paid by Clinton and propagated by Ohr — were not true.

The tales of Bruce and Nellie Ohr, Christopher Steele, Yulia Tymoshenko, and those DEA and TSA agents raise a stark warning: The lines between government officials and informants, unverified political dirt and real intelligence, personal interest and law enforcement, became too blurred for the Justice Department’s own good.

That’s a problem sorely in need of fixing.

Trump intervention triggered EPA’s surprise biofuel waiver decision: sources,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/16/trump-intervention-triggered-epas-surprise-biofuel-waiver-decision-sources/,"WASHINGTON — A phone call from US President Donald Trump last week ended a nearly two-month-long review of the nation’s biofuels program, three sources familiar with the matter said, with the White House siding in favor of oil refiners over corn growers.

Trump gave Andrew Wheeler, head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the green light for the regulator to announce it had granted 31 small refinery exemptions out of the 40 applications, saying he wanted the issue off his desk, the sources said.

Trump’s call triggered a flurry of action within the EPA, leading up to a surprise Friday afternoon announcement, after weeks of negotiations between US government agencies failed to make progress in addressing farmers’ concerns.

“The president has heard from all sides and in the end he has had enough of it. He called Wheeler and gave him the green light,” a source familiar with knowledge of the matter said.

The White House has sought to make changes to the nation’s biofuels laws since the beginning of Trump’s administration in early 2017, but found themselves caught between the powerful oil and corn lobbies, both of whom have allies in Washington in Trump’s Republican Party.

The debate underscores the rising political importance of the US Renewable Fuel Standard, a more than a decade-old federal policy that requires refineries to blend corn-based ethanol into their gasoline or buy credits from those that do.

Since Trump took office, the EPA has more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted to refineries, including some operated by giants Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), saving the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars, but enraging farmers who claim the exemptions threaten demand for one of their staple products.

Refiners dismiss the argument, saying ethanol demand has not been affected.

The White House declined to comment for this story. The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Trump had ordered the revamp of the waiver program in June, after hearing from angry farmers during a trip to Iowa, the nation’s top ethanol producing state. Even though the corn lobby seemed to have the upper hand in early talks, the oil industry’s efforts eventually gained more traction, industry sources have told Reuters.

Iowa is a swing state that Trump carried in 2016 and is potentially crucial for his re-election efforts next year. Farmers in the state have also chafed under Trump’s trade war with China that has sapped demand for agriculture products.

Farmers slammed last Friday’s decision, saying the Trump administration was bailing out the oil industry at a time when U.S. farmers were suffering due to his trade war with China. The refining industry welcomed the move, saying the waivers are lawful and help shield small refiners from the burdensome cost of compliance with RFS."
"Senior Trump officials, including 'Vino Vixen,' harassed, abused, retaliated against career State Dept. employees: IG report",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senior-trump-officials-harassed-abused-retaliated-career-state/story?id=65000738,"Career State Department employees in one of the agency's critical bureaus faced harassment, mistreatment and retaliation by its top Trump appointees, according to a new inspector general report.

The report on the Bureau of International Organization Affairs centers around two senior officials, Mari Stull, a food and beverage lobbyist turned wine blogger under the name ""Vino Vixen,"" and the bureau's head, Assistant Secretary of State Kevin Moley.

According to the report, Stull harassed career employees who she thought were ""disloyal"" to President Donald Trump and, together with Moley, they removed some from their responsibilities and even one senior official from her post. Approximately 50, including senior officials, left on their own because of their management style.

In addition to the retaliation, the IG report found that Moley and Stull treated employees in a ""harsh and aggressive manner,"" engaged in ""disrespectful and hostile treatment,"" and created a ""negative and 'vindictive' environment."" Stull and Moley ""frequently berated employees, raised their voices, and generally engaged in unprofessional behavior toward staff.""

“ ” This report leaves no doubt that Trump Administration political appointees have mismanaged the Department and violated the public trust, and the American people deserve swift action to hold those officials accountable.

The report, rich in detail, is based on the 40-plus interviews that the IG office conducted. Stull initially asked the IG to investigate her own claims of fraud, waste and abuse in the office, but later declined to be interviewed. She left the State Department in January 2019, so she no longer has to comply or faces any penalty.

Moley is still serving as assistant secretary and denied several of the accusations, telling the IG office, ""The behavior attributed to me regarding raising my voice, berating employees and contributing to a hostile work environment does not represent the person I am or have ever been.""

The State Department told the IG that he has received counseling from department leadership ""on appropriate leadership and management of the bureau. Further discipline will be considered.""

It also accepted other recommendations, including developing a ""corrective action plan to address the leadership and management deficiencies"" within 60 days.

U.S. Department of State

""This report leaves no doubt that Trump Administration political appointees have mismanaged the Department and violated the public trust, and the American people deserve swift action to hold those officials accountable,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, chair of the House Oversight Committee.

The International Organization Affairs, or IO, bureau is a lesser known one within the State Department, but its critical function is to be the primary interlocutor with the United Nations and other important international bodies, covering human rights, nuclear issues, climate change, global health and more.

One of the more salacious details that has been reported in the news -- that Stull kept a loyalty list -- was not included in the report, but it seems in principle she kept one. Employees say in the report that she called them or others in the office ""traitors,"" ""Obama holdovers"" or ""disloyal.""

While working at a different agency, Stull sought an IO employee's help with a personal matter. On the advice of the State Department's legal team, he declined. But once at IO, Stull harassed both the employee and his manager for not helping, according to the report. That included bad-mouthing them to senior leaders, assigning a junior employee to ""monitor"" their phone calls, attempting to take away job responsibilities and barring the employee from traveling to important events like the U.N. General Assembly.

Another employee said working with Stull meant ""six to eight hostile interactions per day,"" per the report. In one instance, she called an employee's report on other nations' U.N. contributions ""garbage"" and threw it at another employee. In another, she and Moley berated a junior employee until she cried.

When the bureau's principle deputy assistant secretary, a career Foreign Service officer, raised concerns with Moley about Stull and his management, she was eventually removed by Moley -- which the IG report says was a retaliatory move that broke department policy.

Beyond this senior official, Moley dismissed concerns from other employees about Stull and his management, according to the report; Moley said no one ever raised any issues with him. Even when senior officials above Moley's rank raised concerns with him, he ""did not undertake any meaningful efforts to address these concerns."" In fact, some of the actions described in the report happened after an intervention in June 2018.

When concerns were raised with Stull, she said she was the real victim and told at least one employee that ""raising such concerns was pointless because the Trump administration 'has my back.'""

There is a second IG report on similar personnel issues that has yet to be released. That one deals with senior members of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's staff who allegedly retaliated against employees in the secretary's office, including one for being of Iranian descent. One of those staffers, Brian Hook, remains a top adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo."
A DOJ employee is accused of helping her son and the Bloods intimidate informants,https://www.cnn.com,['Paul P.

Tawanna Hilliard works in an administrative role for the US Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, court documents say. According to the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, over a period of more than two years, Hilliard used her access to information to help her son Tyquan Hilliard, 28, and his gang, the 5-9 Brims set of the Bloods.

Authorities have charged the Hilliards with six felony counts: witness tampering and harassment, obstruction of justice and conspiracy to tamper with a witness. Each carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.

Tawanna Hilliard is also charged with illegally obtaining information from a protected government computer.

The Hilliards' lawyer has not responded to a request for comment.

Roger Stone and the DOJ are fighting in court over a clip from 'The Godfather Part II',https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/16/roger-stone-is-fighting-doj-in-court-over-a-godfather-clip.html,"Longtime Republican strategist and former Trump campaign advisor Roger Stone wants a clip from ""The Godfather Part II"" to sleep with the fishes — at least during his upcoming trial.

The conservative provocateur and the Department of Justice have been sparring for a month over whether jurors can be shown a 4-minute-and-20-second clip from the film.

The video shows Corleone family mob leader Frank Pentangeli lying to Congress — and abandoning his plans to incriminate Michael Corleone — during a dramatic hearing in which Corleone makes an appearance in the audience.

""I don't know nothing about that,"" Pentangeli says in response to a question about Corleone's connections to organized crime. ""Oh — I was in the olive oil business with his father but that was a long time ago.""

""I kept saying Michael Corleone did this, Michael Corleone did that, so I said, yeah, sure,"" Pentangeli says, downplaying his earlier comments, in which he accused Corleone of crimes.

Stone, who was indicted in January on charges including witness tampering, says the clip will make him out to be a ""murderous mafioso."" The Justice Department calls the video ""directly relevant to the charge.""

The Justice Department charged Stone in January with obstruction, false statements and witness tampering in a 24-page indictment that cites the 1974 crime drama."
Senate Dem seeks answers from DHS on reports of pregnant asylum seekers sent back to Mexico,https://thehill.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/latino/457719-senate-dem-seeks-answers-from-dhs-on-reports-of-pregnant-asylum-seekers-sent-back-to,"Sen. Jeff Merkley Jeffrey (Jeff) Alan MerkleySchumer backs Pelosi as impeachment roils caucus Schumer backs up Pelosi's resistance to impeachment inquiry Murray move raises impeachment pressure on Schumer MORE (D-Ore.) on Friday asked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials to clarify reports that pregnant asylum-seekers have been forced to wait out their immigration cases in Mexican border cities.

Merkley wrote DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, asking why six late-term pregnant women were included in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program in May.

Under the program, known colloquially as “Remain in Mexico,” non-Mexican migrants seeking asylum in the United States are sent back across the border to await results of their asylum claims in U.S. immigration courts.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Trump administration implemented the program in January with the acquiescence, but not outright support, of the Mexican government, which agreed to take in the migrants rather than deport them back to their countries of origin.

DHS in March expanded the program from the California border to El Paso, Texas, where the pregnant women were reportedly included in MPP.

DHS officials did not immediately return a request for comment.

“Policies and practices targeting pregnant women at the border are horrific and these allegations must be immediately investigated,” wrote Merkley.

Under U.S. law, children born in American territory would be natural-born U.S. citizens. If the children of third-country nationals are born in Mexico, they are also entitled to Mexican citizenship.

While Ciudad Juárez, the Mexican border city across from El Paso, has some infrastructure to provide medical services, migrant shelters in the city are reportedly overbooked and unable to care for guests with specialized needs.

Asylum-seekers with special medical needs are exempt from MPP, but that exemption does not explicitly include pregnancy.

""It is beyond question that pregnant women, particularly those nearing full term, have known health issues,"" Merkley wrote.

And Ciudad Juárez is among the most dangerous cities in Mexico, host to more than 170 murders per month.

“Forcing pregnant women to wait alone in Mexico for their asylum hearings puts them at extreme risk of abuse and extortion. Moreover, it creates significant health risks for mothers and children facing imminent delivery dates when proper medical care is not available,” Merkley said."
Lawmakers Accuse State Dept. of Defying Federal Law by Missing Deadlines for Yemen Reports,https://www.nytimes.com,['Catie Edmondson'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/us/politics/state-department-yemen-reports.html,"WASHINGTON — In defiance of federal law, the State Department is refusing to submit reports to Congress detailing efforts by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, according to legislators and congressional aides.

Trump administration officials have missed both congressionally mandated deadlines this year to submit the biannual reports, most recently last week. This has further inflamed tensions between the administration and legislators who were already furious with the administration’s unflagging support of the Saudi government and were still stung by the White House’s decision in May to circumvent Congress to sell arms to Riyadh.

“Congress has tried again and again to bring accountability and transparency to America’s role in the war in Yemen. At every turn, the Trump administration has blocked our efforts,” said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “But we won’t stop looking for ways to dial back our involvement in a conflict that’s fueling the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.”

Last year, Senator Todd Young, Republican of Indiana, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, both of whom sit on the Foreign Relations Committee, successfully added a provision to the military defense policy bill that required the State Department to submit certifications to Congress describing the actions Saudi and Emirati officials have taken to reduce the risk of harm to civilians."
Treasury yields rebound from historic lows,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Sam Meredith', 'Yun Li']",08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/16/us-bonds-treasury-yields-climb-away-from-record-lows.html,"Treasury yields rose on Friday, climbing back from their historic lows hit on Thursday, easing fears a global slowdown could tip U.S. economy into a recession.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was higher at around 1.588%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also higher at around 2.047%.

Yields hit a high after a Der Spiegel article said that Germany would boost spending by issuing more debt.

""In terms of the Germans, what has been brewing is that they are prepared to introduce deficit spending,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist with Prudential Financial. ""This is fiscal policy. It's always been about monetary policy. Now there are discussing fiscal spending. This is a change for them.""

A protracted trade war between the world's two largest economies and growing fears about a possible global economic slowdown prompted the 30-year Treasury bond yield to fall below 2% for the first time ever in the previous session.

The 10-year note also slipped below 1.5% on Thursday — registering a three-year low.

The benchmark Treasury yield briefly broke below the 2-year rate on Wednesday, flashing a recession warning that send stocks tumbling. As of Friday, the curve steepened and was no longer inverted.

President Donald Trump said Thursday that he believed the U.S.-China trade dispute would be relatively short, adding China wanted to make a trade deal.

""September, the meeting is still on as I understand it, but I think more importantly than September, we're talking by phone, and we're having very productive talks,"" Trump told reporters on Thursday.

His comments came after Beijing promised it would counter the latest tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods but urged the U.S. to meet halfway in order to secure an agreement.

On the data front, housing starts and building permits for July will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, with consumer sentiment figures for August set to follow slightly later in the session.

There are no major U.S. Treasury auctions expected on Friday.

Florida man arrested on human trafficking charges: DOJ,https://www.miamiherald.com,[],,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article234092257.html,"Santa Rosa County Corrections

A Pensacola business owner was arrested Thursday on charges that he operated a human trafficking ring out of Asian massage parlors across three states, a press release says.

David C. Williams, 41, faces multiple federal racketeering, money laundering and harboring illegal alien charges for his role as owner of parlors in Florida, Virginia and Pennsylvania, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Florida.

The release said Williams had locations in Pensacola, Gulf Breeze and Gainesville.

A joint effort of multiple law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, IRS and Homeland Security, led to Williams’ arrest. These agencies executed more than a dozen search warrants of businesses linked to Williams. Authorities seized his bank records as well.

It’s Official: Defense Department Will Use Other Agencies’ Cloud Security Assessments,https://www.nextgov.com,['Aaron Boyd'],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2019/08/its-official-defense-department-will-use-other-agencies-cloud-security-assessments/159241/,"The Defense Information Systems Agency announced a provisional authorization Thursday that will speed up cloud deployments by eliminating some of the Defense Department’s oversight over security authorizations.

Defense components had been waiting on the rule, which will allow them to purchase and deploy cloud products and services at the moderate security level—impact level two—without having to ask for written permission.

“This authorization allows for data designated publicly releasable or IL2, to be stored in the cloud on authorized FedRAMP offerings without waiting for DOD to issue a specific authorization document,” said Roger Greenwell, the risk management executive and authorizing official at DISA. “We worked with officials from the DOD, Chief Information Office and mission partners on the drafting of the policy, and believe this approach provides significant benefit to both the DOD community as well as the cloud industry.""

Previously, Defense offices were required to do their own security assessments on systems, issuing a program- or department-level authority to operate, or ATO. But this system worked directly against the promise of the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, which was designed to facilitate the certification process and allow agencies to reuse the ATO work done at other departments.

The reuse issue—called “reciprocity”—has been a sticking point since FedRAMP was launched in 2011. Since that time, administration officials and lawmakers have pushed agencies to reuse more ATOs whenever appropriate.

“What was supposed to be an expedited process—six months, maybe costing a quarter of a million dollars—instead, in many cases, took years—and takes years—and can cost companies millions of dollars, the very opposite of what FedRAMP was designed to achieve,” Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., said during a hearing July 17 held by the House Oversight Subcommittee on Government Operations. “We can’t leverage the potential of cloud computing if the processes are slower than the speed at which the technology itself advances.”

Jack Wilmer, Defense Department deputy chief information officer for cybersecurity, previewed the pending rule during the hearing.

“We are fully committed to reciprocity. There’s a massive incentive for us in having that reciprocal arrangement with FedRAMP,” Wilmer said. “Going through those 325 [controls] at the moderate baseline, as an example, which is something that the FedRAMP program takes on for us, is something we no longer have to do in order to leverage those cloud services.”

The blanket agreement comes with some caveats, however. The rule only applies to solutions approved at the moderate baseline through FedRAMP and listed in the program’s marketplace. Even then, Defense offices can only reuse authorizations from companies whose data centers are physically located in the U.S. or its territories.

The covered products also have to maintain their FedRAMP ATO and agree to continuous monitoring.

“If the FedRAMP [Joint Authorization Board] or agency authorization is suspended, revoked, restricted or limited in any manner, the DOD IL2 reciprocity for that [cloud service offering] is considered suspended and will be explicitly revoked until all issues with the authorization are mitigated in accordance with policy,” according to a release.

As of the July hearing, the department had approved the reuse of 140 moderate-level ATOs, only 20 of which required additional reviews, according to Wilmer."
Day 3: Eastern Corn Belt Yield Forecasts Break Sharply From USDA,https://www.dtnpf.com,['Katie Dehlinger'],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/crops/article/2019/08/15/day-3-eastern-corn-belt-yield-break,"""I think it's spot on,"" he said. ""We put our corn in under subpar conditions, just like everyone else, and it's been backpedaling ever since.""

Since the wet spring ended, his region has received a scant 1.5 inches of rain in July and only two-tenths of an inch in August. During pollination, hot-and-dry weather took its toll. ""A quarter of the ears I pulled were zippered. The ground is hard as a rock, and there are cracks an inch to half-an-inch deep,"" he said.

Gro's county-level yield map for soybeans pinpoints the state's potential yield average at 46 bpa, down 29% from last year and 9 bushels lower than USDA's August estimate. Most soybean yields in the northern two-thirds of the state are down 10 to 15 bpa from last year in Gro's maps.

Young actually thinks these yield estimates are too optimistic for his region.

""I think soybeans could be a worse story than corn,"" he said. ""We're starting to see spider mites showing up because we've been so dry. So many flowers are brown -- you'll have a pod with decent-sized soybeans sitting right next to a brown flower with no pod on it, or a pod the size of your pinky nail.""

Both Young's corn and soybean fields were planted three weeks later than normal -- which was a common experience for Illinois farmers, DTN's Anderson noted.

""The slow start has progress running well behind average; corn was finally almost finished pollination during the Aug. 11 weekend, but 20% of the Illinois soybeans had yet to bloom,"" he said.

Young urged growers to venture deep into their fields in the weeks ahead to get a better grasp on the true yield potential of their crop, particularly cornfields.

""Most of the industry's focus has been on areas already committed to prevented planting,"" he said. ""We've been assuming the rest of it was OK, because it came up quickly and it looked like it pollinated. But the ears I pulled that were zippered actually all looked decent in the husks before I pulled them down. People need to get out and look.""

INDIANA

Flooded and ponded ground was a common sight in Indiana this spring, and it shows up as dark-brown swaths on Gro's NDVI maps. The effect is especially prominent in central, eastern and southern parts of the state. See the map here: https://app.gro-intelligence.com/….

""Indiana got unloaded on during the spring, with precipitation in the March-April-May time frame coming in ninth-wettest in 125 years of record-keeping,"" Anderson said.

As a result of the spring weather, more than 700,000 acres of the corn across the state went unplanted, along with 230,000 acres of soybeans, according to the latest Farm Services Agency data.

""Spring temperatures were near average, but soils had no chance to dry out with the consistent rain,"" Anderson said. ""Then, to add to crop stress, the faucet turned off. Mid-July to mid-August, rain has been less than half the normal amount over most of the state. Usually, this sort of trend is a relatively minor swing. But a lot of corn and soybean acreage has shallow roots this year because of wet ground; so this drier trend is very unwelcome.""

In northwestern Indiana's Newton County, Kurt Line said they were irrigating pretty hard until earlier this week when they got an inch or two of rain. The majority of corn in his area was planted in June, although some was planted in April and May in between rains. He said the late start to the growing season took the top end off yield potential.

Gro's county yield maps show a similar trend. The statewide average corn yield is on track to hit 138 bpa, a 27% tumble from USDA's final 189-bpa yield last year. In 2018, a vast majority of counties in Indiana had yield potential above 180 bpa. This year, the highest forecast yield is 178 bpa in Vermillion County, and in the parts of the state hit hardest this spring, yields aren't expected to top 100 bpa. See the county maps here: https://app.gro-intelligence.com/….

Line said Gro's forecast for 161 bpa for Newton County seems a little low to him.

""What I've been in recently, I'm still optimistic. If we get the right weather the rest of the way, we could maybe have a close-to-normal corn crop,"" he said, adding that a lot of the crop is at risk if there's an early frost.

As of the weekend of Aug. 11, 21% of the corn crop hasn't pollinated yet and 30% of the soybean crop hasn't bloomed.

Gro's soybean yield forecast of 46 bpa is 21% lower than last year's final USDA yield of 58.5 bpa. The differences from 2018 are stark. Last year, the lowest county average was 49 bpa while the majority of the state saw yields in the upper 50s and lower 60s. This year, the bulk of the state is forecast to have yields from the mid-30s to mid-40s, with a low of 34 bpa in Hamilton County just north of Indianapolis. The highest forecast is in Jasper County at 55 bpa.

That's just east of Line's farm, where Gro forecasts a county yield of 53 bpa.

""I would take the under,"" he said. There are a lot of holes in the bean fields, including areas that were replanted and then drowned out again. ""They seemed to struggle to get much growth until just the last couple of weeks. They finally looks like beans should, but we sure lost a lot of opportunity to capture sunlight. We were still planting beans on the longest day of the year.""

OHIO

Much of Ohio saw record-setting rainfall this spring, and as a result, almost 1.5 million acres -- 880,000 of it corn and almost 600,000 of it soybeans -- went unplanted.

""The NDVI image shows how the heavy spring rain lashed the state -- almost the entire western half of Ohio has zero, or close to it, for the vegetation anomaly reading. And the west-central and northwestern sectors are almost entirely zeroed out in the NDVI analysis,"" Anderson said. You can see the map here: https://app.gro-intelligence.com/….

The rain continued in June, and USDA's crop progress values show just how late everything was planted in Ohio: 29% of the corn crop hadn't pollinated as of the weekend of Aug. 11 and 31% of the soybeans hadn't yet bloomed. Typically, both of those phases are almost finished.

This year, Gro's Ohio yield forecast is 27% lower than last year at 136 bpa. Typically, the western half of Ohio has the strongest yields in the state, and last year, the averages ran from around 185 bpa to 200 bpa. This year, many of those county yield forecasts are closer to 120 bpa.

Logan County, Ohio, farmer Bill Bayliss said it's hard to even speculate about the corn crop this year. He got some corn planted in early June and then it got wet again.

Anderson said Ohio had the eighth-wettest June in 125 years of record keeping.

But in recent weeks, the tap has turned off, and Bayliss said his farm hasn't seen measurable precipitation in at least three weeks. His corn is in the process of pollinating.

""It's a very inopportune time to be trying to pollinate as hot and as dry as it is,"" he said, adding that he wouldn't be surprised by Gro's 121-bpa average for his county.

On soybeans, Gro's statewide yield forecast of 42 bpa is also 27% below last year. Yields in the state's northwest region range from the upper-20s to mid-40s, a sharp departure from last year's mid-50s to low-60s.

Bayliss planted soybeans until the beginning of July and said his farm may not make Gro's 36-bpa estimate for his county.

""They're podded, but they're knee high at the best,"" he said. ""That field should have been at least waist high at this time of year. Between getting planted late and turning dry, it's just a bad combination.""

Exclusive: Google Insider Turns Over 950 Pages Of Docs And Laptop To DOJ,https://saraacarter.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://saraacarter.com/exclusive-google-insider-turns-over-950-pages-of-docs-and-laptop-to-doj/,"A former Google insider claiming the company created algorithms to hide its political bias within artificial intelligence platforms – in effect targeting particular words, phrases and contexts to promote, alter, reference or manipulate perceptions of Internet content – delivered roughly 950 pages of documents to the Department of Justice’s Antitrust division Friday.

The former Google insider, who has already spoken in to the nonprofit organization Project Veritas, met with SaraACarter.com on several occasions last week. He was interviewed in silhouette, to conceal his identity, in group’s latest film, which they say exposes bias inside the social media platform.

Several weeks prior, the insider mailed a laptop to the DOJ containing the same information delivered on Friday, they said. The former insider is choosing to remain anonymous until Project Verita’s James O’Keefe reveals his identity tomorrow (Wednesday).

He told this reporter on his recent trip to Washington D.C. that the documents he turned over to the Justice Department will provide proof that Google has been manipulating the algorithms and the evidence of how it was done, the insider said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the House Judiciary Committee in December, 2018, that the search engine was not biased against conservatives. Pichai explained what algorithm’s are said Google’s algorithm was not offensive to conservatives because its artificial intelligence does not operate in that manner. He told lawmakers, “things like relevance, freshness, popularity, how other people are using it” are what drives the search results. Pichai said even if his programmers were anti-Republican, the process is so intricate that the artificial intelligence could not be manipulated and it was to complicated to train the algorithm to fit their bias.

Google did not immediately respond for comment on the insider’s claims, however, this story will be updated if comment is provided.

The insider says Google is aware most people are unaware or not knowledgeable about these advanced IT systems and therefore unable to determine who is telling the truth.

“I honestly think that a free market can fix this issue,” he told this reporter at a meeting in Washington D.C. “The issue is that the free market has been distorted and what’s happened is that the distortion is so grotesque and the engineering is so repulsive, all we need to do is just expose what’s going on. People can hear that it is bad but that can be bias. But when they see what Google has actually written with the documents, this will actually be taught in universities of what totalitarian states can do with this type of capability.”

“It will be so revolting that it doesn’t matter what the solution is, a solution will just form as a reaction to this manipulation they have done,” the Google insider said.

He said he’s asked himself many times if he’s overreacting “and every time I simply look back at the documents and realize that I am not.”

“It’s that bad,” he said. “Disclosing Google’s own words to the American public is something I am, must do, if I am to consider myself a good person. The world that google is building is not a place I, or you or our children want to live in.”

— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) August 13, 2019

Another Google insider, who has come forward already, told O’Keefe and other media outlets recently that it is the programers at Google who use the algorithms to manipulate the information to advance its leftist agenda.

Greg Coppola, a software engineer, told Project Veritas that he doesn’t “have a smoking gun.”

However, “I’ve just been coding since I was ten, I have a Ph.D., I have five years of experience at Google, and I just know how algorithms are. They don’t write themselves. We write them to make them do what we want them to do.”

“I look at Search and I look at Google News, and I see what it’s doing,” he said. “I see Google executives go to Congress and say … that it’s not political, and I’m just so sure that that’s not true.”

Department of Justice officials declined to comment on the document dump. But SaraACarter.com has reviewed the documents and obtained proof from the Google insider that the documents were delivered to the DOJ.

The unnamed Google insider first spoke to O’Keefe’s Project Veritas. O’Keefe has been criticized by the left for outing the political bias of executives and employees of Google and other social media companies.

In the nonprofits most recent video, Project Veritas uses their undercover techniques to get Google employees to talk openly about their disdain for Trump and how their artificial intelligence operates.

Jenn Gennai, who heads Google’s Responsible Innovation Team, did not know she was being filmed by O’Keefe’s group. She told the undercover journalist that “the reason we launched our AI principals is because we’re not putting our line in the sand.

35 vintage photos taken by the EPA reveal what American cities looked like before pollution was regulated,https://www.businessinsider.com,['James Pasley'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.businessinsider.com/what-us-cities-looked-like-before-epa-regulated-pollution-2019-8,"Don't let the soft, sepia tones fool you. The United States used to be dangerously polluted.

Before President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, the environment and its well-being was not a federal priority.

In the early 1970s, the EPA launched the "" The Documerica Project,"" which leveraged 100 freelance photographers to document what the US looked like. By 1974, there were of 81,000 photos. The National Archives digitized nearly 16,000 and made them available online.

Many of the photos were taken before water and air pollution were fully regulated. The Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, and the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972.

Baltimore, Birmingham, Cleveland, Delaware, Denver, Kansas, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New Jersey, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and San Francisco all feature here, in shots filled with smoke, smog, acid, oil, rubbish, and sewage.

None of the 35 photos are pretty (other than the film-photo haze), but it's worth remembering what US cities used to be like before we cared what we put into the air, soil, and water."
DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan: Border Crossings Down 43 Percent Since May,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Mairead Mcardle', 'Andrew C. Mccarthy', 'David French', 'Charles C. W. Cooke', 'Jason Delisle', 'Preston Cooper', 'William Z.

(James Lawler Duggan/Reuters)

Acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday that border crossings have declined 43 percent since May, when arrests between ports of entry at the southern border increased for the fourth straight month to 132,887, up from 99,304 arrests in April.

“So those efforts are making progress, 43 percent reduction in crossings since May,” McAleenan said. “We’re hoping to continue the progress in August.”

McAleenan said DHS is working with Central American countries to protect migrants who need asylum as well as conduct an “aggressive effort against human smugglers,” a project he said “could really change the game.”

“I’ll be going back to Central America next week to try to build on that with El Salvador and Panama and really address this problem as a regional effort,” he said.

The number of immigrants being held at border stations is also down significantly from its June high of 20,000, McAleenan said. “This morning we have less than 4,000, and they’re not staying with us very long. We’re able to repatriate the single adults quickly. The unaccompanied children are going to a better situation with Health and Human Services.”

The acting DHS chief went on to take a shot at what he sees as a toxic political environment “where we’re demonizing law enforcement for doing their jobs,” calling it “concerning.”

There have been several attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in recent weeks, including incidents on Tuesday in which shots were fired into two San Antonio facilities. The FBI is investigating those attacks as an “assault on a federal official case.”

“It can be dangerous, and it can result in people taking actions that are not supported by the facts, that are not in response to anything inappropriate that our men and women of ICE and enforcement removal operations are doing,” McAleenan said. “And I think we’ve got to tone that down, absolutely.”"
ANALYSIS: Who and what the Horowitz report is likely to cover,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/analysis-who-and-what-the-horowitz-report-is-likely-to-cover,"The 448-page report detailing special counsel Robert Mueller's two-year Trump-Russia investigation is public. Next up: Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report into how that investigation started.

That report, anticipated to be released after Congress returns from August recess, will come amid an ongoing contentious debate between Republicans who think the government unfairly targeted President Trump and Democrats who believe Trump deserved to be investigated for his alleged ties to Russia.

But what Horowitz's report, which is expected to delve into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the FBI's use of the salacious and unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, contains has been held close.

Still, recent developments have offered a sneak preview of the cast of characters who could make appearances when Horowitz explains what his team uncovered.

Former FBI Director James Comey received good news a couple weeks ago when the DOJ decided not to charge him over leaking his memos, despite a criminal referral from Horowitz, who concluded Comey leaked classified information and showed a lack of candor. But the leak inquiry was just a narrow slice of the broader investigation Horowitz launched in March of last year.

Horowitz is likely scrutinizing every aspect of the FISA approval process, and the head of the FBI plays an integral role. Comey signed three of the four FISA warrant applications and renewals targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, who was never charged with wrongdoing, during the Trump-Russia investigation. Comey defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier but admitted the dossier wasn't verified when he approved its use, and investigators were still working to verify its contents when he was fired in May 2017. The final FISA renewal happened a month later.

The FISA filings required approval from top members of the FBI and the Justice Department, so other possible targets of Horowitz's inquiry likely included the approvers of the four applications and renewals: Comey; Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates; Dana Boente, the only signatory in active government service and currently Trump’s top lawyer at the FBI; then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller to be special counsel the month before.

Mueller told Congress he wasn't involved in approving that final FISA warrant.

The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the Justice Department and the FBI made extensive use of Steele’s dossier, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Clinton campaign hired the firm through Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm and was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race.

Also last week, McCabe and former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, both fired during the Trump administration, separately sued the Justice Department alleging political bias played a role in their removals. Strzok demanded reinstatement and back pay, and McCabe demanded he receive his full retirement pension.

Horowitz has a history with both men. He previously concluded anti-Trump texts sent from Strzok to FBI lawyer Lisa Page, his mistress, not only showed Strzok was biased but also that he was willing to take official action to affect Trump's electoral prospects. Horowitz also concluded McCabe leaked information without authorization and ""lacked candor"" with investigators.

Horowitz's findings were cited in both their firings, and he's likely not done with them since both played prominent roles in the Trump-Russia investigation.

And last Thursday, FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from ""Russian conspiracy theories."" Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI.

Horowitz is also likely looking into the FBI's use of an article by Michael Isikoff to bolster its FISA filings. The FBI told the court it didn't think the piece was connected to the dossier, even though Isikoff only wrote it after meeting with Steele.

The Justice Department inspector general said when he launched the investigation last year at the behest of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements"" related to FISA filings against Page and review the DOJ’s and the FBI’s dealings with Steele. But while Horowitz said he would consider including other issues that arose during the investigation, Attorney General William Barr has since suggested the inquiry is narrow.

Former FBI General Counsel James Baker is also likely to be among those scrutinized, since he admitted he inserted himself into the FISA approval process and reviewed the first FISA application. Baker defended how the FBI handled the Steele dossier, claiming “we took it seriously” but “we didn’t necessarily take it literally.”

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Officials such as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec knew by October 2016 portions of Steele’s dossier were inaccurate. And State Department officials such as Jonathan Winer and Victoria Nuland seem to have been involved in spreading Steele's information within the U.S. government.

Many members of the media also received info from the Steele dossier, which may have contained Russian disinformation, at the behest of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.

The Steele dossier's central thesis was ""a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation"" between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Mueller didn't agree. Although Mueller concluded the Russians interfered in the 2016 presidential election, the investigation did not establish the Kremlin and Trump's campaign criminally conspired. Mueller’s report also shot down at least one of Steele’s biggest claims — that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen met with foreign hackers in Prague.

Horowitz reportedly “homed in” on Steele, and his team reportedly interviewed the ex-spy in June.

Meanwhile, Barr, along with U.S. Attorney John Durham, launched his own inquiry into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Trump gave him broad declassification authority to look into it."
The USDA Dropped a Corn Bombshell. What It Means for Deere and Other Stocks.,https://www.barrons.com,['Al Root'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-usda-dropped-a-corn-bombshell-what-it-means-for-deere-and-other-stocks-51565705634,"Text size

The U.S. Agriculture Department, or USDA, zigged on Monday when the market expected it to zag.

The farming agency released its monthly world grain report, called WASDE, and, surprisingly, the agency sees a bigger U.S. corn crop—despite poor weather in the Midwest. Corn prices cratered as a result.

Corn futures contact prices dropped “limit down” on Monday—dropping about 6%—meaning futures reached their maximum allowable daily losses on Chicago exchanges. And corn prices were down again Tuesday. What roiled commodity traders was the USDA increasing the expected corn yield per acre for farmers in the 2018/2019 crop year. (For farmers the “crop year” goes from harvest to harvest.) The USDA now expect farmers to produce about 169 bushels of corn per acre, up from expecting 166 in July. (Bad weather has had an impact though—U.S. corn yield was more than 176 bushels per acre last year.)

That’s good news if you are a user of corn, such as a food company, such as corn buyer Post (ticker: POST).

“We view the USDA’s August WASDE report as positive for packaged food manufacturers, as fears over a run-up in grain-driven input cost inflation are being alleviated by a robust corn supply outlook,” writes Citigroup analyst Cornell Burnette in a Tuesday research report. “Thus, our positive thesis for the sector remains intact.”

But higher corn production isn’t such good news if you sell inputs or equipment to farmers, such as Deere (DE).

“Deere’s near-term fundamentals were challenging exiting the second quarter 2019 but there was hope that investors could look through near-term weakness as higher corn prices would deliver demand reacceleration in 2020,” writes Baird analyst Mig Dobre in a Monday evening research report. “The 2019 crop still has challenges that could drive prices higher, but the near term is decidedly more difficult after today’s USDA forecast updates.” Dobre rates shares of Deere Buy, but he cut his price target to $150 from $170 based on the USDA news.

Things could still change for the U.S. corn outlook. Weather, exports, ethanol demand all feed into the USDA models, and all inputs are fluid. Agricultural consultant Mark Feight of International Agribusiness Group, or IAG, believes the corn acreage figures could still come down when the USDA reports figures in October.

Stocks usually don’t overreact to a single crop report because equity prices reflect long-term business value—at least, that’s what the theory says. The long-term trend in agricultural prices and acreage matters more for stocks. Still, there were some big moves along the agricultural value chain on Monday.

Post , for instance, dropped 1.4% on Monday along with the 400-point drop of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That wasn’t a surprise, but ethanol producer Green Plains (GPRE) actually dropped 4.3%, even though corn is an input for the company. Ethanol demand also influences Green Plains stock. Input provider Corteva (CTVA) dropped 6%, and tractor maker Deere dropped 5% in Monday trading.

What if democracy isn't what the Chinese people want?,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/what-if-democracy-isnt-what-the-chinese-people-want,"Protesters in Hong Kong have been waving the American flag and singing the American national anthem to signal their desire for democracy and opposition to the Communist Party of China. American politicians ranging from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy have reciprocated by declaring their support.

Of course, the reality of fighting for democracy is far more complicated than the wishes of U.S. politicians.

As it turns out, many citizens of mainland China, who are supposed to be the ultimate beneficiaries of democratization in China, do not feel nearly as inspired as those in Washington or Hong Kong. In fact, resentment of Hong Kong’s protests runs high among segments of the mainland population.

In a poignant encounter at the Hong Kong International Airport recently, two mainland Chinese citizens angrily told Hong Kong protesters in Mandarin, the official language of China, that the protesters were Chinese and had no business hanging the American flag.

“Are we on American soil?!” one of the mainlanders demanded to know.

The protesters jeered. Their responses were scattered at first, with some saying they liked America and other saying they were not Communists.

Ultimately, security arrived and dragged the mainland citizen away. On his way out, he repeatedly screamed at the protesters, “We are Chinese! F--- your mother!” His greeting to the protesters’ mothers was rendered in Cantonese, the native dialect of the Hong Kong protesters.

Eventually, the protesters found their collective response, and in unison chanted: “People of Hong Kong, add oil!”

“Add oil” means “keep it up.”

It is a chant the protesters have consistently used in their months-old movement. It is a touching rallying cry from ordinary citizens, many of whom are young people who do not wish to live under what they perceive as encroaching Chinese Communist rule.

Yet the mainlanders in this airport incident are hardly alone in voicing their disapproval.

In early August, amid Hong Kong’s ongoing protests, an angry online campaign took hold in mainland China to punish Western luxury brands that appeared to have designated Hong Kong and Macau which is a former Portuguese colony that has reverted to Chinese rule, as independent countries rather than part of China.

The luxury brands, including Coach, Versace, and Givenchy were accused of siding with the protesters of Hong Kong to undermine China’s sovereignty. In the melee that followed, the luxury brands quickly apologized and groveled for forgiveness.

Outside observers can say the nationalist fervor of mainlanders is misguided. If the state-owned media in China were not fanning anti-Hong Kong nationalist sentiments, and if basic rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly were readily available there, mainlanders perhaps would not be as so hostile to the democratic aspirations of the people of Hong Kong.

Yet many of these mainlanders are educated and well traveled, and are exposed to differing political opinions, including those in Hong Kong. That exposure has not necessarily changed their minds.

American politicians have long voiced their support for democracy. It is a reflection of this country’s ideals. After all, America’s foreign policy is not value neutral. In light of the recent clashes between mainland Chinese and Hong Kong citizens, however, U.S. policymakers should ask themselves: What if what they want for China is different from what the people of China want for themselves?

Environmentalists renew bid to overturn EPA policy barring scientists from advisory panels,https://thehill.com,[],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/457631-environmentalists-renew-bid-to-overturn-epa-policy-keeping-scientists-off-advisory-committees,"Environmental groups on Thursday appealed a court decision in their attempt to end the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) policy of excluding certain scientists from serving on its advisory boards.

“The Trump administration is simply trying to payback its polluter cronies by gutting sound science that our health and environmental protections rely on,” Neil Gormley, an attorney with Earthjustice, wrote in a statement announcing the appeal filed in the D.C. Circuit Court.

would have a conflict of interest and shouldn’t be allowed to serve on various scientific panels that advise the EPA.

The move outraged science and environmental advocates who countered that the policy would sideline some of the nation’s top researchers while paving the way for industry-funded scientists to gain more influence at the EPA.

A July report from the Government Accountability Office found the EPA increased the number of industry representatives and consultants on its top scientific board and failed to ensure the appointees met ethics requirements.

But the Trump administration has already had a victory in court.

A judge previously ruled that the scientists involved in the case have no recourse because EPA’s decision is not subject to court review.

Earthjustice argues the EPA’s rule on conflicts of interest violates ethics rules and the procedure for changing them.

EPA did not immediately respond to request for comment.

A similar suit from the Natural Resources Defense Council was filed in June. That case is still being litigated.

The legal battles come at a time when many critics argue that such committees are under attack by the Trump administration.

A recent executive order signed by Trump directs all federal agencies to cut their advisory boards by at least one-third.

Those boards are often filled by people considered to be at the top of their fields who can provide important technical advice to various departments as they consider crafting a wide variety of policies.

Tensions between the boards and the agencies they advise have been particularly high at the EPA.

Members of the Science Advisory Board recently pushed back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public."
Acting DHS secretary on ICE facility attack in Texas: Rhetoric must be toned down,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/acting-dhs-secretary-ice-facility-attack-texas,"Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday on ""Fox & Friends"" that the latest attack on an ICE facility in Texas could be the result of politicians and pundits ""demonizing"" federal agents for enforcing existing laws.

After shots were fired into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office and another facility associated with the agency in San Antonio, Texas, early Tuesday, ICE said in a statement that, ""Political rhetoric and misinformation that various politicians, media outlets and activist groups recklessly disseminate to the American people regarding the ICE mission only serve to further encourage these violent acts.""

McAleenan agreed, calling on those who oppose the Trump administration's policies to tone down their rhetoric before someone gets hurt, noting that this is the fourth such incident targeting an ICE facility.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BOOSTS ABILITY TO DENY GREEN CARDS TO IMMIGRANTS USING WELFARE PROGRAMS

""I think the environment where we're demonizing law enforcement for doing their jobs, for enforcing the laws on the books, is concerning, it can be dangerous and it can result in people taking actions that are not supported by the facts,"" he said.

The FBI is investigating the ""targeted attack"" in which shots were fired at around 3 a.m. at an ICE building where two floors house administrative and executive offices, according to the San Antonio Express-News. The outlet reported another shooting occurred at a separate facility where an ICE contractor is located.

The Texas attack follows two separate incidents last month, when a man attacked an ICE building in Washington state and protesters raised a Mexican flag at a Colorado ICE facility.

Many on the left renewed their harsh criticism of ICE after 680 “removable aliens” were arrested last week at several Mississippi food processing plants where they were working. It was deemed the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in U.S. history.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said the raids were part of a ""campaign of terror"" by the Trump administration, while the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote in a letter to McAleenan that the purpose of the raids was ""to instill fear in Latino and immigrant communities at a time when Latinos are already living in terror.""

McAleenan said progress is being made when it comes to working with Mexico and Central American nations to stem the flow of migrants at the border, but the laws ""in the interior"" must also be enforced, including going after businesses who employ undocumented workers."

President Trump does NOT cheat on the golf course ... so says golf legend John Daly, who golfed with POTUS this week.

Trump's honesty on the golf course has been called into question many, many times in the past ... with former golf partners like Samuel L. Jackson and Oscar De La Hoya flat out saying they witnessed Trump cheat.

Rick Reilly even wrote a book -- a freakin' book -- about Trump's alleged cheating.

But, John Daly -- who's been friends with the Prez for years and golfed with him at Trump National in NJ on Monday -- tells TMZ Sports, it just ain't true.

""It's funny how these people say, 'does he cheat?' Well, when he goes out and plays, if he hits a bad shot, he might hit a Mulligan, but he doesn't count it when we're playing the match.""

For those not down with the golf lingo ... a mulligan is essentially a redo after a bad shot.

The 2-time Majors winner doubled down, and called out someone else who was in the Oval Office.

""It's just amazing that people call him a cheat in golf. You wanna call a cheat in golf? I'll tell ya, Bill Clinton, he took a Mulligan on putts, chips, when I played with him.""

""I don't think Bill Clinton could've broken 100. At least the President, Mr. Trump, he can shoot 80. 78 to 84, probably.""

There's more ... Daly gives us his U.S. Presidents golfer power rankings -- and tells us what him and Trump discussed on the links."
