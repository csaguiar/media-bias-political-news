"Dem-led House formally condemns Trump remarks deemed 'racist,' after dramatic floor fight over Pelosi",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-dems-formally-condemn-trumps-racist-remarks-floor-fight-pelosi,"The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed a resolution Tuesday evening condemning President Trump's ""racist"" remarks this weekend -- although the moment was largely overshadowed by a dramatic floor fight earlier in the day that ended with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ruled out of order for a breach of decorum.

The unexpected mayhem in Congress, which briefly resulted in the revocation of Pelosi's speaking privileges on the House floor, left commentators and lawmakers stunned. ""So, Democrats vote to break House rules and decorum, so that they can call Trump out on decorum. Surreal,"" wrote Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel.

The final resolution, entitled ""H. Res. 489 — Condemning President Trump’s racist comments directed at Members of Congress,"" passed by a vote of 240-187. All Democrats voted yea, with a handful of Republicans joining them: Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Will Hurd, Fred Upton and Susan Brooks.

Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party after calling for Trump's impeachment, also voted yes. The rest of the Republicans voted no.

The resolution asserted that ""President Donald Trump’s racist comments have legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color."" The document mentioned Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and quoted luminaries such as Benjamin Franklin, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President John Kennedy and President Ronald Reagan.

Trump had tweeted on Sunday that unnamed ""Democrat Congresswomen"" should go back and fix the ""corrupt"" and ""crime infested places"" from which they came and then ""come back and show us how it's done."" He later all but affirmed he was referring to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley -- all of whom, except Omar, were born in the United States.

AOC 'SQUAD' HOLDS PRESS CONFERENCE CALLING TRUMP 'OCCUPANT' OF WHITE HOUSE

But, what Democrat leaders envisioned as a moment of Democrat unity turned out to be a striking display of disarray. As Pelosi spoke in favor of the resolution on the floor, she used frank and unsparing terms about Trump's comments -- and soon became the story herself.

""There is no place anywhere for the president's words, which are not only divisive, but dangerous -- and have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color,"" Pelosi, D-Calif., said. ""It's so sad because you would think that there would be a given that we would universally, in this body, just say, 'Of course. Of course.'""

Pelosi continued, her voice rising: ""There's no excuse for any response to those words but a swift and strong unified condemnation. Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president's racist tweets. To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values, and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people. I urge a unanimous vote, and yield back the balance of my time.""

Georgia Republican Rep. Doug Collins rose to challenge her and demand that her words be ""taken down."" The extraordinary rebuke was the first of its kind involving a member of Congress and a speaker of the House in decades.

Collins immediately stood and asked if Pelosi wanted to ""rephrase that comment.""

""I have cleared my remarks with the parliamentarian before I read them,"" Pelosi claimed, before walking away to applause.

""Can I ask the words be taken down? I make a point of order that the gentlewoman's words are unparliamentary and be taken down,"" Collins said.

Fox News is told Collins used House Rule XVII, Clause 1(B). That rule requires that remarks on the floor “be confined to the question under debate, avoiding personality.""

""The chair will remind all members, please, please, do not make personality-based comments,"" the chair, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., responded.

Collins then repeated his request to strike Pelosi's comments. For more than 30 minutes after Collins' objection, House members were huddled with the parliamentarian, Thomas J. Wickham Jr., to determine next steps.

As the consultation dragged on, Pelosi then appeared to leave the House floor, which itself constituted a violation of House Rules when someone’s words were taken down. Members are supposed to be seated on the floor when a member’s words are stricken.

The scene then became even more bizarre when Cleaver told representatives after the lengthy huddle that he was trying to make a fair ruling as to whether Pelosi had broken House rules governing decorum, but people weren’t cooperating. Cleaver explained to Fox News he felt Pelosi was being singled out.

CONWAY BLASTS DEMS' 'TIRED' CLAIMS OF RACISM, SAYS SHE 'TOTALLY DISAGREES' WITH HUSBAND'S SCATHING OP-ED

Cleaver simply declared, ""I abandon the chair,"" and left -- a moment with no apparent precedent in modern congressional history. North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield, also a Democrat, assumed the chair, before Hoyer took the reins.

Hoyer eventually assumed the chair upon Pelosi's request so that a Democrat leader, and not a rank-and-file member, could take control. Hoyer eventually read the parliamentarian's ruling that, based on the precedent ""of May 15, 1984,"" Pelosi’s language did not meet the standard.

""The words used by the gentlewoman from California contained an accusation of racist behavior on the part of the President,” Hoyer said, affirming the House parliamentarian's decision and technically banning Pelosi from speaking on the House floor for the rest of the day.

“The words should not be used in debate,"" Hoyer said.

Democrats, including Hoyer, quickly voted along party lines to restore Pelosi's speaking privileges and keep her comments on the record, effectively overruling the parliamentarian.

The 1984 precedent came after Republican Newt Gingrich, then a Georgia congressman, sparred with then-House Speaker Tip O’Neill, a Massachusetts Democrat. O'Neill remarked: ""My personal opinion is this: You deliberately stood in that well before an empty House and challenged these people, and you challenged their Americanism, and it is the lowest thing I have ever seen in my thirty-two years in Congress.""

The parliamentarian determined at the time that the speaker’s use of the word ""lowest"" amounted to inappropriate language, and O'Neill's words were taken down.

Collins, in a statement late Tuesday, condemned Democrats for effectively reversing the ruling.

""Democrats admitted her words violated the rules of decorum, the very rules that ensure democracy’s every voice can be heard as we carry out the people’s business,"" Collins said. ""Still, every Democrat lawmaker voted against striking her words from the record. It bears repeating the House prizes decorum because it is a symptom of and a catalyst for a healthy, confident democracy. I hope we recover that confidence soon and more forward with respect for the American people who sent elected officials, including the president, to represent them in Washington.”

But, Democrats privately told Fox News that rules of the House technically have been broken all the time, and that Republicans just wanted to distract from Trump's remarks.

Among other volumes, the House has used Thomas Jefferson’s ""Manual of Parliamentary Practice"" as a touchstone for House operations even today. Jefferson’s manual stated that House members cannot use language on the floor ""which is personally offensive to the President."" The manual also said members cannot accuse the president of ""having made a bigoted or racist statement.""

The House additionally has relied on Cannon’s Book of Precedents, authored by the late Missouri Rep. Clarence Cannon, a Democrat. Cannon’s book says that ""personal criticism, innuendo, ridicule and terms of opprobrium"" are out of the order in the House.

House Republican leaders, meanwhile, said the outrage over Trump's comments was ""all about politics."" A series of news organizations, meanwhile, have flatly referred to Trump's comments as ""racist,"" without acknowledging the dispute over the matter.

South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham told ""Fox & Friends"" that the progressive representatives were a ""bunch of communists,"" and charged that Omar was plainly anti-Semitic. Just over a dozen GOP lawmakers have condemned Trump's comments.

Omar previously has been criticized by prominent members of both parties for making remarks widely deemed anti-Semitic. This past March, the Democrat-led House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan resolution that indirectly condemned Omar's repeated ""anti-Semitic"" and ""pernicious"" comments, including some in which she suggested Jewish politicians in the U.S. were bought and paid for.

The final House resolution, after days of Democrat infighting, did not actually mention Omar by name, and instead condemned bigotry of ""all kinds.""

Omar has also referred to 9/11 as a day when ""some people did something,"" rankling Trump and top Republicans, who called the remarks clearly insensitive.

“We all know that [AOC] and this crowd are a bunch of communists, they hate Israel, they hate our own country, they’re calling the guards along our border—the Border Patrol agents—concentration camp guards,” Graham said.

Some Republicans have condemned the president's remarks, including Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who tweeted: ""There is no excuse for the president’s spiteful comments –they were absolutely unacceptable and this needs to stop.""

After the final vote on the resolution Tuesday night, Texas Rep. Al Green, a Democrat, reintroduced articles of impeachment against Trump. Omar and Tlaib, in a press conference Monday, had pushed for Trump to be impeached, saying he had been ""credibly accused"" of criminal collusion with Russians -- despite the contrary results of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe.

Green said his revived impeachment effort was related to Trump's comments this weekend. An impeachment resolution is privileged, meaning it goes to the front of the legislative line. It will be up for consideration either Wednesday or Thursday.

However, it is not guaranteed that there will be a straight up-or-down vote on the articles of impeachment. The House could move to table, or set aside, Green’s measure. Therefore, the vote is not on impeaching the president, but whether to kill or set aside Green’s articles of impeachment. The vote is two steps removed from an actual roll call tally.

Trump Officials Face Cover-Up Allegations After Failed Citizenship Question Push,https://www.npr.org,['Hansi Lo Wang'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/16/742259233/trump-officials-face-cover-up-allegations-after-failed-citizenship-question-push,"Trump Officials Face Cover-Up Allegations After Failed Citizenship Question Push

Days after President Trump announced he's no longer pushing for a citizenship question on the 2020 census, officials in his administration are now facing allegations of covering up the question's origins.

Challengers of the question filed a formal request Tuesday for U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of New York to consider imposing penalties on the Trump administration for allegedly providing false or misleading statements as part of the multiple lawsuits over the question, which was originally approved by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

Administration officials allegedly engaged in conduct that is ""nothing less than a fraud on the Court,"" plaintiffs' attorneys with the ACLU, New York Civil Liberties Union and Arnold & Porter argue.

""Through the use of false or misleading testimony, they obscured evidence suggesting that the true purpose of Secretary Ross's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census — suppressing the political power of minority immigrant communities,"" the lawyers argue.

They also note, however, that ""the misconduct appears to have been perpetrated by senior Commerce and [Justice Department] officials — not the career DOJ attorneys who litigated this case.""

Last week, the Justice Department asked to switch out every single career DOJ attorney who had been working on the lawsuits for months. Furman denied the request, which did not provide any explanation for the change as required by a local court rule.

In their motion for sanctions, the plaintiffs are asking Furman to order the Trump administration to pay their attorney's fees as well as other monetary penalties. They are also requesting more releases of internal documents and questioning under oath of administration officials in order ""to clarify the roles of specific senior government personnel,"" including Ross, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and GOP redistricting strategist Thomas Hofeller.

A spokesperson for the Justice Department, Kelly Laco, said the department — which is representing the administration in these lawsuits — declined to comment.

In a written statement, A. Mark Neuman — a former adviser to Ross accused of providing false testimony and withholding evidence — rejected the allegations.

""I have a consistent 30 year record of relentless focus on effective strategy and operations to count the 'hardest to count populations', including and especially Latino immigrant communities,"" Neuman wrote in an email. ""My own mother was a Spanish-speaking immigrant to the United States. The idea that I would work to undermine the interests of my own community is an outrageous falsehood.""

Attorneys for plaintiffs in one of the New York-based cases first raised claims of a cover-up in late May shortly after they uncovered documents from Hofeller's hard drives after he died last August. In an unpublished study, Hofeller concluded that adding a question about U.S. citizenship status to the census would produce the data needed to give Republicans and non-Hispanic white people a political advantage when new voting districts are drawn after the 2020 census.

Another file found among Hofeller's documents contains a paragraph that matches word for word with a part of a letter that Justice Department official John Gore has identified as an early draft of the administration's formal request for a citizenship question. The paragraph justifies the question's addition with the Voting Rights Act.

Better protection of the voting rights of racial minorities was the administration's original stated reason for the question, but President Trump did not mention it at all in the executive order he released last week explaining why he thinks citizenship information is important.

""I understand that some State officials are interested in such data for districting purposes,"" Trump wrote. ""This order will assist the [Commerce] Department in securing the most accurate and complete citizenship data so that it can respond to such requests from the States.""

After almost two weeks of uncertainty in the Trump administration's strategy following the Supreme Court's decision in late June to keep the citizenship question blocked, Trump announced last week that his administration is relying instead on the Census Bureau's original recommendation — compiling existing citizenship records from the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies.

Ross had already directed the bureau to gather those records last year. A recent filing to the White House's Office of Management and Budget confirms that Ross has now ordered the bureau to release citizenship data based on those records to state redistricting officials in 2021.

Earlier Tuesday, Furman signed an order that permanently blocks the administration from adding a citizenship question to forms for next year's head count. U.S. District Judge George Hazel is considering approving a similar order proposed by both the administration and plaintiffs in the Maryland-based lawsuits.

Furman had previously decided to delay reviewing the cover-up claims to avoid interfering with the Supreme Court, which had not ruled yet on the issue. Still, during a hearing in June, Furman called the plaintiffs' allegations ""serious.""

The move by the plaintiffs comes as the House of Representatives prepares for an expected vote on Wednesday to hold Ross and U.S. Attorney General William Barr in contempt for refusing to provide full copies of emails as part of the House Oversight and Reform Committee's ongoing investigation into the citizenship question. The president has claimed executive privilege over the requested documents.

In the meantime, the Census Bureau is continuing its final preparations for the constitutionally mandated head count of every person living in the U.S. The census is set to officially begin in January in rural Alaska before rolling out to the rest of the country in March. The numbers will be used to determine how congressional seats, Electoral College votes and federal funding are distributed among the states for the next decade.

Throughout the controversy over the citizenship question, the bureau has been been under pressure to meet critical milestones, including the printing of paper forms, amidst the legal uncertainty. But at a hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday, Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham tried to look on the bright side.

""I think we're well positioned at this point. We have a definite path forward,"" Dillingham said. ""Some people would speculate that even the attention that may be considered attention of disagreements on the census could, in fact, become beneficial because people know now that the census is very important.""

Other census advocates, however, worry that the attention on the failed citizenship question push has heightened fears about the count, especially among immigrant communities who may be more likely now to stay away."
CNN Invites White Supremacist Richard Spencer to Talk About Trump’s Racist Tweets,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Kelly Weill', 'Justin Baragona']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-invites-white-supremacist-richard-spencer-to-talk-about-trumps-racist-tweets,"CNN interviewed white supremacist Richard Spencer during a Tuesday segment on President Donald Trump’s racist tweets, in another example of a news outlet normalizing far-right radicals by giving them a mainstream platform.

The segment on Jake Tapper’s The Lead covered neo-Nazis’ support for Trump’s racist attacks on four progressive congresswomen of color. The spot included an interview with Spencer who said Trump is playing a “con game” and that his attacks were not racist enough.

“He gives us nothing outside of racist tweets,” he said. “And by racist tweets, I mean tweets that are meaningless and cheap and express the kind of sentiments you might hear from your drunk uncle while he’s watching [Sean] Hannity.”

CNN correspondent Sara Sidner also interviewed Joanna Mendelson, a senior investigative reporter at the Anti-Defamation League, who spoke about the effect of Trump’s racist tweets.

“Essentially, it normalizes hate and it makes it acceptable,” Mendelson said of the tweets.

Indeed, Spencer shared the CNN segment on his Twitter account shortly after it aired.

“The CNN anchors didn't understand that Spencer was trying to position Trump as a moderate and to mock other white supremacists who supported Trump,” said Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Project at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center. “Spencer was saying that Trump was performing racism on Twitter, but that his policies do not go far enough to be considered support for white supremacists goals.”

CNN and Sidner did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Tapper tweeted that Sidner “covers racists and white supremacists for us (among other subjects) and does a great job. She did a taped package for cnn about the reaction of white supremacists to the president’s tweets.”

Spencer is an open white nationalist who advocates for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” Spencer was a key player and featured speaker at Unite the Right, the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a neo-Nazi murdered an anti-racist protester. (Spencer is currently being sued over the event.) Open neo-Nazi groups like the Traditionalist Worker Party have provided security at his events. He has repeatedly invoked Nazi slogans and imagery, including calling media the “lügenpresse” (""lying press"") and leading a Hitler-type salute of Trump. Spencer is so racist he is banned from most countries in Europe.

Spencer has also been accused of domestic abuse, allegedly beating his now-estranged wife throughout their relationship, including while she was pregnant—accusations he denies.

Academics have cautioned against offering white supremacists wide exposure, such as on-air interviews in slick studios.

“Spencer will turn this into a new wave of attention within his own media ecosystem, where CNN has now just legitimated a litany of white supremacists, many of who were relegated to online obscurity,” said Donovan.

CNN is the most-recent mainstream news outlet to struggle with how to handle the outsized stature of the racist far right since they leapt to support Trump during his presidential campaign. Last year, NBC’s Today show hosted the leader of the white supremacist group Identity Evropa, who repeated the group’s recruitment talking points. In 2016, Mother Jones ran a heavily criticized article describing Spencer as “dapper” in the headline. The New York Times ran a similarly soft-focused article on Tony Hovater as a harmless young man from the Midwest despite his membership in the violent Traditionalist Worker Party.

Defense Secretary nominee Esper grilled over contractor ties in heated confirmation hearing,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/defense-secretary-nom-esper-grilled-over-contractor-ties-in-heated-confirmation-hearing,"Mark Esper, who took over the role of Acting Secretary of Defense after former Acting Secretary Patrick Shanahan stepped down in June, faced tense moments in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee Tuesday during his confirmation process for the permanent Secretary job.

Esper, a former Army veteran who served 10 years on active duty and 11 years in the National Guard and Army Reserve, was grilled by multiple senators over his history as a lobbyist for Raytheon, a defense contractor he left in 2017 before becoming Secretary of the Army. Esper insisted there is nothing to worry about.

BOLTON TOUTS NATO ALLIES' $100B MILITARY SPENDING SPREE AFTER TRUMP PUSH: 'UNEQUALED TRIUMPH'

“It’s my commitment to the nation’s security, it’s my commitment to the men and women in uniform that drives me,” Esper said when asked about Raytheon by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. “Not anything else.”

After he became Acting Defense Secretary, Esper said in a memo that he would limit his involvement in any matters related to Raytheon, and that his staff would “screen all matters” and consult with the Standards of Conduct Office where appropriate.

During the hearing, he stated that he will employ a “robust screening process” and “remain in constant contact with our ethics personnel.” When asked by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., if he would recuse himself from matters involving Raytheon, Esper asserted that he is ”fully committed to living up to my ethics commitments.”

That was not enough for 2020 Democratic candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who claimed that because Esper qualified his recusal instead of committing to recuse himself from any and all matters related to his former employer, it was “a conflict of interest given that Raytheon does billions of dollars worth of business every year with the Defense Department.”

Esper responded by saying that ethics officials at the Pentagon recommended that he not recuse for all matters.

Warren then pointed to an exception to ethics obligations that she said Esper referred to in a memo, which would allow for a waiver that would permit him to get involved in matters that directly affect Raytheon’s financial interest if no other official can do the job.

“This smacks of corruption, plain and simple,” Warren said.

But in a letter to Esper from the Department of Defense’s Office of the General Counsel obtained by Fox News, Director Scott Thompson refuted Warren’s accusations, “At no time while serving as the Secretary of the Army or the Acting Secretary of Defense did you request, seek, or receive a waiver or authorization related to your Ethics Agreement and ethics obligations.”

Esper, who earlier in the hearing said he does not have any financial stake in Raytheon other than the deferred compensation, took issue with Warren’s implication that he is incapable of ethically performing the duties of the job.

“At the age of 18 I went to West Point and I swore an oath to defend this Constitution and I embraced the motto called Duty and Honor and Country and I've lived my life in accordance with those values ever since then,” Esper said. “I went to war for this country, I served overseas for this country, I've stepped down from jobs that paid me well more than what I was working anywhere else. And each time it was to serve the public good and to serve the young men and women of our armed services.”

According to the Fox News Research Dept. and Open Secrets.org, Warren received $31,919 in campaign donations from the defense industry for her 2020 campaign. Raytheon gave her nearly $9,000 in 2018. The company is headquartered in her home state.

Other issues that came up during the hearing included how the United States should deal with Iran.

Esper pointed to the need to focus on Iran and lingering threats from groups like al Qaeda, while building American military capabilities. At the same time, he made clear that “we do not want war with Iran.”

Regarding Russian efforts to interfere with American elections, Esper said the U.S. is in a better position than in the past, but there is still work to be done.

“We’ve been doing more but way short of what is necessary,” he said, adding “we need to be on guard and vigilant.”

In terms of new military technology, Esper said artificial intelligence is of the utmost importance.

“I think artificial intelligence will likely change the character of warfare, and I believe whoever masters it first will dominate on the battlefield for many, many, many years,” he said.

“We have to get there first. We have to.”

The testimony came as tech investor Peter Thiel called out Google for working with China, and not the U.S., on a massive artificial intelligence project. Thiel said the relationship could be “treasonous,” and President Trump said Tuesday morning that his administration would look into it.

TRUMP SUGGESTS GOOGLE COULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR 'TREASON'

If confirmed, Esper would be the first permanent Defense Secretary since James Mattis stepped down at the end of 2018. Shanahan, who filled the role on an interim basis afterwards, had been considered for the permanent job, but reportedly withdrew due to a 2010 domestic incident that he did not want to be brought up during the confirmation process.

For the duration of Esper’s confirmation process, Navy Secretary Richard Spencer has assumed the role of Acting Defense Secretary, since federal law forbids people under consideration for a permanent secretary position to serve as acting secretary.

Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said that a final confirmation vote for Esper could take place as soon as later this week, but no later than next Tuesday."
House votes to condemn Trump's racist tweets with support from only 4 Republicans,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Christal Hayes', 'Jason Lalljee', 'Sarah Elbeshbishi', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/16/president-trump-house-resolution-squad-aoc/1743579001/,"CLOSE Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi responded to the recent comments made by President Donald Trump and the White House while on the House floor. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – The House formally condemned President Donald Trump’s Twitter posts as racist on Tuesday – in a vote split largely along party lines despite pressure for Republicans to denounce the president’s attacks on four Democratic congresswomen of color that they should ""go back"" to where they came from.

The vote on the resolution condemning a series of Trump’s remarks and Twitter posts came after a dramatic and combative hours-long debate that hit several snags due to long-standing House rules that prohibit any personal attacks on the president.

The vote, 240-187, fell nearly entirely along party lines with only four Republicans voting with Democrats. The four Republicans lawmakers are: Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan and retiring Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who recently left the GOP to become an independent, also voted in support of the resolution.

The resolution specifically called Trump's comments about ""The Squad"" — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. — ""racist"" and says the attacks have ""legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.""

Everything we know: Trump triples down on his controversial tweets about 'The Squad.'

The vote put Republicans on the record as to whether they denounced the president's comments or stuck beside him. Throughout Tuesday's debates Democrats aimed to pressure Republicans to hold Trump accountable while Republicans resisted, denouncing the resolution as a political ploy.

The intense debate over the president's rhetoric led to the House halting proceedings for nearly two hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's comments “racist” and a top Republican asked her remarks be taken down.

""These comments from the White House are disgraceful and disgusting and these comments are racist,"" Pelosi said. ""Every single member of this institution — Democratic and Republican — should join us in condemning the president’s racist tweets. To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.""

Editorial: Trump's racist rants are too offensive to overlook

As Pelosi called the president’s tweets racist, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., tried to interrupt and cut off her speech. Pelosi only spoke louder, looking down at her prepared remarks.

After Pelosi was done, Collins looked wide-eyed at Pelosi and asked if she wanted to ""rephrase that comment."" Pelosi shot back: ""I have cleared my remarks with the parliamentarian before I read them."" House Democrats started cheering and clapping.

The move led to two hours of delay as officials debated over whether Pelosi violated House rules, which the House ruled she had. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., who was presiding over the House floor at the time, abdicated his post due to the dramatic fighting on both sides.

""We don’t ever, ever want to pass up, it seems, an opportunity to escalate. That’s what this is,” he said, noting that he tried to remain fair. But, he said. “fairness isn’t enough. We want to just fight.""

“I’ll abandon the chair,” Cleaver said, slamming the gavel on the dais and storming away as House officials watched in amazement.

The moment was replayed on loop on C-SPAN like a moment from an NFL game with reporters left with their jaws dropped remarking aloud whether this had happened before. A large crowd of journalists gathered in the gallery overlooking the House floor to watch the debate.

Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., and chairman of the House Rules Committee, also got in a heated back-and-forth with Republicans after he attacked the president's comments in a speech as something that ""used to be reserved for the darkest corners of the internet.""

""This is proudly using Twitter as a megaphone to attack fellow Americans,"" he said. ""These are American citizens being turned into some kind of scary 'other,' not because of their party, but because of their background, their race and their opinions.""

He added: ""I implore my colleagues to think twice before you follow the president off a cliff.""

Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Ga., took issue with McGovern's comments, saying they clearly violated rules and were ""diminishing"" the institution of the House of Representatives.

Pelosi told members of her caucus Tuesday morning she wasn't worried about House rules on calling out the president's comments, describing the four congresswomen as their ""sisters"" and saying Trump's ""words were racist,"" according to an aide in the room.

She added that she hoped Republicans would join them in condemning the comments by voting in a bipartisan fashion for the resolution.

""If they can’t support condemning the words of the President, well that’s a message in and of itself,"" Pelosi said, according to the source.

Most Republicans did not condemn the president and Republican leaders in both the House and Senate refused to do so throughout the day Tuesday, alleging the outcry is over politics.

“Let’s not be false about what is happening here today,” said GOP minority leader Kevin McCarthy. “This is all about politics and beliefs of ideologies.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to call the comments racist and specifically said ""the president's not a racist.""

""Our words do matter. We all know politics is a contact sport. But it's about time we lowered the temperature all across the board,"" said McConnell, R-Ky. ""All of us ought to contribute to a better level of discourse.""

After Tuesday's vote, Republicans said they felt the day was wasted talking about the president instead of working to settle issues that will help the American people.

""This resolution divides our nation and distracts us from addressing the issues the American people sent us here to solve,"" Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said. ""It's time House Democrats start focusing on the real problems facing the American people, instead of their own.""

CLOSE Four congresswomen reacted to President Donald Trump seemingly suggesting they ""go back"" to the countries they ""originally came from"". USA TODAY

Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., said the debate and chaos the resolution caused on the House floor left him ""struggling."" He said, to him, this debate ""is not about race.""

""It should be about the issues that we disagree on, trying to come together and find common ground,"" Newhouse said. ""That’s what I’m looking forward to try to find some respectful discourse and some civility out of all this.""

Along with the resolution, Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., introduced a measure that would censure Trump for his racist comments. Democrats aren't expected to take up the measure for a vote, instead hoping the resolution on Tuesday would garner bipartisan support.

Trump wrote on Sunday that it was ""so interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"" now telling the U.S. how to run its government. He did not mention Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley or Tlaib by name.

""Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Then come back and show us how it is done.""

All four are American citizens. The four progressive freshmen lawmakers are some of the president's most vocal critics in the House and have become known as ""The Squad"" — sticking together even when they seem to go against the rest of their party on key votes and issues.

The president's tweets appeared to help unite House Democrats after weeks of infighting that exploded into the public last month over sending emergency money to border agencies running migrant detention centers.

The feud garnered headlines after Pelosi criticized members of ""The Squad,"" telling New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd that the four congresswomen ""have their public whatever and their Twitter world"" but do not ""have any following.""

Ocasio-Cortez questioned why Pelosi would single out the new women of color in the caucus, telling the Washington Post it was ""outright disrespectful.""

The back-and-forth digs ended over the weekend after Trump's attacks. Instead, Democrats united against the president and denounced his comments.

The resolution not only condemns Trump's comments. It also highlights immigration as a centerpiece of American history and culture, quoting presidents throughout history and comparing them to the policies of the Trump administration, which has been heavily scrutinized due in part to the worsening conditions in migrant detention centers at the southern U.S. border.

""The commitment to immigration and asylum has been not a partisan cause but a powerful national value that has infused the work of many Presidents,"" the resolution reads. ""American patriotism is defined not by race or ethnicity but by devotion to the Constitutional ideals of equality, liberty, inclusion, and democracy and by service to our communities and struggle for the common good.""

"In Eric Garner case, Justice Department declines civil rights charges against New York City police officer",https://www.foxnews.com,['Lucia Suarez Sang'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-will-not-pursue-charges-against-cop-involved-in-eric-garners-death-source,"Despite disagreement between top prosecutors regarding the strength of the case, the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday ultimately declined to bring civil rights charges against the New York City police officer involved in the controversial and racially-charged death of Eric Garner -- with Attorney General Bill Barr stepping in to make the ultimate decision, a person familiar with the case confirmed to Fox News.

Garner, who was black, died in 2014 during his arrest for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes outside a Staten Island convenience store. The 43-year-old refused to be handcuffed, and cops -- including the white officer who the DOJ declined to prosecute -- took him down.

A senior justice official familiar with the case told Fox News the DOJ's Civil Rights Division recommended charges be brought against officer Daniel Pantaleo -- but the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York disagreed, saying the government's burden of proof could not be met.

Ultimately, the decision fell to Barr, who broke the tie and made the final call not to bring charges after several briefings with lawyers on both sides of the issue and after viewing the video of the arrest gone awry on numerous occasions.

In the video, taken by a bystander, Garner was heard crying out “I can’t breathe” at least 11 times before he fell unconscious. The phrase has since become a rallying cry among those protesting perceived racial injustices perpetrated by police departments nationwide.

FLASHBACK: ERIC GARNER CHOKEHOLD DEATH: NO INDICTMENT FOR NYPD COP, DOJ TO OPEN CIVIL RIGHTS PROBE

The decision not to bring charges against Pantaleo comes a day before the statute of limitations was set to expire, marking five years since the encounter that led to Garner’s death.

A state grand jury has also refused to indict the officer on criminal charges. Civil rights prosecutors have advocated charges in the case, though they've met fierce resistance.

Garner's family and attorney were informed of a decision Tuesday morning. During a press conference later with the Rev. Al Sharpton, Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, demanded the police department act immediately to fire Pantaleo.

""We are here with heavy hearts because the DOJ has failed us,"" she said. ""Five years ago my son said he couldn't breathe 11 times. Today we can't breathe because they have let us down.""

She added: ""We will keep pushing. This is not the end. We are asking the commissioner to make the right decision.""

An attorney for the family said the DOJ's failure to bring charges against Pantaleo was a ""national shame"" and said every candidate running for president will need to take a position on this case.

Chokeholds are banned under police policy and, though Pantaleo maintained he used a different and legal takedown maneuver called the “seatbelt,” the medical examiner’s office has said a chokehold contributed to Garner’s death.

But, according to a senior Department of Justice official, prosecutors still felt they couldn't reach the bar for proving Pantaleo or other officers acted ""willfully"" during the physical confrontation.

""What's communicated to the officer is relevant, but it is not determinative to what was going through the officer's mind,"" the official said.

ERICA GARNER, DAUGHTER OF NYPD CHOKEHOLD VICTIM, DIES AFTER SUFFERING HEART ATTACK

Part of the Department's thinking in the matter relied on Supreme Court precedent, specifically, the case 'Graham v. Connor,' in which the high court ruled ""not every push or shove violates the Fourth Amendment"" and the fact that police officers must make ""split-second decisions"" has to be taken into account.

The particular test that could not be met was whether the officers -- and Pantaleo in particular -- carried out their actions ""willfully,"" the official said. To meet that burden, the government would have been required to prove officers were acting with ""some clarity of thought.""

""We expect a different outcome when a member of the public comes in contact with a police officer,"" a senior DOJ official said. ""But the decision to bring federal charges is a different matter.""

The New York Police Department brought Pantaleo up on departmental charges earlier this year. An administrative judge has not ruled whether he violated policy. He could face dismissal, but Police Commissioner James O’Neill has the final say. O'Neill will not make a formal decision until the police administrative judge who oversaw the disciplinary trial renders her verdict, the New York Times reported.

The NYPD said in a tweet on Tuesday that the internal department disciplinary case against Pantaleo is ""proceeding and a determination has NOT yet been made.""

""Today's announcement by the US Department of Justice does not affect this process,"" it said.

None of the other police officers involved in Garner's death have been charged with a crime or disciplined by the Police Department.

""All the officers involved need to be off the books. The steers of New York City are not safe with them,"" Carr said. ""Five years ago, it was my family. Tomorrow it could be yours... We are going to keep fighting. This will not be swept under the rug.""

In the years since Garner’s death, Pantaleo has remained on the job but not in the field, and activists have decried the fact he's still being issued paychecks that include union-negotiated raises.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement that the city put their faith in the federal government to act on possible charges against Pantaleo and that they ""won't make that mistake again.""

""New York City is not the same city it was five years ago. We are a different city, and we must act like a different city,"" he said. ""Moving forward, we will not wait for the federal government to commence our own disciplinary proceedings.""

The city of New York also reached a civil settlement with Garner's family in 2015 for $5.9 million.

Pompeo layers over top State Dept. negotiator ahead of talks with Russia,https://www.politico.com,['Eliana Johnson'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/16/state-russia-pompeo-andrea-thompson-1417602,"State Department official Andrea Thompson’s planned presence at a meeting with Russia’s foreign minister raised concerns after it was revealed she had failed to disclose ties to Maria Butina. | Thomas Peter/AP Photo foreign policy Pompeo layers over top State Dept. negotiator ahead of talks with Russia The official, Andrea Thompson, stands accused of failing to disclose ties to a GOP operative caught up in the Maria Butina affair.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed concern about sending one of his top arms control negotiators, Andrea Thompson, to head a U.S. delegation meeting with Russia’s deputy foreign minister this week after it was revealed that she had failed to disclose her ties to the boyfriend of Russian foreign agent Maria Butina.

So Pompeo dispatched his deputy, John Sullivan, to lead the delegation instead. The delegation, which now includes Sullivan, Thompson and other senior U.S. officials, is attending the strategic security dialogue in Geneva, where American officials are set to talk with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov about arms control, including what sort of arrangement might replace the International Nuclear Forces treaty that the Trump administration scuttled earlier this year.

Story Continued Below

Thompson’s presence at the meeting raised concern in some quarters of the administration after the Washington Post reported last month that she had not disclosed her personal and financial ties to Paul Erickson, the veteran GOP operative who worked with Butina to establish a Kremlin backchannel to the Trump campaign in 2016.

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a private letter to the State Department in recent days regarding Thompson’s “apparent failures to disclose required and material information to the SFRC during her nomination process,” according to Juan Pachon, Menendez’s communications director on the committee.

A State Department spokesman confirmed receipt of the letter, but declined to comment on Pompeo’s last-minute decision to send Sullivan to Geneva, or on whether the department was satisfied with Thompson’s disclosures during her confirmation process.

Thompson failed to alert her superiors that Erickson officiated her 2017 wedding, according to two U.S. officials, and did not disclose during her Senate confirmation that her husband, David Gillian, a retired Australian Army officer, had wired Erickson $100,000 for an allegedly fraudulent investment scheme in which Gillian and others were allegedly defrauded by Erickson -- a transaction laid out by the FBI in court filings.

The failure to disclose could have serious repercussions for Thompson, former officials said, though it is not necessarily fatal to her career.

“All senior officers have to report on their finances and any connections to overseas interests. Diplomatic Security should review her clearance,” said John Sipher, who spent nearly three decades working in the CIA’s clandestine service, including a stint in Moscow. “When Erickson and Butina were all over the news, she should have reported her connection. At the very least it now puts the administration in a bind where critics can question her competence, professionalism and judgment.”

At the time of her wedding and her then-fiance’s investment in Erickson’s business four months prior, Thompson was working as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. A year later, in April of 2018, she was confirmed by the Senate as undersecretary for arms control and international security.

At the time, Gillian was complaining to Erickson that he hadn’t seen the promised return on his investment, the FBI said, and received what agents described as a “lulling payment” of $5,000 -- intended to allay Gillian’s concerns -- on March 29, 2018, the month after Thompson’s Senate Committee hearing and the month before her confirmation vote.

Thompson’s alleged failure to disclose her relationship with Erickson, who was by then the subject of national news stories detailing his relationship with Butina, during her Senate confirmation has raised anxiety among Russia hawks in the Trump orbit who fear that Thompson, one of the last remaining acolytes of the president’s first national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, is insufficiently hard-headed and enters this week’s talks in a compromised position.

One of these officials said that Thompson’s failure to disclose her connection to Erickson indicates that her “judgment is in question.”

“She either didn’t understand what she was doing … or she did and she tried to conceal it,” this person said.

Flynn was pushed out of the administration in February of 2017 after news reports indicated he had misled senior White House officials about the substance of his conversations with Russian officials during the transition period. He stands accused of lying to the FBI about the nature of those interactions, though he has suggested that investigators tricked him into making false statements.

In March of 2017, Thompson filed a public financial disclosure report after joining the vice president’s office. Prosecutors in the Erickson case note that her then fiancé, Gillian, had wired $100,000 to Erickson on February 28, 2017. That was just days before her paperwork was submitted, but neither Erickson’s nor Butina’s role in the presidential campaign had yet been reported.

A subsequent financial disclosure would have been due in May 2018, according to a source in the vice president’s office, but by then, Thompson was at the State Department.

In the interim, Erickson became the subject of national headlines when reports surfaced that he had made overtures to the Trump campaign offering to establish a backchannel to the Kremlin. Erickson was engaged in a romantic relationship with Maria Butina, who has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an unregistered Russian agent.

Throughout the 2016 campaign, prosecutors argued, Butina, a 30-year-old graduate student, worked to forge relationships with influential Republican political organizations, including the National Rifle Association, in an attempt to create backchannels to the Russian government. She worked both to organize trips for influential GOP operatives to visit Moscow and to get access to government officials for Russian delegations visiting the U.S.

A former GOP operative and fundraiser, Erickson was indicted in February on fraud charges in February and pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege that he swindled upwards of $2 million from investors for three business propositions, including one to invest in a chain of elder care facilities, and did not spend the money on any of them.

Though the charges were not directly related to Erickson’s relationship with Butina, the FBI alleged that “some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina."""

“The policy that I have communicated to my counterpart, if confirmed, (Turkey’s) defense minister is that you can either have the S-400 or you can have the F-35, you cannot have both,” said Army Secretary Mark Esper, testifying at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Broke Rules in Shake-Up of Science Panels, Federal Watchdog Says",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/climate/epa-advisory-panels-gao-report.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration failed to follow ethics rules last year when it dismissed academic members of Environmental Protection Agency advisory boards and replaced them with appointees connected to industry, a federal watchdog agency concluded Monday.

The agency, the Government Accountability Office, found that the administration “did not consistently ensure” that appointees to E.P.A. advisory panels met federal ethics requirements. It also concluded that Trump administration officials violated E.P.A. guidelines by not basing the appointments on recommendations made by career staff members.

Scott Pruitt, President Trump’s first E.P.A. administrator who resigned last year amid ethics scandals, remade the agency’s science advisory panels because he said they did not fairly represent the United States geographically, or the industries affected by regulations.

The percentage of academic scientists serving on one E.P.A. panel, the Scientific Advisory Board, dropped 27 percent during the first year of the Trump administration. Academics on the agency’s Board of Scientific Counselors dropped 45 percent. Investigators found that the percentage of academics on E.P.A. advisory boards remained stable around 83 percent during the first year President Barack Obama was in office ."
Bureau of Land Management to move headquarters from DC to Colorado,https://thehill.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453321-bureau-of-land-management-to-move-headquarters-from-dc-to-colorado,"The Trump administration plans to relocate the headquarters of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from Washington, D.C., to Colorado, according to two lawmakers.

The reorganization, first considered under former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkePress: Acosta, latest to walk the plank Senior Trump administration official to leave post next week 2020 Democrats vow to get tough on lobbyists MORE, is aimed at putting more agency officials closer to the lands they manage out West, though critics have questioned moving tenured policy officials far from the nation's capital.

Currently only about 4 percent of BLM employees live in D.C., but the proposal would shrink that number even further, leaving just 60 of the nearly 400 BLM employees in the nation’s capital, according to a letter from Interior to a Republican lawmaker dated Tuesday, obtained by The Hill.

Just 27 employees will be moved to the new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo., with the rest divided among the western states of Utah, Nevada and other existing local offices, according to the document.

Since BLM has nearly 10,000 employees, the reorganization plans would effectively move the agency entirely out of D.C.

Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner Cory Scott GardnerBottom Line Congress mobilizes on cyber threats to electric grid The Hill's Morning Report - 2020 jitters hit both parties in the Senate MORE (R) confirmed the headquarters move on Monday, calling it a “significant win” for his state.

“This means that people will be able to have greater say, greater impact on public lands decisions that affect their community,” Gardner said in a video he tweeted.

“This is an effort I started years ago under the Obama administration so that we could have the policymakers in Washington closer to the people that are most impacted by the decisions that Washington makes.”

The Department of Interior, which oversees BLM, did not respond to requests for comment or details about the plan. The agency is expected to make an announcement later Tuesday.

Democratic lawmakers criticized the administration for failing to alert them earlier of the planned move, which is expected to affect BLM managers and other agency officials.

“This administration has been handing over public lands to fossil fuel companies at record speed, and this move is part of that agenda. Putting BLM headquarters down the road from Secretary Bernhardt’s home town just makes it easier for special interests to walk in the door demanding favors without congressional oversight or accountability,” Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement.

“The BLM officials based in Washington are here to work directly with Congress and their federal colleagues, and that function is going to take a permanent hit if this move goes forward. The agency will lose a lot of good people because of this move, and I suspect that’s the administration’s real goal here.”

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt often failed to provide any details about the move when pushed by lawmakers, typically saying the decision began under Zinke and was still being reviewed. Bernhardt is originally from Rifle, Colo., about 60 miles east of Grand Junction.

“We’ve been asking questions for more than a year about what they’re planning, who and what infrastructure they’re moving, how much this will cost, how they justify it, what impacts they expect on agency missions, etc,” said a senior Democratic staffer on the committee.

“They’ve refused to answer any of those questions.”

However, it’s unclear how much approval from Congress is necessary for the administration to continue with its plans.

The BLM headquarters move could be the first of many reorganizational plans within the Department of Interior. Zinke first announced in January 2018 plans to overhaul the department, arguing that too many bureaucrats lead from Washington rather than the areas they are regulating. His plan, announced last August, would reorganize management of the department through 12 ecosystem and watershed boundaries rather than state lines in what will be called Unified Regions.

The plans have yet to take root, but Bernhardt has indicated they are forthcoming.

Grand Junction sits outside of Colorado National Monument preserves, which spills across the western border into Utah. The town has an estimated population of a little over 63,000. Most of the area surrounding Grand Junction is public land managed by BLM. The town already has a large percentage of government employment, ranging from the school district to the county and city, according to a report from Grand Junction.

The decision to move West comes as other agencies are also planning to relocate parts of their teams. The Environmental Protection Agency has moved employees around several of its offices outside of D.C., and the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave more than 500 employees until Monday to decide whether to move to the Kansas City area.

"US Treasury Secretary Shares Trump’s Concerns on Crypto, Stresses Compliance",https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'John Jackal', 'Justin Connelly', 'Ernst D. Berg', 'Jose Rafael Ruiz Estanga', 'Masao Akimoto']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-treasury-secretary-shares-trumps-concerns-on-crypto-stresses-compliance,"United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin shares President Donald Trump’s concerns on the use of cryptocurrency to finance illicit activity, and stresses the role of enforcing FinCEN regulations with respect to crypto-dealing organizations. Mnuchin made his remarks at a press conference on July 15.

Mnuchin called the use of cryptocurrencies to fund illicit activity a national security issue, saying that billions of dollars have been used for this purpose:

“Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity, like cybercrime, tax evasion, extortion, randomware, illicit drugs, human trafficking […] This is indeed a national security issue.”

In response to a question from the press, Mnuchin further commented on the ostensible role of crypto as a means to finance crime, saying:

“I think to a large extent, these cryptocurrencies have been dominated by illicit activities and speculation.”

Secretary Mnuchin also echoed the Presidents’ latest Twitter posts on cryptocurrencies, saying: “As the President has said: ‘Bitcoin is highly volatile and based on thin air’” and “Treasury takes very seriously the role of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.”

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, President Trump tweeted out a series of anti-crypto and anti-Bitcoin remarks on July 12, following his “Social Media Summit” for conservative personalities. Trump remarked that the value of crypto is “highly volatile and based on thin air” and that they can “facilitate unlawful behavior.”

According to Mnuchin, the Treasury has stressed — to Facebook and Bitcoin (BTC) users among others — that digital financial services are bound by the same Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism policies as traditional institutions such as banks.

Additionally, he said that any crypto transmitters must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN): a bureau of the Treasury. FinCEN is the federal regulator that implements the BSA in practice, and has authority over all money service transmitters — including cryptocurrency projects such as Libra.

Mnuchin also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s Working Group on Digital Assets, which reportedly includes key regulatory players such as the SEC, CFTC, and the Fed in addition to FinCEN. The idea of this group is to mitigate purported regulatory risks associated with cryptocurrencies."
"Veterans Affairs abandoned 200,000+ health care applications this year",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/veterans-affairs-abandoned-200-000-health-care-applications-this-year/VR5zYSyyBn0LnTndnE2x1L/,"An arm of the Veterans Affairs Department in Atlanta eliminated 208,272 applications from across the country for health care early this year amid efforts to shrink a massive backlog of requests, saying they were missing signatures or information about military service and income, according to records reviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Veterans groups say the VA should have done more to communicate with the veterans before closing their applications, some of which date back to 1998. Troops face additional challenges in applying for VA health care, they said, as they grapple with reentry into civilian life, change addresses following overseas deployments and suffer from combat stress.

In the middle of the controversy is the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, the Atlanta office that oversees the process by which veterans seek access to the VA medical system. It and its parent agency have come under intense scrutiny in recent years for mismanagement and delays in providing medical care, presenting a thorny challenge for the administration of President Donald Trump, who focused on veterans’ care during his presidential campaign.

As of April, 8.8 million veterans were enrolled in the VA’s health care system, the agency’s records show. The VA said it enrolled 395,417 people in its health care system and rejected 98,897 in the fiscal year ending in September. Its backlog of pending applications totaled 317,157 in April, down from a high of 886,045 last year, according to records the VA sent the AJC.

That current backlog is still “way too high,” said Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based advocacy group. He suggested additional collaboration between the VA and veteran service groups could shrink it more.

“Something is not quite working right if we are not getting that number lower than it is,” he said. “We need to be working together to get that number down.”

Butler joined Adrian Atizado, deputy national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity based in Kentucky, in criticizing the VA’s efforts to reach the veterans before rejecting and closing their 208,272 applications.

The VA sent out one rejection letter to each of those applicants in 2016. In 2017, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers — including Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson — urged the VA to send the applicants an additional letter clarifying what missing information they needed to turn in. The lawmakers were responding to allegations that a coding error caused the VA to send veterans incorrect letters about what they still needed to submit.

The VA said it opted against sending an additional letter after its Office of Inspector General determined there was no such error and that the letters it sent in 2016 were appropriate and complied with federal law.

Isakson, who leads the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, was unavailable for an interview, according to an aide. But his spokeswoman said the VA took Isakson’s recommendation to have the inspector general review the issue and then briefed the senator’s committee about its decision to close the applications.

Atizado called the VA’s decision to send just one letter to the applicants in 2016 before closing their cases this year “quite unfortunate.”

“When we hear about the VA not taking a more thoughtful approach to a situation like this — when they only send one letter because they have an incomplete application — I think we all should be expecting our government and this administration to do better by our veterans,” he said.

The VA said veterans may reapply for health care. The agency said it is now striving to contact people about incomplete applications up to six times each with phone calls and letters. Its Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, meanwhile, has added 115 employees since July of 2016.

The 208,272 eliminated cases didn’t receive such treatment, though. That also has drawn renewed criticism from Scott Davis, a VA employee and whistleblower who testified before Congress in 2014 about problems at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, located off Clairmont Road.

“This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits,” Davis wrote in an article for the Washington Examiner in May.

Defending its decision, the VA pointed to a federal law that says applications that remain incomplete for a year cannot be approved.

“In accordance with federal law, VA closed 208,272 incomplete health care enrollment applications between January and February,” the VA said in a prepared statement. “It would have been illegal for VA to keep the applications open.”

Davis disputed that, saying the law doesn’t say anything about closing applications. In an interview, he accused the VA of “purging applications under a law that does not give them the authority to do so.”

Asked how many of the 208,272 applications the agency closed were from former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients and combat veterans, the VA told the AJC that the newspaper would have to file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for that information. The AJC did that last month and its request is still pending.

Presidential historian: Trump now with Andrew Johnson as 'most racist president in American history',https://thehill.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/453240-presidential-historian-trump-now-with-andrew-johnson-as-most-racist,"Presidential historian Jon Meacham said Monday that President Trump Donald John TrumpEsper sidesteps question on whether he aligns more with Mattis or Trump Warren embraces Thiel label: 'Good' As tensions escalate, US must intensify pressure on Iran and the IAEA MORE's latest attacks against a group of minority congresswomen placed him alongside former President Andrew Johnson as the ""most racist president in American history.""

""What the president’s done here is yet again, because I think he did it after Charlottesville, and I think he did it frankly when he was pushing the birther lie about President Obama, is he has joined Andrew Johnson as the most racist president in American history,"" Meacham, who has written biographies on past presidents Thomas Jefferson and George H.W. Bush, said on MSNBC's ""Hardball.""

Meacham described the 17th president's history with racism, noting that Johnson once said in a state message that ""African Americans were incapable of self government and relapsed into barbarism if they weren’t closely supervised.""

ADVERTISEMENT

The historian drew the parallels between Trump and Johnson one day after Trump targeted four freshman House lawmakers, saying that they should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came"" before speaking out about how the United States government should be run.

Trump also claimed that the progressive Democrats ""came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe.""

He did not identify the lawmakers in his tweet, but the comments were aimed at Reps. Ilhan Omar (Minn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.). The four addressed the comments in a press conference on Monday. Omar, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Somalia, is the only one among the four who was born in a foreign country.

Several Democratic lawmakers, as well as multiple GOP congressmen, have derided the comments as xenophobic and racist. House Democrats on Monday introduced a formal resolution to condemn Trump's remarks.

Meacham, a frequent critic of Trump, said Monday that the president's remarks contradicted the ""journey"" of the United States.

""It’s long been said, and President Reagan said it quite well, that America is the one place on earth that is not about a birthright,"" he said. ''It’s about the ascent to an idea, an idea that was written in one of the most important sentences ever written in the English language, that all men were created equal and were endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.

""We didn't apply that fully then. We haven't applied that fully now. But that journey toward a more perfect union is the story of the country.""

Trump has stood by his remarks about the progressive Democrats, stating that the lawmakers should leave the country if they are not ""happy."""

Asked about how he would repair alliances that have been frayed by the Trump administration (a legitimate discussion point), Inslee said that if elected, he would ask Megan Rapinoe to be his secretary of state.

Yes, that Megan Rapinoe, the U.S. women's national team soccer star.

One of Inslee's fellow panelists congratulated him ""well played, well played!"", but his suggestion represents sad absurdity. Sad because Inslee's suggestion degrades U.S. foreign policy to base partisan point-scoring. Absurd because Rapinoe has shown zero indication of being equipped with the knowledge and temperament necessary to serve as America's chief diplomat.

Inslee claims that Rapinoe offers us ""more love rather than hate"" and that ""what she has said that has inspired us so much is such an antithesis of the president's foreign policy."" Really? Rapinoe is an exceptional athlete, and she has every right to protest the anthem. But she isn't exactly a diplomat-in-waiting, let alone the most obvious prospect to lead America's diplomatic service.

The soccer star has the very opposite of a diplomatic temperament. She is quick to launch scathing and profanity-laced attacks on people she disagrees with or dislikes, prone to emotional outbursts, and somewhat arrogant. True, all those things apply in equal if not greater measure to President Trump. But Trump at least has appointed two informed, experienced, and tempered individuals as secretary of state. What message would Rapinoe's appointment send to the men and women of the State Department? That the president of the United States regards his diplomats and civil service officers only as a useful prop for some kind of far-left public relations.

Moreover, at a time where Russia increasingly threatens NATO security, China is trying to replace the U.S.-led international order, Iran is threatening conflict, Saudi Arabia is led by an emotional prince, the European Union is in strife, and Indian power is rising rapidly, we might just want to have a qualified candidate in Foggy Bottom.

Rapinoe is a great soccer player. I hope she keeps representing America. But Inslee makes himself a joke by promoting her as a prospective secretary of state.

Then again, perhaps he was just looking for some free media coverage?"
Trump Fans the Flames of a Racial Fire,https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/trump-twitter-race.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump woke up on Sunday morning, gazed out at the nation he leads, saw the dry kindling of race relations and decided to throw a match on it. It was not the first time, nor is it likely to be the last. He has a pretty large carton of matches and a ready supply of kerosene.

His Twitter harangue goading Democratic congresswomen of color to “go back” to the country they came from, even though most of them were actually born in the United States, shocked many. But it should have surprised few who have watched the way he has governed a multicultural, multiracial country the last two and a half years.

When it comes to race, Mr. Trump plays with fire like no other president in a century. While others who occupied the White House at times skirted close to or even over the line, finding ways to appeal to the resentments of white Americans with subtle and not-so-subtle appeals, none of them in modern times fanned the flames as overtly, relentlessly and even eagerly as Mr. Trump.

His attack on the Democratic congresswomen came on the same day his administration was threatening mass roundups of immigrants living in the country illegally. And it came just days after he hosted some of the most incendiary right-wing voices on the internet at the White House and vowed to find another way to count citizens separately from noncitizens despite a Supreme Court ruling that blocked him from adding a question to the once-a-decade census."
EPA orders closures of 15 cesspools in Arizona national forests,https://ktar.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://ktar.com/story/2656284/epa-orders-closures-of-15-cesspools-in-arizona-national-forests/,"PHOENIX — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday that more than a dozen cesspools must be closed in Arizona national forests.

The agency said 15 campground pit toilets in the Apache-Sitgreaves, Tonto, Coconino and Kaibab national forests are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s 2005 ban on large-capacity cesspools.

The cesspools discharge untreated raw sewage into the ground, which can cause pathogens to contaminate bodies of water, the agency said.

The U.S. Forest Service will have until December 2024 to close the areas and comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act.

The agencies’ agreement also includes reporting requirements and fines for the Forest Service if it doesn’t meet deadlines.

“Closing cesspools in national forests is important to protect the drinking water resources and the health of those using our public lands,” Mike Stoker, EPA Pacific Southwest regional administrator, said in a press release.

“We are pleased that the Forest Service helped to identify the cesspools and committed to address these violations.”

The public is able to submit comments on the agreement through Aug. 15.

Education Department ruling a win for cosmetology schools and students,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/education-department-ruling-a-win-for-cosmetology-schools-and-students,"The cosmetology industry is among the fastest growing sectors in our economy because millions of Americans have come to rely on experienced, licensed cosmetologists every day. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the industry is expected to grow nearly twice as fast as the national average, by over 13% in the next few years. In 2016 alone, it generated more than $84 billion in revenue, which has helped to support workers and communities across the country.

That record of success and continued growth has been at great risk because of the Obama-era “Gainful Employment” rule. This rule could have forced cosmetology school closures across the country. This would have created a ripple effect of unintended consequences for schools, students, spas, and salons, as well as millions of Americans who rely on skilled, licensed cosmetologists every day.

Fortunately, students, schools, and consumers achieved an important win recently when Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rescinded the rule, based on its flawed construction and the inaccurate data that had been used to grade cosmetology programs.

Gainful Employment was first implemented to measure schools' success by comparing their students' debt to their presumed income after graduation. While seemingly well intentioned, the rule’s framework serves as a warning of what happens when rulemaking does not account for real-world situations.

When it came to the cosmetology industry, the rule failed to take into account a number of critical factors, including the underreporting of wages and tips. It’s well known that much like the restaurant industry, many transactions in the cosmetology industry are made in cash. As a result of underreported tips, the Gainful Employment scores of cosmetology schools were being significantly skewed.

Despite these known inaccuracies, the Education Department continued to use this metric with devastating consequences. If a school program failed, it faced ineligibility for federal aid. Students would no longer be able to use financial aid to pay for their education, ultimately forcing them to withdraw or pay out-of-pocket.

American Association of Cosmetology School members have always supported strengthening transparency in the higher education system and ensuring students can make the best choice possible for their own futures. But from day one, the association made clear that this rule was not only flawed but also had the potential to seriously damage and possibly close hundreds of reputable cosmetology schools. Even the IRS recognized how problematic the underreporting of wages and tips were on accurately measuring a school’s score.

When other efforts failed, the association filed a lawsuit against the Education Department and won. But it still left an uneven playing field across our educational institutions with an unfair advantage given to nonprofit schools.

That is because in reality, this rule did nothing more than target schools based on their tax status. According to Forbes, in 2016, only 16% of all students were actually enrolled in a program covered by the Gainful Employment rule. This means that roughly 80% of all college students were exempt from these standards. Moreover, cosmetology programs often take a year or less to complete and cost approximately $18,000, with average debt less than $10,000, significantly less than traditional four-year schools. In contrast, private, nonprofit schools average $35,000 per year.

All schools should be held to the highest standards, but those standards should be applied fairly across the board to create a level playing field.

As an industry, we believe that holding institutions of higher education to the highest standards, and ensuring students and parents have all the necessary information to make informed enrollment and borrowing choices is vital to the long-term success of both students and our schools. America’s cosmetology schools applaud Secretary DeVos and the Department of Education for ending this harmful regulation and protecting schools, students, and consumers.

Kathy Chow is the executive director of the American Association of Cosmetology Schools, representing over 600 cosmetology schools and nearly 300 school owners across the nation."
State Dept. urges Sweden to treat arrested rapper ASAP Rocky fairly,https://www.politico.com,['Daniel Lippman'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/14/asap-rocky-arrested-sweden-state-department-1415839,"Swedish prosecutors must decide by Friday whether to charge A$AP Rocky with any crimes. | Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP File Photo foreign policy State Dept. urges Sweden to treat arrested rapper ASAP Rocky fairly

The State Department is raising concerns about the arrest and detention of an American rapper in Sweden and is urging the Swedish government to treat him fairly, according to a statement shared exclusively with POLITICO.

ASAP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was arrested July 2 after voluntarily going to the police in Stockholm for questioning about a street fight he was involved in.

Story Continued Below

A State Department spokesperson said that the department is aware of the case and that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been briefed. Top officials at the department, including Robert O’Brien, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, are also closely monitoring the situation and working to make sure the rapper is treated fairly.

“There are certainly some facts about the arrest and detention that raise concerns,” the spokesperson said. “We expect all governments, including Sweden, to treat American citizens fairly and with respect. … We hope to see ASAP Rocky and his colleagues back on tour and reunited with friends and family soon.”

Swedish prosecutors must decide by Friday whether to charge Rocky, who is being held in solitary confinement, or ask a court to let them hold him longer.

Rocky and his entourage, who were in Stockholm for the Smash music festival, were walking around the city “minding their own business” on June 30 when they were verbally harassed by two men who had started following them, according to a person close to the rapper.

Eventually, after one of them took “a fighting stance and then threw a punch” at Rocky’s bodyguard and hit him, the two sides soon started fighting.

“They were obviously spoiling for a fight,” said the person close to Rocky. The person added that the rapper and his crew “had no choice but to defend themselves” and that the two men who had been accosting Rocky and his colleagues got physical first. The person also said Rocky is “eager to defend himself and his name” in court if charges are filed.

A TMZ video shows Rocky throwing across the street one of the men who had been following him and his entourage. The video also shows some members of Rocky’s group kicking and hitting the person.

Rocky posted a video on Instagram with his side of the story, which showed his bodyguard telling the men to quit following them.

“So a few drug addicts are not my fans, we dont know these guys and we didnt want trouble, they followed us for 4 blocks, and they were slapping girls butts who passed, give me a break,” he wrote. Another video Rocky posted shows one of the men fighting with his bodyguard and throwing his headphones at him.

Alan Jackson, a lawyer for Rocky, told POLITICO: “President Trump has made bringing home unjustly held Americans a top priority for his administration. The State Department’s interest in the case gives us great hope for Rocky’s situation.

“Secretary Pompeo and Ambassador O’Brien have been relentless in their diplomatic efforts on behalf of American citizens being held all over the world. Rocky’s millions of fans worldwide are putting their trust in the State Department to get Rocky home.”

Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations requires signatory countries to immediately notify consular officials upon arresting a foreign citizen, but that didn’t happen for hours in Rocky’s case, according to the person close to Rocky.

A State Department official was also initially denied access to Rocky but upon being granted access, the official couldn’t have a private conversation with the rapper because two Swedish security guards were within earshot.

The Swedish Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.

Rocky was initially held for four days in a facility that had “relatively fetid conditions” with a “terrible stench” that was “dirty, filthy and disgusting,” according to the person close to the rapper. He was later moved to a detention facility where the conditions are “markedly better.”

Celebrities, including Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes, sent out social media posts in support of Rocky, and more than 580,000 people have signed a ""#JusticeForRocky"" petition on Change.org to urge Sweden to release him.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), whose district includes Harlem, where Rocky is from, said he’d “seen the tape of what occurred, and clearly, he was provoked, and harassed, and followed, and accosted, and I think he acted in self-defense.” Espaillat also raised concerns about the conditions of Rocky’s jail and told Complex.com that he would “fight until he’s brought back home.” The lawmaker has sent letters on the case to the State Department, the U.S. Embassy in Sweden and the Swedish ambassador to the U.S., Karin Olofsdotter."
We need someone who can lift us up again.

An open letter to Barack Obama:

Mr. President, it is time. You must speak. Your country needs you.

Eleven summers ago, as you accepted the Democratic nomination for president, you announced: “Tonight, I say to the people of America, to Democrats and Republicans and independents across this great land: Enough. This moment — this election — is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.”

Of course, we knew then that our nation had deep political differences, and would continue to. Only the most naive among us would have expected the election of the first African American president to come about with no backlash.

But would anyone have anticipated that within a dozen years, we would hear another president tell four nonwhite congresswomen — three of whom were born in this country — to “go back” to where they came from?

Donald Trump’s tweets over the weekend were the basest kind of bigotry, the oldest of racist tropes. And they were a reminder that in the eyes of some, who apparently include our current president, people of color will never be seen as fully American, regardless of how many generations their families have been part of this nation’s story or how much they achieve as individuals.

President Obama, I understand your reluctance to weigh in on Trump’s latest transgression. You are a respecter of norms, including the one dictating that former presidents steer clear of criticizing their successors. And for all the barriers you shattered, racism was never a topic upon which you seemed eager to hold forth.

But silence now is unacceptable. It is time to make yourself heard.

We have long since given up expectations that anyone in Trump’s own party will do or say anything to call him out for what he is. The few who tried at the beginning have capitulated, been driven from office or walked away.

For Trump, racism is not a moral failing; it is a political tactic. None of us can really claim to understand what is in his heart, but the cynicism of his actions is apparent, and it must be exposed for what it is.

No one knows that better than you do. Trump launched his political career by spreading a blatantly racist lie that you had been born in Africa.

At the time, Americans could still be hopeful enough about who we were to write him off as a buffoon. You even joked about it. As Trump sat fuming in the audience at the 2011 White House correspondents’ dinner, you released what you said was your “official birth video.” It was a clip from “The Lion King.”

But he was just getting started. Birtherism turned out to be Trump’s original sin, the one from which so many others have followed — the 2015 presidential announcement speech in which Trump branded Mexican immigrants as drug dealers and rapists, his call for a ban on Muslims entering the country, his claim that a judge of Mexican descent born in Indiana was incapable of ruling fairly on a case involving Trump University, his declaration that there were “very fine people on both sides” of the deadly clashes between hate-fueled white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville.

There was a political calculation behind every one of those vile statements, and as repulsed as we are with his latest racist rant, it is possible to see the calculation that is at work here as well.

Trump knows Democrats will set aside their internal differences, as they should, to rally around the four, who represent their party’s more liberal, more youthful edge. He intends to make Reps. Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.) the faces of the Democratic Party, as he wants America to see it.

“These are people that if they don’t like it here, they can leave,” he said Monday. “They hate our country. They hate it, I think, with a passion.”

The irony was rich, given how incessantly Trump himself criticized this country before he was elected, and how even his campaign slogan — “Make America Great Again” — denigrated both the nation and the progress it has made.

President Obama, what we need more than anything else right now is someone who can lift the country’s sights again. Someone who can charge us, as you once did, with a mission to “march into the future. Let us keep that promise, that American promise, and in the words of scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.”

Find your voice again. Reclaim your legacy. Do it now. It won’t wait until your memoirs."
"A Revere veteran’s legal marijuana job cost him a VA loan. Now, Congress is stepping in",https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2019/07/16/fought-good-fight-revere-veteran-shocked-congress-cared-about-his-home-loan-rejection-over-legal-marijuana-job/kPnw9QCisvNtgvUshzwXeJ/story.html,"It was validation for the 35-year-old disabled Army veteran from Revere. He never imagined that anyone would care that the Veterans Administration had rejected his home loan application in January, just as his family was set to move, because the VA disapproved of his job managing a marijuana store.

The US House of Representatives passed your amendment, said the caller from Representative Katherine Clark’s office. Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.

But now, the House had shown it agreed that the veteran should have received his earned benefit. On Friday, it passed a measure banning the VA from considering veterans’ income from state-approved cannabis industries as a reason to deny them their benefit of a low-rate home loan guarantee with no money down.

“I’m blown away — I can’t believe it,” said the veteran, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his military relationship. “It’s cool because we fought the good fight and something really went the way it should go.”

In January, after the veteran’s house purchase fell through at the last moment because of the VA’s rejection, he contacted his congresswoman, Clark. She filed the amendment to ban the VA’s practice as part of the larger defense budget. Separately, she sent a letter, signed by 20 lawmakers, to the VA requesting more policy details in light of the veteran’s case. The letter noted that more than 211,000 people work in the legal cannabis trade nationwide, which generates $11 billion in sales per year.

“The cannabis industry is a growing part of our economy and no one, let alone our veterans, should be penalized for being part of it,” Clark said in a statement Friday after the House vote. “The passage of this amendment ensures that our service members receive the benefits they deserve while modernizing the policies of the VA.”

The VA did not respond to a request for comment, but previously said it would reply directly to the lawmakers.

Because the Senate had already passed its version of the defense budget, a joint committee will determine whether the measure will be included in the bill that lands on President Trump’s desk.

The Revere veteran’s experience highlights one of the many ways that veterans and others can get caught between federal marijuana prohibition and states that have legalized pot.

Some veterans have reported a loss of benefits or being labeled unemployable as a result of consuming marijuana or working in the legal marijuana industry. Many veterans who find medical relief from pot say they’re financially overburdened and medically underserved because the VA doesn’t discuss or cover the drug as it does with other medications, including opioids.

The Revere veteran started working in the cannabis industry after finding that medical marijuana helped ease his chronic pain resulting from tearing both shoulders in a military training exercise. The cannabis also allowed him to get off opioids, he said, which made him “a shell of myself.”

Last year, he became the assistant manager of a marijuana retailer, now one of the state’s 22 pot shops. He loves helping patients find relief. The job gives him fulfillment that he’d missed since the Army.

In January, when he learned why the VA rejected his home loan, the veteran vented to his coworkers. One of his colleagues connected him to a mortgage company that helped him secure a reduced-rate home loan that he could afford.

The veteran and his family are no longer crammed into a tiny apartment or his parents’ home. Last week, they moved into their new house: a yellow four-bedroom in Dracut with a sunroom, white countertops, and a huge backyard perfect for his three children.

“It’s a dream come true,” the veteran said. “It’s a bigger, better, beautiful house. Maybe everything happens for a reason.”

The Energy 202: Watchdog says EPA didn't follow its own rules when picking science advisers,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy', 'July At Am']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/07/16/the-energy-202-watchdog-says-epa-didn-t-follow-its-own-rules-when-picking-science-advisers/5d2cb871a7a0a45423a3ec0a/,"THE LIGHTBULB

A government watchdog said Monday the Environmental Protection Agency did not follow its own guidelines when filling two key science advisory panels with fewer academic researchers and more industry voices.

The findings from the Government Accountability Office, published Monday at the request of several Senate Democrats, provide additional fodder for critics who say President Trump's deputies are trying to degrade the way EPA assesses scientific research. Both panels are part of the EPA and made up of scientists from outside the agency who advise it on the best science surrounding issues like air pollution, pesticides and hazardous waste.

The agency itself disputes the watchdog's findings, arguing in a letter submitted to the GAO that its way of choosing new panelists for the Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee is “more rigorous” than under the EPA's old guidelines.

The GAO described a sharp decrease in the number of university researchers serving on the Science Advisory Board, which reviews the integrity of scientific information used by the EPA when writing rules, over the first 15 months of the Trump administration. The number of university researchers on the panel went from 36 in January 2017 to just 22 in March 2018. The panel had between 44 and 47 members during that period.

The decrease came as the number of researchers from consulting firms or from companies regulated by the agency went up, a fact that Democrats latched onto as more evidence the Trump adminisitration is overly influenced by polluting industries.

“After a careful investigation, the non-partisan GAO confirms what we’ve been critical of all along: The Trump Administration is violating its own rules by putting industry officials in charge of crucially important science advisory boards,” said Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee who with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) led a group of Democrats in asking the GAO to investigate the agency's practices. “This is not a trivial issue, but a serious problem that has profound consequences for enforcement and regulatory actions across the agency.”

Among those who under Trump joined the Science Advisory Board are Brant Ulsh, a health physicist at M.H. Chew & Associates who has argued the EPA has overplayed the risk of small doses of radiation; and John Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama at Huntsville whose work critical of NASA's climate scientists has been often cited by so-called climate “skeptics.”

The watchdog agency found fewer ""notable"" changes to the composition of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee.

That decrease in academics on the Science Advisory Board is due largely to a Trump administration policy barring scientists who get EPA grants from serving as advisers, according to Genna Reed, a science and policy analyst in the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“It's a pretty clear connection to draw,” she said. The ban, put in place by former EPA chief Scott Pruitt, drew praise from industry lobbying groups and condemnation from scientific organizations such as Reed's when it was announced in 2017.

According to the GAO, in the past agency staffers weighed in with written recommendations on who should be selected for these two boards. That part of the selection process was spelled out in one of the EPA's own handbooks.

But in the Trump administration, officials ignored those internal guidelines and chose advisers without much of a paper trail. Instead of written recommendations, EPA management instead requested briefings with staffers.

“That was our key finding: The EPA didn't follow this key step with these two committees,” said J. Alfredo Gomez, director of the GAO's natural resources and environment team.

In the past, EPA head Andrew Wheeler cast the panel appointments as an effort to gather scientific opinions from a diverse set of voices. But when selecting researchers for the Science Advisory Board, there is one region of the country the Trump administration seems to turn to frequently: the South.

At the start of the administration, about a quarter, or 28 percent, of the panel hailed from the generally conservative region, which spanned Delaware to Texas in the GAO's analysis. About 15 months later, Southerners constituted more than half of the board.

One of the newcomers is Michael Honeycutt, the top toxicologist in the state of Texas who in 2017 was chosen to chair the Science Advisory Board and who has accused the agency of “overstating” the risks associated with mercury, a toxic heavy metal that can cause brain damage.

In a letter commenting on a draft of the GAO report, the EPA urged the watchdog to delete from the final version the conclusion that EPA ignored its own rules when selecting members of the panels because it is within Wheeler's authority to set new guidance.

“EPA has already provided GAO its thorough explanation on their conclusion that the Agency did not follow its own policy — the assertion is incorrect and should be removed from the report,” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud wrote in an email Monday.

The GAO acknowledged Wheeler had that discretion, but ultimately recommended that the EPA follow the handbook's guidelines.

The Interior Department building in Washington features murals just outside the Bureau of Land Management offices done by artist John Steuart Curry — “The Oklahoma Land Rush,” left, and “The Homestead and the Building of the Barbed Wire Fence.” (Doug Kapustin for The Washington Post)

— Another agency is moving staff out of Washington: The Interior Department is planning to yank most of the Bureau of Land Management’s Washington-based employees out of the District and move them out West. Some top employees are set to be transferred to Grand Junction, Colo., and others will move to other cities, The Post’s Juliet Eilperin and Lisa Rein report.

The context: “The proposal to move roughly 300 employees from a key Interior Department agency — among them the majority of top managers — comes as Trump officials are forcibly reassigning career officials and upending operations across the federal government,” they write. “Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue finalized plans this summer to move about 550 jobs at two of his department’s scientific agencies from the nation’s capital to greater Kansas City. The White House is trying to abolish the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources agency, and has threatened to furlough as many as 150 employees if Congress blocks it.""

Two sides to the argument: In a statement supporting the move, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said the “problem with Washington is too many policy makers are far removed from the people they are there to serve... Ninety-nine percent of the land the BLM manages is West of the Mississippi River, and so should be the BLM headquarters,” he added. Meanwhile, Steve Ellis, who retired as BLM’s deputy director in 2016 told Rein and Eilperin: “If I wanted to dismantle an agency, this would be in my playbook … It’s important for these agencies to have a meaningful footprint in D.C.”

Eilperin with more details:

Under the plan (I got additional details last night), Utah will get several dozen jobs, as will Nevada and Colorado. More than 80 percent of headquarters jobs will move West. https://t.co/rddUkHXdTY — Juliet Eilperin (@eilperin) July 16, 2019

THERMOMETER

— Tracking the deluge from Barry: There were rainfall totals reaching 15 inches in parts of Louisiana on Monday, as the impact of tropical depression Barry poured down on the state, though later than anticipated, The Post's Jason Samenow reports. “Since late last week, forecasters said Barry would be a drawn-out event, with heavy rain a threat lasting two to three days. But the worst was expected over the weekend, when meteorologists predicted tremendous amounts of rain in Louisiana. Rivers were forecast to surge to historic heights,” he writes.

Still, more rain is yet to come: “Dangerous, significant flash flooding is likely, especially across south-central Louisiana,” the National Weather Service wrote in a statement. Samenow adds the agency is predicting “five to eight inches more of rain in this area through the afternoon and rainfall rates as high as two to four inches per hour.”

— This climate scientist is also an evangelical Christian, and she’s trying to persuade skeptics: Katharine Hayhoe, a leading climate scientist, has found a way to talk to people about science by talking to them about faith, The Post’s Dan Zak writes in this profile of the Texas Tech University researcher. During a keynote address at the Citizens’ Climate Lobby conference in Washington, Hayhoe — who is also a lead author on the U.S. government’s latest National Climate Assessment — displayed an ability to communicate that seems “miraculous by the standards of modern climate politics: She can convert nonbelievers — or, to put it in her terms, make people realize that they’ve believed in the importance of this issue all along,” Zak writes. “She knows how to speak to oilmen, to Christians, to farmers and ranchers, having lived for years in Lubbock, Tex., with her pastor husband. She is a scientist who thinks that we’ve talked enough about science, that we need to talk more about matters of the heart.” “We humans have been given responsibility for every living thing on this planet, which includes each other,” she said at the conference. “We are called to tend the garden and be good stewards of the gifts that God has given us.”

— How extreme heat is changing sports: Scientists say the hottest places on the planet are getting hotter, faster. Las Vegas, for example, the location of an annual race called Running with the Devil, is the “fastest-warming city in the country and has seen an average temperature increase of nearly 6 degrees since 1970,” The Post’s Rick Maese reports in the latest piece in a series on how climate change is affecting the world of sports. “The Running with the Devil race, intentionally scheduled for extreme conditions, might not be an exact peek into the future, but it does highlight many of the challenges already confronting much of the sports world. How does heat affect performance? What dangers lurk on the outdoor courses and fields exposed to the summer sun? How does one stage a safe event in extreme conditions?”

— Man, it’s a hot one: Last month was the Earth’s hottest June on record, 1.7 degrees above the norm for the global average temperature for the month, according to data from NASA. “The month was punctuated by a severe heat wave that struck Western Europe in particular during the last week, with numerous all-time-hottest-temperature records falling in countries with centuries-old data sets,” The Post’s Jason Samenow and Andrew Freedman report. “NASA is the second institution to confirm that it was Earth’s hottest June, as the Copernicus Climate Change Service had already determined that June 2019 was the warmest such month on record for Europe and globally.”

— No word on what caused New York City’s blackout: Con Edison warned the city could see more power outages this summer after a weekend power failure left 73,000 residents in the dark. “We expect that there could be service outages — those things happen during heat waves,” the power company’s chief spokesman, Mike Clendenin, said in an interview with PIX 11, according to the New York Post. He also said there’s still no explanation for what caused the blackout. “We are very, very focused on examining exactly what transpired and caused that outage,” Clendenin said. ““There’s a lot of patience and poise that New Yorkers displayed during the outage itself. The same kind of patience and diligence is going to be needed as engineers and experts dive into the date and actually analyze how equipment tripped off, or what went wrong, that led to the large outage.”

Meanwhile, in Washington: ""Power was cut off Monday night to as many as 7,000 homes and businesses in the District, many of them in Northeast, near Capitol Hill according to Pepco,"" The Post's Martin Weil reports. ""The utility said it had issues with equipment at a substation in Northeast.""

Sen. Cory Gardner said the move ""will bring the bureau's decision makers closer to the people they serve and the public lands they manage.""

A spokeswoman who answered the phone at the Bureau of Land Management's press office said Grand Junction was the bureau's selection. But moving required a congressional review and the completion of ""paperwork,"" she told CNN. The spokeswoman declined twice to provide her name.

""That's the area they picked, but as far as saying and doing, I'm not sure,"" she said.

Agriculture Department's relocation of ERS and NIFA: A solution in search of a problem,https://thehill.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/453332-agriculture-departments-relocation-of-ers-and-nifa-a-solution-in,"Earlier this year, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the relocation of the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) federal agencies from Washington, DC to the recently chosen Kansas City, Mo. Moving ERS and NIFA is a hasty solution in search of a nonexistent problem that wastes taxpayer money and will harm U.S. agriculture.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue George (Sonny) Ervin PerdueThis is not the way to move USDA agencies out of Washington American farmers can't afford this administration's climate apathy Overnight Energy: New EPA rule could expand officials weighing in on FOIA requests | Trump plan to strip conservation fund gets bipartisan pushback | Agriculture chief downplays climate concerns MORE said the rationale for the move is to save taxpayer money and move the agencies closer to stakeholders. Upon closer examination, these reasons do not hold water. First, farmers and ranchers may be informed by ERS reports, but they are not direct recipients or users of most of the ERS products. ERS and NIFA are not regulatory or farm program agencies. These agencies do not implement farm programs like the Farm Services Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service. Nor do they inspect meat and poultry plants like the Food Safety and Inspection Service. ERS and NIFA research policy to advance agriculture-related sciences. The best place for these agencies is close to the center of policymaking, Washington, DC.

Additionally, the USDA decided to move the agencies out of the capital region before they even did a cost-benefit analysis, so it is unclear how they determined it would save taxpayer money. When the department finally did a cost-benefit analysis, the Government Accountability Office determined it was misleading and incomplete. USDA’s own estimate found average savings of just .13% of the total funding provided for ERS and NIFA in FY19—not even a full percentage point. An independent group of economists, The Agricultural and Applied Economics Association (AAEA), that includes two former ERS administrators, found that the move would actually cost taxpayers between $37 to 128 million, instead of saving money, due to a loss of talent.

Furthermore, the USDA already owns empty spaces in the capital region that could accommodate ERS and NIFA rent-free, while avoiding relocation, buy out, and early retirement costs—but this option wasn’t included in the official USDA cost-benefit analysis.

Not only does moving ERS and NIFA to Kansas City not make financial sense, it will set the agencies back for years due to loss of experienced, highly-specialized employees—yet another cost not accounted for in the department’s insufficient cost-benefit analysis. Employees are already quitting in anticipation of the move. Internal sources say the retirement rate has doubled since the move was announced, and on one day at the end of April, six people quit at ERS. According to a new union survey, nearly 70 percent of the ERS employees ordered to move to Kansas City will instead quit their jobs. The level of experience these agencies will lose cannot be replaced quickly or found just anywhere.

As chairman of the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, I dedicated an entire hearing to this proposed relocation. We heard from four former USDA officials with a total of 70 years of experience in the ERS and NIFA over several administrations, a senior advisor to Secretary Perdue, and later in a separate hearing, Secretary Perdue himself. None of the former ERS and NIFA officials who testified agreed with the move. Nearly 110 agriculture science and food related organizations, at least 37 deans of university agriculture departments, several former government officials, and more than 1150 individual scientists from 47 states publicly oppose the move.

The American Association for the Advancement of Science and more than a dozen land-grant universities—most of them in the heartland to which the Trump administration wanted the agencies to be closer—have sent a letter to Senate appropriators urging them to stop the move because it “sends a clear message that agricultural research is not as important as research funded by the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, the National Institutes of Health, and numerous other major research agencies.”

Secretary Perdue himself remarked, “I’m just amazed that all those people you mentioned could be wrong.” I too wonder how all these experienced professionals could be wrong and why only the Trump administration seems to think this is a good idea. Employees at both agencies believe the move is punishment for research that did not align with the Trump administration’s agenda.

If the USDA succeeds in moving ERS and NIFA to Kansas City, there is no question it will disrupt normal operations that may never return to their previous efficiency and power. Our nation’s agriculture industry cannot afford delays to the vital economic data that ERS provides and the technological innovations developed through NIFA support. It’s ironic the proposal to relocate research and data-driven agencies seems to have no hard data supporting it. We should not harm our farmers and researchers by weakening the well-established infrastructure for research that has kept American agriculture No. 1 in the world.

"Devin Nunes: Without jail time for Russia probe 'dirty cops', no Republican will trust DOJ for ‘generations'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/devin-nunes-jail-dirty-cops-republicans-doj,"House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said there will be massive political consequences if Justice Department officials don't face jail time for their conduct during the Russia investigation.

According to Nunes, the Russia investigation was an ""obstruction of justice trap,"" that started without evidence of collusion and ended in an ""awful situation"" that could only be fixed by jailing the people who ""perpetuated this hoax.""

""These are all a bunch of dirty cops and I'll tell you,"" he told Fox News' Bill Hemmer on the latest ""Hemmer Time"" podcast. ""We're going to go down in a spiral in this country because you will not have a Republican that will trust the FBI or the Department of Justice for generations to come.""

Nunes specifically mentioned Andrew Weissman, one of the Mueller team's top prosecutors who briefed AP reporters in 2017, before Mueller's team was assembled, on ""something to do with the Trump-Russia investigation.""

Authorities, Nunes said, hid that fact from his committee -- something he said was inappropriate given that Weissman was briefed on the Steele dossier in the summer of 2016.

At Mueller's hearing, Nunes plans to ask him whether he knew that Weissmann had been briefed on the dossier. Weissmann's early involvement with the chain of custody, according to legal advice Nunes received, effectively disqualified him from serving on Mueller's team.

Nunes' comments came before former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was scheduled to testify on July 17 before the House Judiciary Committee -- a hearing Nunes suspected Democrats hoped would include ""nasty"" comments making President Trump ""look bad.""

That date, according to sources, could have been pushed back to July 24, although committee Democrats have maintained the hearing would take place on July 17.

While the committee's chair, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., joined other Democrats in continuing to pursue the Mueller report's findings, Republicans have attempted to refocus the debate on accountability for what Nunes described as ""dirty cops.""

REP. NUNES ON CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S GRILLING BY DOJ INVESTIGATORS: A LOT OF THE DOSSIER 'WAS JUST MADE UP'

Barr already started the investigation and Nunes, in April, sent a criminal referral notification telling the Justice Department in April that he had identified ""potential violations"" of the law. Those criminal referrals stemmed from the Intelligence Committee's investigation when Nunes was chair and Republicans held the House.

Nunes told Fox News host Bill Hemmer that he thought it was possible that the Russia investigation was a way for the House to develop an impeachment strategy. He accused DOJ officials of trying to drag out the investigation in order to find legal violations.

""They were trying to hold out this investigation as long as possible, bust people here and there for nickel and dime stuff -- like obstructing an investigation, lying to Congress -- and eventually they would get Trump,"" he said.

Dogs deserve better than brutal VA research that wastes money better spent on veterans,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Dina Titus', 'Brian Mast', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/16/veterans-affairs-dog-testing-brutal-shameful-must-stop-column/1733380001/,"CLOSE

The VA has done these barbaric tests for decades with no discernible benefits in many years. It should stop hurting dogs and start helping veterans.

Few members of the public are aware that the federal government uses taxpayer money to hurt puppies in painful and unnecessary lab experiments.

At the Richmond Veterans Affairs Hospital, where most of the VA’s dog testing takes place, puppies are given heart attacks by injecting latex into their arteries. The dogs are then put on treadmills to stress their compromised hearts, and they are ultimately killed and dissected.

These and other cruel practices must end.

We’ve been leading the charge against this government-funded animal abuse. Our efforts have focused on the Department of Veterans Affairs, where hounds and beagles are subjected to deadly experiments. Though the department has conducted these barbaric tests for decades, the research has not resulted in any discernible benefits for veterans in many years.

VA experiments stopped in many cities

The good news is that we’re making significant progress to end the VA’s canine cruelty. Today there are just a few ongoing dog experiments thanks to pressure from grassroots advocates, sharp media scrutiny and congressional action. In Los Angeles, the VA has stopped injecting Dobermans with methamphetamines; in Milwaukee, the VA has put an end to several painful and invasive experiments on beagles. And in Cleveland, the VA just stopped severing the spinal cords of puppies in deadly tests.

A dog's nose and a single step: On K9 Veterans Day, honor heroic military working dogs for saving soldiers' lives

Now there’s momentum to completely end this antiquated program once and for all. At our urging, the House has passed legislation this year that cuts all funding for painful dog experiments, and our bipartisan bill to permanently end VA dog testing — the Preventing Unkind and Painful Procedures and Experiments on Respected Species (PUPPERS) Act — now has over 100 co-sponsors, including 17 veterans.

Eliminating dog testing within reach

We’re optimistic because there is growing recognition that VA’s dog testing is outdated and unnecessary:

► Earlier this year, due to pressure from Congress and advocates, the VA committed $2 million to develop alternatives to its disgraceful heart attack tests on dogs.

► In May, a spinal cord injury researcher from the University of Miami told a VA-commissioned panel that dog use for spinal cord research like the tests that were being done in Cleveland is unnecessary and that alternatives are readily available.

► Former VA Secretary Dr. David Shulkin was instrumental in many of the pro-puppy reforms we’ve seen in recent years.

And while the VA absurdly drags its feet on ending this outdated program, the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control are moving away from dog experiments.

Help veterans, don't hurt dogs

We know all too well that veterans desperately need the resources that are currently wasted on unnecessary and cruel dog testing. The brave service members who have selflessly served this nation deserve better. That’s why our movement to end these experiments has the support of many national veterans’ groups that want to end this waste and abuse.

I knew too much about war, he knew blessedly little: Afghanistan veteran on the dog that is his best friend

Most importantly, our dogs — who are cherished pets, faithful partners to patriots serving abroad, and sources of comfort and healing to those who have returned home — deserve much better. Putting an end to the VA’s brutal dog experiments would be a win for veterans, taxpayer, and the dogs that are troops’ best friend. We intend to do exactly that, once and for all.

DHS inspector general confirms investigation into leaked ICE raids,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-inspector-general-confirms-investigation-into-leaked-ice-raids,"The Department of Homeland Security's independent Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement to call off a nationwide operation, according to the federal agency.

“Last month, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) became aware of an apparent leak related to a planned enforcement operation. Leaks of law enforcement sensitive information jeopardize the safety of ICE officers and agents who have sworn an oath to uphold the law. ICE referred the incident to its Office of Professional Responsibility, which, in accordance with its normal procedures, referred it to the DHS Office of Inspector General,"" ICE said in a statement issued Monday morning.

The Washington Examiner was first to report on Friday that then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team had reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak.

""Everyone knows who they are investigating. Why didn't the acting secretary call for an investigation?"" a senior official told the Washington Examiner on Monday.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak. These sources charged he wanted to sabotage ICE’s months-long plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham two weeks ago, but last Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which Border Patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE carried out raids nationwide this past weekend, though reports suggested they were not of the magnitude anticipated."
"Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose: President Trump's weekend tweets were 'racist,' calls for civility in politics",https://www.cincinnati.com,"['Jessie Balmert', 'Published P.M.

Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose says President Donald Trump's recent tweets targeting Democratic congresswomen were racist and false.

“The president says things that I would never condone, that I believe are false,"" LaRose, a Republican elected in 2018, told The Enquirer's editorial board Tuesday. ""The most recent tweet is racist – whether it was intended that way or not, I’m not in the man’s mind and heart. I don’t know, but that’s how it sounds to me.”

Trump tweeted early Sunday that progressive members of Congress should ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.""

Although Trump did not mention any lawmakers by name, he appears to be referring to Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. Three lawmakers were born in America and Omar, a native of Somalia, became a U.S. citizen in 2000.

In denouncing the tweets, LaRose went further than some fellow Republicans, who stopped short of calling the comments racist.

Sen. Rob Portman labeled them ""divisive, unnecessary and wrong."" Rep. Steve Chabot called diversity a strength of the nation, adding ""we can disagree without being disagreeable.”

Trump, on Tuesday, responded to detractors, tweeting ""I don't have a Racist bone in my body!""

Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don’t have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show “weakness” and fall into their trap. This should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the Democrat..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2019

LaRose's history with the president is mixed. He initially supported then-Gov. John Kasich's GOP bid for president in 2016. At one point, LaRose said he couldn't vote for Trump because of an Access Hollywood video that captured the then-nominee's lewd comments. Later, LaRose helped with the logistics for Trump's inauguration.

LaRose announced last month that he wouldn't endorse a candidate for president in 2020. It's part of an initiative with Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, to encourage civility in politics – and a deeper trust of its election officials.

“Making self-government work again may be my generation’s man on the moon,"" LaRose told The Enquirer.

LaRose, who worked with Democrats to reform Ohio's map-drawing process, said civility goes beyond niceness.

""If people are retreating to their corners, finding cable news cameras and saying bombastic things about each other, how are those people going to come together to actually solve problems?"" LaRose asked. When there’s such incivility, there’s no room for compromise.

Scientists flee USDA as research agencies move to Kansas City area,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453193-scientists-flee-usda-as-research-agencies-move-to-kansas-city-area,"A Trump administration decision to move researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the Kansas City area is threatening to spark the flight of more than half of the staff selected to move, gutting the agency of its top scientific voices.

Staff have until midnight Monday to decide whether to uproot and join the department as it moves its research branches from Washington, D.C., lured by $26 million in promised incentives from state and local officials.

Critics see the move, set to be completed by Sept. 30, as yet another example of the Trump administration looking to sideline scientists and researchers, keeping them away from the corridors of power. Administration officials deny that, calling it a cost-saving move intended to have researchers closer to farmers.

ADVERTISEMENT

The decision comes as other agencies are also planning to relocate parts of their teams amid suspicions about the move. For example, the Interior Department is expected to announce new headquarters for the Bureau of Land Management on Tuesday.

“Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers. A lot of the research that scientists and economists do at [the USDA] has policy implications, and members of Congress need this information and need to have face-to-face meetings with these researchers,” Rebecca Boehm, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Hill.

“It keeps science out of the policymaking process. And we’ve seen many times that this administration doesn’t like facts or research that isn’t convenient or [is] an impediment to their agenda, so I think moving them away helps accomplish that,” she added.

The move affects two wings of the USDA. Economic Research Service (ERS) employees analyze the agricultural market, but their research is much broader, including looking at food stamps, rural poverty and conservation.

National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) employees work with universities to fund research and coordinate the process that issues research grants on agriculture-related subjects, including climate change adaptation.

The two agencies voted to unionize in response to the move, as Democrats in both chambers and a number of groups that regularly work with the two agencies lobby to keep them in Washington.

Estimates tallied by employees show 70 percent of ERS employees designated for the Kansas City office will not be moving. For NIFA, 45 percent of those surveyed said they will not move. Overall, the move was expected to impact 547 staff between the two agencies.

But the numbers of staff refusing to move may grow. Some employees said staff at both agencies are trying not to tip their hands, saying they will move only if they do not find another job in the D.C. area.

So far, just 27 ERS staff out of 250 have committed to moving to the Kansas City area, according to the employee tallies.

The UDSA argues the move will save $300 million over 15 years, but critics have said their cost-benefit analysis was shoddy and did not follow guidelines.

A different cost-benefit analysis from the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association found the move would cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million.

Democrats have blocked USDA funding from supporting the move and asked the agency to turn over information about its decisionmaking process, and they have sponsored legislation to keep the two agencies in Washington.

“I am appalled with the Trump administration’s decision to force hundreds of Washington-based USDA research staffers to uproot their lives to Kansas City in order to keep their livelihoods,” Rep. Chellie Pingree Rochelle (Chellie) PingreeScientists flee USDA as research agencies move to Kansas City area Federal employees turn their backs on Agriculture secretary after relocation plans announced Congress should make Interior's Bernhardt 'manage the land to stop climate change' MORE (D-Maine), who sponsored the legislation, said in a statement when the move was announced.

“Many of these staffers believe their relocation is an effort to silence their research into topics that do not align with the Trump administration’s political agenda, including the study of climate change and benefits of low-income food assistance,” she added.

Employees had a list of complaints about a move they have likened to Amazon’s search for a second headquarters, as the USDA examined bids from 139 cities.

That process was put on pause during the government shutdown, but on June 16 employees were told they had a month to decide whether they’d like to move to the Kansas City area or leave the agency.

Employees would then have two months to move to Kansas City — they must be there by the end of the fiscal year — but school in the area is slated to start Aug. 12, putting added pressure on those with families to quickly make a move.

Employees say they are getting conflicting information about how much of their moving costs will be covered by the government. Other key details about the move are also unknown so far, according to the employees.

The USDA said it was working to make the move as smooth as possible but did not respond to several specific questions about the move from The Hill.

“USDA has determinedly worked to ensure employees have the resources they need to make informed decisions about their employment and to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible,” the agency said in a statement.

Employees say morale is at an all-time low and they worry about the future of an agency that is already hemorrhaging staff and having trouble completing its work.

“Honestly, I’m not sure how we’re going to bounce back or if we will,” said Laura Dodson, an agricultural economist with ERS who is now a union steward. “This agency is the product of like 50 years of institutional knowledge and gathering up researchers who are very specialized in their fields.”

Employees also say there are contradictions between what the USDA says it hopes to achieve with the move and how it would actually impact the department.

“It was sort of get fired or go,” said Ariela Zycherman, a national program leader with NIFA who is still weighing a move to Kansas City.

“People keep saying, ‘Those East Coasters don’t want to come to Kansas or Missouri.’ The fact of matter is that’s not really the issue,” she said. “Many of us would move to Kansas City, but there are questions about future of agency and its effectiveness and questions about the way this was hastily rolled out and whether it will have long-term effects on our families’ well-being.”

The USDA has argued the move will allow employees to be closer to farmers — something employees say shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what they do.

“I think the biggest misconception around this is, we don’t serve individual farmers,” Dodson said. “Our stakeholders are primarily Congress and program leads and agencies and nonprofits in D.C. or people that come to meet with multiple entities in D.C.""

“I think our presence will be very much diminished. I think we’ll be quite literally out of sight and out of mind,” Dodson added.

The bipartisan Kansas and Missouri delegation pushed hard to bring the offices to the Kansas City area, calling it a hub for research and a talented workforce and touting the lower cost compared to Washington, D.C.

But employees say the hectic way the move has been handled has soured many about the USDA.

“I’ve never experienced morale like this in any job,” said Wesley Dean, a national program leader in sociology for NIFA. “My colleagues are deeply committed to the mission of the agency and see their positions as an opportunity to both shape the future of their scientific disciplines and to serve the American people.

“These highly motivated civil servants feel as if their expertise and dedication to the agency and the public has been undermined and dismissed by the department,” Dean added."
Inside Trump’s Border Wars,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jason Zengerle'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/magazine/immigration-department-of-homeland-security.html,"But it was also a remarkable opportunity. After all, Nielsen had a much thinner résumé than her predecessors at the job: former governors, judges and upper-echelon government lawyers. James Nealon, who worked with Nielsen as the department’s assistant secretary for international engagement, describes her as “a super staffer.” But it’s a general rule of Washington that staff members, even super staffers, don’t become cabinet officers — much less when they’re still in their 40s.

Not long after Nielsen was sworn in as homeland security secretary in December 2017, according to a current and a former administration official, McAleenan alerted her to a rise in illegal border crossings. If the trend continued, he warned, by the spring — when border crossings typically peak — the immigration system would most likely be so overwhelmed that the department would no longer be able to process, much less interdict, new arrivals. Together with Thomas Homan, then the acting director of ICE, and L. Francis Cissna, then the director of Citizenship and Immigration Services — the agency that handles the country’s legal immigration procedures — he urged Nielsen to take some sort of drastic action.

One option McAleenan, Homan and Cissna presented to Nielsen, according to the current and former administration officials, was instituting a policy of separating migrant children from their families. Because of a consent decree known as the Flores settlement, C.B.P. is prohibited from holding immigrant children caught illegally crossing the border with their guardians for more than 20 days. This meant that adult immigrants, if they illegally came across the border with their children, would be released — often immediately or at the longest after 20 days — when their children were required to be released. Separating the children from their parents, department officials argued, would allow C.B.P. to detain the adults longer.

According to former senior administration officials, Kelly, when he was homeland security secretary, had been urged by other administration officials to institute such a family-separation policy. Publicly, Kelly said he was considering such a move. “I would do almost anything to deter the people from Central America to getting on this very, very dangerous network that brings them up through Mexico into the United States,” he told CNN in March 2017. But according to former senior administration officials, he privately rejected it, and the idea was tabled.

Now Nielsen rejected it as well. But as the border numbers kept rising, the pressure on Nielsen to do something only grew — and it was no longer coming from just her deputies. Toward the end of 2017, Gene Hamilton, Miller’s old ally at D.H.S., moved over to the Department of Justice, where he was reunited with Sessions, his old Senate boss. Not long after Hamilton’s arrival, the attorney general began to assert himself more aggressively on immigration matters. In early April 2018, Sessions announced that the Department of Justice would institute a policy of “zero tolerance” for undocumented immigrants. For the last two decades, under Democratic and Republican presidents, people who were caught crossing the border for the first time were typically charged with misdemeanors and then released. Under the zero-tolerance policy, all undocumented immigrants would be “met with the full prosecutorial power of the Department of Justice,” as Sessions put it.

The timing of the attorney general’s announcement caught Nielsen by surprise — and it presented her with a problem. For the Trump administration to be able to prosecute all undocumented immigrants, C.B.P. would have to refer their cases to the Justice Department, which would mean separating parents from their children while the parents awaited prosecution. Later that April, McAleenan, Homan and Cissna wrote Nielsen a memo recommending that D.H.S. start doing just that.

According to The Washington Post, which obtained a copy of the memo, they noted that the Trump administration had run a pilot zero-tolerance program along parts of the border in Texas and New Mexico for four months in 2017 and that the number of families trying to cross illegally had gone down 64 percent, only to rise again when the program was paused. After receiving the memo, Nielsen met with McAleenan, Homan and Cissna at the Ronald Reagan Building near the White House. There, according to former senior administration officials, she told them that she felt boxed in, but she agreed to their recommendation."
Trump DOJ scores rare win on sanctuary city crackdown in appeals court,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doj-scores-rare-win-on-sanctuary-city-crackdown-in-appeals-court,"President Trump notched a win on Friday in a federal appeals court, which upheld a Department of Justice method for cracking down on sanctuary cities.

In a 2-1 decision that overturns a nationwide injunction, the DOJ is now allowed to give preferential treatment for community policing grants to cities that don't defy federal immigration enforcement.

""The department is pleased that the court recognized the lawful authority of the administration to provide favorable treatment when awarding discretionary law enforcement grants to jurisdictions that assist in enforcing federal immigration laws,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

DHS LEADING INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO RAID LEAKS

While the Trump administration has faced numerous obstacles in cutting funding to sanctuary cities, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appears to make an exception for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program, which is meant to help cities hire more police officers.

Other factors in the program's ""points"" system include the hiring of veterans, and the occurrence of school shootings within a jurisdiction. In 2017, the DOJ under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented points that benefit non-sanctuary cities.

Judges Sandra Ikuta and Jay Bybee, who ruled in the DOJ's favor, were appointees of President George W. Bush.

""Cooperation relating to enforcement of federal immigration law is in pursuit of the general welfare, and meets the low bar of being germane to the federal interest in providing the funding to 'address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise ... enhance public safety,'"" Ikuta stated."
Resignation puts state Department of Human Services under the microscope. Again.,https://www.minnpost.com,"['Peter Callaghan', 'Andy Steiner', 'Walker Orenstein', 'About The Author']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2019/07/resignation-puts-state-department-of-human-services-under-the-microscope-again/,"When Tony Lourey told Gov. Tim Walz he wanted to leave his job as commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, he said he wanted to do so immediately — to avoid drama and speculation.

Things didn’t exactly work out that way.

In a press release issued Monday morning, Walz’s office announced that Pam Wheelock would be appointed acting commissioner of the state’s largest agency. Wheelock has broad experience in government and nonprofits, including stints as Gov. Jesse Ventura’s finance commissioner and former St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman’s deputy mayor. But beneath that annnounced in the release was the real news: that Lourey would resign and leave the job. At the end of the day.

Six months as DHS commissioner is not a long tenure, even in a volatile job like state government Cabinet secretary. And Lourey’s quick departure, especially after giving up a state Senate seat lost to Republicans in a February special election, created plenty of drama. Coming a weekend after the resignation of two long-serving and well-regarded senior department executives, the move also spawned widespread speculation.

Was he fired? Did the governor ask for the resignation letter? How much notice was Walz given?

At a news conference Monday, Walz said Lourey was not fired; that he didn’t ask for the resignation; and that he found out about the decision the day before. Even if those answers were designed to tamp down speculation, the timing and verbage the DFL governor used Monday — and that Lourey used in his resignation letter — triggered a day of reading between the lines.

While that isn’t unusual for political appointees, the difference was that Lourey also didn’t have a good working relationship with the senior bureaucrats who are often relied upon to run the place.

Walz said Monday that the two officials who recently resigned, Deputy Commissioners Chuck Johnson and Claire Wilson, spoke late last week with his chief of staff, Chris Schmitter, about their reasons for leaving the department. “When two longtime, dedicated public servants say they’re going to leave service, I want to know that, too,” Walz said.

While Walz described them as “very respectful,” the two said they disagreed with the direction the agency was going under Lourey.

“I expressed my desire to try to keep both of them,” said Walz.

Neither Johnson or Wilson are leaving immediately, and Walz wasn’t ruling out the possibility that they would rescind those resignations. “The resignation letter of the commissioner is very self-aware that maybe this is the wrong leadership style at this time to achieve the goals we are looking for,” Walz said. “I think Commissioner Lourey said, ‘I got you through this, I helped you get this budget, I got the provider tax sunset removed, now it’s time for someone else’s skill set.’”

That letter to Walz, while thanking him for the opportunity and citing “the real change I pushed for in an agency that needs to grow in how it connects with and partners with the people we serve,” noted in its conclusion: “I believe a new leader is necessary to best execute your vision for human services and continue the critical work of improving the health of Minnesotan across the state.”

Lourey said through an agency spokesperson that he was not doing interviews or taking questions about his departure.

Walz rejected suggestions that the department is in chaos and used Wheelock’s willingness to take on the job as evidence. “I don’t think that acting Commissioner Wheelock saw an agency in crisis,” he said. “I think she saw an agency at a transition point.”

Another issue might have contributed to the timing of the announcement. Last week, the Pioneer-Press reported that the Department of Human Services was still paying Inspector General Carolyn Ham four months after putting her on leave. While the suggestion was that she was the subject of an investigation into how the department responded to allegations of fraud and theft in the Child Care Assistance Program, Ham said no investigation had begun.

On Monday, Walz said an investigation had begun but wouldn’t say when. Later, House GOP Leader Kurt Daudt said he’d been told that morning that the investigation had begun “very recently.”

Walz said he was restricted in what he could say but said that no state employee took money.

“The situation that happened with the Child Care Assistance Program is totally unacceptable,” Walz said. “And to be totally clear, no one in state government stole any money. Private businesses stole from the state of Minnesota and we were negligent — or it appears to me that we were negligent — in stopping that in a timely manner.”

The investigation, he said, is to understand why that happened.

But Walz also said there was no linkage between the CCAP issue and Lourey’s resignation. “I think there’s going to be a desire to find more drama than is there,” he said. “Those of you who know me know I don’t do drama. I think the situation is we have a complex agency, the skillset Commissioner Lourey possessed was incredibly helpful and was the catalyst to helping us get a budget done.”

Now, however, as policies and budgets are implemented, and as the CCAP problems are addressed, “I will take Commissioner Lourey at this word that he felt he was not the right person at this time to do that.”

While neither Johnson nor Wilson made public statements about concerns with the agency, another person who recently left the agency did. Dr. Jeff Schiff was the longtime medical director to the state Medicaid program before his job was eliminated last month. The Pioneer Press reported that he issued a statement last week after Johnson’s and Wilson’s resignations: “This event, following the reorganization that led to my departure, points to serious systemic issues with the leadership culture of the agency,” he said. “I call upon Governor Walz and Lieutenant Governor Flanagan to live up to their pledge of ‘One Minnesota,’ investigate, and act so that we can go back to being the healthiest state in the nation for all Minnesotans.”

Republican legislators had already scheduled a noon press conference to talk about the Johnson and Wilson resignations, arguing that it signaled disarray in the agency. Monday’s announcement changed the narrative a bit, but not the political message.

“Since Gov. Walz has taken office, the department has been embroiled in chaos,” said Rep. Mary Franson, R-Alexandria. She compared it to a dumpster fire. Daudt repeatedly termed the resignation of Lourey and whatever led up to it as a “scandal.” Daudt, R-Crown, said he has been around state government long enough to know commissioners don’t get fired, they get asked to resign.

The rapid action suggests that this has been “boiling up for a few days,” he said, and that the state is owed a more specific explanation of why Lourey resigned. “I can assure you that Commissioner Lourey didn’t give up a Senate seat to serve as commissioner for six months,” Daudt said.

And while he was willing to allow Walz some leeway since the CCAP fraud investigation covered his predecessor’s term in office, that will end soon. “There comes a time when fraud is overlooked enough that Gov. Walz will own that fraud,” Daudt said. “If he does nothing to fix the fraud, he becomes part of the fraud.”

Unlike Daudt and Franson, who are minority members of the House, Sen. Michelle Benson is a member of the Senate’s majority caucus, and as such controls a committee with oversight of the Department of Human Services. The Ham Lake Republican said she had a working relationship with Lourey, both when he served in the state Senate and then as commissioner. She termed it a “functional working relationship” and said he called her last week to tell her of the Johnson and Wilson resignations.

But she said her hopes that Lourey would be a “transformative leader” were not realized. “It just might be the case that DHS is too big of an entrenched bureaucracy, even for someone with Tony Lourey’s experience, to transform,” Benson said.

She renewed her call to break the agency up into parts and said Walz should call on experts from the private sector as he did to resolve delays and cost overruns in the MNLARS state licensing system. “It is time the governor grab the leadership and move this to a better place,” Benson said. “That’s all I want. In 18 months for the place to be noticeably and fundamentally better.”

Benson’s counterpart in the House, Health and Human Services Finance chair Tina Liebling, called the Lourey resignation disappointing and described him as “a great guy.”

But the job is a difficult one, she said, “maybe even harder than governor,” and that Lourey may not have known how tough it was until he was in the midst of it.

The DFLer said she too was surprised that the investigation into the office of inspector general and the CCAP issue either hadn’t begun or has just been begun. And she called the loss of Johnson and Wilson “a tremendous loss for the administration.” Johnson, she said, was respected by both parties in the Legislature. “He has always engendered a lot of comfort,” she said. “He knows the agency and he handles himself well.

“He’s the one you want in the room when there’s some tough issue,” she said.

But she rejected GOP suggestions that the situation at DHS represents disarray or chaos. “I’m as surprised as anyone. It is a short period of time,” she said. But compared to the comings and going of members of the Trump administration, it doesn’t suggest a lot of turnover. “It isn’t a disaster. I think it’s just an opportunity to rethink what the agency needs.”"

A life-size bronze statue of Obama was unveiled Saturday in Rapid City. The sculpture, created by artist James Van Nuys, is part of a collection of figures honoring past US presidents throughout the city's downtown district.

But Obama's statue is slightly different than the others.

The City of Presidents project, the private group behind the statues, initially planned to release the statue within nine months and it took them about two years. Members had planned to show Obama only standing and waving when they decided to brainstorm more ideas.

""One of us said, 'This is boring. This is not going to have the wow factor,'"" said Dallerie Davis, the group's co-founder. ""A man waving is not a showstopper.""

What the USDA Label Really Says,https://www.goodhousekeeping.com,"['Jaclyn London', 'Ms', 'Rd', 'Cdn', 'Good Housekeeping Institute', 'Director', 'Nutrition Lab', 'A Registered Dietitian With A Bachelor Of Arts Degree Northwestern University', 'A Master Of Science Degree In Clinical Nutrition New York University', 'Jaclyn']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a28224713/what-does-organic-mean/,"You see the word ""organic"" thrown around everywhere these days — whether it's on food, clothing, beauty products, and more. But what does it actually mean to call something organic? The U.S. Department of Agriculture National Organic Standards Board defines the term as this:

""Organic"" is a labeling term that denotes products produced under the authority of the Organic Foods Production Act. The principal guidelines for organic production are to use materials and practices that enhance the ecological balance of natural systems and that integrate the parts of the farming system into an ecological whole.

Okay ... So what does that definition actually mean for you? Here's what you really need to know about buying and eating organic food.

What exactly does organic mean?

To label a food as organic, it must meet the guidelines set by the USDA. These include:

Not using prohibited substances (most synthetic fertilizers and pesticides) for three years prior to harvest

Not using genetically modified organisms (GMOs)

Raising animals in living conditions accommodating their natural behaviors (like grazing on pasture), feeding them 100% organic food, and not administering antibiotics or hormones

Omitting artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors from multi-ingredient, processed foods with some exceptions, like baking soda in baked goods

Organic agricultural production still uses pesticides and herbicides that USDA's organic certification standards have okayed. Just because something is labeled ""organic"" does not mean that no pesticides or herbicides were used. It simply means that the ones applied met the USDA's production standards for the term.

The definition of organic also limits the use of ""genetically modified organisms."" GMO crops have been genetically altered to withstand the application of herbicides and pesticides — chemicals that protect harvests from viruses and bugs. The introduction of GMOs into the food supply sparked a debate over their health and environmental implications. Anything bearing the USDA Organic Seal is automatically non-GMO.

What does organic food mean?

USDA

Contrary to popular belief, organic food relates back to agricultural production, not a specific nutrition- or health-related guideline. For a product to carry the USDA organic label, a third party must verify at least 95% of the ingredients as organic. The phrase ""made with organic ingredients"" means at least 70% of the ingredients used counted as organic.

Foods can still be organic even if they're not labeled as such. Since the standard requires third-party verification, there's a cost associated with the certification process. Food companies must consistently provide back-up documentation in order to use the ""USDA Organic"" seal. That makes it less desirable to smaller or newer brands that use organic production practices, but don't want to incur the costs of verification.



Is organic food really better?

Despite controversial headlines about this labeling claim, the agricultural practice used to produce food does not determine how nutritious it is for you, nor does it directly impact your state of health. Case in point: Organic cane sugar is still sugar. The nutrients you'll find within the food are what, over time, predominantly affect your health — not the growing methods used to make it. Also, organic products will cost more than their non-organic counterparts, which is a critical consideration for most of us on a budget.

There's also the question of whether or not genetically modifying crops are harmful to health. But to date, there's no substantial data to imply that GMO crops available on the consumer market pose a direct risk.

Does organic mean healthy?

Short answer? No. Growing methods do not universally make foods better or worse for you nutritionally. This is especially true when you consider eating a balanced diet overall. For example, USDA Organic beef is grass-fed, which implies that you'll find slightly more omega-3 fatty acids in it compared to conventionally raised cattle. But if you're also regularly consuming seafood, then you're already getting the omega-3's you need.

When you see alarmist headline about a specific pesticide used in conventional agriculture, it's almost always talking about exposure through proximity (i.e., field work), not ingesting the foods we eat. Some population studies show a correlation between buying organic food and better health, but it's important to consider the other factors that buying organic implies, including lifestyle and socioeconomic status. Since there's no specific, isolated link between the two, we simply cannot use the term ""organic"" to imply ""healthy"" — despite the fact that it's often marketed as such.

As for GMOs and your health? The most recent and comprehensive National Academy of Sciences report states that although genetically modified crops may vary in nutritional composition, the variation is no more than what would occur naturally among non-GMO crops. The report also analyzed data from large-scale studies since GMOs entered the food supply in the '90s, but did not find any associations with chronic disease incidence and dietary patterns.

The biggest issue with GMOs from a nutritional standpoint is the products in which they’re usually found: highly processed foods and beverages. The most predominant GMO crops — corn and soybeans — can go in packaged foods loaded with added sugar (e.g., sugary beverages made with corn syrup) and saturated fat.



Is anything really organic?

In food, yes. That's because the USDA requires companies to follow certain agricultural practices before getting verified. But in other types of products, that's not necessarily the case.

The Bottom Line: While we still don't know everything about GMOs and organic growing practices, there is one thing about this debate I can say with confidence: It's more important to know exactly what foods are wholesome, nutritious, and health-promoting overall rather than focusing on a specific label claim."
"Ross, Barr Set for Contempt Vote as Commerce Secretary Faces Uncertain Future",https://www.usnews.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-07-16/ross-barr-set-for-contempt-vote-as-commerce-secretary-faces-uncertain-future,"President Donald Trump arrives at a press conference with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, right, and Attorney General William Barr, on July 11. A House vote on holding Ross and Barr in contempt is set for Tuesday. The Associated Press

The House is poised to vote on holding Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Attorney General William Barr in contempt over their roles in withholding information about efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census amid a report that President Donald Trump is considering firing Ross over the failed attempt to include one.

Democrats in the House scheduled a Tuesday floor vote on the criminal contempt resolution since Ross and Barr have declined to comply with a subpoena to hand over documents to the House Oversight and Reform Committee to help aid in its investigation about the origins of the citizenship question.

House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland accused the Trump administration of wanting to add a citizenship question for the first time since 1950 ""only to deter minorities from participating and leading to an undercount in parts of the country.""

Officials held in criminal contempt face fines and up to a year in prison, but it's highly unlikely either would face criminal charges from the Justice Department. Barr would be the second attorney general held in contempt by the full House other than Eric Holder when he was attorney general for former President Barack Obama.

Democrats on the oversight committee are still pressing on with their census investigation even after Trump announced last Thursday that he'd be ending his hard-fought bid to add a citizenship question. Instead, he announced an executive order that calls on every federal agency to provide the Commerce Department with requested records to determine the number of citizens and noncitizens in the U.S.

Both Ross and Barr stood next to Trump during his announcement in the Rose Garden, but only Barr spoke about the efforts to find other ways to collect citizenship data and pushed back on media reports that Trump was initially pursuing executive action to add the question.

Amid the fallout of the administration's census efforts, Trump is weighing firing Ross, sharing frustrations with his inner circle and outside allies who believe the commerce secretary could be gone by this summer at the earliest, according to NBC News . But NBC reported that Trump doesn't appear to be reaching out to potential replacements for commerce secretary, for now.

As the president reportedly considers ousting Ross, he already faces a string of high-profile departures from the White House and his Cabinet. On Friday, Alex Acosta announced his resignation as labor secretary as he faces heightened scrutiny for his role in a 2008 plea deal for accused sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently arrested and pleaded not guilty to new sex-trafficking charges.

Trump told reporters last week that Ross hadn't ""let me down"" on the census. Kevin Manning, Commerce Department press secretary, told NBC in a statement that Ross is currently overseeing the agency's handling of Hurricane Barry and ""will continue to work on behalf of the American people and the president's America First agenda.""

The decision to halt efforts to add the question came after the Supreme Court handed down a ruling last month that temporarily blocked its inclusion, sending it back down to the lower court. Chief Justice John Roberts asked the administration to submit a new explanation of why it wanted to add the question, calling Ross' explanation that it would help DOJ enforce the Voting Rights Act ""contrived.""

With a strict printing deadline of June 30, the Commerce Department went ahead with printing the forms without the question. But since then, Trump had disputed his own administration and wavered several times on whether to keep pursuing the inclusion of the citizenship question.

Amid confusion over Trump's comments about keeping the question alive, DOJ attorneys informed a federal judge in Maryland that the administration was still exploring ways to add it. They also confirmed that printing without the question was still underway due to an injunction.

Trump appeared ready to pursue some type of executive action to push for inclusion of the question on Friday but abruptly reversed course and backed down on those efforts altogether.

In Maryland, U.S. District Judge George Hazel, who has already ruled against the question because it broke federal administrative law, is still reexamining the case through the lens of whether the administration had any discriminatory motives behind wanting to include it. Hazel is considering a recently surfaced report from a deceased Republican operative who argued in 2015 that it would be ""advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites."""

I had a very busy week, and I forgot.

Oh, yes, I am sure I would certainly very loudly denounce them as would my colleagues, but you see I cannot yet, because I died.

Also I don’t know what a tweet is.

Also a big bird flew through the window and scooped up my phone in its beak and dropped it into a river, so even if I was going to, you see now I cannot!

Also I am becoming a bird.

Also CAW! CAW! CAW! NO FURTHER QUESTIONS!

Also I have this condition where if anyone forces me to think hard at all about anything the president has said or done, I start to melt and then catch fire.

Seriously, my whole worldview is hanging by a very fragile thread! Please, nothing further.

Also I am invisible. You cannot see or hear me.

Also I would, but I am not a statesman any more! I spend all my time on John Boehner’s riding mower going around his lawn in slow circles with a martini! You have come to the wrong place, cowboy! I haven’t done that sort of thing for a long time!

Also I made a vow of silence unto the Lord. Oops!

Also, oh, no, I suddenly forgot how to read, so the words in front of me are all meaningless now, little squiggling black worms in milk.

Also there was a power outage somewhere in the country, so out of respect, I could not, absolutely could not, turn on my phone.

Also my phone fell out the window.

Also the Internet, I hear, fell into a lake.

Also I didn’t see you there.

I did denounce him already, surely I did! I am no coward! Did you not see it? Well, it was there! Oh, this racist remark? This new one? No, that was — never mind.

I would have denounced him, but you see, I was attending a rally to express support for his views.

I got stuck.

Out of respect for my wife, I cannot say anything positive about another woman, even a colleague.

I will denounce him, absolutely I’m going to, I swear as soon as I put on my glasses. *Throws glasses out window, steps on them*

I would, but the cat got my tongue and then the cat died STILL STUCK IN THAT POSITION!

Je ne parle pas l’anglais!

I would denounce his comments, but aren’t you the ones always saying his tweets are a scheme to distract you from the the real issues?

I would, but I agree with them.

""DoD has an urgent need to get these critical capabilities in place to support the warfighter and we have multiple military services and combatant commands waiting on the availability of JEDI. Our focus continues to be on finalizing the award decision.”

Earlier this year, the court dismissed a similar case brought by IBM.

The JEDI contract is now set to proceed, with only Amazon and Azure eligible, with an award expected to be announced in late August.

There remains perhaps one more roadblock, however, with Senator Marco Rubio last week writing an open letter to National Security Advisor John Bolton: ""JEDI has the potential to be a $10 billion, 10-year contract. This type of fiscal and time commitment should demand a procurement steeped in competition and conducted without bias toward any one vendor.

""However, DoD has used arbitrary criteria and standards for bidders. Even though 200 companies were initially interested, DoD instituted such a restrictive criteria that only four companies bid on JEDI. DoD then further used the arbitrary criteria to eliminate two of the bidders, IBM and Oracle, leaving only Amazon and Microsoft. And in the end, DoD plans to award this massive contract to a single vendor, even though multiple vendors would ensure continuing price competition and access to the latest innovations.""

Rubio, who in 2016 received $4m in campaign donations from Oracle founder Larry Ellison, added: ""I respectfully request that you direct the delay of an award until all efforts are concluded in addition to evaluating all bids in a fair and open process in order to provide the competition necessary to obtain the best cost and best technology for its cloud computing needs.""

Communities no longer able to appeal pollution permits under forthcoming EPA rule: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453164-communities-no-longer-able-to-appeal-pollution-permits-under,"Changing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations could soon strip individuals and communities of the ability to challenge granted pollution permits while continuing to allow industry to appeal denials, The New York Times reported.

The rule the EPA is preparing to weaken would no longer allow community voices across the country to challenge decisions on how much pollution is legally allowed to be released at nearby power plants, according to the report.

Three people familiar with the draft plan, which has not yet been released, told the Times that industry stakeholders would still be allowed to appeal the EPA’s decisions to the Environmental Appeals Board.

The EPA did not confirm or deny the existence of the forthcoming rulemaking.

“EPA is always interested in improving its processes while maintaining environmental protection. Contrary to the speculation by certain parties, EPA is working to protect the public interest and transparently carry out its work,” an EPA spokesman said in a statement.

News of the rule change, first announced by the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility on Friday, came the same week President Trump Donald John TrumpEsper sidesteps question on whether he aligns more with Mattis or Trump Warren embraces Thiel label: 'Good' As tensions escalate, US must intensify pressure on Iran and the IAEA MORE held his environmental leadership speech at the White House. Trump preached the role his administration has played in bringing top-notch water and air protections to the U.S.

“What E.P.A. is proposing means communities and families no longer have the right to appeal a pollution permit that might affect them,” Patrice Simms, a former staff lawyer for the Environmental Appeals Board, told the Times.

Critics of the rule change say the appeals option offered communities a forum to push back on the EPA’s decisions without piling on legal fees and mounting lengthy legal cases.

Supporters of the change say it would eliminate red tape and speed up a process that ends up being decided by the courts anyway.

The rule proposal could be made public as soon as this week, according to the Times."
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the 2020 Presidential Race and Why We Should Break Up Homeland Security,https://www.newyorker.com,"['Dorothy Wickenden', 'David Remnick', 'Chia-Chia Lin', 'Siddhartha Mukherjee', 'Louisa Thomas', 'Oliver Sacks']",,,,https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-on-the-2020-presidential-race-and-why-we-should-break-up-homeland-security,"It’s hard to recall a newly elected freshman representative to Congress who has made a bigger impact than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Her primary victory for New York’s Fourteenth District seat—as a young woman of color beating out a long-established white male incumbent—was big news, and Ocasio-Cortez has been generating headlines almost daily ever since. Practically since the day she took her seat in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez became the hero of the Democratic left wing and a favored villain of Fox News and the right. She battled Nancy Pelosi to make the Green New Deal a priority and has been involved with a movement to launch primary challenges against centrist or right-leaning Democrats. Like Bernie Sanders, she embraces the label of democratic socialism and supports free college education for all Americans. She has called for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She joined David Remnick in the New Yorker Radio Hour studio on July 5th, just after her trip to the border to examine migrant-detention facilities. Remnick and Ocasio-Cortez spoke about why she courted controversy by referring to some facilities as “concentration camps”; why she thinks the Department of Homeland Security is irredeemable; and whether Joe Biden is qualified to be President, given his comments about colleagues who supported forms of segregation. “Issues of race and gender are not extra-credit points in being a good Democrat,” she says. “They are a core part of the . . . competencies that a President needs. . . . Where are you on understanding the people that live in this country?”"
