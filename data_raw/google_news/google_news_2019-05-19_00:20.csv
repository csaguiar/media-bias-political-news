Trump Shows Signs He Will Pardon Servicemen Accused or Convicted of War Crimes,https://www.nytimes.com,['Dave Philipps'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/us/trump-pardons-war-crimes.html,"President Trump has indicated that he is considering pardons for several American military members accused or convicted of war crimes, including high-profile cases of murder, attempted murder and desecration of a corpse, according to two United States officials.

The officials said that the Trump administration had made expedited requests this week for paperwork needed to pardon the troops on or around Memorial Day.

One request is for Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher of the Navy SEALs, who is scheduled to stand trial in the coming weeks on charges of shooting unarmed civilians and killing an enemy captive with a knife while deployed in Iraq.

The others are believed to include the case of a former Blackwater security contractor recently found guilty in the deadly 2007 shooting of dozens of unarmed Iraqis; the case of Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, the Army Green Beret accused of killing an unarmed Afghan in 2010; and the case of a group of Marine Corps snipers charged with urinating on the corpses of dead Taliban fighters."

Mike Pence in Indiana: Proud of Trump admin for standing for the 'sanctity of human life',https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mike-pence-indiana-proud-trump-admin-standing-sanctity/story?id=63124027,"Speaking at a commencement ceremony in his home state of Indiana, Vice President Mike Pence said he was proud of the Trump administration for standing “without a apology” for the “sanctity of human life,” but avoided any mention of the controversial anti-abortion measures approved in several states in recent weeks.

“I couldn’t be more proud to be part of an administration that stood strong on the timeless values that have made this nation great, stood without apology for the sanctity of human life,” Pence told graduating students at Taylor University.

While the vice president has expressed similar sentiments before, his comments on Saturday come as outrage builds among the Democratic field of 2020 presidential candidates over a new Alabama law that would make it a felony to perform an abortion and carry a sentence of up to 99 years in prison.

The vice president did not directly address the measure, which was signed into law by Alabama's governor but will have to survive legal challenges before it takes effect, or similarly restrictive bills approved in Georgia and Missouri.

The speech closely resembled remarks Pence has made in commencement addresses at various university’s during this graduation season.

For the most part, Pence's address at Taylor discussed what the vice president described as the difficulties in being a devout Christian in today’s society.

""You know, throughout most of our American history [it] has been pretty easy to call yourself a Christian. But things are different now,"" he said. ""Lately it's become acceptable, even fashionable, to malign traditional Christian beliefs. So as you prepare to leave this place, and build your life on the Christ centered world engaging foundation poured here at Taylor University – be prepared to stand up,""

The choice of Pence as Taylor's commencement speaker stirred up a heated debate on campus of the Christian college.

Following the announcement, the Taylor faculty voted 61-49 to express their disagreement with the university's decision.

A petition circulated by students and alumni that protested Pence's visit to the campus got 8,000 signatures online.

“Inviting Vice President Pence to Taylor University and giving him a coveted platform for his political views makes our alumni, faculty, staff and current students complicit in the Trump-Pence Administration's policies, which we believe are not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear,” the petition said.

Minutes before Pence was introduced on Saturday, dozens of graduates and faculty walked out of the graduation ceremony.

At the close of his speech, the vice president received a standing ovation, according to the school’s student newspaper."
Opinion | Don’t Fight Iran,https://www.nytimes.com,['Ross Douthat'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/opinion/sunday/trump-iran-war.html,"But the (arguable) coherence of this approach has been breaking down as the Trump administration has moved into its “maximum pressure” phase of sanctions against Tehran. Because if you impose maximum pressure on a regional power you are, by definition, no longer trying to maintain a Middle Eastern status quo while pivoting to Asia. Instead, you’re effectively returning to the last two administration’s more dramatic Middle East ambitions: You are assuming either that some great diplomatic coup awaits (so Obama was right to seek détente, just wrong to settle) or that your pressure will lead to regime change and democratization (so Bush was right about the freedom agenda after all).

I suspect that Trump is making the first assumption, imagining all this pressure as a prelude to a dramatic deal, while John Bolton and Mike Pompeo are making the second one, imagining the Iranian regime suddenly buckling like the Soviet Union in 1991.

But whatever the core assumption, the maximalist approach inevitably increases the risk of war. If the White House is wrong about the Iranian regime’s willingness to make more concessions, then they’re turning a dial that can produce only two policy responses: endurance or armed reaction. And if they’re right that regime change is a possibility, then the regime they’re trying to change will become more likely to lash out the closer it gets to its own breaking point.

Either way, there is nothing about the current situation in the Middle East, or globally, that makes the chance of war with Iran worth taking — as hawks as well as doves concede.

For instance: National Review’s David French, generally far more hawkish than I am, describes a potential conflict with Iran as possibly worse than any of our wars since 9/11, and a terrible idea “absent the most serious, urgent and compelling need.” David Frum, once a notable Iraq war supporter, writes that war with Iran would recapitulate our Iraq blunders on “a much bigger scale, without allies, without justification, and without any plan at all for what comes next.”"

Four scores were posted to the president’s USGA-administered GHIN (Golf Handicap and Information Network) system on Friday, though there’s no indication that the scores – 101, 100, 108, 102 – are authentic because Trump was traveling and didn’t play golf.

The media has long scrutinized Trump’s golf record as he maintains an index of 2.8 that is perceived as especially good.

A book released last month by longtime sportswriter Rick Reilly accused Trump of not being always honest on the course when marking the scores.

Reilly detailed one time Trump played with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson shortly after becoming president. Trump’s partner, Fox Sports golf analyst Brad Faxon, said the president marked down a score that didn’t account for two balls he hit in the water.

Immigration activists stew over Pence’s role on immigration plan,https://www.politico.com,"['Anita Kumar', 'Daniel Lippman', 'Jordyn Hermani', 'Ted Hesson']",05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/18/mike-pence-immigration-trump-1331565,"Vice President Mike Pence's critics have noticed with growing alarm that he is playing a greater behind-the-scenes role in Trump’s immigration policy than has been previously understood. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images white house Immigration activists stew over Pence’s role on immigration plan Hardliners never forgave Pence for what they say was an 'amnesty' plan he offered as a congressman in 2006.

As a member of Congress more than a decade ago, Mike Pence unveiled an immigration proposal offering a chance for legal status to people who had come to the country illegally.

Hardline conservative activists were furious.

Story Continued Below

Tom Tancredo, then a firebrand Republican congressman from Colorado, called the vice president’s proposal both “amnesty” and “an atrocity”: A political action committee he co-founded set up a running “Pence Watch” online. The populist pundit Pat Buchanan likened Pence’s call for “a principled consensus on immigration reform” to a betrayal from “The Godfather” and said it could mean “the end of Mike Pence as a rising star of the GOP.”

Pence’s 2006 plan, which he insisted did not amount to amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally, died quietly and has been mostly forgotten in Washington.

But not by those hawkish advocates, who suspect that Pence is quietly seeking to have a moderating influence over President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, including what the president introduced as his new “pro-immigrant” plan on Thursday.

Although Pence largely echoes Trump’s talking points and has given few public hints that he sees things any differently, his critics have noticed with growing alarm that he is playing a greater behind-the-scenes role in Trump’s immigration policy than has been previously understood, a fact confirmed by people close to Pence.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/2044/1155968404_6038156514001_6037834539001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

Immigration hawks say Pence’s involvement is a warning sign that “establishment Republicans who are interested in more workers — and not more relief for American workers” — are making inroads into Trump’s policymaking, said Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, who attended a meeting with Jared Kushner, the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law.

Vaughan and her influential allies are in constant battle with what they see as Chamber of Commerce-style establishment Republicans, who are far more interested in ensuring an ample labor supply than in Trump’s themes of secure borders and national identity. That approach is at odds with the plan Trump released Thursday, which does not aim to reduce the overall number of immigrants allowed in the U.S. legally or address the illegal immigration population — issues he had rallied against for years.

Though the latest immigration proposal was crafted by Kushner, the vice president and his staff attended discussions at the White House over the past several months as it was being shaped. Those meetings included at least two meetings between Kushner and various advocacy groups, including business and agriculture organizations, according to four people who attended the meetings. He has held at least one call with activists on immigration. More recently, he has spoken at a series of immigration events focused on securing the U.S.-Mexico border.

Pence was primarily observing when he sat in one of Kushner’s meetings earlier this year, according to an immigration activist, who supports more enforcement, though he did mention several times the plan he proposed while in the House.

A person close to the vice president said that some themes of Pence’s old bill had been discussed as part of the new effort, while the activist also said Pence had been involved in the developmental phase of the plan and had attended other meetings more recently.

“He’s been an active participant in the discussions that Jared has led, trying to find a good balance between, for example, guest worker programs for agriculture workers, things like that,” the person close to Pence said. That same person said that some themes of Pence’s old bill, including providing skilled labor in critical industries such as agriculture and retaining talent trained in American universities, particularly in STEM, were discussed as part of the new effort.

A White House official said that Pence has attended meetings for months about immigration, primarily about border security, but also about the issue broadly as well as Kushner’s developing plan. Some of his staff, too, have attended meetings, the official said. But the official said that while Pence and his team had been involved in some discussions, they had not played a leading role in Kushner’s plan.

Instead, Pence was tasked with helping solve the impasse over border wall funding that led to the longest federal government shutdown in history and ended with a bill that funded new barriers on the border, more detention space, surveillance equipment and immigration judges. Since then, Pence has traveled to nearly a dozen states thanking homeland security employees for their work.

Still, other people who are either close to Pence or involved in the negotiations see it differently.

Pence brings a more pragmatic approach to a subject that Trump sees in uncompromising, almost good-and-evil terms, according to one former White House official familiar with the situation.

“There’s a solid respect for what the VP brings to the table,” the former official said, adding that Pence had been “figuring out how to do this legally, figure out how to do it in a way that makes sense.”

House members and governors often air their private feelings on a range of issues with Pence, according to someone close to him.

In some ways, Pence is an unlikely understudy to an extreme immigration hardliner like Trump. Associates say his views on immigration in large part stem from a grandfather who immigrated from Ireland, whom he was very close to, and the large agricultural community in his home state of Indiana.

“As the grandson of an Irish immigrant, I believe in the ideals enshrined on the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor,” Pence wrote in a June 2006 Wall Street Journal op-ed. “America always has been, and always will be, a welcoming nation, welcoming under the law any and all with courage enough to come here.”

The new White House proposal doesn’t quite invoke that sort of language. But it would move the U.S. toward a process that welcomes immigrants through a merit-based system, as well as boosts border security.

Pence “recognizes the crisis on the southern border but also understands that there are people who add to our economy and are doing this because they’re seeking employment and, frankly, in jobs that Americans aren’t willing to do at this point, so there is a need,” the person close to Pence said.

The new White House plan would increase the number of migrant workers while reducing the number of family members whom U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents can sponsor to come to the country under the current system — a zero-sum plan that would leave overall immigration levels unchanged.

“If anything … I think the vice president is more invested in the outcome than Jared is,” said one of the people who attended a meeting with Pence. “He’s a regular old-style Republican. He’s a regular Chamber of Commerce Republican.”

While Pence hasn’t advocated for a specific plan, he offered specific thoughts — including support for J-1 visas, a program that allows for short-term work experience in the U.S. — according to a person familiar with the situation. Trump officials have argued that the visas can reduce summer job opportunities. The White House official said there had been no direct vice presidential involvement in advocating for or against J-1 visas.

Pence’s 2006 House bill would have allowed immigrants who were in the country illegally to apply for legal status by leaving the U.S. and returning briefly to their home country.

When Trump tapped him to be his running mate, some immigration groups pushing for enforcement were worried.

“Pence was very much a part of the Republican establishment that paid lip service to the public’s concerns about immigration enforcement, while promoting the agenda of the Chamber of Commerce,” the Federation for American Immigration Reform said in a statement at the time.

The White House official said Pence had made no effort as vice president to revive his 2006 House plan.

During the first two years of Trump’s presidency, Pence has served as a point person on legislative issues. He helped build the White House legislative affairs office, held weekly calls with select Republican members of Congress during the transition, and visits regularly with Senate Republicans for lunch.

“If it’s a legislative issue, Pence is going to be involved,” said a former Trump adviser who remains close to the White House.

The vice president has a vested interest in the final White House immigration proposal because, like other major policy plans, including healthcare and tax cuts, he will be expected to try to sell it on Capitol Hill.

“We are calling on the Congress to act,” Pence said recently at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore. “We have a broken border. We have a broken immigration system.”

Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers,https://www.npr.org,['Frank Morris'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/18/724433714/critics-say-usda-plan-to-move-federal-agencies-could-hurt-research-vital-for-far,"Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP

A couple of federal agencies you probably haven't heard of keep track of what farmers grow, what Americans eat and how the country's entire food system operates. And the Trump administration wants them out of Washington, D.C.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would relocate somewhere that's closer to farmers and public universities doing agricultural research. But critics, including many scientists, balked, saying the agencies won't be as effective.

ERS collects and crunches numbers on everything from how much corn syrup Americans consume to how tariffs affect farmers, while NIFA funds research that does things like closely track climate change.

USDA has yet to announce a new home for the agencies, but recently narrowed the list to three: the greater Kansas City metro area, the Research Triangle Park area near Raleigh, N.C., and various sites in Indiana — Vice President Mike Pence's home state.

Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran recalled when he heard of Perdue's proposal.

""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" said the Republican, who, along with other Missouri and Kansas members of Congress, supports the move.

""Not every job in government needs to be in Washington D.C."" Moran said, noting that about 9 out of 10 USDA employees already work outside of Washington.

He added that ERS and NIFA would boost budding research clusters like the Kansas City area's animal health corridor and give bright kids from the region a chance to stay put and still pursue a research career. The move would also fall in line with the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Moran said office rent and the cost of living is cheaper away from the coasts.

Skepticism about what is driving the move

But many in the research community said efficiency isn't driving the move. It's hostility toward science.

""I think that moving the agencies out of D.C. is going to significantly dilute their effectiveness as well as their relevance,"" says Ricardo Salvador, who is the Director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The agency's effectiveness already is under attack, according to a former ERS employee who was granted anonymity due to fear of losing his current position.

""Efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale,"" the ex-ERS employee said.

He said he enjoyed working at the agency until about a year and a half ago, when researchers began to fear tackling politically sensitive topics. Then, Purdue pushed to take the agency out from under nonpartisan oversight and place it under his control.

Finally, the ex-employee said, the surprise announcement to move most of ERS and NIFA out of Washington triggered a cascade of resignations, including his own.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee said.

Employees remaining at ERS and NIFA are fighting back. ERS researchers recently voted to join the American Federation of Government Employees, and NIFA employees plan to take a vote, too. The union will negotiate to give ERS and NIFA employees longer to decide if they want to move, and is backing legislation that would withhold funds USDA would need to make the move.

The Trump administration wanted staff reductions years ago. And all three Trump budgets, none of which have been accepted by Congress, have proposed deep cuts to the agencies.

Salvador argued that's because objective research often clashes with political ideology. ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.

""So the secretary is clearly dealing with inconvenient facts by going to the source and eliminating them,"" Salvador said.

Sen. Jerry Moran said he believes the research agencies can be relocated and well supported, and he's played a key role in fighting off earlier efforts to cut funding for agricultural research.

Moran said farmers, ranchers and policymakers can't make sound decisions without reliable USDA data.

But that's exactly the problem critics have with the proposal to move ERS and NIFA: They say the USDA hasn't produced data that support the move."

Comey, a vocal critic of the Trump administration since Trump fired him from the FBI in 2017, appeared to hit Barr over his probes into the Justice Department’s handling of an investigation into whether any Trump associates aided Russia’s efforts to meddle in the 2016 presidential race.

Barr this week assigned a federal prosecutor in Connecticut to examine the origins of the inquiry and if any political bias influenced any investigative decisions.

The attorney general in April also formed a team to review the actions of the Justice Department and FBI leading up to the Russia investigation. Barr told Congress around that time that he was ""reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016.""

Barr raised eyebrows last month when he said he believes the FBI spied on the Trump campaign during its probe.

“I think spying did occur,” he said during a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. “But the question is whether it was adequately predicated and I’m not suggesting it wasn’t adequately predicated, but I need to explore that.”

Barr later tried to clarify his testimony, saying he was looking into whether “improper surveillance” occurred in 2016.

""I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I'm saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it. That's all,"" he said."
Homeland Security flying migrants out of Texas to locations throughout U.S.,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Nikki Battiste'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/homeland-security-flying-migrants-out-of-texas-to-locations-throughout-u-s-florida-san-diego/,"With the surge of asylum seekers, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol are now flying migrants from the Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas to cities across the country.

In San Diego on Friday, 100 migrants arrived for processing. It came one day after two south Florida counties were upset with a plan that would bring thousands of migrants there.

""We cannot accommodate in Florida just dumping unlawful migrants into our state,"" said Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""I think it'll tax our resources, the schools, healthcare, law enforcement, state agencies.""

CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and the White House, but neither has responded.

Florida officials have been told to expect two plane loads of migrants each week, up to 1,000 people a month, split between Palm Beach and Broward counties. Both are Democratic strongholds. The migrants do not face criminal charges but would likely be released into the community awaiting immigration hearings.

CBS News reporting found that 80% of the beds at the nation's largest detention center for immigrant families in Dilley, Texas were empty last month. But Brian Hastings, chief of law enforcement operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they're overwhelmed.

""The crisis at hand is causing us to look at multiple different locations where we have capacity to process, to fly these individuals to, simply so we can process them into the system,"" Hastings said.

Florida has no designated shelters or government funding for food and security. Officials there have been told to expect migrants in about two weeks."

New DOJ Investigation Has Haunted FBI for Months,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/18/new_doj_investigation_has_haunted_fbi_for_months.html,"John Durham, the prosecutor tapped by Attorney General William Barr to investigate how Trump-Russia allegations emerged and spread within federal law enforcement, has already been looking into whether the FBI’s former top lawyer, James Baker, illegally leaked to reporters.

In fact, the U.S. attorney from Connecticut appears to have begun that work more than seven months ago, to judge from an underreported transcript of an October congressional interview with Baker. The Baker interview, at which Durham was not present, suggests that the prosecutor nevertheless has some people very worried.

Baker testified about the Trump-Russia affair on Oct. 3 before the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

In that session, the former FBI general counsel admitted that versions and variations of Christopher Steele’s dossier were being turned in to the bureau from the strangest of places. Baker said he had even heard about it from David Corn, Washington bureau chief of left-leaning Mother Jones, who wrote one of the first pieces on the dossier, in October 2016. But in one of those company-town connections that happen frequently in Washington, Baker said he was not just a contact or source for Corn; they were also old pals.

“Tell me about your relationship with David Corn,” said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan.

“David is a friend of mine,” Baker said.

“Tell me about that. A close friend? Long-time friend?”

“Long-time friend.”

Jordan asked, “When did you first meet Mr. Corn?”

“I don't specifically remember,” Baker testified. “A long time ago, though.”

“Years ago? “

“Years and years and years ago, yeah,” Baker allowed. “Our kids carpooled together. We carpooled with them when our kids were little.”

So one of the most divisive scandals in Washington history was facilitated by an unexpected friendship, an odd couple brought together by a shared interest in getting their kids dropped off at school.

The congressman from Ohio wanted to know more about the Baker-Corn relationship: “Prior to the election of – Presidential election of 2016,” Jordan asked, “how many times did you talk with David Corn in the weeks and months prior to election day?”

“I don't remember,” Baker said, providing an answer that suggests it was more than a few.

“Is it fair to say you did” talk with Corn, Jordan asked?

“Yes, I did, but I just don't remember how many [times].”

“So did you talk to Mr. Corn about anything that the FBI was working on,” Jordan asked, “specifically the now infamous Steele dossier?”

Suddenly, Baker’s lawyer, Dan Levin, jumped in: “One second,” he said before he and his client had a conversation off the record.

When the microphones were back on, Levin declared he would “not let [Baker] answer these questions right now. You may or may not know, he's been the subject of a leak investigation which is still – a criminal leak investigation that's still active at the Justice Department.” And so Levin concluded, “I’m sorry. I'm cutting off any discussion about conversations with reporters.”

North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows wanted to make clear what Baker’s lawyer was claiming: “You're saying he's under criminal investigation? That's why you're not letting him answer?”

“Yes.”

Levin and the lawmakers sparred a bit over whether Baker was invoking his Fifth Amendment rights, and the congressmen finally got around to asking who was leading this criminal probe:

“There is an ongoing investigation by whom?” Jordan said.

“The Justice Department,” Levin responded.

“I mean, is the inspector general looking at this or is this—”

“No,” said Levin, “it's Mr. John Durham, a prosecutor.”

The specter of Durham haunts the rest of the interview. Baker can’t talk about what he told his old friend David Corn in their conversations about the dossier because it would put Baker in legal jeopardy.

Time and again, when Baker was asked questions about reporters – even hypothetical questions about FBI policy regarding contacts with the press, Levin said, “I'm not going to allow him to answer that question” or “I am not going let him answer any questions about leaks.”

“I don't want him talking about conversations he's had with reporters because I don't know what the questions are and I don't know what the answers are right now,” Levin said. “Given that there is an ongoing investigation of him for leaks which the Department has not closed, I'm not comfortable letting him answer questions.” Durham’s inquiry was serious enough to limit significantly what Baker was willing to talk about with lawmakers.

That Baker’s lawyer advised him not to talk about leaks is, of course, not proof that Baker leaked. ""Baker's lawyer was obviously being prudent and saying his client could not talk about anything related to any leaks of any kind,"" David Corn tells RealClearInvestigations. Corn emphasizes that the ""Durham inquiry did not involve Russia or the Steele memos; it had nothing to do with me or my limited interaction with Baker.""

And one former federal official who said he has been interviewed by Durham in connection with the Baker probe, Robert Litt, has written that the inquiry has nothing to do with the Steele dossier.

DHS Urges Cybersecurity Staff to ‘Deploy’ to Border Instead,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy-Woodruff Sam-Brodey', 'Betsy Woodruff', 'Sam Brodey']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-homeland-security-urges-cybersecurity-staff-to-deploy-to-border-instead,"The Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency—which also works to protect schools and places of worship—is urging staffers tasked with handling cyber threats to set their day jobs aside and go on mini-deployments to the U.S.-Mexico border after an earlier request from headquarters failed to recruit enough officials, according to an email obtained by The Daily Beast.

The effort to send more employees to the border comes amid concerns that the agency’s focus on the influx of migrants at the border is siphoning off DHS officials who should be handling other threats—especially to elections. DHS’s other components, including its intelligence arm, have also been asked to send volunteers to the border. It is unclear if those components have found enough volunteers to satisfy headquarters.

On Friday, the deputy director of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sent out an email asking employees to consider a “short-term deployment to the southern border,” ranging from 30 to 45 days, due to the “ongoing surge of migrants.”

“It is never easy to ask colleagues to take on extra challenges, but as DHS employees, serving the needs of the homeland is the cornerstone of what we do,” wrote Matthew Travis, CISA deputy director, to agency employees.

“If it is in your capacity to deploy, please give serious thought to volunteering,” he added.

Earlier this spring, top officials asked employees from all DHS entities to go volunteer at the border, according to a DHS official. The email went out because CISA is still working to send as many people as DHS headquarters has asked for, the official added. In other words, not enough CISA employees want to step away from their cybersecurity work to focus on border security—at least, not yet.

“As we have consistently said, the Department is considering all options to address the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border,” said Tyler Houlton, DHS acting assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement.

“We will continue to work with our workforce to find dynamic solutions and funding to address this very serious problem. As part of this effort, it is our responsibility to explore fiscal mechanisms that will ensure the safety and welfare of both our workforce and the migrant population, which is also reflected in the supplemental request submitted to Congress.”

Among the officials who were asked on Friday to assist the federal government at the border are those tasked with protecting the U.S. government’s cyber infrastructure — including election systems considered vulnerable in the run-up to 2020.

DHS also said the deployments will not hamper the department’s other work.

“DHS is fully capable of deploying more resources to address the crisis at our southern border while simultaneously maintaining our operational capabilities throughout the Department in order to carry out our mission to protect the American people,” said Houlton.

DHS has been urging its personnel who do not work for Customs and Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement to volunteer at the border because they say those agencies need additional assistance due to the flow of migrants from the south. Roughly 400 employees of the Transportation Security Administration, for example, are expected to arrive at the border soon.

But DHS has not offered many details on what specific responsibilities these employees will handle. With many migrants traveling in large groups and often with young children, agents are spending much of their time attending to children, DHS officials have said.

The Border Patrol chief, Carla Provost, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 8 that some agents are serving primarily as “child care professionals, medical caregivers, bus drivers and food service workers.”

Apprehensions of migrants at the southern border have reached a 13-year high. In the last two months, Border Patrol apprehended over 200,000 migrants; the total for April—109,000—is the highest number for a single month since 2007.

Trump administration officials are saying they do not have enough resources to handle the influx, and have requested an additional $4.5 billion for their operations from Congress. Democrats on Capitol Hill have signaled a willingness to fund humanitarian assistance at the border, but have scuttled other uses of funding, like increasing beds in ICE detention facilities."
"James Comey blasts AG Barr, accuses him of ‘sliming his own department’",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/james-comey-william-barr-sliming-department,"Former FBI Director James Comey ripped into Attorney General William Barr on Friday, accusing him of “sliming his own department” after Barr said that government power was used “to spy on American citizens.”

“The AG should stop sliming his own Department,” Comey tweeted. “If there are bad facts, show us, or search for them professionally and then tell us what you found.”

BILL BARR REVEALS RUSSIA PROBE REVIEW TO FOCUS ON TRUMP DOSSIER BRIEFING, LEAKER

“An AG must act like the leader of the Department of Justice, an organization based on truth,” he said. “Donald Trump has enough spokespeople.”

Comey did not specify what comments he was reacting to, but the tweet came after Barr gave interviews to Fox News and The Wall Street Journal about the investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, that he has tapped U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead.

Barr told Fox News that the investigation will cover the time period between Election Day and Inauguration Day, and he told Fox News’ Bill Hemmer that “some very strange developments” took place during that period.

Barr said the country must know “exactly what happened” with counterintelligence activities conducted during the 2016 election -- and he is determined to get to the bottom of the case.

“The first step is to find out exactly what happened, and we're trying to get our arms around that, getting all the relevant information from the various agencies and starting to talk to some of the people that have information,” Barr told Hemmer.

He also expressed concern about the role of the anti-Trump Steele dossier to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant against Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

“It’s a very unusual situation to have opposition research like that, especially one that, on its face, had a number of clear mistakes and in a somewhat jejune analysis,” Barr said. “And to, and to use that, take it to conduct counterintelligence against an American political campaign is a strange -- would be a strange development.”

He told The Wall Street Journal that the investigation could lead to rule changes for counterintelligence investigations of political campaigns.

“Government power was used to spy on American citizens,” he said. “I can’t imagine any world where we wouldn’t take a look and make sure that was done properly.”

“Just like we need to ensure that foreign actors don’t influence the outcome of our elections, we need to ensure that the government doesn’t use its powers to put a thumb on the scale,” he said.

Comey’s comments came just days after former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein accused the former FBI chief of being a “partisan pundit” and trampling on “bright lines that should never be crossed.”

""Now, the former director is a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul,"" Rosenstein said. ""That is disappointing. Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors. Generally, we base our opinions on eyewitness testimony.""

(CBS)- With the surge of asylum seekers, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol are now flying migrants from the Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas to cities across the country.

In San Diego on Friday, 100 migrants arrived for processing. It came one day after two south Florida counties were upset with a plan that would bring thousands of migrants there.

""We cannot accommodate in Florida just dumping unlawful migrants into our state,"" said Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""I think it'll tax our resources, the schools, healthcare, law enforcement, state agencies.""

CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and the White House, but neither has responded.

Florida officials have been told to expect two plane loads of migrants each week, up to 1,000 people a month, split between Palm Beach and Broward counties. Both are Democratic strongholds. The migrants do not face criminal charges but would likely be released into the community awaiting immigration hearings.

CBS News reporting found that 80% of the beds at the nation's largest detention center for immigrant families in Dilley, Texas were empty last month. But Brian Hastings, chief of law enforcement operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they're overwhelmed.

""The crisis at hand is causing us to look at multiple different locations where we have capacity to process, to fly these individuals to, simply so we can process them into the system,"" Hastings said.

Florida has no designated shelters or government funding for food and security. Officials there have been told to expect migrants in about two weeks.

Steven Mnuchin Refuses to Comply With Subpoena for Trump’s Tax Returns,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Alan Rappeport', 'Nicholas Fandos']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/us/politics/mnuchin-trump-tax-returns-subpoena.html,"“For the same reasons, we are unable to provide the requested information in response to the committee’s subpoena,” Mr. Mnuchin said.

Mr. Mnuchin was widely expected to ignore the subpoena, as Mr. Trump has vowed to fight all subpoenas from House Democrats. The Treasury secretary has warned that allowing House Democrats to retrieve the president’s tax returns would open the door to lawmakers from both parties politicizing the Internal Revenue Service in the future.

At a Senate hearing this week, Mr. Mnuchin said that House Democrats were trying to “weaponize” the I.R.S. He said that he had not yet decided how he would respond to the subpoena, but that “you can guess which way we are leaning.” He said that the judiciary, as the third branch of government, would most likely need to settle the dispute between Congress and the executive branch, signaling the potential for a protracted court fight.

House Democrats have been weighing how to respond to the Trump administration’s defiance of congressional subpoenas. On Friday, Mr. Neal made clear his preference for avoiding retaliatory threats, to the disappointment of several of his more liberal colleagues.

Mr. Neal told reporters that he saw little value in trying to hold Mr. Mnuchin or Charles P. Rettig, the I.R.S. commissioner, in contempt of Congress. Instead, he said, he would go straight to the courts to try to enforce his subpoena, potentially as soon as next week. The case could take months or years to resolve."
State Department reveals Nicaraguan police killed imprisoned US citizen,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-department-reveals-nicaraguan-police-killed-imprisoned-us-citizen,"In a statement released on Saturday, the Department of State revealed U.S. citizen Eddy Montes, 57, died while in prison in Nicaragua.

""We vehemently condemn the killing of Mr. Montes. His death, the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians at the hands of [Nicaraguan President Daniel] Ortega’s security and parapolice forces, and the continued detention of hundreds more political prisoners demonstrate the regime’s utter disregard for human life and democratic freedoms,"" spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said.

""We call for an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation of Montes’ death. We reiterate our call for the unconditional release of all political prisoners. The United States will hold accountable the Ortega regime and Nicaraguan security forces involved in human rights abuses and violations,"" she said.

According to the State Department, there are more than 500 political prisoners in jail under Ortega's leadership.

""The U.S. government continues to stand with the Nicaraguan people in their ongoing struggle to restore respect for human rights and democratic governance in their country,"" Ortagus said.

The Asociated Press reports Montes was a dual citizen of the U.S. and Nicaragua who had served in the U.S. Navy. He had returned to the country to protest for reform.

Nicaraguan authorities accused the inmates of causing ""a serious disturbance."" Attorney Yonarqui Martínez said Montes was shot in the back.

Kevin Sullivan, U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua, said there needs to be a full investigation into Montes' death.

Prior recalled how Comey held a press conference in July 2016 to speak about the Clinton email investigation.

He said Mueller similarly gave a ""laundry list of facts and evidence"" in the obstruction of justice half of his investigation into Trump, but stopped short of offering an ""indictment or... a conclusion.""

Prior pointed to Attorney General William Barr telling host Bill Hemmer that he was ""surprised"" that Mueller's report offered no recommendation on the charge of obstruction.

"Biden shows early strength, but pitfalls loom in 2020 U.S. presidential race",https://www.reuters.com,"['James Oliphant', 'Min Read']",05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden/biden-shows-early-strength-but-pitfalls-loom-in-2020-us-presidential-race-idUSKCN1SN112,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has shown surprising strength in the first three weeks of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, prompting a persistent question: Can anyone stop him?

Biden holds a significant lead in opinion polls over the 23 other Democratic contenders. Republican President Donald Trump is treating him like his top threat in 2020.

Ahead of his formal campaign kickoff on Saturday at an outdoor rally in Philadelphia, Biden, 76, has seemingly put to rest doubts about his age and his ability to raise money as well as questions over whether he is out of step with the Democratic Party.

“The rest of the race now revolves around Joe Biden,” said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic operative who is not aligned with the campaign.

But traps may lie ahead. The first major opportunity for Biden’s competitors to dent his lead comes next month in the first of a dozen Democratic presidential debates.

Biden could find himself as the leading target of attacks, particularly from progressives. He also has a history of gaffes, something that could be problematic in the national spotlight.

“I’ve long said Joe Biden’s best days will be the beginning of this campaign,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the progressive advocacy group Democracy for America.

According to Real Clear Politics, Biden is backed by about 40% of the Democratic electorate on average in opinion polls, giving him more than a 20 percentage-point lead over his nearest challenger, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

Experienced presidential strategists told Reuters that while they expect some other Democrats to eventually become top contenders, Biden’s strength is likely sustainable.

They cited two main factors: The massive Democratic field makes it difficult for any one candidate to stand out, and voters tend to be risk-averse when seeking a candidate to topple a sitting president.

FAR AFIELD

In recent elections, early front-runners such as Democrat Al Gore, himself a former vice president, in 2000 and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 largely kept a lock on the nomination, despite some bumps along the way.

In 2008, Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton was overtaken by Barack Obama to secure the nomination, but Obama took advantage of a relatively small field to steadily amass support as the top alternative to Clinton. When Clinton ran again in 2016, Sanders tried to do the same thing with a similarly small field and almost succeeded.

That becomes exponentially harder with the 2020 scrum, with its 20-plus candidates all vying for attention and money. Trippi said more than a dozen Democrats trying to challenge Biden have consulted Trippi on strategy.

“I’ve told every single one of them that Joe Biden is going to be more formidable than they thought, and it was going to be tough for anyone to emerge from this field,” he said.

Biden also is aided by the perception among some voters that he may be a safer choice to take on Trump than a less-known politician.

In the 2004 primary, Democrat John Kerry, a longtime party fixture with a strong national-security background, used that argument to wrest the nomination from Howard Dean, like Sanders an upstart progressive from Vermont.

Robert Shrum, Kerry’s top strategist at the time, said Democrats began to panic at the thought of running Dean against Republican President George W. Bush.

Which candidate could beat Bush became “the defining question,” Shrum said.

AVOIDING LANDMINES

Shrum cautioned, however, the 2020 race could still shift. Biden would be the oldest president ever elected, and he will need to “seem vigorous and energetic” at the debates, Shrum said.

“This is a dynamic process,” Shrum said. “It is not frozen in amber. A lot depends on his conduct.”

Biden, who spent 40 years in the U.S. Senate and two terms as Obama’s vice president, must also defend his record to progressive voters who view him as too moderate.

In the past week alone, Biden has been challenged over his stance on combating climate change and his support for the 1990s crime bill, which is viewed by critics as leading to mass incarceration of African-Americans.

“When we get to that whites-of-their-eyes stage of the campaign and candidates realize the only way to improve their market share is to take Biden head-on, that’s when the real test begins,” said Kevin Madden, a former top aide to Romney.

Those tensions within the party could lead to some tough stretches for Biden, despite his current position. In 2012, Romney was the early front-runner, only to yield to challengers such as Rick Perry and Rick Santorum at different times before finally re-asserting himself as the favorite.

Madden said Romney’s campaign made hats with the slogan “The Long Slog” for a reason.

“No one is going to give you the nomination,” he said, “and every other candidate has a plan to take it away from you.”"
Washington Post: Acting Homeland Security chief threatened to leave over Stephen Miller,https://www.cnn.com,['Caroline Kelly'],05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/17/politics/wapo-miller-mcaleenan-clash/index.html,"(CNN) Acting Homeland Security Director Kevin McAleenan threatened to step down this week if he did not get more authority over his agency in response to another attempt by White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller to dictate agency hiring, The Washington Post reported Friday.

The clash highlights yet another instance of Miller causing tension with his far-reaching influence as a counselor on immigration matters to President Donald Trump.

The private confrontation centered on Miller's advice to Trump that he should pick Mark Morgan -- whom Trump has named to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- for commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, and keep current acting ICE Director Matthew Albence in his role, the paper reported.

Three Trump administration officials told the Post that McAleenan informed senior White House officials that he, not Miller, leads the department and that he should have at least a hand in departmental hiring choices. McAleenan met with acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, the officials said. One Trump aide described the internal turmoil surrounding the issue as akin to an ""immigration knife fight.""

Three Homeland Security officials told the Post that Morgan will begin as acting ICE director next week, while Albence will return to his role as deputy director of the agency -- a win for McAleenan.

Nellie Ohr deleted emails sent from husband's DOJ account,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nellie-ohr-deleted-emails-sent-from-husbands-doj-account,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, told her husband she was deleting emails sent from his government account.

The revelation comes as both Ohrs remain under intense scrutiny for their ties to Fusion GPS and British ex-spy Christopher Steele, the author of the anti-Trump dossier that was used to obtain warrants to wiretap a member of President Trump's 2016 campaign.

Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained a series of April 2016 emails from a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Justice Department that show a correspondence between the Ohrs, an aide to Bruce Ohr named Lisa Holtyn, and Stefan Bress, a first secretary at the German Embassy.

They discussed setting up a dinner for the German delegation as well as a meeting to discuss Russian organized crime. Included in a proposed agenda is the “Impact of Russian influence operations in Europe (‘PsyOps/InfoWar’).”

On April 20, responding to the email thread with the subject line, “Analyst Russian Organized Crime – April 2016,"" came the email from Nellie Ohr about deleting the emails. ""Thanks! I’m deleting these emails now,"" she said.

Bruce Ohr was an associate deputy attorney general and director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force while his wife Nellie was an independent contractor and Russia specialist.

Emails previously released by Judicial Watch show Bruce Ohr acting as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Nellie Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS.

Both Ohrs testified last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election. This month, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a criminal referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Nellie Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" to lawmakers.

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said that Nellie Ohr informing her husband about deleting the emails indicates a pattern of covering up a plot against Trump. “This email is disturbing and suggests documents relevant to the improper targeting of President Trump were destroyed,” Fitton said in a statement."

The Russia investigation and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report continue to be debated by Republicans and Democrats since its release last month.

In an interview that aired on Fox News Thursday, Barr explained that he is trying to get to the bottom of whether or not “government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale” during the early stages of the Russia probe.

Seth Moulton, D-Mass., voiced his opposition to the Department of Veterans Affairs' resistance to allow veterans to use medical cannabis.

Moulton, a Marine Corps infantry veteran, said fellow veterans use cannabis in order to not get addicted to opioids, which the widespread use of has led to overdoses across the country.

""We talk to each other because none of my friends can talk about cannabis with their doctors at the VA. Despite the fact that cannabis is either legal or decriminalized in more than half the states in the country, they might lose their VA benefits if they do,"" Moulton said.

""Veterans seeking cannabis aren’t druggies. Many are American heroes who deserve a VA that researches cannabis and protects veterans from opioids using any method that’s safe. Federal drug laws currently prevent researchers from figuring that out,"" he said. ""It’s time for change.""

Moulton pointed to the three bills he introduced with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., that will protect veterans who are using cannabis from losing their benefits, direct the VA to conduct a survey of veterans and VA healthcare providers to learn more about how many veterans are using cannabis and why, and expand access to educational resources so VA doctors can learn more about medical cannabis.

""Ultimately, making the VA a place where veterans can discuss and maybe someday access cannabis, will help our country evolve on this issue too,"" Moulton said, hoping making medical cannabis accessible to veterans will lead to more decriminalization of marijuana across the country."

WASHINGTON — Federal investigators concluded in a report Thursday that Scott Pruitt had spent nearly $124,000 on “excessive” travel arrangements as head of the Environmental Protection Agency and recommended that the agency try to recover the money.

The report, issued by the E.P.A.’s inspector general, brings to a close a nearly two-year investigation into Mr. Pruitt’s travel. It found that 40 trips or planned trips that were later canceled during 10 months starting in March 2017, the time frame of the investigation, had cost taxpayers a total of more than $985,000.

About 82 percent of that was for first-class and business-class airfare, and 16 of the trips involved stops in Tulsa, Okla., where Mr. Pruitt owned a home. The expenses also included a $629-per-night hotel room in Italy. Many of the trips were approved by agency officials retroactively after Mr. Pruitt’s travel.

Of the total cost, inspectors concluded that $123,942 had been spent “without sufficient justification and, initially, without appropriate approval authority.”"
CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/723568597/cfpb-chief-says-education-department-is-blocking-student-loan-oversight,"CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Trump administration's Education Department is getting in the way of efforts to police the student loan industry. The revelation, in a letter obtained by NPR, comes at the same time that lawsuits allege that widespread wrongdoing by student loan companies is costing some borrowers thousands of dollars.

CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger explained the problem in an April letter responding to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers about whether the federal regulator had ""abandoned its supervision and enforcement activities"" related to more than $1 trillion in student loans.

A central issue is that companies that manage student loans, known as student loan servicers, are refusing to share information that the CFPB says it needs to perform proper oversight.

""Since December 2017,"" Kraninger wrote in the letter, ""student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations"" related to federal student loans.

She said servicers are not sharing the information because the Department of Education has issued guidance telling them not to do so, citing ""privacy"" concerns. Kraninger also said that information from student loan servicers is ""necessary for supervisory examinations.""

The letter is a carefully worded response to senators' questions. But Kraninger, a Trump administration appointee, is in essence saying that the CFPB is trying to do its job protecting student borrowers and supervising loan servicing companies, but the Education Department is getting in the way.

""It's actually quite remarkable,"" says Seth Frotman, executive director of the nonprofit Student Borrower Protection Center. ""The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is telling the world that the secretary of education has put in place a series of policies that are obstructing federal law enforcement officials from standing up for the millions of Americans with student debt.""

Frotman used to be the CFPB's student loan ombudsman but quit last summer over frustrations with the Trump administration. In a scathing resignation letter last August, he said the Trump administration was ""turning its back on student borrowers"" and preventing him from doing his job.

Now Kraninger, the administration's hand-picked director for the bureau, is pointing the finger, albeit in a less dramatic way, at the Education Department for hindering efforts to protect student borrowers.

In response to Kraninger's letter, Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, and three other Democratic senators called the revelations ""disturbing"" in a round of letters they fired off this week to loan servicing companies.

The lawmakers say in their letters that since Kraninger says the CFPB has attempted to get documents it needs for supervision and been rebuffed by the servicers, that ""reveals that the Department under Secretary DeVos, has removed the most potent weapon from the CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers, and that federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' requests for information.""

The senators' letters add that no ""guidance"" from the Department of Education ""can absolve servicers of their legal responsibility to comply with state and federal consumer protection law.""

Student borrowers getting hurt

When Jessica Saint-Paul heard about a program called Public Service Loan Forgiveness, she was ecstatic. For borrowers who work in qualifying public service jobs — such as police officers, government workers, people who work at nonprofit organizations — the program promises that if they make loan payments for 10 years, the remainder of their student debt will be forgiven. Saint-Paul had about $80,000 in student loans and she wasn't making much money working for a nonprofit that provides services to foster children.

""I was just like, 'Oh, this is perfect,' "" Saint-Paul says. So she called the company that was servicing her student loans and says she was told she was all set — after 10 years, she should be eligible to get her loans forgiven. That was nine years ago.

Saint-Paul said she called back over the years, including once when she changed nonprofit jobs in 2014, to say, ""just making sure I'm on track."" She says she was told, "" 'OK, no problem.' The conversation was quick; they were so kind.""

The call center workers might have been friendly, but Saint-Paul says she was getting bad information. She says she found that out just last year at a conference she attended. There was an information session on loan forgiveness, and she was told she was in the wrong kind of loan and wrong payment plan so she couldn't qualify. She says many other people were finding out the same thing alongside her at the conference.

""It was like a support group almost it turned into because people were like, 'No, that can't be true,' "" Saint-Paul says. ""I went on my phone, people were on their laptops checking what kind of loan they were in. We were all sitting there just frantic.""

Saint-Paul says that if nine years ago her loan servicer had just told her to convert to the right loan and payment plan, everything would have been OK. Instead, she says she feels as though someone stole tens of thousands of dollars from her.

""I just cannot believe this happened to me,"" she says. ""That's like criminal, it's not right.""

Many people agree that it's not right — regulators and advocacy groups are filing a growing number of lawsuits against loan servicing companies alleging mishandling of the loan forgiveness program. Saint-Paul is a plaintiff in one of them.

Many of the consumer complaints and lawsuits involve allegations that servicing companies gave borrowers bad information or advice that resulted in them thinking they were getting credit toward loan forgiveness, when in fact they were in the wrong loan or payment plan.

The Education Department revealed late last year that about 99% of borrowers who thought they had reached that 10-year milestone and applied for forgiveness were rejected. More than 1 million people are actively pursuing loan forgiveness under the program and hoping to qualify.

That's why Democratic lawmakers say they want to make sure that perhaps the most powerful watchdog — the CFPB — is on top of all this.

Fears that the watchdog has been asleep

Since 2011, the CFPB has monitored loan servicers, lenders and complaints from student borrowers and brought enforcement actions when it discovered wrongdoing. For example, the CFPB in 2015 returned $480 million to allegedly defrauded students of Corinthian Colleges.

In 2017, the CFPB brought a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest student loan servicers, Navient. The bureau said Navient ""created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information, processing payments incorrectly, and failing to act when borrowers complained. Through shortcuts and deception, the company also illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans."" That lawsuit is ongoing.

Navient disputes the allegations in the CFPB lawsuit and other suits brought by state regulators. ""The allegations made in the claims are unfounded, and we are vigorously defending our record in court,"" a Navient spokesman says.

But since Richard Cordray, the bureau's Obama-era director, stepped down in November 2017, consumer advocates have been worried that the Trump-appointed interim director, Mick Mulvaney, and now the permanent director, Kraninger, have backed away from protecting student borrowers.

But in her letter, Kraninger said the consumer protection bureau takes that job seriously.

""As with all industries subject to the Bureau's supervisory or enforcement authority, the Bureau will continue to monitor those subject to its authority — in this case, student lenders and student loan servicers — to ensure they are complying with the law,"" she wrote.

At the same time, Kraninger also explained that the Education Department has created obstacles that are getting in the way of the CFPB doing its job. In addition to the guidance to student loan servicers that is impeding oversight efforts, back in 2017, the Trump administration's Education Department ended information sharing agreements that it had with the CFPB. In her letter, Kraninger said an information-sharing agreement (called a Memorandum of Understanding) is required under law and it is ""a priority"" for the bureau to get a new one in place.

Some advocates say the CFPB should do more than acknowledge such problems in a letter to lawmakers. Frotman, of the Student Borrower Protection Center, says the bureau has broad powers to compel student loan servicing companies to turn over the information it needs about student loans and student borrowers.

""I think just identifying this fact is of little solace to student loan borrowers who desperately need the help of a consumer financial watchdog that is supposed to be independent,"" Frotman says. He says he'd like to see Kraninger more directly demand that the Education Department change its guidance to loan servicers and tell them to cooperate with regulators. The CFPB could also take loan servicers to court to get the information it needs., Frotman says.

In a statement to NPR, the CFPB said: ""The Bureau continues to supervise the student loan market, as well as taking action against those who fail to comply with the law."" And the bureau says it is confident it can resolve the issues to achieve its mission of protecting borrowers.

But for its part the Education Department appears to be defending its stance — that loan servicers not hand over information to the CFPB. The department says in a statement that it takes privacy seriously along with the need to ""protect customers' personal data."" It says requests for information about student loan borrowers should be made to the department.

State regulators also say Education Department impeding oversight

Last month, 21 state attorneys general sent Education Secretary Betsy DeVos a letter calling on her to ""reverse the limitations"" the department has placed on student loan servicing companies sharing information with state law enforcement agencies.

The attorneys general said ""student loan information is vital to our efforts to protect consumers from illegal, unfair, abusive, or deceptive practices by actors in the higher education industry, in which the Department historically has been an important partner. However, the Department's policy reversal impedes states' ability to enforce the law and shields unprincipled industry actors from regulatory enforcement, harming student loan borrowers nationwide.""

The industry group the Student Loan Servicing Alliance told NPR in a statement, ""As contractors of the Department of Education which owns its federal student loan data, federal servicers must follow federal law and ED guidance on disclosure and data sharing.""

Why not just share the information?

It's not clear why the department is blocking state and federal regulators from getting information from servicers to do oversight presumably aimed at protecting the rights of student borrowers.

Jason Delisle, a fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, says there may be a turf war going on here. Even if a particular student loan program has problems, Delisle says the department may feel, ""this is our program and we're designing it the way we want to design it and we're running it the way we want to run it."" And Delisle says if there are problems the department may feel it can sort them out by itself.

Frotman says that's not the issue. He says the Education Department may not like having regulators looking into alleged wrongdoing within the companies managing its loan programs, but ""this isn't about reasonable disagreements, it is about following the law versus obstructing law enforcement."""
"Dispute erupts over whether Brennan, Comey pushed Steele dossier, as DOJ probe into misconduct begins",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dispute-erupts-over-whether-brennan-comey-pushed-steele-dossier-as-doj-probe-into-misconduct-begins,"A high-level dispute over which senior government officials pushed the unverified Steele dossier amid efforts to surveil the Trump campaign has broken out into the open again, after it emerged that Attorney General William Barr appointed a U.S. attorney to examine the origins of the Russia investigation and determine if the FBI and DOJ's actions were ""lawful and appropriate.""

Sources familiar with the records told Fox News that a late-2016 email chain indicated then-FBI Director James Comey told bureau subordinates that then-CIA Director John Brennan insisted the dossier be included in the intelligence community assessment on Russian interference, known as the ICA.

Fox News was told that the email chain – not yet public -- referred to the dossier as ""crown material,"" but it was not clear why this apparent code was used. On Tuesday night, former GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy said on Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" that ""Comey has a better argument than Brennan, based on what I've seen.""

A day earlier, Gowdy told Fox News, ""Whoever is looking into this, tell them to look into emails"" from December 2016 involving Brennan and Comey. Gowdy, who is now a Fox News contributor, said his assessment was based on sensitive Russia records he reviewed as then-chairman of the Republican-led House Oversight Committee.

But in a statement to Fox News, a former CIA official put the blame squarely on Comey.

""Former Director Brennan, along with former [Director of National Intelligence] James Clapper, are the ones who opposed James Comey’s recommendation that the Steele Dossier be included in the intelligence report,"" the official said.

""They opposed this because the dossier was in no way used to develop the ICA,"" the official continued. ""The intelligence analysts didn't include it when they were doing their work because it wasn't corroborated intelligence, therefore it wasn't used and it wasn't included. Brennan and Clapper prevented it from being added into the official assessment. James Comey then decided on his own to brief Trump about the document.""

Fox News has reached out to Comey's legal team twice, and provided the statement from the former CIA official, but did not receive a reply on the record.

In March, Republican Sen. Rand Paul leveled similar allegations on Twitter, citing a ""high-level source"" who said Brennan had ""insisted that the unverified and fake Steele dossier"" be included in the January 2017 ICA.

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INTERNAL FBI TEXTS SHOW DOJ WARNED FBI OF 'BIAS' IN KEY FISA SOURCE -- BUT FBI PRESSED ON

Clapper previously testified that the dossier was not ultimately used in the ICA. News that Comey had briefed Trump personally on the dossier before the inauguration -- purportedly to warn him of potential blackmail threats -- leaked within days and opened the door for media outlets to publicize the dossier's lurid claims.

Whether the FBI acted appropriately in obtaining the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to Trump campaign aide Carter Page is now the subject not only of U.S. Attorney John Durham's new probe, but also the ongoing review by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber has been conducting his own investigation separately, although details of his progress were unclear.

As one example, in its FISA application, the bureau repeatedly and incorrectly assured the court in a footnote that it ""does not believe"" British ex-spy Christopher Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion, and instead asserted that the Yahoo article provided an independent basis to believe Steele.

Steele has told a British court that he briefed multiple news organizations during the fall of 2016 -- including Yahoo News.

Gowdy's remarks echoed Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" this past weekend that he was pushing to declassify documents that would expose the FBI's poor efforts to corroborate the dossier.



""There's a document that's classified that I'm gonna try to get unclassified that takes the dossier -- all the pages of it -- and it has verification to one side,"" Graham said. ""There really is no verification, other than media reports that were generated by reporters that received the dossier.""

Graham cited a report from The Hill's John Solomon that the FBI was told expressly that Steele, the bureau's confidential informant, had admitted to a State Department contact he was ""keen"" to leak his discredited dossier for purposes of influencing the 2016 election.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec’s written account of her meeting with Steele on Oct. 11, 2016, was sent to the FBI prior to the bureau's FISA warrant application to monitor Page, according to records unearthed in a transparency lawsuit by Citizens United.

The Senate on Thursday confirmed Jeffrey Rosen to replace embattled Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, despite Democratic criticism he wasn’t ready for the job.

The Senate voted 52-45 to confirm Rosen, along party lines.

Story Continued Below

Rosenstein, who left the Department of Justice last week, oversaw special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election until the investigation was handed off to Attorney General William Barr. It's unlikely Rosen will have any role in overseeing Mueller since Barr is in charge of the probe.

Rosen is currently deputy Transportation secretary. He was general counsel at the Department of Transportation and at the Office of Management and Budget under President George W. Bush. He also worked at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis where he overlapped briefly with Barr.

Prior to the vote, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) praised Rosen for a “rock-solid legal reputation."" Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who introduced Rosen to the Senate Judiciary Committee at his confirmation hearing, said Rosen has ""the experience skills and the temperament we want in a deputy attorney general.""

But Rosen faced opposition from Senate Democrats, who criticized him for not having worked at the Justice Department and for lacking experience as a prosecutor.

“We need a Deputy Attorney General who knows the Justice Department,,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said in a statement after Rosen's confirmation. “Mr. Rosen simply does not have the qualifications for this critical assignment.”

President Donald Trump nominated Rosen to replace Rosenstein in February."

Interior published four months' worth of Bernhardt’s schedules to its website on Thursday, a day after he appeared before the House Natural Resources Committee.

While some entries released by the agency list the names of attendees at meetings, others only describe him as having a scheduled ""external meeting."" ADVERTISEMENT

One House Democrat called the Trump Cabinet member's schedules a ""fake calendar.""

Huffman, a member of the Natural Resources Committee, added, “This fake calendar only has details if something is politically useful - e.g. 'meeting w/ youth group.' How dumb does he think we are?”

Interior, when asked to respond to criticism of the entries, sent a letter from March 26 addressed to House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) explaining how the office maintains Bernhardt’s calendar.

Bernhardt’s calendars have been an ongoing source of criticism for the department. House Democrats have raised questions over whether the department’s use of Google Docs to maintain his calendar complies with recordkeeping laws.

Interior has offered conflicting information about how Bernhardt’s schedule is maintained, but in April acknowledged that some meetings with industry representatives were intentionally left off his calendar.

Aaron Weiss, deputy director at The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, argued that “it’s not an accident that they waited until the day after his hearing” to share the calendars.

“They’re playing a shell game with Bernhardt’s calendar to still have to avoid saying publicly what he’s working on and who he’s meeting with,” he said.

Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents,https://www.npr.org,['Jessica Taylor'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/722230017/another-rule-trump-could-break-primary-challengers-doom-incumbent-presidents,"Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Eisen/Getty Images Scott Eisen/Getty Images

An incumbent president with a middling approval rating and mounting controversies is usually an easy draw for primary challengers.

Look to Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. All three presidents survived intraparty battles, but those primary fights left their reelection campaigns so hobbled — exposing longstanding weaknesses with their bases — that each went on to lose out on four more years in the White House.

But even if a viable GOP challenger to President Trump does emerge, it's unlikely he or she could make much headway or have a lasting impact on the president's chances in November. That's because Trump's firm grasp on the Republican Party could help him emerge not only victorious, but relatively unscathed by a primary challenge.

Political polarization is higher than ever, according to Princeton University professor of history and public affairs Julian Zelizer. And the slice of the electorate that likes Trump isn't budging, no matter what the president may say or do. Meanwhile, those who don't like him are resolute in their disdain, leaving a smaller block of persuadable voters than there were in previous elections.

""Trump has essentially remade the Republican Party in his image,"" said Zelizer. ""So many people aren't going to believe anything that the Mueller report says, and they take whatever Trump says as gospel. That just to me is another stumbling block that you probably didn't have in a post-Watergate era.""

In 1976, President Gerald Ford was already in a debilitated position. The Republican was an incumbent that had never been elected president (or even vice president) and was uniquely challenged in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon's resignation and his own subsequent controversial pardon of Nixon. So it's not surprising former California Gov. Ronald Reagan mounted a near-upset bid against him.

During the primaries, momentum swung back and forth between the two GOP candidates. The first ballot of voting at the 1976 Republican National Convention was razor-thin: 1,187 delegates for Ford and 1,070 for Reagan, just a 117 vote difference. But Ford did narrowly clear the 1,130 delegates needed to secure the nomination. Such a fractious ending would prove prescient months later as he lost to former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, netting 240 electoral votes to the Democrat's 297.

Four years later amid a sagging economy and the hostage crisis in Iran, Carter himself would be hamstrung as he sought a second term. Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose brothers had both sought the presidency, saw an opening. But despite strong numbers at the outset of the primary, Kennedy would peter out as his personal scandals surfaced and Carter simply out-organized him. Their fight would continue through 1980 Democratic convention though, where Kennedy, having finished with just over a third of the primary votes, admitted he couldn't win.

The famous not-really-a-concession speech Kennedy gave at the New York City convention laid out his own idealistic vision rather than trying to boost Carter.

""For me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end,"" the political scion told the crowd. ""For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on. The cause endures. The hope still lives. And the dream shall never die.""

As a result, it was Kennedy who got the raucous applause and seemed like the hero of the 1980 DNC, not the incumbent president who had actually won the nomination. Facing a renewed Reagan in the general election, Carter was walloped, winning just 49 electoral votes to the Republican's 489.

Perhaps it's President George H.W. Bush's re-election battle that best foreshadowed the era of Trump. The former vice president and CIA director saw sky high approval numbers in the aftermath of the Gulf War. But the economy would slow, giving conservative commentator Pat Buchanan a divide he could exploit by waging a bid based on fighting the ""culture wars.""

Buchanan would falter and end up taking less than a quarter of the primary vote away from Bush, and billionaire Ross Perot running as an independent in the general election also deeply harmed the incumbent's chances. But there was an anti-establishment vein within the GOP Buchanan may have helped awaken. It might have taken decades to fully manifest, but many saw Trump as the eventual embodiment of what Buchanan helped to shape.

History doesn't always repeat itself

Trump seems to have a stronghold on his party that no candidate can shake. As Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center put it, Trump has simply proven, time and time again, ""that all previous rules do not apply.""

""When we look back at the lessons of history, they may repeat themselves, but they haven't so far,"" Perry said. ""He may get a challenge by either a strong gadfly or a strong personality or a strong presence in the party,"" just as Ronald Reagan was to Ford in 1976 and Ted Kennedy was to Carter in 1980. ""But I don't see that person on the horizon.""

There are some possible challengers emerging to Trump, but Perry is right that less than nine months before the nominating process begins, no Republican has stood out as a formidable alternative.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld is the only major announced candidate so far after running for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016 along with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. But Weld certainly doesn't seem to have the heft of past White House challengers that could irrevocably damage a sitting president.

Some of the potential heavyweights who are still mulling bids include former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who also sought the GOP nomination last time, and popular centrist Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who's already made some early state moves.

Frequent Trump agitators like former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and former Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker were also floated early on. Flake has since ruled out a 2020 run, but the recently retired Corker still sounds open, saying recently that Trump ""purposely seeks to divide"" the American people and someone should challenge him.

""Philosophically, you could look at it and say that it would be a good thing for our country should that occur,"" Corker said during the TIME 100 Summit last month. ""If you had a real primary, where you had someone that was really being listened to, and of substance, things that we were talking about — and I could go through a list of them — they would actually be debated in a real way.""

There might once have been other names on that list — prominent 2016 doubters like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham or former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Despite their blistering criticism almost four years ago toward the polarizing reality TV show host and businessman, they too have come around and been loyal allies of Trump in the case of Graham, or a onetime part of his administration, with Haley serving as UN ambassador until last year.

The president's poll numbers reflect the waning influence of the once vocal critics may have had within the party — winning over converts, even if he may have polarized more independent voters.

The most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey shows a staggering 90 percent of Republicans approve of the job Trump has done, leaving little room for a challenger to grab a foothold. And for now, there's no GOP option who seems like they could truly compete with Trump, given the unprecedented way he has tried to centralize the Republican National Committee around his re-election bid and ward off a primary challenge.

Tribalism is a force that Corker also lamented, saying at the TIME event that Trump ""has an unusually visceral contact with the Republican base as it's made up today... That's in some ways where the electorate is today, where it has become very tribal in nature."""

The justices are poised to hear the Second Amendment case next term, and it will be the first substantive gun rights cases the court has heard since Justice Antonin Scalia's landmark opinion in 2008 holding that the Constitution protects an individual's right to keep a gun at home and a follow up case in 2010.

Since those opinions came down, the court has declined to take up several other follow up cases to the frustration of gun-rights supporters.

Supporters of gun rights fear that the Supreme Court may have decided to weigh in now because Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation last year solidified a 5-4 conservative majority.

"US non-essential personnel ordered to leave Iraq Embassy, consulate",https://www.foxnews.com,['Brie Stimson'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/state-department-orders-all-non-essential-personnel-to-leave-iraq,"The State Department has ordered all non-emergency personnel at the U.S. Embassy and consulate in Iraq to leave the country amid rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran.

The announcement was made in a security alert on its website early Wednesday morning. The alert also said that normal visa services would be temporarily suspended.

This comes amid a standoff between the U.S. and Iran, which has recently threatened to pull out of the nuclear deal and resume higher uranium enrichment if no new deal is put in place.

The move coincided with Germany's decision on Tuesday to suspend training of Iraqi soldiers due to tensions in the region, though the government indicated no specific threats to its own troops.

German Defense Ministry spokesman Jens Flosdorff says that Germany is “orienting itself toward our partner countries, which have taken this step.”

The country currently has about 160 German soldiers in Iraq as part of the fight against ISIS, about 60 of them at a base north of Baghdad where Iraqi forces are being trained.

IRANIAN PRESIDENTIAL AIDE SAYS TRUMP WILL 'GET A WAR' FOR LISTENING TO 'THE MUSTACHE' JOHN BOLTON

Trump warned Iran on Monday afternoon that it will “suffer greatly” if the country does “anything” in the form of an attack, a remark that came in the wake of revelations that U.S. military experts suggested “Iran or its proxies” damaged four commercial ships off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sunday.

This also came just days before the regime warned it easily could destroy a naval fleet sent by the United States in order to ward off a potential threat to U.S. commercial interests.

“Their billion[-dollar] fleet can be destroyed with one missile,” Ayatollah Tabatabai-Nejad said, according to Reuters.

“If they attempt any move, they will ... [face] dozens of missiles because at that time [government] officials won't be in charge to act cautiously, but instead things will be in the hands of our beloved leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,” he warned.

GEN. JACK KEANE SAYS REPORT TRUMP HAS UPDATED PLANS TO SEND 100,000 TROOPS TO IRAN IS 'DISTORTION OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENS'

Last week, U.S. officials said urgent ""credible threats"" from Iran against Americans were detected and the embassy advised against all travel to the region, citing “heightened tensions.”

The president denied Tuesday the reports that the administration was planning to send more than 100,000 troops to the region in the wake of the war with Iran, but adding, “Would I do that? Absolutely ... If we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo backed the president's claim, saying ""We fundamentally do not seek war with Iran, we’re looking for the regime to simply stop conducting assassination campaigns throughout Europe,” he said Tuesday in the seaside resort of Sochi, Russia.

Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also downplayed the escalation. Iran's state TV quoted Khamenei on Tuesday as calling negotiations with the U.S. ""poison"" and saying: ""This is not a military confrontation, because no war is going to happen.""

Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, said: ""Neither we, nor they are seeking war, they know that it is not to their benefit.""

Iranian state media reported Wednesday however that Khamenei followed up these remarks by saying it wouldn't be difficult for the Islamic Republic to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels amid rising tensions with the U.S., state media reported Wednesday.

"China's Huawei, 70 affiliates placed on U.S. trade blacklist",https://www.reuters.com,"['David Shepardson', 'Min Read']",05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huaweitech/chinas-huawei-70-affiliates-placed-on-us-trade-blacklist-idUSKCN1SL2W4,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday it is adding Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and 70 affiliates to its so-called “Entity List” - a move that bans the telecom giant from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.

U.S. officials told Reuters the decision would also make it difficult if not impossible for Huawei, the largest telecommunications equipment producer in the world, to sell some products because of its reliance on U.S. suppliers.

Under the order that will take effect in the coming days, Huawei will need a U.S. government license to buy American technology. Huawei did not immediately comment.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement President Donald Trump backed the decision that will “prevent American technology from being used by foreign owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.”

The dramatic move comes as the Trump administration has aggressively lobbied other countries not to use Huawei equipment in next-generation 5G networks and comes just days after the Trump administration imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods amid an escalating trade war.

The Commerce Department said the move comes after the U.S. Justice Department unsealed an indictment in January of Huawei and some entities that said the company had conspired to provide prohibited financial services to Iran. The department said it has a reasonable basis to conclude that Huawei is “engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest.”

Huawei reported first-quarter revenue of $27 billion last month and said it had shipped 59 million smartphones in the first quarter.

In March 2016, the Commerce Department added ZTE Corp to the entity list over allegations it organized an elaborate scheme to hide its re-export of U.S. items to sanctioned countries in violation of U.S. law.

The restrictions prevented suppliers from providing ZTE with U.S. equipment, potentially freezing the Huawei rival’s supply chain, but they were short-lived. The U.S. suspended the restrictions in a series of temporary reprieves, allowing the company to maintain ties to U.S. suppliers until it agreed to a plea deal a year later.

In August, Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government itself from using equipment from Huawei and ZTE.

Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican, said “Huawei’s supply chain depends on contracts with American companies” and he urged the Commerce Department to look “at how we can effectively disrupt our adversary.”"

House Democrats grilled Interior Secretary David Bernhardt about what his department is doing to address the causes and effects of climate change, noting that levels of carbon dioxide just hit their highest in human history.

His response? “I haven’t lost any sleep over it.”

The exchange is the latest escalation between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over what responsibility the Interior Department, which oversees more than 400 million acres of federal lands, bears in blunting a worldwide problem such as global warming. It came amid a barrage of legal citations from Democrats who claimed that current law compels the leader of the department to protect public lands from its impacts.

The remark came as Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) pressed Bernhardt about how concerned, on a scale of 1 to 10, he was about the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere eclipsing 415 parts per million, as recorded by the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.

“Okay, so you're a zero or a one, is that it?” Cartwright said in response.

Later in the hearing, Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) gave Bernhardt the chance to expand on his comment, saying that for climate scientists it is a “hair-on-fire crisis.”

“It’s one of those clips of testimony that will reverberate,” he said. “People will look back to what you said.”

Indeed, after the hearing, environmental groups shared widely on social media videos of Bernhardt's “sleep” comment.

In response, Bernhardt said: “I absolutely care that our climate is changing and that we need to factor that into our thinking. I absolutely believe that. And I've said that over and over and over.”

He noted that among developed nations, the United States is “number one” in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The hearing Wednesday in front of the House Natural Resources Committee, ostensibly to discuss the Trump administration's budget proposal for the department, was Bernhardt's second since being confirmed as interior secretary.

Last week in front of a House Appropriations subcommittee, Bernhardt punted the climate issue to Congress, telling members it was up to them to pass legislation compelling him to reduce emissions from public lands. Between 2005 and 2014, a quarter of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions came from the extracting and burning of fossil fuels from federal lands.

“There's no 'shalls,' "" Bernhardt said, referring to the word in law that indicates a legally binding requirement. “You guys come up with the 'shalls.' ""

In the intervening days, House Democrats had clearly dusted off law books.

During the hearing, Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) chided the Trump administration for rolling back an Obama-era rule that sought to limit the amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, released by oil and gas wells on the Bureau of Land Management lands.

And another Democrat, Mike Levin of California, rattled off four laws that, for example, compel the interior secretary to ensure that national parks are “unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations” and to “take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation” to BLM areas.

Bernhardt suggests the language in those laws did not direct him to do anything specific in response to climate change, such as stop leasing land for coal, oil or natural gas extraction.

“What I specifically said is you haven’t given me any direction to stop any particular activity,” he said.

John Leshy, interior solicitor under President Clinton, said that the legal language authorizing the government's land management programs is “necessarily general.”

“I give Bernhardt credit,” Leshy told The Post. “He's a wily guy.”

Leshy said Levin could also have mentioned the Endangered Species Act, which compels the interior secretary to use the “best available” science to determine whether a plant or animal is under threat of extinction.

On the dangers of climate change to biodiversity, he said, “the science is increasingly clear.”

At one point in yesterday's hearing, Democrats got Bernhardt to acknowledge that some laws — including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their actions — compel him to take climate change into account when managing lands.

“Certainly, NEPA would be one to them.”

Correction: The original version of this story referred to California Rep. Mike Levin as Mark Levin.

The Trump administration’s attitude to climate change, and our country's fate, in one sentence from @SecBernhardt: ""I haven't lost any sleep over it.""

— Controversial mining leases renewed: BLM has renewed two federal minerals leases for a proposed copper-nickel mine by Minnesota mining company Twin Metals. The controversial decision follows a years-long clash over opening the state to minerals mining, the Star Tribune reports. The leases were ended by the Obama administration in 2016 over concerns about the environmental risks of mining near a protected wilderness, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.

Trump administration touts economic benefit of new mining: “Mining on public lands balances conservation . . . with the need to produce minerals that add value to the lives of all Americans by providing raw materials used in the manufacture of medical aids, automobiles, smartphones and computers, and household appliances,” said Joe Balash, the interior's assistant secretary for land and minerals management.

“Mining on public lands balances conservation . . . with the need to produce minerals that add value to the lives of all Americans by providing raw materials used in the manufacture of medical aids, automobiles, smartphones and computers, and household appliances,” said Joe Balash, the interior's assistant secretary for land and minerals management. But Minnesota lawmakers are gearing up for a fight: ""Every sulfide-ore mine has failed to contain pollution and has affected the surrounding water quality,"" said Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.). ""Once polluted, this incredible landscape and its wildlife will never been the same.""

— 2020 watch: Two Democratic presidential candidates, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, are out this week with new climate policies.

Warren: In a post on Medium, Warren laid out a plan requiring the Pentagon to reach net-zero carbon emissions for its infrastructure and non-combat bases by 2030. Her plan also calls for creating a “dedicated source of funding to adapt our bases in the United States and around the world."" It also targets contractors hired by the Defense Department, proposing that any contractor that doesn't reach the net-zero emissions mark pay 1 percent of the value of the contract, which would be used to “to invest directly in making our military infrastructure more resilient.”

— A plan to put up border wall through protected lands: The federal government is looking to replace barriers across 100 miles of the southern border with Mexico in California and Arizona, including through the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, the Associated Press reports, citing environmental advocates and government documents.

The refuge specifically is meant to provide a designated home for 275 wildlife species. The report follows a move by the Department of Homeland Security to waive numerous laws in order to build more border wall. “The Trump administration just ignored bedrock environmental and public health laws to plow a disastrous border wall through protected, spectacular wildlands,” the Center for Biological Diversity’s Laiken Jordahl told the AP.

— ""So you think we can innovate our way out of this?"" The House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday hearing on climate change was the first to focus on the issue in a dozen years, the Washington Examiner reports, and lawmakers discussed various topics, including a carbon tax and clean energy.

During the hearing, Republican members also acknowledged there’s been a shift in rhetoric on the issue from their party. “We have gone from full of claims of [being] climate deniers to now we seem to be progress deniers,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) said, suggesting Democrats haven’t appreciated the shift. “We are making progress. Is it enough? Absolutely not. But we can learn from what’s brought us that progress to solve the challenge ahead of us, which is real.”

But: Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) meanwhile, dismissed what he called “happy talk” about progress. “There was no acknowledgment about the terrible [climate change] impacts that are getting worse, and the Trump administration's concerted effort to make it even worse. So you think we can innovate our way out of this? We are on a path that is going to be very grim.”

— New York's pipeline predicament: Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has until Thursday to decide whether to approve a proposed pipeline that would connect natural gas fields in Pennsylvania to New Jersey and New York. The pipeline has been at the center of debate about the state’s energy future, the New York Times reports.

Environmental advocates are worried about the impact on vulnerable ecosystems and establishing a reliance on fossil fuels as some New Yorkers look toward pushing renewable energy sources. “While the pipeline has not attracted anywhere near the attention of the Keystone XL or Dakota Access pipelines in the Great Plains region, which carry oil, supporters and opponents alike said the gas project could be similarly consequential,” the Times reports.

THERMOMETER

— PG&E’s wildfire woes: California state fire officials have concluded that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. equipment is to blame for the devastating Camp Fire that killed 85 people in November and was the most destructive wildfire in the state’s history. According to investigators with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the deadly blaze was sparked by electrical transmission lines controlled by the state’s largest utility and located in the community of Pulga, The Post’s Michael Brice-Saddler reports. In February, the company acknowledged it is “probable that its equipment will be determined to be an ignition point of the 2018 Camp fire.”

— An “an invisible cost” to deadly fires: Fire officials spoke to state lawmakers at a joint California Senate and Assembly hearing this week about the toll frequent deadly fires are having on firefighters and their mental health, as one fire captain from Sacramento called it an “invisible cost that’s rarely discussed.”

In California alone, the Firefighter Behavioral Health Alliance reports there have been 46 firefighter and emergency medical worker suicides in the past five years. Across the country, there have been 33 firefighter and emergency medical personnel suicides this year, E&E News reports. “At the hearing, fire officials said they needed more mental health support for emergency workers, both in the field during events and after the fires. They also said they needed more fire suppression personnel overall.”

— A trade-off for fast-growing trees: Although certain types of plants and trees could experience accelerated growth as a result of higher temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, a new study suggests those same trees could die faster, too. That means even as some experts say faster-growing trees could help combat global warming by drawing carbon in and storing the gas at higher rates, a new study in Nature Communications found “faster-growing trees also die younger, meaning the carbon they store goes back into the atmosphere more quickly,” E&E News reports.

Opinion | The Fight Over How Trump Fits in With the Other 44 Presidents,https://www.nytimes.com,['Thomas B. Edsall'],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/opinion/trump-history-presidents.html,"I raised the question with Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard who wrote the book “How Democracies Die” with his government department colleague Daniel Ziblatt.

Levitsky, responding to my emailed query, wrote:

There may well be something to the claim that Trump’s is a disjunctive presidency representing the end of the Reagan era. But to jump from there to the conclusion that he does not pose a serious threat to democratic institutions strikes me as facile. Such a claim too easily sets aside important contextual differences between this administration and those of other “disjunctive” presidents.

Levitsky provided a long list of contemporary factors that distinguish the Trump presidency from the Hoover and Carter presidencies, including

extreme partisan polarization along overlapping social/cultural/cleavages, the hardening of partisan identities and the rise of intense negative partisanship, the crystallization of white identities and the perception among some white voters of threat in the face of decades of immigration and steps toward racial equality; dramatically higher levels of income inequality and declining social mobility; the weakening of party elites’ gatekeeping capacity, reinforced by the introduction of party primaries, and, in the context of extreme polarization, the erosion of key democratic norms.

Levitsky’s argument goes beyond the overarching political environment to Trump’s character.

Trump “has shown himself,” Levitsky continued,

to be a more openly autocratic figure than any of the other disjunctive president I am aware of. So we have a president with authoritarian instincts in a context of extreme partisan polarization (such that Republicans line up behind Trump no matter what) and weakened norms. That strikes me as quite a bit different — and more threatening — than say, the Carter presidency.

In addition, Trump must be viewed as the avatar not only of an American political phenomenon but a global one.

Levitsky argues that the “disjunctive presidency” theory

lacks any comparative or global perspective. There are changes occurring globally that have unleashed illiberal or populist right wing reactions across much of the industrialized West. Whether it is globalization, migration and ethnic diversification, technological change, or some combination thereof, at least some of the dynamics that are occurring in the US cannot be understood in a vacuum. It would therefore be silly to assume that the context in which we are operating in 2019 is easily comparable to those of 1924-28 or 1976-80.

Ziblatt, Levitsky’s co-author, argued in an email that it is a highly risky proposition to take any comfort in a theoretical construct placing Trump as the endpoint of the Reagan era:

It is very, very dangerous way to feel reassured and to write off the Trump presidency as the final, dying days of the Reagan era. There are certainly analogies to be drawn from earlier eras but it is only an analogy, not a law of history.

Trump stands apart from past presidents in his willingness to capitalize on what Ziblatt identifies as an “existential fear” among voters in the face of broad demographic change:

The huge demographic changes underway in the U.S. since the 1970s have prompted Republican existential fear about the future and an increasingly stiff resistance to democracy itself. Like Conservatives in Europe before 1914 or Southern Democrats in the 1890s, fear of the future means a greater willingness to play dirty and to block the emergence of any “recuperative presidency.”

Theda Skocpol, professor of government and sociology at Harvard, sharply criticized the Skowronek-Balkin theory because it masks what she contends is a fundamentally different and dangerous moment in American politics:

We are in a very extreme period in U.S. political history because of the radicalization of the GOP and the apparent willingness of virtually all of its officeholders, candidates, and big donors to go along with authoritarian and anti-democratic measures of many kinds, not just presidential power grabs but legislative and judicial steps to curtail voting and organizational rights of opponents, in essence rigging future electoral contests in a very minority rule direction.

Skocpol warned of “mechanistic over-optimism,” writing that “things will look very different if Trump is re-elected, as he may very well be.” The current state of politics “is no ordinary cyclical turn,” she notes. “I would rank this period as one of the most conflictual since the late 1960s and early 1930s and the one with the greatest potential for actual regime change since the Civil War.”

There are some political scientists who generally agree with the Skowronek theory of cyclical regime change but who raise concerns about how well Trump fits into that analytic structure.

Julia Azari, a political scientist at Marquette University, poses a basic question about attempts to place Trump within a repetitive historical context:

We have both a president who is distinct in history and an era in political time that differs from previous ones in important structural ways. This combination points to the limits of history as a clear set of instructions for what might happen next.

In an email, Azari wrote that

the overall dynamics of party competition have changed in part because, for the first time in US history as far as I can tell, race and immigration are sorted between the two parties.

In the case of Trump, Azari points out that

Presidents who violate norms, especially those about the boundaries of their power, tend to be reconstructive presidents who reset the terms of debate and the expectations for the presidency — FDR and Jackson are perhaps the clearest examples of this.

Trump, in this context, is more like a reconstructive president than a disjunctive president:

Trump has also changed the language and, I think to some degree altered the identity and agenda of the Republican Party — and of the Democrats, who are responding to him. Trump has altered how we use political language — we all use adapted Trumpisms all the time, like make X great again or a riff on “build the wall."" He looms large in politics and in culture. This is not a typical disjunctive trajectory.

Azari was a student of Skowronek’s at Yale and believes his cyclical theory of regime change remains “incredibly useful for looking at politics.”

Both Azari and Skowronek acknowledge, however, that something that does not fit the theory of regime change may be taking place in American politics."
Exclusive: Trump EPA did not await court ruling to loosen biofuel rules for refiners - documents,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jarrett Renshaw', 'Min Read']",05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-biofuels-exclusive/exclusive-trump-epa-did-not-await-court-ruling-to-loosen-biofuel-rules-for-refiners-documents-idUSKCN1SM13Z,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration made it easier for oil refineries to get waivers from the nation’s biofuel law at least four months before a 2017 court decision it often cites to justify the move to the corn lobby, and the move was motivated by a desire to save the oil industry money, Reuters has learned.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sign is seen on the podium at EPA headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ting Shen/File Photo/File Photo

The timing and motivation for the Environmental Protection Agency’s policy change, revealed through court documents and an interview with a former top agency official, have not been previously reported. This reinforces the concerns of the corn industry that the decision to expand the waiver program was made at the EPA’s discretion.

“EPA repeatedly told Congress its hands were tied and blamed the courts. That appears to have been a lie. EPA also said it was following Department of Energy recommendations. We also know that’s bunk. I’m going to get to the bottom of this,” U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from the farm state of Iowa, said in a statement on Thursday.

The waivers, granted to small refineries including those run by oil majors Exxon Mobil, Chevron Corp and billionaire investor Carl Icahn, saved the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars. The waivers angered the corn lobby which argued they hurt farmers by threatening demand for ethanol.

Whether the EPA’s moves have hurt ethanol demand has been a topic of fierce debate.

The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel or buy credits generated by those who do, but smaller refineries can be exempted if they prove compliance would cause them financial harm.

Trump’s EPA granted 35 such waivers for 2017, up sharply from seven in the final year of the Obama administration.

Court documents filed by a biofuels advocacy group show that the EPA changed the policy before May 4, 2017.

On that date, the EPA told a refining company in a letter that “we are changing our approach” to the waiver program by allowing exemptions to refineries even if their operations “are not significantly impaired” by compliance, according to the documents filed by the Advanced Biofuels Association in a challenge of the expanded waiver program.

That puts the policy shift at least four months ahead of an August 2017 U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that found the agency was using too strict a standard when it denied Utah-based Sinclair Oil an exemption. The EPA subsequently withdrew its defense on a similar court case, and lost a third.

Those cases are often cited by EPA officials and refining industry representatives defending the expanded waiver program.

“The courts have clearly told us we have to follow the law, and that’s what we are going to do,” EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler said in April media interview when pressed about the expansion.

Mandy Gunasekara, who retired as principal deputy assistant administrator at the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation this year, said the EPA under then-administrator Scott Pruitt had decided to “reinstate” the small refinery waiver program to help an industry that felt ignored by Obama.

She said Pruitt also believed loosening the standards could help lower the cost of compliance credits, known as RINS, which could help the entire industry as opposed to just smaller refiners.

“Certainly, one of the goals was to put downward pressure on the price of RINs,” she told Reuters in an interview.

She said the Sinclair case did not influence the changes to the waiver program. “When I saw the Sinclar decision come down, I saw it as a vindication of our changes,” she said.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud did not respond to questions about whether the agency still believes the small refinery program should be used to help manage RIN prices. He maintained that EPA has been consistent in its justification for the expansion of the waiver program.

“The premise of this story is wrong,” he said, adding that the waiver program has “been subject to appropriations language and court opinions prior to and during the Trump Administration.”

Expansion of waivers drove down RIN prices to multi-year lows last year. This helped refiners like Valero Energy Corp and PBF Energy Inc that had been purchasing them, along with CVR Energy Inc, owned by Icahn.

Icahn came under federal investigation after CVR was seen shorting the credit market in 2017 while he advocated for financial relief from the biofuel program.

Icahn and other merchant refiners had long complained that their profit margins were being squeezed by the law, which is nearly 15 years old. It was intended to help farmers and reduce U.S. reliance on energy imports.

The waiver provision was intended to temporarily exempt smaller refineries so they could invest in biofuel blending equipment."
Former DHS officials ousted over push back on Trump administration's plan to arrest thousands of migrants,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-dhs-officials-ousted-over-push-back-on-trump-administrations-plan-to-arrest-thousands-of-migrants,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and a top immigration official challenged a previously secret White House plan to arrest thousands of migrant parents and children in nearly a dozen U.S. cities, Fox News confirmed Monday.

The Trump administration wanted to target migrant families that had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico in attempt to show that the U.S. wasn't going to back down on its border stance by detaining and deporting illegal immigrant families, The Washington Post first reported, citing several current and former Homeland Security officials.

NEW TRUMP WH POLICY LETS DEPUTIES DETAIN IMMIGRANTS ON BEHALF OF ICE, SUBVERTING 'SANCTUARY' LAWS

The operation included fast-tracking immigration court cases and allowing the U.S. to deport those who failed to show up in their hearings as well as coordinating raids against parents with children in several cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and several other major metropolitan areas, Fox News confirmed.

Nielsen and top immigration official Ronald Vitiello pushed back on the administration’s plan, citing lack of preparation, public outrage and worries that the operation could use border resources. Stephen Miller and ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence were supportive of the plan arguing that such an operation could deter migrants from crossing into the U.S., according to The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s were concerned over the operation and logistics over the plan and not the ethical reasons behind it, according to the newspaper. Nielsen also worried that targeting parents and children might detract from the White House’s goal of going after so-called “criminal aliens.”

“There was concern that it was being hastily put together, would be ineffective and might actually backfire by misdirecting resources away from critical border emergency response operations,” a Homeland Security official told The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s push back was reportedly part of the reason why Trump pushed both officials out of the administration.

Neither Homeland Security nor the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have commented on the report. Miller, through a White House spokesman, declined comment to The Post.

Nielsen left her position after only 16 months on the job. The Associated Press, citing two sources, reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the southwestern border.

The commerce ban does not prohibit U.S. telecom companies from purchasing Huawei gear, but instead bans Huawei from sourcing its supply chain components from U.S. companies. The move will hamper Huawei’s ability to conduct business internationally because of its reliance on U.S. companies for components for its gear, according to a Reuters report citing unnamed U.S. officials.

The move comes one day after U.S. president Donald Trump declared a national emergency in relation to telecom equipment, claiming that “foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services.” Trump’s executive order prohibits U.S. companies from sourcing telecom gear from companies that pose a national security risk, but does not name Huawei nor China as specific threats.

RELATED: Trump to ban U.S. carriers from using network gear posing security risk: Reuters

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the ban is the result of President Trump’s request that the department to be “vigilant in its protection of national security activities.”

“This will prevent American technology from being used by foreign-owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests,” Ross said in a statement.

In a statement, Huawei argued the ban would hurt American efforts to roll out 5G networks. “Restricting Huawei from doing business in the U.S. will not make the U.S. more secure or stronger; instead, this will only serve to limit the U.S. to inferior. yet more expensive alternatives, leaving the U.S. lagging behind in 5G deployment, and eventually harming the interests of U.S. companies and consumers,” the company said. “Unreasonable restrictions will infringe upon Huawei's rights and raise other serious legal issues.”

“We are ready and willing to engage with the U.S. government and come up with effective measures to ensure product security,” Huawei said.

The Commerce department made a similar move in 2016 against China-based telecom equipment maker ZTE, over allegations that ZTE was breaking U.S. sanctions.

"FDA can’t control death penalty drugs, DOJ says",https://www.politico.com,['Josh Gerstein'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/fda-death-penalty-drugs-1323248,"“The Constitution and numerous federal statutes presuppose that capital punishment will remain available and that the federal government will defer to States over methods of execution,” the opinion says. | California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation via Getty Images legal FDA can’t control death penalty drugs, DOJ says

The Justice Department issued a legal opinion that could lead to more executions in the U.S. by easing the availability of drugs used to carry out lethal injections.

The opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel says the Food and Drug Administration lacks the authority to regulate drugs or other items when used in connection with the death penalty.

Story Continued Below

The immediate effect of the Trump administration decision is unclear because of a court injunction issued in 2012 barring the FDA from allowing the importation of a key execution drug, sodium thiopental. Shortages of that drug have led many states to scale back or halt executions in recent years.

In a statement, an FDA spokesperson said the agency would “follow the conclusion of the opinion to the extent permissible” by the 7-year-old order, which remains in effect.

The 26-page opinion , signed by Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel, indicates that it was sought by the attorney general's office, but does not say when. OLC opinions are traditionally treated as controlling law within the executive branch. Courts often take note of such high-level legal advice when it is made public, but are not obliged to follow the opinions.

Engel’s opinion argues that drugs and other items intended for use in executions are not covered by the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, passed in 1938 and repeatedly updated by Congress. The legal memo also says that conclusion is reinforced by so-called federalism problems that could arise from federal officials trying to enforce such regulations in a way that would frustrate state efforts to carry out executions.

“The FDCA cannot be read as authorizing FDA to effectively ban capital punishment, because that reading would contravene or render moot a host of federal statutes that presuppose the lawfulness of capital punishment,” Engel wrote in the opinion, dated May 3 and released by the Justice Department on Tuesday evening.

“The Constitution and numerous federal statutes presuppose that capital punishment will remain available and that the federal government will defer to States over methods of execution,” the opinion says. “Interpreting the FDCA to bar the importation, sale, and distribution of articles intended for use in executions would conflict with that settled understanding. The FDCA’s definitions of ‘drug’ and ‘device’ are broad, but breadth alone fails to manifest the intent needed to alter federal-state relations so dramatically with respect to capital punishment.”

While the 2012 injunction was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit the next year, Engel’s opinion downplays the significance of those rulings. “Neither the district court, nor the D.C. Circuit, addressed the broader question of FDA’s jurisdiction,” the opinion says.

When the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental stopped production in 2009, states began scrambling to find stocks of the drug in the U.S. and abroad. After the 2012 injunction, the FDA moved to halt such imports. In 2015, it blocked a shipment headed for a Texas prison.

Because of the shortage, states have turned to a variety of other methods for executions, including substitutions for thiopental in a three-drug combination and the use of a single drug, pentobarbital. Some of the new methods resulted in a spate of episodes in which the condemned gasped, convulsed or cried out during the execution process.

States have carried out about 25 executions a year since 2015, a significant drop-off from the previous two decades. The last federal execution was in 2003.

Bulldog Durham is good choice for investigation into the investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/bulldog-john-durham-is-good-choice-for-investigation-into-the-investigation,"Attorney General William Barr has the right idea for investigating the investigators.

Even for those of us who think some Trumpian fulminations about a “deep state” trying to undermine Trump's campaign or presidency have reached ludicrous proportions, the appointment of experienced federal prosecutor John Durham to investigate it all looks necessary, proper, and wise.

Durham has a record as a superb and trusted prosecutor. He is charged with probing issues that are quite serious, even if not an “attempted coup” or whatever other poppycock Trump’s slavish minions are claiming it was.

We know the controversial “Steele dossier” that played a role in catalyzing the Trump-Russia investigation was largely bogus. We know that the investigation predated it and was nowhere near entirely reliant on it, but we also know it was misused for partisan, anti-Trump purposes even after its allegations were very much in doubt.

We know that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has blasted former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and that former FBI lawyers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok exhibited horrendous anti-Trump bias in the course of the Russia investigation. And we know that the Trump team was subjected to some forms of surveillance that were at least somewhat unusual and perhaps more sinister than that.

In short, no matter what Democrats and their media sycophants might say, there is plenty of reason to investigate the whole rat’s nest for possible illegality. No prosecutors, ever, should be allowed to use their powers for nakedly political purposes.

On the flip side, just as what occurred a quarter century ago after the suicide of Clinton-family intimate Vince Foster, there are so many breathless “deep state” conspiracy theories flying around that only a thorough, formal, careful, professional investigation can separate fact from folderol. If there were a few very bad actors but not the vast, left-wing conspiracy that some Trumpists hyperventilate about, the American public deserves to know that the FBI as a whole remains trustworthy and that no body snatchers are secretly manipulating America into perdition.

That’s why the selection of Durham is so important. Everything about his record yells competence and trustworthiness. He has been tasked by both Republican and Democratic administrations to handle tough, high-profile cases. He helped put Republican Connecticut governor John Rowlands in jail; he prosecuted agents of the Gambino, Patriarca, and Genovese mob families; he led the indictments of associates of mob killer Whitey Bulger; and though nominally a Republican, he has been trusted and praised by Connecticut’s two Democratic senators, Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy.

As the Wall Street Journal put it, “appointing someone of his standing and experience is important to getting to the truth.”

What a novel idea: actually getting to the truth, rather than letting politicized charges, counter-charges, and conspiracy theories rule the day. Furthermore, if the truth shows illegality, then prosecute it and put the bad guys in prison."
Ethics experts explain how to protect taxpayers from Pruitt-like scandals,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-watchdog-pruitt-scandal-travel-0571e566f505/,"Internal watchdogs opened more than a dozen investigations into a range of scandals surrounding the former heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department last year. Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke both resigned as their ethics, management, and travel scandals mounted.

In doing so, they have largely been able to avoid the accusations and potential consequences, leading experts and politicians alike to demand greater accountability.

Several of the probes into these two former Trump officials have been closed or remain inconclusive due to lack of cooperation from former or current officials. But agency watchdogs are still investigating alleged misconduct. The EPA’s Office of Inspector General issued a report Thursday on Pruitt’s travel expenses that found Pruitt racked up nearly $124,000 in “excessive” travel costs in 2017 — largely due to his penchant for first class travel, which often took place “without sufficient justification and proper approval.”

Among its more than a dozen recommendations, the OIG says the EPA should recover these funds from the “responsible official or officials.” Ten of the 14 recommendations in the report remain unresolved, however, and in its response, the EPA asserted that since the travel was “valid” it does not have any plans to try and recoup the money.

The 84-page report is detailed and pointed, but the EPA’s response left many critics unsatisfied.

Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA), who was the first member of Congress to formally call for Pruitt’s resignation, said current EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is “sweeping [Pruitt’s] wrongdoing under the rug.”

“Andrew Wheeler is allowing him to cheat taxpayers out of thousands of dollars by proclaiming his intention not to follow up on the findings of [the] report,” Beyer said in a statement. “Pruitt should not be allowed to evade the consequences of his actions just because he was dismissed before his offenses were fully uncovered.”

The same can be said of Zinke, who remains largely unscathed by the numerous investigations that dogged him in the Trump administration. After resigning, he failed to cooperate with investigators by not turning in documents regarding his use of a private plane linked to oil executives, along with other charter flights that cost taxpayers thousands of dollars. The inspector general’s report was therefore inconclusive.

So, this all begs the question: How can government officials be held accountable for misuse of taxpayer money when it seems by resigning they largely escape the consequences?

Government ethics watchdogs have long criticized this lack of accountability. “Once a government official resigns from government service, an IG [Inspector General] often closes investigations into wrongful behavior because the IG can no longer compel the person’s testimony,” Rebecca Jones, policy counsel at the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), told ThinkProgress.

“Then, rather than being held accountable for their actions, the former employee often lands in a lucrative private consulting position,” she continued. “This is an accountability loophole that permits flagrant abuse of power. It’s also an unabashed slap in the face to taxpayers left signing the check.”

Pruitt and Zinke now work as high-paid consultants for industries they regulated just a short time ago — Pruitt for coal and Zinke for mining.

The EPA’s latest report seeks to address a portion of this accountability gap by laying out steps for how the misuse of taxpayer funds for first class travel and expensive hotels can be avoided in the future.

In addition to urging the EPA to recoup the $123,942 in excessive travel costs, the OIG calls for the agency to adopt stricter policies and oversight procedures. This includes implementing controls to ensure the official approving first class or business travel has the authority to do so, that this type of travel be “properly justified and documented prior to approval,” and have controls to ensure “adequate cost comparisons” are made before approving a travel route that’s not the most direct or standard route. Nearly half of Pruitt’s domestic flights were routed via his hometown in Oklahoma, for instance.

“I think this makes sense,” Tom Pelton, communications director for the Environmental Integrity Project, told ThinkProgress. “More careful oversight of the spending of cabinet members by the federal government should crack down on this kind of waste and abuse of taxpayer funds.”

Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, agreed. “You are correct that sometimes with administrative matters, the consequences for certain violations may not materialize if they are left up to agency discretion; and sometimes the absence of an official moots an investigation,” she said. “But the fact of this report and the recommendation is significant.”

Annual OIG reports are submitted to Congress, Marsco explained, and the OIG keeps logs of recommendations that were not implemented. “These recommendations can and should be used as a tool for congressional oversight of agency practice with regard to travel, if the agency fails to implement the recommendations on its own,” Marsco said.

Ultimately, preventing future scandals comes down to congressional oversight, according to POGO’s Jones. “I think the solution lies as much in deterring this kind of blatant disregard for ethics as it does in having the ability to hold bad actors accountable after the fact,” she said.

Congress needs to ensure inspectors general and the Office of Special Counsel have adequate funding, said Jones. In February 2018, the EPA OIG said it didn’t have enough funding to investigate all of Pruitt’s scandals, and so it had to limit its travel probe to 2017 — which is why the report out this week does not examine any travel by Pruitt in 2018.

Congressional committees are able to wield greater power than inspectors general to compel information. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ), for instance, has said he’ll use his subpoena power as Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee to hold Zinke to account; with a majority vote, the committee can issue a subpoena for Zinke to testify.

Congress should also introduce reforms to support inspectors general to be able to do the same, Jones said. This includes giving them testimonial subpoena authority (which is separate from issuing a subpoena for documents) so they can call upon former officials to testify even if they’ve resigned. Other reforms should focus on increasing transparency and strengthening the independence of these internal watchdog offices.

At the end of the day, however, “compliance with ethics rules is so dependent on the ethical culture of the agency,” said Marsco. “If we see the most senior officials skirting ethics rules, it’s more likely that less senior employees will feel empowered to do the same.”

There’s no lack of ethics controversies in the Trump administration. Beyond Zinke and Pruitt, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao have also been criticized over taxpayer-funded travel expenses. Meanwhile, the former heads of Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency all resigned amid expenses controversies. And the current officials leading the EPA and Interior, along with other government agencies, are face questions over conflicts of interest.

“In the absence of ethical leadership, strong prevention mechanisms are necessary,” she said, noting that she felt the OIG’s recommendations to the EPA were “good ones.”

For many politicians, watchdogs, and environmental groups, though, a satisfying first step would be for Pruitt to pay back his travel costs.

“There needs to be accountability for such blatant abuses of the public trust. Mr. Pruitt should repay the taxpayer money that he wasted on his lavish travel expenses,” Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee overseeing the EPA’s budget, said in a statement. He added that “the Trump EPA needs to heed the recommendations of the OIG” to prevent such future abuses.

It’s not unprecedented for officials to reimburse expenses. According to an October 2018 Interior OIG report, for instance, which found that Zinke violated department policy by allowing his wife and others ride with him in department vehicles, the couple repaid the costs associated with the travel. And Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reportedly reimbursed taxpayers for his private travel to watch an eclipse with his wife.

“By resigning, [Pruitt] should not now be able to escape repaying what he owes taxpayers for these improper expenses,” Tim Whitehouse, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), said in an email to ThinkProgress.

But many doubt Pruitt will do this. And as a spokesperson from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) told ThinkProgress, “It’s not about holding the officials accountable as much as holding the government accountable. By removing wrongdoers from the government, the government becomes more accountable to taxpayers.”"
Here's what could happen if China used its 'nuclear option' in the trade war,https://www.businessinsider.co.za,[],,,,https://www.businessinsider.co.za/us-china-trade-war-what-happens-if-china-uses-nuclear-option-2019-5,"Earlier this week, the editor in chief of the Global Times, a state-aligned Chinese tabloid, said Chinese scholars were looking into the possibility of China dumping US Treasurys.

UBS looked at The Federal Reserve's tapering to try and figure out what kind of impact China selling $1.1 trillion of Treasurys would have on the bond market, and concluded the 10-year yield could rise by up to 40 basis points.

Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal thinks yields could actually fall if China sold its holdings.

The debate is likely for naught as China needs to hold Treasurys, according to one analyst.

Chinese scholars are reportedly looking into the so-called nuclear option in the trade war - Beijing dumping US Treasurys.

""Many Chinese scholars are discussing the possibility of dumping US Treasuries and how to do it specifically,"" Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the state-aligned Chinese tabloid Global Times, tweeted on Monday, setting off a debate about what the consequences would be if China divested its holdings.

While UBS strategists think its unlikely China would sell the entirety of its holdings, they looked into what could happen just in case. To do so, they looked at the impact the Fed's tapering had on yields.

""Through quantitative easing programs, the Fed expanded its balance sheet by about $3.5trn,"" the strategists wrote. ""We estimated that this compressed US term premium by about 110bp. Through its balance sheet unwind of $600bn, we estimated that 10-year term premium had risen by about 20-30bp.""

Therefore, they conclude that China unloading all $1.1 trillion of its Treasurys, or about 7% of the entire market, would cause the 10-year yield to climb by 30 to 40 basis points.

But not everyone agrees that yields would go higher. In Bloomberg's daily markets email, Joe Weisenthal, executive editor for daily news, suggested Treasury yields could actually fall.

""What's more plausible than spiking yields is that if word got out that China really did want to dump U.S. debt in size,"" he wrote.

""Yields would fall because people would assume that this ""nuclear option"" represented a gigantic break in the U.S.-Sino relationship. All that would hurt the global economy, causing the Fed to be even slower with expected rate hikes. In the immediate term, there would likely be a flight to Treasuries, amid a big risk-off move in markets. The Treasury market often behaves counterintuitively.""

Of course the whole debate is likely for naught.

""What people don't understand is that it is not a choice"" for China to keep so many Treasurys, J Capital Research cofounder Anne Stevenson-Yang told Business Insider's Linette Lopez. ""This is a dollar world and China hold Treasurys to manage its trade with the world.""

Selling Treasurys is a ""good meme for the Chinese people but it doesn't actually mean anything,"" she said.
