Trump scrapped the meeting, which was slated as an opportunity to discuss the country's infrastructure, after Pelosi told reporters that the president ""engaged in a cover-up"" following a meeting with her caucus.

After Trump left the room, Conway asked the Speaker if she had a ""direct response to the president,"" Fox News confirmed.

Conway slammed Pelosi's dismissal of her.

""Really great. That’s really pro-woman of you,” the White House counselor is said to have responded.

The tense moment came before Trump blasted Democratic lawmakers with his remarks from the Rose Garden, telling reporters, ""I don't do cover-ups.""

“You can't do it under these circumstances,” Trump said about negotiating with Democrats. “Get these phony investigations over with.”

Pelosi doubled down on her accusation at the Center for American Progress 2019 Ideas Conference Wednesday afternoon.

“The fact is, in plain sight, in the public domain, this president is obstructing justice and he's engaged in a cover-up. And that could be an impeachable offense,” Pelosi said."
New York Passes Bill Giving Congress a Way to Get Trump’s State Tax Returns,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jesse Mckinley'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/nyregion/trump-state-tax-returns.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

ALBANY — New York State lawmakers on Wednesday gave their final approval to a bill that would clear a path for Congress to obtain President Trump’s state tax returns, injecting another element into a tortuous battle over the president’s refusal to release his taxes.

The bill, which is expected to be signed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat and regular critic of Mr. Trump’s policies and behavior, will authorize state tax officials to release the president’s state returns to any one of three congressional committees.

The returns — filed in New York, the president’s home state and business headquarters — would likely contain much of the same information as the contested federal returns, though it remained unclear whether those congressional committees would use such new power in their investigations.

The Legislature’s actions put the state in a bit of uncharted legal territory; Mr. Trump has said that he is ready to take the fight over his federal tax returns to the Supreme Court, and it seems likely that he would seek to contest New York’s maneuver."

Trump, in his impromptu remarks and in response to questions, made clear that he couldn't negotiate with the Democratic leaders in light of Pelosi's slam and the endless investigations after the Mueller ""witch hunt.""

Chuck and Nancy promptly held a counter-news conference and talked about ... infrastructure.

It was nothing short of surreal. Pelosi made no reference to her time-bomb of a comment. ""We believe that no one is above the law including the president of the United States. And we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up,"" she had told reporters.

Instead, she went on about the importance of building projects, harkening back to Thomas Jefferson and Teddy Roosevelt. And Schumer said Trump had seized on a ""pre-planned excuse"" to blow up the meeting. They took no questions.

Pelosi doubled down at a later event with the Center for American Progress, saying ""this president is obstructing justice ... and that could be an impeachable offense.""

Trump was already mad, as we can tell from a morning tweetstorm, and the ""cover-up"" rhetoric was the tipping point. Still, there's no question this was a tactical misstep by Pelosi. You don't hurl a charge against anyone you're about to hold a business meeting with, especially a president who has built his career on counterpunching. What, did she think he wouldn't notice? She was surrounded by cameras.

And even if Trump was looking to back out of a bipartisan building plan, she sure gave him cover.

And yet Pelosi, in her own way, was trying to find a middle ground. She is under enormous pressure from her own side to greenlight impeachment proceedings. More of her prominent members, including those on the Judiciary Committee, are coming out for the I-word. And it's easy to pander to the three-quarters of Democrats who favor impeachment in recent polls.

REP. COHEN: '80-90 PERCENT' OF DEMS ON HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE READY TO PUSH FOR IMPEACHMENT

But the speaker is also savvy enough to know that actual impeachment hearings would obliterate the party's agenda, energize the hell out of Trump's base and ultimately fail in the Senate, just as we head into the 2020 elections.

Pelosi's cover-up language, in my view, was an attempt to toss red meat at the left wing of her party without serving the full impeachment buffet. She's trying to show she shares their colleagues' concerns about the accusations against the president, yet settling for a sort of Impeachment Lite.

Trump isn't helping himself by flatly refusing every subpoena request, including the one for Don McGahn this week. Steve Mnuchin also took a hit when The Washington Post revealed that a staff lawyer's memo (which the Treasury boss says he never saw) said the department had no choice but to give Congress his tax returns.

The president is doing this as part of his always-on-offense strategy, and in part because he views the Hill probes as a ""do-over"" for a Mueller investigation that recommended no criminal charges. He's well aware that more Democrats are citing his lack of cooperation as a reason to pursue impeachment, which would give them broader power to obtain information. Either he's calling their bluff or believes an actual impeachment would play out to his benefit.

What we're left with an Impeachment in All But Name, as the president and his Democratic adversaries keep raising the stakes. The danger here is that the momentum builds to the point that the country is plunged into an actual impeachment that, in the end, would resolve nothing."
"Harriet Tubman $20 Bill Is Delayed Until Trump Leaves Office, Mnuchin Says",https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/harriet-tubman-bill.html,"“It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary down the road.”

Replacing Jackson with Tubman was both filled with symbolism and marred by controversy.

Tubman was born into slavery, escaped and then returned to the South, where she led other slaves to freedom. She was a Union scout during the Civil War and later advocated women’s voting rights. Jackson orchestrated the removal of Native Americans from lands to the east of the Mississippi River and sent them marching west on the so-called Trail of Tears.

In 2017, speculation began that Mr. Trump might scrap Mr. Lew’s plan for the $20 bill when mentions of it were scrubbed from the Treasury Department’s website during a redesign.

Then, that August, Mr. Mnuchin made clear that Tubman’s future on the bill was in doubt.

“People have been on the bills for a long period of time,” he told CNBC. “This is something we’ll consider. Right now, we’ve got a lot more important issues to focus on.”

Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, recently introduced the Harriet Tubman Tribute Act and called on the Treasury Department to offer clarity on the status of the $20 bill. The legislation, if passed, would direct the department to place the likeness of Tubman on $20 Federal Reserve notes printed after Dec. 31, 2020.

“There is no excuse for the administration’s failure to make this redesign a priority,” Ms. Shaheen said. “Sadly, this delay sends an unmistakable message to women and girls, and communities of color, who were promised they’d see Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.”

Supporters of the tribute act in the House — including Representatives Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, and John Katko, Republican of New York — also expressed frustration with the Trump administration over the delay."

National attention is turning to issues that have been central to Kirsten Gillibrand's years of public service: equality and reproductive rights.

The New York senator and presidential candidate joined several of her Democratic primary opponents and abortion-rights advocates at a rally outside the U.S. Supreme Court this week after multiple states passed restrictive abortion legislation. And on Wednesday she released a plan that promotes investments in maternal and child health, paid family leave and education.

""I think President Trump and these very extreme Republican legislators around the country, they are taking this country in a direction that it does not want to go,"" Gillibrand told NPR. ""I believe that if President Trump wants a war with America's women, it's a war he will have and it is one he will lose.""

Gillibrand announced her exploratory committee in January on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. A video released by her committee at the time highlighted Gillibrand's work on government transparency, her rejection of corporate PAC money and her help pushing through the Sept. 11 health bill.

Two months after making her candidacy official, she's not yet assured to qualify for the first primary debate. Asked whether she was concerned about her campaign's momentum, she said: ""The truth is, it's a marathon and not a sprint.""

Gillibrand spoke with Morning Edition as part of the show's Opening Argument conversations, exploring the presidential candidates' core messages.

Interview Highlights

On abortion and women's rights

Equality and reproductive freedom has been something that I have focused my time in public service on over the last 12 years, but as [a presidential candidate] I've already made a very significant platform surrounding these issues.

I will only appoint judges and justices that see Roe v. Wade as settled precedent. I will codify Roe v. Wade legislatively. I will look to remove the Hyde Amendment, which is the law that prohibits federal money paying for abortion services in a full range of health care, particularly for poor low-income women. I will also make sure and guarantee that no matter what state you live in you will have a right to access full reproductive services, including abortion services, regardless of where you live.

On whether Democrats are shifting further to the left

I think there there's a perception [of a shift], but I think the truth is certainly the party that I've been part of has been working on a lot of these issues for a very long time. But some things the way they're talked about seem new and seem more radical. And I don't think that's the case. And I'll give you an example. Global climate change.

I think global climate change is the greatest threat to humanity that exists. So I think the Green New Deal is just a platform of ideas that have been around for a long time that are already bipartisan. ... And to be honest I just see it as an aspirational goal that's not unlike when John F. Kennedy wanted to put a man on the moon. He said, ""I want to do this in 10 years, not because it's easy, but because it's hard."" And it's exciting and that's what leadership is. And it doesn't have to be partisan.

On her idea for national public service

People want health care as a right. They want better public schools. They want to know that their kids can go to college debt-free. So my idea to do that is national public service.

I believe that if you tell every young person in this country that if you do a year of public service you could have two years of community college or state school free. We know that we have needs and lots of service industries that are desperate for young workers. And so if you open up public service to all those industry groups and you incentivize young people to commit a year or two to that, it's going to not only create pipelines into new jobs and careers that will create economic growth, but it changes the heart of the country and the heart of these kids in a generation.

DOJ Attorneys Reportedly Ready to Block T-Mobile/Sprint Merger,https://gizmodo.com,"['Dell Cameron', 'About The Author', 'Privacy', 'Security', 'Tech Policy', 'Email', 'Dell Gizmodo.Com', 'Xmpp', 'Dell Jabber.Ccc.De']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/doj-attorneys-reportedly-ready-to-block-t-mobile-sprint-1834961808,"Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP

To literally no one’s surprise, the head of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday announced Monday that he’d recommend approving the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. But it now looks as if the Justice Department’s own attorneys vehemently oppose the merger.



Reuters reported Wednesday that the DOJ’s antitrust division has recommended filing a lawsuit to block the $26.5 billion deal. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, the news agency said the division’s staff have long been “skeptical” of the proposed merger, in that it does not appear to be in the best interests of consumers.

Per Reuters: “T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.”

Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, said earlier that commitments by T-Mobile and Sprint to close “the digital divide in rural America” and advance “United States leadership in 5G, the next generation in wireless connectivity,” has persuaded him to approve the deal.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr—only days after accepting an award from the nation’s largest wireless industry trade association—announced that he, too, was also swayed by the companies’ commitments and would support the chairman’s decision.

Praising his “ongoing leadership,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere thanked Pai for his support in a statement Monday, while promising the commitments T-Mobile agreed to are “verifiable, enforceable and specific.” But consumer advocacy groups and legal experts following the news disagreed entirely.

“Rather than actually examine the competitive impact, Chairman Pai’s recommended approval points to T-Mobile’s commitments and behavioral conditions,” said Yosef Getachew, media and democracy program director for Common Cause. “Not only are these commitments and conditions unenforceable and riddled with loopholes, they do nothing to address the blatant competitive harms the merger poses to consumers.”

Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, echoed those concerns in a Wired op-ed this week, writing that Legere’s assurances “are speculative, unsubstantiated, and entirely unenforceable.” Sohn went on to call T-Mobile’s vow not to raise prices for three years an “admission” that, should the merger be approved, “there would not be enough competition in the wireless market to constrain price increases.”

Pai’s announcement was also rebuked by, among others, New America’s Open Technology Institute and the Rural Wireless Association. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is Democrat, compared the merger to “consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,” which she argued, “hasn’t worked out well for consumers.”

“The inadequate conditions [Pai] and his fellow GOP commissioners so readily and rapidly blessed are a tiny Band-Aid on what would be a fatal wound to wireless competition and affordability in this country,” said Matt Wood, vice president of policy at the advocacy group Free Press. “DOJ’s staff seems to get that, even if some of the political appointees leading the FCC don’t.”"
"USDA relocates expert economists, researchers who challenge Trump policies: report",https://thehill.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/445151-usda-relocates-expert-economists-researchers-who-challenge-trump,"The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is moving expert economists and researchers whose work challenges President Trump Donald John TrumpFeinstein, Iranian foreign minister had dinner amid tensions: report The Hill's Morning Report - Trump says no legislation until Dems end probes Harris readies a Phase 2 as she seeks to rejuvenate campaign MORE's policies out of Washington D.C., Politico reported Wednesday.

Almost all researchers who work on the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps in the agency are being moved out of the capital in what they described to Politico as a political crackdown.

Employees of the USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) were reportedly told last year by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue George (Sonny) Ervin PerdueUSDA relocates expert economists, researchers who challenge Trump policies: report Gov.

On March 5, the department began notifying people who were allowed to stay in Washington but didn’t provide a comprehensive list, only telling employees in person whether they had made the cut.

Current and former employees independently made a list, covering all 279 people on staff, which reportedly found that 76 are being allowed to stay in the capital.

The current and former employees told Politico the specialties of those being asked to move correspond closely to the areas where economic assessments often clash with Trump's policies, including tax policies, climate change and farms.

“This was a clear politicization of the agency many of us loved for its non-partisan research and analysis,” a current ERS employee told the outlet, claiming that department leaders picked those whose work was more likely to offend the administration and forced them to move “out or quit.”

""You can draw the conclusion that these are the less valued activities that are undertaken by ERS,"" said a former researcher who left last month in anticipation of being moved. ""They view ERS as being useful in that it produces data and statistics that can inform policy but the research that’s done by the economists and geographers and statisticians at ERS is less valuable and that they’re not concerned with a significant deterioration in ERS’ ability to do research.”

Perdue, however, denied the relocations were political.

“We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide,” Perdue said in a statement to The Hill. “We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C.”

“None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our ERS or NIFA employees, and in fact, I frequently tell my Cabinet colleagues that USDA has the best workforce in the federal government.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill on Politico's report.

The Harriet Tubman $20 bill was set for 2020. Now the Trump administration says it won't happen for years,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Jason Silverstein'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harriet-tubman-20-bill-2020-release-delayed-trump-administration-says-it-wont-happen-for-years-2019-05-22/,"Don't bet on seeing a Harriet Tubman $20 bill anytime soon. The redesigned bill bearing Tubman's face, which was supposed to debut next year, will not be coming out for nearly a decade, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said.

Planning started years ago to have Tubman replace former President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. Tubman, who was born into slavery and became a noted abolitionist and political activist, would be the first black woman to have her face on U.S. currency. The new bill was scheduled to be released in 2020 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.

But Mnuchin said Wednesday that it won't be happening under the Trump administration.

""It's not a decision that is likely to come until way past my term, even if I serve the second term for the president,"" Mnuchin told the House Financial Services Committee. ""So I'm not focused on that for the moment.""

In the Women on 20s grassroots campaign, which inspired bills in the House and the Senate, Harriet Tubman came out the frontrunner to replace President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, after more than 600,000 people cast ballots. WomenOn20s.org

Mnuchin said a redesign of the bill's security features will still come out in 2020. But the issue of changing how the bill looks ""most likely"" won't come up again until 2026, he said, and the new $20 bill won't be printed until 2028.

Mnuchin did not explain why the Tubman bill won't be produced on his watch. He also did not state whether he personally supports seeing Tubman on the money. ""I've made no decision as it relates to that,"" he said.

Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who grilled Mnuchin about the Tubman plan, tweeted after the hearing: ""People other than white men built this county. And Sec Mnuchin agrees, yet he refuses to update our #currency.""

People other than white men built this county.

Mnuchin's predecessor in the Obama administration, Jack Lew, oversaw a 10-month process in which the public suggested hundreds of people whose portraits could appear on U.S. bills. He said that process ""inspired"" him to put Tubman on the $20 bill. The Treasury Department announced in April 2016 that it would work on getting the new bill out ""as quickly as possible.""

President Trump said during the 2016 campaign that he did not support putting Tubman on the 20, calling the plan ""pure political correctness."" He suggested instead having Tubman on ""the $2 bill"" or ""another bill.""

Mr. Trump has expressed admiration for President Andrew Jackson, who was a slave owner, and had a portrait of him put in the Oval Office."
Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost to leave before year's end: Sources,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-chief-carla-provost-to-leave-before-years-end-sources,"U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost is expected to leave her post by December, according to several high-ranking former Department of Homeland Security and union officials with first-hand knowledge of the plan.

Provost, the first woman to lead the 95-year-old federal law enforcement agency, will retire by the year’s end, wrapping up her 24-year career, the Washington Examiner has learned.

The 48-year-old lifetime Border Patrol employee has served as permanent chief for less than a year. She was acting chief from April 2017 through August 2018 and officially took over late last summer after Robert Perez was confirmed by the Senate as deputy commissioner of Border Patrol’s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection.

Provost has led the agency’s 20,000 employees during a turbulent time as the organization struggles to handle the more than half a million people apprehended while illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in the first six-and-a-half months of fiscal 2019. It will also leave another hole in DHS, which has more than a dozen vacancies at the senior level.

“It’s not going well over there. The pressure’s outrageous,” said a former Customs and Border Protection leader who was aware of her forthcoming departure, who added she may leave earlier than December.

Two officials said Manuel ""Manny"" Padilla was most likely to take over when Provost leaves. Padilla is director of the Department of Homeland Security Joint Task Force West and served 30 years with Border Patrol. He was tapped in April to head the department's interagency emergency border cell.

Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment.

Provost joined the Border Patrol in her early 20s after working a short period as a police officer in her home state of Kansas. She worked in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. She went on to take over its Washington-based internal affairs office in 2015.

Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan credited her last August for her work in internal affairs and the lowering of firearm-related incidents even as assaults against agents jumped to a record high. However, an Intercept report last year showed assaults were being counted in a new way where each rock thrown at an agent counted as an assault.

Provost was endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council, the primary union for agents, at the time of her promotion to chief in early 2017.

“Carla is an agent's agent,” McAleenan said at the promotion announcement last August. “She's come up through the ranks.”

Since taking over Border Patrol as acting and permanent chief in early 2017, Provost has been on the receiving end of the Trump administration's attempts to go after unauthorized immigrants and thwart illegal immigration, including the family separations that took place during the ""zero tolerance"" policy.

Provost sat down with the Examiner last May and said one of her greatest frustrations was the amount of coverage on “anything that’s in a negative fashion.""

“I would tell you it doesn’t make it into the media generally because it’s not sexy,” Provost said. “I have seen and I’ve done it myself. Border Patrol agents — they apprehend people. They’re hungry and they’re thirsty. They go through a drive-thru on their way to take them in and they use their own money to buy them food and something to drink. I, many a time back in the day, ran through — whether it was McDonald's usually in Douglas because there wasn’t a lot of options — but agents do those things.""

On Monday, a 16-year-old unaccompanied Guatemalan boy died while in Border Patrol custody. The death marked the fourth minor to die in Customs and Border Protection custody this fiscal year and brought criticism from immigrant groups and Democratic lawmakers concerned about overcrowded conditions at government facilities on the southern border.

Mnuchin Presses Companies for Trade War Contingency Plans,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/irs-trump-tax-returns.html,"Walmart has said that it is working on strategies to mitigate the pain of the tariffs to keep prices low. A Walmart spokesman said that it was not unusual for the company to be in touch with White House officials.

“We’re viewed by Republican and Democratic administrations as an important bellwether of the economy and the health of the American consumer,” he said, “so it’s not uncommon that current and past administrations would reach out reach out to us on important issues like this.”

Retail analysts suggested that despite such efforts, companies cannot necessarily adjust their business plans as quickly as the trade winds blow.

“It is not something that can be changed overnight,” said Christopher Mandeville, an analyst at Jefferies. “Having said that, management has been aware of tariff risk for some time now, where, in circumstances that allow for it, they could shift sourcing to nearby countries in Southeast Asia.”

Mr. Mnuchin said that his “expectation is a lot of this business will be moved from China” and that there will be only a small number of items where tariffs are passed on to consumers.

While Mr. Mnuchin has privately cautioned against tariffs, on Wednesday he argued that depreciation of China’s currency could blunt some of the effects of the tariffs by making Chinese products cheaper to buy. He also said that it was yet not certain that the next round of tariffs would be imposed, noting that Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will most likely meet at the G-20 summit meeting next month in Japan.

However, Mr. Mnuchin was far less optimistic about a deal than he was just a month ago.

“We were beginning to send out the date for the two presidents to meet and have a signing ceremony,” he said. “Unfortunately, China has taken a big step backward.”"
Dem wants Trump officials jailed for not turning over tax returns,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.

Lloyd Doggett said Tuesday that IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin should be jailed or fined for stonewalling congressional subpoenas for President Trump’s tax returns.

Doggett, D-Texas, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said Tuesday that congressional Democrats need to employ what's known as ""inherent contempt"" for Trump officials defying committee requests and subpoenas for Trump’s financial information.

CONFIDENTIAL DRAFT IRS TAX MEMO SAYS TAX RETURNS MUST BE HANDED TO CONGRESS UNLESS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE: REPORT

“I believe that there is no legal advice that will stop the lawlessness and lies of this administration, and that is why Congress needs to act firmly now to use every tool it has available to get this information that Trump so fears that the public will see,” Doggett told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Tuesday night.

“To take action, I believe it’s going to require fines or confinement under our power of inherent contempt to get the information we need and to get all these other people that, under what seems to be gang rule, are told don’t say anything and don’t provide anything,” he continued. “Total silence, total obstruction.”

Doggett later clarified who should be targeted in that effort.

“The subpoena is directed to the IRS commissioner,” Doggett explained. “But Secretary Mnuchin has never let him answer the questions—he responds with all the answers.”

“I think that both of them could be subject to fines or confinement,” he said. “I think you know there are so many people out there from [former White House counsel Don] McGahn to [Attorney General Bill] Barr, to others that are refusing to disclose and respond to the Congress.”

He added: “It’s probably a matter of selecting one of them and moving forward to show how this power of inherent contempt could work.”

Inherent contempt is one of three contempt options available to Congress, along with criminal contempt (under which an individual is charged with a crime) and civil judgment (leading to a civil court process.)

If Congress were to use inherent contempt, it would mean the Sergeant at Arms would arrest an official and hold them until they provide testimony or otherwise comply. The tactic reportedly has not been used since the 1930s, and is viewed as an extreme measure.

Congressional Democrats, though, already have threatened to take such action against Barr, who defied a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee for an unredacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report and all underlying evidence and documents. The Democrat-led committee has already recommended some form of contempt citation against Barr, while Democrats have threatened to pursue the same against McGahn after he defied a subpoena to testify before the same committee.

MNUCHIN SAYS HE WON'T COMPLY WITH SUBPOENA FOR TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS

The calls for Rettig and Mnuchin to be jailed, though, come amid a growing battle between the Trump administration and Congress, specifically the House Ways and Means Committee, over the president’s financial documents.

Just days after Mnuchin said he would not comply with a subpoena for the tax returns, a confidential draft IRS memo obtained by The Washington Post called the disclosure “mandatory,” unless the president asserts his executive privilege.

The Post published the 10-page memo that does not mention Trump by name, but appears to add new pressure on the White House. Mnuchin, though, has been resisting House Democrats’ requests for Trump’s tax returns on the grounds that such a request “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose” and said his department will not “disclose the requested returns and return information.”

But the IRS document says the law “does not allow the Secretary to exercise discretion in disclosing the information provided the statutory conditions are met” and directly rejects the reason Mnuchin has cited for withholding the information.

“[T]he Secretary’s obligation to disclose return and return information would not be affected by the failure of a tax writing committee … to state a reason for the request,” it reads, adding that the “only basis” for refusing would be “the invocation of the doctrine of executive privilege.”

But the IRS pushed back on the report, stating that the memo does not represent an official position for the agency.

“The memo in question is a draft background paper that was never finalized. It is not the official position of the IRS. The document was prepared last fall,” an IRS spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News. “The IRS Commissioner and the Chief Counsel were unaware of the paper until this week’s media inquiry. The document was not sent to Treasury.”

It is unclear whether the president would have to assert executive privilege to protect his financial documents from being exposed.

At a House Financial Services hearing on Wednesday where the tax return issue was front and center, Mnuchin testified that he never talked to anyone at the White House, or the president, about handing over tax returns to Congress.

Addressing the IRS memo, Mnuchin said he did not believe it contradicts his conclusion that Congress needs a ""legitimate legislative purpose,"" and said the memo addresses a ""different issue."" Mnuchin also said the administration is in the process of finding out who penned the memo.

The standoff between the congressional Democrats and the administration is likely to lead to a court battle, with Trump reportedly indicating he’s prepared to fight all the way to the Supreme Court.

Trump declined to reveal his tax returns during the 2016 presidential election, claiming he was under audit. Political candidates aren’t required to disclose their tax returns, though traditionally all candidates do.

The Trump White House has long been a place of internal strife, from the early days of Steve Bannon versus everyone else, to the daily sparring of John Kelly and his boss, to the current conflict between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton. According to a new report from CNN, Pompeo is frustrated by Bolton overstepping his role and circumventing the usual policy-making processes.

Since becoming national security adviser in April 2018, Bolton has hosted fewer “principals meetings” involving high-level Cabinet officials and has pursued shorter, more informal briefs with the president and his staff. Generally, he has reengineered his role “into a decision-making perch instead of a position meant to funnel information to the President,” per CNN.

At times, that’s left other top-ranking officials, including Pompeo, feeling excluded and out of the loop.

During a recent debate over how to handle North Korea, Bolton left Pompeo off messages he sent to the CIA that included a list of questions he wanted answered, according to a source in the intelligence community.

That infuriated Pompeo, who as secretary of state has led negotiations with the North Koreans. In its replies to Bolton, the CIA started sharing information with both Bolton and Pompeo.

Bolton is also reportedly holding meetings at the CIA headquarters as an easy way to keep State Department staffers from attending. One source told CNN that “John Bolton is playing secretary of State.”

Pompeo and Bolton agree on foreign policy in broad strokes and are separated mostly by degrees of hawkishness. For example, Pompeo wants to put pressure on the Iranian government, while Bolton has long been an advocate for regime change in Tehran. But the two diverge in their approach to sharing information. While Pompeo tends to be careful in his media appearances, Bolton is happy to put himself at the forefront of policy debates on television and on Twitter, to the consternation of his counterpart at State. Bolton will also attempt to use lawmakers to forward his policy goals, reportedly sending staff to the Hill in advance of representatives’ meetings with Trump, hoping they will rebroadcast an idea of his in their sessions with the president.

Not only is Bolton’s jockeying causing open conflict with Pompeo in national security meetings, Trump also appears to be frustrated by his unconventional adviser. The president reportedly said that he felt undermined by Bolton on North Korea, and that Bolton is pushing a “war agenda” on Iran, when he would prefer diplomatic talks. Naturally, the president also doesn’t like his adviser’s public-facing role. Bolton’s Twitter presence and media appearances are not “appreciated by the president,” a source close to Bolton told CNN. “He wants it to be all about him.”"
Dem rebuked after calling child deaths ‘intentional’ in fiery exchange with DHS boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-rebuked-after-calling-child-deaths-intentional-in-fiery-exchange-with-dhs-boss,"A hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee came to a screeching halt Wednesday when a Democrat had her words struck from the record after calling the deaths of children in custody at the border an ""intentional"" policy decision.

Rep. Lauren Underwood's questioning of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was contentious from the beginning, when the Illinois lawmaker asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that the continued poor conditions in which children allegedly were being kept, and the recent death of a fifth child in custody, showed that this was the administration's goal.

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

""At this point, with five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their families, I feel like, and the evidence is really clear, this is intentional,"" Underwood said. ""It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane.""

McAleenan fired back, disputing Underwood's characterization.

""That's an appalling accusation, and our men and women fight hard to protect people in our custody every single day,"" he said. McAleenan added that his department asked for resources prior to the latest fatality and that Congress has not responded. He also said that DHS asked for changes ""that would have prevented this from happening.""

Underwood's comments were in reference to the government's announcement that a 16-year-old Guatemalan died Monday at a South Texas Border Patrol station. He was diagnosed with the flu on Sunday at a border facility, which was then temporarily closed.

Last week, a 2-year-old died after he and his mother were detained. Government officials said the child was taken to the hospital the same day his mother reported he was sick, and he was in the hospital for weeks. On April 30, a 16-year-old boy also died after officials at a Health and Human Services detention facility noticed that he was sick.

Underwood was given an opportunity to clarify her remarks, and she said the same thing, using virtually identical language. ""With five children dead and 5,000 separated from their families, this is intentional. It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane,"" she reiterated.

Ranking Member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., came to McAleenan's defense, calling out Underwood for her remarks.

""Mr. Chairman, you cannot impugn the character of the witness by stating that he intentionally murders children,"" he said. ""That is completely inappropriate, and her words should be taken down. She was very explicit.""

Underwood defended herself, saying she did not use the word ""murder,"" but said that deaths were the result of policy choices.

""He has said that he stands by the policy decisions of this administration, that's what he said at the beginning of his testimony.""

McAleenan said he ""did not say that at all.""

FORMER OBAMA DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY ON INCREASING NUMBER OF BORDER APPREHENSIONS

Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., first allowed Underwood's words to remain on the record, stating that ""the language is approprite and that it should not be taken down.""

This eventually led to a vote over whether to take down Underwood's words from the record.

After a 9-7 vote, Underwood's words were taken down.

Underwood later took to Twitter to comment on what happened.

""For over a year, it’s been clear that policies at the border have harmed the physical and mental health of migrant children,"" she said. ""I believe, at this point, failure to change these broken policies based on that knowledge is intentional and unacceptable.""

And by some strange coincidence, he is considering these pardons as the most notorious of American war prisoners -- the ""American Taliban"" John Walker Lindh -- is scheduled to be released Thursday, after serving 17 years of a 20-year sentence

The presidential power to pardon is near-absolute in the Constitution -- ""except in cases of impeachment.""

But no previous recent president has pardoned a murderer. Until Trump.

People march to demand the release of Puerto Rican nationalist Oscar Lopez Rivera near the White House in Washington, DC, on January 11, 2017, shortly before Obama commuted his sentence.

Data on the Justice Department's website includes the nature of a pardoned person's crime only back through George H.W. Bush. Note: Most murders are prosecuted at the state and not the federal level.

led to deaths. Obama and President Bill Clinton also commuted the sentences of violent revolutionaries fighting for Puerto Rican independence responsible for multiple bombings in the US during the '70s and '80s. But they gave clemency only to those whose crimes had notled to deaths.

Trump crossed that line this month when he pardoned Michael Behenna , who had been sentenced to prison in 2009 for unpremeditated murder in the killing of an Iraqi detainee and released on parole in 2014 after his sentence was reduced.

That Trump is considering other pardons for military crimes on a short timeline before Memorial Day took the Department of Justice and the Pentagon by surprise and added new context to the pardon power, which he's already used to reward political allies and send political messages.

Here's a look at the history and practice of presidential pardons for service members.

Trump's praise for war crimes, shooting deserters

JUST WATCHED Trump tweets debunked legend about US general Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump tweets debunked legend about US general 01:25

This issue first and foremost recalls Trump's repeated endorsement of behavior that could easily be classified as war criminal.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump admiringly repeated an apocryphal story about Gen. John Pershing shooting Muslim prisoners with bullets dipped in pig blood -- because it violated Muslim law -- in the Philippines more than 100 years ago

wasn't a true story, but the point is that Trump liked it. He liked the idea of US troops killing 49 prisoners and disrespecting their religion in order to make the 50th tell other people what had happened. It probably wasn't a true story, but the point is that Trump liked it. He liked the idea of US troops killing 49 prisoners and disrespecting their religion in order to make the 50th tell other people what had happened.

It would also be a war crime to shoot prisoners.

Trump said US soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held as a prisoner of war for years in Afghanistan, should be shot for desertion after he walked off his base in 2009. A military court gave Bergdahl no additional prison time after he pleaded guilty.

The new chapter in the annals of Trump and military justice is the news, first reported in The New York Times, that he's considering pardons for two American service members who are anticipating trial on murder charges.

He's also looking at the case of Marines convicted of urinating on dead bodies and the case of a contractor, once employed by Erik Prince's now-defunct Blackwater security company, convicted in federal court of first-degree murder for his role in the killing of 14 Iraqis in 2007.

But it is the idea of pardons for accused service members who have not yet gone to trial and been convicted that is raising the most concern for some military law experts.

Army Maj. Matthew Golsteyn divulged his role in the killing of a bomb maker in Afghanistan during a job interview with the CIA and subsequently in a Fox News interview. The Army says the killing was premeditated and Golsteyn is set to stand trial. He could face the death penalty.

Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher is charged with stabbing a wounded man to death, shooting at a male and female noncombatant and obstructing justice while deployed in Iraq. His own teammates turned him in, but Gallagher, who has pleaded not guilty, has found defenders in the media and on Capitol Hill.

Navy SEAL Chief Edward Gallagher is charged with murder of Iraqi civilians.

He was allowed to leave the brig after Trump tweeted about the case. The President also tweeted about Golsteyn.

""At the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a 'U.S. Military hero,' Major Matt Golsteyn, who is charged with murder. He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas. @PeteHegseth @FoxNews""

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2018

The closest a modern president has come to a pardon for war crimes was Richard Nixon's treatment of William Calley, who was convicted of premeditated murder for his role in the Vietnam War My Lai massacre of unarmed civilians in 1968. Nixon released him to house arrest and his life sentence was commuted by Nixon's secretary of the army, Howard Calloway

The first difficulty of assessing war crimes in the US is that there is no commonly accepted definition of the term and the US is not a party to the Rome Statute, which created the International Criminal Court in 1998. In fact, the Trump administration recently revoked visas for the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor, which CNN reported was part of an effort by the US to deter ICC actions against US service members in Afghanistan.

That doesn't mean the US military is not prosecuting those suspected of war crimes, according to Chris Jenks, a law professor at the Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law who is a former Army judge advocate. Jenks is an expert in the law of armed conflict who wrote about possible Trump pardons for the Just Security blog . He answered some questions about Trump's possible move and what it could mean for the military justice system.

What is a war crime and are US service members charged with war crimes?

Lt. William Calley walks from Fort Benning, GA. stockade, April 1, 1971. Calley was convicted for his part in the 1968 My Lai massacre incident of the Vietnam War. President Richard Nixon ordered him placed under house arrest during appeal.

""As a general proposition, when people say war crimes within the international legal community, what we're talking about is serious violations of the law of armed conflict or international humanitarian law, serious violations of the laws of war,"" said Jenks.

He pointed out that Calley was not charged with a war crime, but rather hundreds of charges of murder. Similarly, he said Sgt. Robert Bales, who killed 16 Afghan civilians , was charged with multiple counts of murder, even though, as Jenks said, ""I would tell you under international law definitions Sgt. Bales committed one or more war crimes.""

Is there any precedent for what Trump is doing?

""In terms of has there ever been an instance where the commander in chief has preemptively pardoned a US service member facing a court-martial for murder? No, I'm not aware of that,"" said Jenks.

""You have an entire military justice apparatus,"" he said, which is set up to make sure justice is served. It starts with the Navy SEALs who reported Gallagher, for example, continues through the Naval Criminal Investigative Service agents who collected evidence and the admiral who recommended that Gallagher be prosecuted.

""What's the point of having the military justice system if it's not allowed to operate?"" asked Jenks. ""What are you saying to the commanders and the judge advocates who participate in the process when you don't let the military justice process proceed?""

Are there adequate protections for US service members accused of war crimes?

Given that American service members are operating in war zones, it's important that they have protection from the US government.

""If there was ever a circumstance by which I was accused of serious wrongdoing and I was offered a choice of being prosecuted in a state court, a federal court, or a military court, I would run to a military court because of the protections and the process that it affords service members, frankly, well in excess of the protections and processes that are afforded in state and federal court,"" said Jenks.

He said there is a larger problem underlying Trump's potential pardons, which is that service members are standing accused of these crimes but also standing in judgment of each other.

""The broader unstated point is the President and those who support pardons are trying to position themselves as this is an us against them. But when you think about who is the us and who is the them -- it's US service members on both sides of this equation.""

He argued that after the criminal justice system is allowed to work, the decision to pardon becomes a matter of judgment. There is precedent for preemptive pardons, however. More on that in a moment.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said on CNN that usurping the military justice system will hurt the military as a whole.

""If you lose control of your forces, you're no longer a military force, you're just a mob,"" said Hertling, a CNN analyst.

Chelsea Manning and war crimes

Obama did not pardon but rather commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the convicted leaker of classified information to WikiLeaks -- drawing widespread criticism since Manning arguably jeopardized national security. Supporters argue she uncovered US war crimes , like the killing of Iraqi civilians, including two who worked for Reuters. In that instance, perhaps proving how difficult and rare it is for the military to seek charges against its members, the only charges that were brought after an investigation into those killings were the ones against Manning for her leaks.

Unrelated to her commutation, Manning was ordered back to jail this month after refusing to testify before a grand jury as part of a federal investigation into Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.

Confederates and draft dodgers pardoned

There have been massive military-related pardons in American history. President Andrew Johnson pardoned Confederate soldiers after the Civil War . More than 100 years later, President Jimmy Carter essentially pardoned Confederate President Jefferson Davis by posthumously restoring his citizenship. Carter also, on his first day in office, pardoned draft dodgers after Vietnam."

In response to a question from Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, about proposed tariffs and potentially higher prices on items including diapers, infant formula and strollers, Mnuchin said he discussed such concerns with Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs.

""I can tell you I am monitoring the situation very carefully. I was on phone with the CFO of Walmart, which obviously is one of the biggest sellers of the items that you've described to specifically understand from Walmart what things they can source from other areas and what items they can't,"" Mnuchin said at the House Financial Services Committee hearing.

""I would say we haven't made any decisions yet, but we will be especially sensitive to the consumer items,"" Mnuchin said.

Mnuchin added that he speaks with Biggs on a ""regular basis"" and has ""spoken to all of the major companies that provide consumer goods"" about the issue. Asked for comment, Walmart reiterated statements from its first-quarter earnings call made by Biggs and the chief executive of its U.S. arm, Greg Foran.

""In regards to tariffs, we continue to monitor the situation. Our goal is always to be the low price leader and we'll continue to actively manage pricing and margins with our customers and shareholders in mind,"" Biggs said Thursday. ""We're going to continue to do everything we can to keep prices low, that's who we are. However, increased tariffs will lead to increased prices we believe for our customers.""

Foran later added on the earnings call: ""Merchants are managing costs and retails on an item by item basis. We are working closely with domestic and international suppliers to drive higher efficiency and reduce costs."""
"Trump USDA is paying millions to a shady Brazilian meatpacking company under DOJ, SEC investigation",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-usda-is-paying-millions-to-a-shady-brazilian-meatpacking-company-under-doj-sec-investigation,"A massive Brazilian meatpacking company is raking in millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars even while two federal agencies are investigating the corruption-addled parent company of the meatpacker.

In January, the Department of Agriculture purchased $22.3 million worth of pork from JBS USA, a subsidiary of the Brazil-based company JBS SA. But the one hand doesn't seem to know what the other is doing. While USDA is contracting with JBS, the Justice Department and the Securities Exchange Commission are investigating the parent company, J&F Investimentos, for ""potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,"" according to D.C. court documents reviewed by the Washington Examiner from September 2018.

A USDA spokesperson defended the agency's contract with JBS in a prepared statement sent to the Washington Examiner. “USDA buys American commodities, produced on American farms by American farmers. [USDA's Agriculture Marketing Service] obtains and maintains approved vendors who have proven they can procure these U.S.-produced products. This means that regardless of who the vendor is, the products purchased are grown in the U.S. and benefit U.S. farmers. JBS qualifies as a bidder under this criteria. This is similar to someone buying JBS bacon in a grocery store. Regardless of the packaging, the bacon inside is from a hog grown on an American farm.”

The DOJ and SEC declined to comment.

The current trade war with China, which is hurting U.S. farmers, has resulted in even more taxpayer money flowing to JBS. The company has pocketed more than $64 million in federal payments through Trump's special trade-war bailout program for farmers.

JBS SA is the largest meat processing company in the world. According to its 2018 earnings, it has a net income of $45 billion. J&F Investimentos is wholly owned by Joesley and Wesley Batista, billionaire brothers who confessed to and served prison time for bribing hundreds of officials in the Brazilian government.

The Batista brothers' complex and ongoing court case in Brazil took a strange turn this past week after Wesley Batista was indicted by a Brazilian federal court for insider trading. If convicted, he could serve a prison sentence of one to five years and a hefty fine.

On top of the DOJ and SEC investigations, the Batista brothers are also closely connected to Diosdado Cabello, the president of the Nicolás Maduro-backed Venezuelan National Assembly, through a $2.1 billion meat and poultry contract in 2015. In 2017, it was reported that Cabello put out an assassination order against Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., according to U.S. intelligence. Rubio's office has not yet responded to a request for comment.

The U.S. cattle industry has long battled with JBS, which it accuses of illegally colluding with other meat packers to drive down prices. The ranchers point to the many investigations swirling around the Brazilian company. In June 2017, Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America, the largest cattle association in the country, called on the Trump administration to move forward on an antitrust investigation into the company, citing its corrupt practices and its negative impact on farmers.

On Tuesday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue urging him ""to immediately cease any existing or future bailout payments to foreign-owned corporations, like the Brazilian-owned meatpacker JBS, and remove them from your approved and eligible vendors list.""

Blumenthal's office did not respond to a request for comment."
DHS press secretary to leave post for position at State Department,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/22/politics/dhs-press-secretary-leaving-for-state-department/index.html,"(CNN) Department of Homeland Security press secretary Tyler Q. Houlton is leaving his position at the end of the week after nearly two years delivering the public message for a department that has been at the center of the Trump administration's focus on immigration and many of its controversial policies.

Houlton's last day at DHS is Friday and he is expected to remain in the administration, taking a position as a senior adviser at the State Department. CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.

His departure from the department is the latest in a wave of changes at DHS headquarters, including at top leadership positions, stemming from the forced resignation last month of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

The departures included the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as a leadership shakeup at US Secret Service, Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration.

After Nielsen left the department, CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan was appointed as acting secretary, bringing a number of CBP staff with him to headquarters.

You’ve never seen a House member elected president. Neither have your parents — nor, in all likelihood, their parents. The last time it happened, there were 38 states and electricity was a novelty.

Never in American history has a sitting mayor been elected president, or even received a major party’s nomination. But three — Mr. de Blasio, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla. — are running now.

In 2016, when Republicans had a field almost as big as the Democrats do now, it included no House members or mayors. Of the 17 candidates, nine were sitting or former governors, and five were sitting or former senators.

But, of course, all those governors and senators lost to Donald J. Trump, who had no political experience at all. Before Mr. Trump was elected, no one had ever become president without a background in government or the military. Now, it’s harder to say what the bar is — or whether voters care.

As the chart above shows, a small number of offices have produced the vast majority of our presidents. A governorship is the most common steppingstone. This year, though, only three of the 23 Democratic candidates are (or were) governors, and all of them are trailing in polls.

While the vice presidency might seem the most obvious launching pad for the presidency, only five people have done what Joseph R. Biden Jr. is trying to do now: get elected after completing his vice presidency. Fourteen presidents were previously vice presidents, but nine of them took over when a president died or resigned. (Four of those nine went on to win a full term.)

Cabinet secretaries were elected president much more often in the early days of the republic than they are now. Hillary Clinton came close in 2016. But of the six presidents whose highest previous office was in the cabinet, four were elected before 1850, and the most recent, Herbert Hoover, was elected almost 100 years ago.

Senators occupy an interesting space in modern presidential history: frequently nominated but rarely elected. Since 1960, Americans have elected only two senators — John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama — to the presidency, but five more received their party’s nomination. This year, however, seven are running for the Democratic nomination, and most of the front-runners are among them.

By the time you get down to the House, the history is paper-thin, and thinner still for rank-and-file members. Garfield, the last House member elected, was a committee chairman.

But the six 2020 candidates in this category have one thing going for them: They are not the least experienced in the pack.

Two of their competitors, Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang, are following a path on which nobody but Mr. Trump has been successful: They are running for president with no political or military experience at all."

The May 8 document lists criteria for when Defense Department officials are allowed to provide congressional offices or committees with information regarding operational plans and orders, according to the newspaper.

The Pentagon hit back at the criticism, saying the new policy is intended to increase transparency between the Pentagon and Congress.

“In establishing this policy, Secretary Shanahan seeks to increase transparency and information-sharing with Congress. Under his direction, the Department of Defense has been engaging with the Senate and House Armed Services Committees to develop a process for providing Congress with access to plans and operational orders, including Executive Orders. This policy establishes such a process. Previously, no such policy existed,” Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said in a statement to The Hill.

The memo, which was reportedly shared widely within the Pentagon but was sent to key lawmakers after inquiries from the Post, lists six guidelines for information sharing with Capitol Hill.

The document orders military officials and political appointees to determine whether a congressional request “contains sufficient information to demonstrate a relationship to the legislative function” and urges officials to provide a summary briefing instead of the requested plan or order itself.

It also gives responsibility for evaluating congressional requests to the undersecretary of Defense for policy, often a political appointee. Officials across the Pentagon previously responded to requests on an ad hoc basis.

The memo appears to arise from worries that lawmakers could leak military plans, calling on officials to evaluate “whether the degree of protection from unauthorized disclosure that Congress will afford to the plan is equivalent to that afforded” by the Pentagon, according to the Post.

The Energy 202: EPA blocks a dozen products containing pesticides thought harmful to bees,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy', 'May At Am']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/22/the-energy-202-epa-blocks-a-dozen-products-containing-pesticides-thought-harmful-to-bees/5ce46c34a7a0a46b92a3fd6a/,"THE LIGHTBULB

The Environmental Protection Agency is pulling from the market a dozen products containing pesticides known to be toxic to a linchpin of the U.S. food system — the honeybee.

The agency announced Monday it has canceled the registrations of 12 pest-killing products with compounds belonging to a class of chemicals known as neonicotinoids, as part of a legal settlement.

For years, beekeepers and wildlife conversationalists alike have voiced concern that the widespread use of neonics, as the chemicals are commonly called, is imperiling wild and domesticated bees crucial to pollinating commercial fruit, nut and vegetable crops.

The Trump administration's action was welcome news to some environmentalists. “Certainly we have a ways to go,” said George Kimbrell, legal director at the nonprofit advocacy group Center for Food Safety, whose lawsuit prompted the EPA’s action. “But it's an important first step in acknowledging the harm they cause.”

The EPA has pulled other neonics from market before, agency spokesman John Konkus said in an email. But close observers of the agency say such actions are rare.

“For the EPA to pull a previously registered pesticide is a pretty major step,” said Mark Winston, a professor of apiculture and social insects at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, B.C. “It’s not something they do very often.”

The decision follows five years of litigation in which the beekeepers and environmentalists pressed the agency to mount a response to the use of neonics as regulators in Europe and Canada have taken steps toward banning the chemicals.

Finally, at the end of 2018, three agribusinesses — Bayer, Syngenta and Valent — agreed to let the EPA pull from shelves the 12 pesticide products used by growers ranging from large-scale agricultural businesses to home gardeners. The legal settlement also compels the EPA to analyze the impacts of the entire neonic class on endangered species.

Two of the pesticide makers, Bayer and Valent, say their products are tested and safe to use, noting that the environmentalists and beekeepers won their case on the technical grounds that the EPA did not follow the right steps under the Endangered Species Act when registering their products.

“Neonicotinoids are rigorously tested before going to market to ensure they can be used safely and effectively,” said Steve Tatum, a spokesman for Valent, which makes four of the delisted products.

Bayer noted its two products targeted by the EPA action are not sold in the United States. But spokesman Darren Wallis added: “Growers rely on these critical pest-management tools because of their performance against destructive pests, as well as their favorable human and environmental safety profile.”

Concern over neonics has grown since 2006, when beekeepers first started witnessing the sudden and mysterious collapse of honeybee hives across the nation.

Researchers have shown the compounds to be harmful to bees in laboratory tests. But they have had less luck pinning down the pesticides’ effects on beekeepers’ colonies when they go about their work pollinating apple orchards and other farms.

In his second term Barack Obama, who had earlier approved installing a beehive on the South Lawn of the White House, launched an initiative to promote the health of honeybees and other pollinators.

But Rebecca Riley, legal director of the nature program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that the agency has failed often in the past to adequately consider the potential impact of its pesticide approvals on endangered animals — something every federal agency is supposed to do.

“EPA for years has been ignoring this requirement of the law,” she said.

That has led to a number of lawsuits, such as one the NRDC filed in 2017, asking a federal court to vacate the registrations of nearly 100 products that contain one of several insecticides that are harmful to various bees, butterflies, birds and insects. That case remains unresolved, even as the separate Center for Food Safety case led EPA to pull some pesticides from the market.

“This is a win for both the rule of law and also for bees, birds and other wildlife impacted by these pesticides,” Riley said of the latest case. “But the reality is there are hundreds of pesticide products on the market. So, this is important … but it does not get rid of the danger.”

— EPA doesn't send rep to hearing: Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to send a representative to testify during a hearing about a Trump administration proposal to roll back Obama-era mercury regulations. “I am continually frustrated and surprised by the administration's refusal to send witnesses to Congress,” she said. “And the EPA's refusal to show up today is just another example of the efforts to block Congress from performing its oversight functions. And so we're going to have to move forward, but it would be really helpful if we had the agencies here to help us.”

— Nominee for top Interior Dept. lawyer advances: The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced the president’s pick to be the Interior Department solicitor, Daniel Jorjani, on a party-line vote. Jorjani advanced despite objections from Democrats including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who criticized the nominee during Tuesday’s panel meeting. “It concerns me Mr. Jorjani has spent the past two years he served as acting solicitor overturning prior interpretations of our public lands laws in a manner that is out of step with the congressional intent,” Manchin said in a statement. “The Solicitor must uphold the law above all else—above party, politics, and ideology. That was not the sense I got from Mr. Jorjani’s responses to our questions.”

— Texas bill could penalize pipeline protesters: Under a new bill approved by both chambers in Texas’s state legislature, protesters who are found to have delayed pipeline operations or otherwise damaged equipment could face up to a decade in prison. “The Texas Oil & Gas Association applauded its passage and said the bill provides property owners and pipeline companies ‘greater protections against intentional damage, delays, and stoppages caused by illegal activity,’” Bloomberg News reports. “Environmental groups, meanwhile, called the measure an assault on free speech.” Cyrus Reed, interim director for the Sierra Club’s Texas chapter, said the bill is about “silencing protesters trying to protect their water and land.”

— The reality of plastic pollution: A new study found there are about 414 million pieces of debris scattered across the remote Cocos Islands of Australia, which could be an underestimate because a lot of the waste is below the surface, NBC News reports. The findings could suggest the amount of plastic polluting the world could be much more than previously realized. “The scientists surveyed seven of the 27 islands, which made up 88 percent of the total landmass of the islands, and estimated that they were littered with 262 tons of plastic. A quarter of those pieces of debris were single-use or disposable items such as straws, bags and toothbrushes (about 373,000 of them). The researchers also identified about 977,000 shoes,” per the report.

— A wild spring storm: A powerful spring system drove a variety of extreme weather throughout the country on Monday and Tuesday, with serious flooding and more than 20 tornadoes blasting through the Southern Plains, The Post’s Jason Samenow reports. ""Flash flooding proved to be more of a widespread hazard than the tornadoes,” he writes. “Flooding spread from the north and west sides of Oklahoma City northeast to Tulsa, where four to eight inches of rain fell in a short time. Roads were closed, and numerous high-water rescues were required.”

After two years of disturbing increases, the preliminary FBI statistics for the first six months of 2018 demonstrate a sustained reduction in violent crime. The numbers show a 6.7 percent decline in murders, a 12.5 percent decline in robbery, and a 12.7 percent decline in burglary compared to the first six months of 2017.

This is a win for the American people and especially for those communities most impacted by violent crime.

GERMANY REPORTS DROP IN CRIME, 96% OF HOMICIDE CASES CLEARED

Such decreases were not predestined. From 2014 to 2016, nationwide violent crime increased by nearly 7 percent -- with a troubling 21 percent increase in the murder rate. 2015 alone saw an 11 percent increase in murders, the largest annual increase since 1968.

Some of our large cities suffered the brunt of this violent crime spike with the murder rate rising in 22 of the 34 largest cities in 2016.

Following this significant increase in violent crime and murder, the Department of Justice under President Trump is committed to addressing the problem in a smart, systematic manner.

One of the government’s flagship programs is Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a nationwide strategy that brings together federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement -- and the communities they serve -- to address the most pressing violent crime issues and develop comprehensive solutions to address them.

Project Safe Neighborhoods is premised on three guiding principles. First, the best way to reduce violent crime is to target the most violent offenders. Research has shown that repeat violent offenders -- a small percentage of the overall criminal population -- are responsible for a grossly disproportionate number of violent crimes.

Second, local jurisdictions need to tailor enforcement to meet their specific needs. PSN is effective because it is not a Washington-centered, “one-size-fits-all” program. Every jurisdiction faces unique challenges, so federal authorities are working with local stakeholders to tailor methods and strategies to their respective communities. Using both pooled intelligence and the latest technology, law enforcement can target and interdict those who are the greatest threats to our communities.

Third, the approach must be comprehensive.

To have long-term, sustained reductions in the violent crime rate, we must dedicate resources to reach at-risk individuals and improve reentry outcomes for criminals who have completed their sentences.

The Department provides millions of dollars to support these programs nationwide. We are already seeing strong signs of progress.

To further decrease violent crime, the Department of Justice has focused on enforcing our gun laws.

Gun crime in America is driven by the illegal use and possession of firearms, including by felons and drug traffickers. In fact, according to a 2016 study of gun crimes in a major American city, 80 percent of firearms recovered by police were from people who were not the lawful owners. In fiscal year 2018, the Department of Justice prosecuted nearly 20 percent more firearms offenders than it did in 2017, and 30% more than it did in 2016.

But effective violent crime reduction is not simply about increasing prosecution rates -- it is about minimizing the number of crime victims by taking the most violent criminals off the streets.

To do so, our PSN partners have leveraged effective and innovative crime-fighting strategies, such as Crime Gun Intelligence Centers and focused deterrence models. Each U.S. Attorney is working with his or her local partners and stakeholders to identify the worst offenders and bring them to justice.

Preventing violent crime by enforcing the law is not a partisan issue; it is an issue for all Americans. Nobody takes that mission more seriously than the men and women of the Department of Justice and our partners in law enforcement. Through programs such as PSN, the Department of Justice under President Trump will continue vigorously to prosecute society’s most violent offenders, working to make every American neighborhood safer."
DHS warns of 'strong concerns' that Chinese-made drones are stealing data,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/20/politics/dhs-chinese-drone-warning/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert issued Monday obtained by CNN.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" the alert says.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities,"" the alert adds.

E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Pollution Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama-era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted.

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter — the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream — is linked to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease."

Senate Democrats on Tuesday hammered a top Treasury Department official over a bombshell report that Deutsche Bank resisted reporting suspicious financial activity tied to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose companies were clients of the German lender.

One after another, Democrats at a Senate Banking Committee hearing that focused on anonymous shell company abuse urged the director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Kenneth Blanco, to take action on the New York Times story.

Story Continued Below

Blanco's agency, known as FinCEN, is responsible for policing illegal money laundering and would have received any so-called suspicious activity reports filed by Deutsche Bank. According to the Times, bank employees prepared the reports but were blocked by executives.

""The alleged facts are in plain sight,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said. ""It's essential it seems to me to the public trust and the integrity of FinCEN that these be actively pursued.""

Despite the pummeling by Democrats — not a single Republican at the hearing brought up Deutsche Bank — Blanco said he was unable to comment on allegations made in the story, which he said he had been briefed on but had not read.

""You're a very smart man,"" Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), responded. ""It wouldn't take very long to read it, but it might be very informative to you.""

""Just because it's in the newspaper doesn't mean it’s true,"" Blanco said. ""I'm not saying it's false, either.""

Blanco suggested that the bank might have been comfortable with the risks it was taking with Trump.

""Everything is fact-specific,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, it could be quite appropriate.""

Before Tuesday's hearing, Van Hollen and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking him to confirm the accuracy of the Times story and to divulge how many suspicious activity reports were quashed.

"Did Interior break the law in eyeing oil, gas leases in the former Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument? Dems want new probe.",https://www.sltrib.com,"['Tburr Sltrib.Com', 'Thomas Burr']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2019/05/22/did-interior-break-law/,"Washington • A New Mexico senator and Minnesota congresswoman are asking for an investigation of whether the Interior Department broke the law in conducting studies about possibly leasing land for oil and gas drilling in original boundaries of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.

President Donald Trump cut 900,000 acres of the then-1.9 million acre monument in 2017, a move heralded by Utah’s GOP leaders but one that brought a swift rebuke by environmental groups who immediately sued the president.

The Bureau of Land Management, which maintains the monument area, has been in the process of creating a management plan for the region, which now includes three smaller monuments. One of the four potential management plans identified some 660,000 acres for possible leasing.

But a little-noticed provision tacked on to every budget for the Interior Department since 2002 says that it cannot use any taxpayer money to conduct pre-leasing studies on lands contained in monuments as they existed on Jan. 20, 2001.

(The Bears Ears National Monument created by President Barack Obama wouldn’t be covered under the budget language because it didn’t exist in 2001. Trump shrunk that monument as well in 2017.)

But the provision would apply to Grand Staircase-Escalante, which was designated by President Bill Clinton in 1996.

Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., told Interior Secretary David Bernhardt on Wednesday that he believes the department violated the law and will ask the Government Accountability Office to investigate.

“How is this pre-leasing work not a violation of appropriations law?” Udall asked Bernhardt.

“I don't think it is but I will go look at it,” the secretary responded.

“I hope you look at it because it's pretty clear to me,” Udall said.

“Roger,” Bernhardt retorted.

There have been no leases doled out in the original boundaries of the monument but the government has identified possible acreage it could lease later on as part of a management planning process.

Udall and Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., sent a letter to the GAO on Wednesday afternoon asking it to specifically investigate whether Interior’s actions violated its budget act and, if so, if the department also violated the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits a government agency from spending money without the approval of Congress.

Nada Culver, senior counsel for The Wilderness Society, which has sued the Trump administration over its dismantling of the Grand Staircase and Bears Ears monuments, said Interior's actions are not surprising.

“The Trump administration’s Department of Interior has a pattern of ignoring the law in their rush to sell out public lands for exploitation by private interests and the fossil fuel industry, and this planning process appears to be no different,” Culver said. “Thankfully, Senator Udall and Congresswoman McCollum are holding the Department accountable by asking the GAO to look into the Department’s likely violations in rushing forward plans to open up Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to drilling and mining.”"
Lawmakers slam Trump's pick for defense secretary over new oversight policy,https://www.cnn.com,['Ryan Browne'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/22/politics/shanahan-pentagon-oversight/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The senior Democrat and Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee criticized acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan over a new policy which they say seeks to limit congressional oversight of the Pentagon.

The statement refers to a Shanahan-approved Pentagon memo , which has been obtained by CNN, and is dated May 8.

The memo stipulates that when a Department of Defense ""component receives a congressional request for access to an operational plan or operational order the DoD component will forward the request"" to a senior official who will review it using a series of criteria to include ""whether the request contains sufficient information to demonstrate a relationship to a legislative function"" and ""whether the request implicates presidential decision-making or the President's prerogatives as the Commander in Chief.""

The move comes after the California Democrat said last week that he would hold a ""business meeting"" Wednesday to take an unspecified ""enforcement action"" against the Justice Department for not complying with his subpoena for counterintelligence information related to Mueller's report.

The Justice Department on Tuesday offered to give the committee access to a less redacted version of the first volume of Mueller's 448-page report — the section discussing alleged ties between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Moscow — and identify other documents related to the special counsel's investigation if House Democrats dropped its threat to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. The House Judiciary Committee has already voted to hold Barr in contempt for not complying with that panel's subpoena for an unredacted version of Mueller report.

Schiff said the Justice Department would begin turning over to the committee ""twelve categories of counterintelligence and foreign intelligence materials as part of an initial rolling production"" and noted that ""the initial production should be completed by the end of next week.""

The committee was expected to vote Wednesday on an enforcement action regarding Barr's subpoena, but Schiff said that meeting had been postponed as a result of the department's agreement. The subpoena, however, will remain in effect and will be enforced should the Justice Department fail to comply with the committee's full request, he added.

""The Department has repeatedly acknowledged the Committee's legitimate oversight interest in these materials,"" Schiff said. ""I look forward to — and expect — continued compliance by the Department so we can do our vital oversight work.""

The agreement between the Justice Department and the House Intelligence Committee represents a rare detente and comes amid escalating tensions between the White House and House Democrats over investigations on issues including foreign election interference, alleged mismanagement in the White House security clearance procedures, the president's finances and his immigration policies.

Since the Democrats seized control of the House of Representatives in January, current and former Trump administration officials have faced a barrage of subpoenas, demands to testify before a host of congressional panels and letters seeking a flurry of documents. But the White House has often ignored congressional requests for documents and witnesses, claiming that the demands are an unconstitutional infringement on the president's powers. Democrats, meanwhile, have accused the Trump administration of stonewalling or flat-out ignoring their requests for documents and information.

The executive branch's attempts to push back against congressional inquiries targeting the White House have led a growing number of Democrats to contemplate new ways to compel current and former West Wing aides to acquiesce to their demands, including heightening calls to open impeachment proceedings against the president. Some Democrats have even proposed personally fining or jailing administration officials who do not comply with their requests."

Corn: Flawed USDA Forecast Creates Tremendous Opportunity,https://seekingalpha.com,['Atlas Research'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4265517-corn-flawed-usda-forecast-creates-tremendous-opportunity,"Normally, incompetence costs you dearly... but on May 10th, government incompetence created tremendous opportunity.

Regular readers know that I often disagree with government forecasts. Last month, I argued that the energy information agency (""EIA"") is likely overestimating the new supply coming from U.S. gas producers this year. You see, in my experience, government forecasters often simply extrapolate the prevailing trends into the future. Shale drillers supplied a lot of new gas in 2018... so why not just project more of the same in 2019? I detailed the evidence indicating why that projection was likely wrong in last month's article. So far, the available data confirms that gas production growth has slowed to a crawl in 2019.

In the case of the corn market, government forecasters simply plugged in an expected yield for this year's corn crop that closely matched the yield of previous years. Now in a normal year, this method of extrapolation might work out just fine. But 2019 is no normal year...

In this article, I'll explain why the USDA simply got it wrong with their latest estimate for corn yield, and thus corn production, for the current corn crop. And I'll show how this faulty forecast created a tremendous contrarian opportunity in the corn (NYSEARCA:CORN) market.

First, let's start with a basic overview of today's corn market.

Corn Supply and Demand Overview

Like any other commodity, analyzing the corn market is all about estimating future supply and demand. U.S. corn demand typically fluctuates by 1-2% annually, with longer-term corn demand driven by GDP and population growth. Shorter-term fluctuations can be influenced by changes in ethanol consumption since corn-based ethanol is used as a gasoline additive. Corn demand also fluctuates with shorter-term changes in consumption for livestock feed and exports.

For the 2018/2019 corn crop year (August 2018 through September 2019), the USDA estimates total corn consumption of 14.5 billion bushels. That's down 2% from 14.8 billion bushels last year, due to a 150 million decline in corn for ethanol production and a 138 million drop in corn exports. For the upcoming 2019/2020 crop year, the USDA forecasts corn demand growth of 1.2% to 14.7 billion bushels, boosted by higher feed demand and a rebound in corn usage for ethanol production.

Of course, the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China has created a lot of headline hype in the agriculture sector. And yes, some crops have taken a big hit from Chinese buyers pulling out of the market, namely soybeans. But the U.S. corn crop remains insulated from these trade tensions. Why? For one, U.S. corn exports to China have already suffered a more than 90% decline over the last several years:

The reasons for this drop are beyond the scope of this article. But here's the bottom line...

The U.S. consumes roughly 80% of its 14-15 billion bushels of its domestic corn production annually. And of the 2.3 billion bushels that we sold abroad last year, China bought just 15 million bushels. That's less than 1% of total U.S. corn exports and only 0.1% of total U.S. production. In other words, even a full-blown trade war would have little direct impact on the American corn market.

So there shouldn't be any big surprises in the demand picture this year. That leaves supply as the key factor driving corn prices today. And this is where the trade war has created an indirect headwind for corn prices. Let me explain...

Low Soybean Prices = More Corn Planting

Each year, many American farmers have the choice between growing corn or soybeans on their farmland. And unlike corn, trade tensions have dealt a major blow to U.S. soybean exports, pushing prices down to around $8 per bushel - the lowest level in over a decade. Depressed soybean prices have incentivized farmers to switch from soybeans to corn for the 2019/2020 crop year.

According to the latest USDA estimates, soybean acreage will drop from 89.2 million acres last year to 84.6 million acres this year, while corn acreage will rise from 89.1 million acres to 92.8 million acres. This 92.8 million planted acres translate into 85.4 million harvested acres, assuming normal crop loss rates. And if you assume a normal yield of 176 bushels per harvested acre, that means U.S. corn farmers will grow 15 billion bushels of corn this year - up 4.2% from last year's 14.4 billion bushel crop.

This projected production growth will handily outpace the expected 1.2% increase in consumption, thereby driving up corn ""ending stocks"" (the official term for corn inventories) to a massive 2.485 billion bushels, based on the following USDA projections:

The chart below puts this 2.485 billion bushel estimate for corn ending stocks into historical perspective...

So it's no surprise that corn prices tanked immediately following the release of these estimates in the USDA's most recent WASDE report released on Friday, May 10th. Prices fell from $3.54 to as low as $3.45 on the heels of that report and continued dropping to $3.43 the following Monday morning, exacerbated by escalating trade war rhetoric over the weekend.

For those who follow me on Twitter you may have seen me release the following tweet and chart, alerting my followers of a tremendous contrarian opportunity in the corn market on Monday morning:

""#Corn capitulation creating terrific opportunity to harvest irrational trade war-inspired volatility this morning. #bullish""

And here's what happened next…

By aggressively selling put options on corn futures, I captured thousands of dollars in option premiums in just a few trading days last week. I don't say this to brag...ok, maybe a little. But more importantly, I want to point out that commodity markets and government forecasters can occasionally get things very, very wrong. And when they do, you can make a lot of money by simply adding two and two together to get four. That's precisely what I did when analyzing the corn market last week. Here's the simple math I used to figure that the fear in the corn market was unjustified…

Basic Logic Shows the Fallacy of the USDA's 2019 Corn Yield Forecast

Each month, the USDA puts out a monthly WASDE (World Agriculture Supply and Demand Estimate) report estimating supply and demand for agricultural products, including corn. The following excerpt below from the latest WASDE report released on Friday, May 10th, which details how U.S. corn inventories would balloon to the aforementioned multi-decade high level of 2,485 million bushels. In this report, the USDA made one key assumption when calculating this year's production - a normal yield (circled in red) based on ""assuming normal mid-May planting progress"" (highlighted in yellow):

And that single assumption was all I needed to know that the USDA's forecaster inventory number was completely unrealistic and just plain way too bearish. Why? Two words: late planting.

You see, each year corn farmers have a brief 8-9 week window from early April through May 20th to get their crops planted if they hope to achieve optimal yields. Any corn planted after May 20th is officially considered ""late planted"" corn, as yields begin dropping for corn planted after this date. That's why crop insurance payouts begin dropping for corn planted after a specific cut-off date, typically in late May or early June.

So getting back to the USDA report, the following chart shows why it's simply absurd for the USDA to assume ""normal mid-May planting progress"" for 2019:

With just a few weeks left in the planting season, 2019's corn planting progress is nowhere near ""normal"". Farmers have only planted 30% of their planned acreage as of May 12th. That's more than 50% behind schedule compared to the five-year average. Thanks to the extreme rains that inundated the Midwest corn belt states this spring, many farmers trying to get their seed into the ground have found themselves in situations like this:

Simply put, too much water in the soil means farmers can't get their seeds into the ground. To get a sense of the extreme difficulty corn farmers have had this planting season, let's zoom to see where 2019's planting progress falls for this time of year (Week 19) compared with the last 40 years:

At just 30% of the corn crop planted by week 13, we've only seen two other years in the last 40 with less corn planting progress - 28% in 2013 and 29% in 1984. So to summarize…

The USDA created the market perception that U.S. corn inventories would soar to a multi-decade high by the end of 2019's crop season. But that projection was based on the ridiculous assumption of ""normal mid-May planting progress"". And I just showed how 2019 is very, very far removed from normal.

Now, the real question becomes - what's a more reasonable yield estimate given the large amount of corn that will likely be planted late (or not at all)? This article provides a great analysis of the historical impact that late planting has on U.S. corn yields. The key conclusion is summarized in the chart below, which shows that corn yields typically suffer a minor drop in yields when the amount of late planting exceeds the average by less than 10%. But when the deviation exceeds 10%, the yield decline goes exponential - dropping anywhere from 10-20 bushels per acre in the extreme cases.

So far, all signs point towards 2019 falling on the far right side of the graph. That means a big downside risk to corn yields. Based on the study's historical regression model, a conservative estimate would translate into a drop in yields of anywhere from 5-10 bushels per acre… and I wouldn't be surprised to see it come out much worse.

Now, the caveat here is that summer weather will provide the other critical variable in determining this year's corn yield. But no one trading corn today has any degree of certainty what the 2019 summer weather will look like. What we do know for sure is that corn farmers are way behind schedule with their planting this year. It's flat-out wrong to expect a normal yield based on the information available today.

So let's take a conservative estimate of losing 6 bushels per acre due to the extreme amount of late planting likely in 2019. That would lower the USDA's 2019 production estimate by roughly half a billion bushels to roughly 14,500 million bushels, based on the following math:

This 170 bushels per acre yield assumption creates a much less bearish ending stock number of 1,972 million bushels - a four-year low instead of the USDA's multi-decade high:

When using this conservative yield and ending stocks assumption, it's clear that corn prices trading well below the typical range of the last four years was way out of line with reality last week. The red line shows how far below the normal price range corn prices fell to last week, creating a tremendous contrarian buying opportunity when corn briefly traded below $3.50 per bushel:

It didn't take long for the market to realize the fallacy of the USDA forecast and irrational trade war fears. Corn prices have already rallied more than 10% off last Monday's lows. At just over $3.90 per bushel, I don't see a screaming opportunity to get long at today's levels. But on any pullbacks below the average price of the last four years, I'll be on the lookout to capture volatility through selling put options or getting long corn futures.

Going forward, there's a significant chance for a tail-risk event in U.S. corn supply, and thus much higher prices, if continued wet weather keeps farmers away from their fields in the few weeks left in the planting season. Meanwhile, summer weather will provide another wildcard that could either overcome the headwinds from late planting with benign growing conditions or create a meaningful supply shortage with harsh summer weather.

Subscribe for future updates and potential opportunities that might arise from further irrationality in today's corn market. And when the USDA releases its next corn supply and demand forecast, pay close attention to key assumptions driving their estimates... it just might create another terrific contrarian opportunity.

Commerce Dept. grants Huawei a 90-day license to help existing users,https://www.engadget.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/20/huawei-temp-license/,"Last week the US Commerce Department added Huawei and 68 subsidiaries to its ""Entity List"" that bans it from doing business with US companies without a special license. Today, as anticipated, the Commerce Department loosened that restriction a bit with a temporary 90-day license. According to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, it ""will allow operations to continue for existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks.""

Because many operators, or owners of various handsets might not have any other way to get software updates or look into backups for necessary equipment, Huawei can continue to service those existing customers -- for now at least. For the long term, however, it's still looking at the loss of access to technology like Google's Android OS, not to mention any business deals in the US.

Update: Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei made a rare public statement, telling media in China that his company had already made preparations for a ban, and said that its 5G would not be affected by the restrictions. He also said the temporary license ""bears little meaning."""
Tillerson quietly meets with House lawmakers to discuss Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Zachary Cohen'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/politics/tillerson-meeting-house-foreign-affairs/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson quietly met with the top Democrat and Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee Tuesday for an interview that focused primarily on his time in the Trump administration, a congressional aide with direct knowledge of the discussion confirmed to CNN.

Tillerson traveled to Capitol Hill where he sat down with the committee's Democratic chairman Rep. Eliot Engel and ranking Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, the aide said, adding that major topics of interest included the administration's dealings with Russia and uncertainty surrounding the role of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in deciding foreign policy.

The interview lasted roughly seven hours, including breaks, the same source said.

On Wednesday, a House Foreign Affairs Committee Republican aide called on the Democratic majority to release the transcript from Tillerson's meeting, claiming the ""tone and facts"" of the discussion were skewed by some media reports.

""We believe Tillerson's testimony best speaks for itself, and are hopeful that our Democrat chairman will release the full transcript of the meeting to the public soon,"" the aide said.

""Contrary to media reports, Secretary Tillerson made clear that 2016 Russian election interference was raised clearly at the highest levels with Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. Regarding Kushner, every single administration is entitled to choose and seek counsel from their own advisers. Tillerson emphasized that all presidents ultimately and appropriately determine which advice to follow in their decisions,"" they added.

A Democrat committee aide told CNN that Tillerson will have the chance to review the transcript before any of it is made public.

""Per an agreement with Secretary Tillerson, he will have the chance to review the transcript before any of it is made public. Our Republican colleagues were aware of this arrangement prior to yesterday's interview,"" they said.

In his prepared opening statement submitted to the committee leaders, Tillerson explained why he returned to Washington to speak with lawmakers.

""As you know, I am here today voluntarily in response to your request for my testimony. I chose to come back to Washington to speak with you today on a bipartisan basis because I understand and appreciate the critical role that Congressional oversight of the Executive Branch plays in our constitutional system,"" he wrote, according to a copy of the remarks released Wednesday.

""That role is especially important with respect to foreign affairs, where our position is strengthened when the world knows that we speak with one voice in protecting America's interests abroad,"" Tillerson added.

In a statement also released Wednesday, Engel applauded Tillerson for his willingness to appear before the committee.

""It's become clear that across the government, President Trump is trying to shut down any inquiry into what his Administration is doing. That's why Rex Tillerson's appearance before the Committee was so heartening. It's how the government is supposed to work: Congress and the executive branch seeking answers together,"" he said.

While specific details related to the meeting remain murky, it is clear that Tillerson's visit to Capitol Hill came as a surprise to many in Washington, including to some members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Several members of the House panel did not know about the interview until after it was first reported by The Daily Beast , according to a Republican lawmaker and an aide to a Democrat on the committee.

Tillerson was unceremoniously fired i n March 2018 and replaced by Trump's current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Tension between Tillerson and Kushner, who effectively ran a shadow State Department on Middle East issues, was well documented before Engel and McCaul probed the former top diplomat on the issue Tuesday.

As was the frayed relationship between Tillerson and the President, himself.

In a December 2018 interview with CBS News, Tillerson called President Trump ""undisciplined.""

""When the President would say, 'Here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it.' And I'd have to say to him, 'Well Mr. President, I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law. It violates treaty,'"" he said at the time.

Tuesday's meeting comes as House Democrats seek to use their power as the majority party to conduct various oversight investigations into Trump's financial dealings and foreign policy decisions.

Specifically, Democratic lawmakers have expressed interest in learning more about Trump's meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin -- and signaled they would like to know more about specific interactions between the two leaders that occurred during Tillerson's tenure at the State Department.

In January, CNN confirmed that after a 2017 meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany, Trump took the interpreter's notes and told him not to share anything about the discussion with anyone else, according to a former State Department official who was in Hamburg when the meeting took place.

Senior White House and State officials who work on Russian issues asked for notes on the meeting and did not get them, the source said.

Another former State Department official said that Tillerson did not provide a readout of the meeting to US ambassadors in the region at the time. The source said that ""Tillerson played stuff pretty close to his chest"" with all meetings and this one was no different."
Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says there are no plans to go to Beijing for trade talks yet,https://www.cnbc.com,['Yun Li'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/22/treasury-secretary-mnuchin-says-no-plans-to-go-to-beijing-for-trade-talks-yet.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a resumption of trade talks with China is not on the calendar yet.

Mnuchin told CNBC's Ylan Mui on Wednesday that a trip to Beijing has not been scheduled. Mnuchin made the comments on his way into a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee.

China has invited the U.S. delegation to Beijing after the two countries failed to reach a trade agreement in Washington this month.

""I'm still hopeful that we can get back to the table. The two presidents will most likely see each other at the end of June,"" Mnuchin said during the hearing. The two leaders are set to meet at the G-20 summit in Japan next month.

President Donald Trump followed through with his threat to increase tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. China immediately responded by upping the tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods to as high as 25%.

The trade tensions further intensified this week as the U.S. blacklisted Huawei and effectively halted its ability to buy American-made parts and components. China on Wednesday threatened to cut more economic ties with the U.S. in the wake of the new tariffs and Huawei ban.

The talks between the U.S. and China appeared to have stalled as it is unclear what the two sides would negotiate, CNBC previously reported. Trump said recently he has not ""made that decision yet"" on whether to put tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese goods."

"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Utah Gov. Herbert to meet over roadless rule",https://www.deseretnews.com,"[""Amy Joi O'Donoghue"", 'Amy Joi Is The Environmental Reporter For The Deseret News.']",05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900071458/agriculture-secretary-sonny-perdue-utah-gov-herbert-to-meet-over-roadless-rule.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is coming to Utah this week and will meet with Gov. Gary Herbert to discuss multiple issues, including the state's desire for a roadless rule specific to Utah and the formalization of a stewardship agreement with the U.S. Forest Service.

Herbert and Perdue will spend most of the day together Wednesday, kicking things off with a meeting, talks over breakfast, a Tooele County tour of a watershed restoration project, lunch and a tour of Welfare Square operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

As head of the agriculture department, Perdue oversees the management of the nation's forests. In Utah, there are 8.1 million forested acres, of which more than 4 million are designated and managed as roadless.

The 2001 Roadless Rule, according to the U.S. Forest Service, establishes prohibitions on road construction, road reconstruction and timber harvesting on 58.5 million acres of inventoried forest lands across the country.

Utah is following the lead of Alaska, which in 2018 successfully received approval of its petition to the U.S. Forest Service for the agency to begin developing a specific roadless rule plan for the Tongass National Forest.

Any new rule or update requires an environmental review process, and the state's petition to change what is on the books has prompted outcry and objection from multiple organizations.

In a briefing to lawmakers last week, the head of the Utah Public Lands Policy Coordinating Office, Kathleen Clarke, said Utah's petition was submitted at the end of February and is awaiting action by the U.S. Forest Service.

Perdue's visit is a good sign, she added, in her presentation to the Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Interim Committee.

“I think it is a very solid petition,"" Clarke said. ""There is a lot of rumor out there. There are a lot of accusations of it taking over management, which it does not do,"" she said.

Utah's desire for the roadless rule alteration comes in the aftermath of a record-breaking wildfire season in 2018 that cost the state more than $42 million in funding to quell.

Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News The Dollar Ridge Fire continues to burn at Strawberry Reservoir on Friday, July 6, 2018.

In a video presented to the legislative committee, Clarke's office detailed the specific motivation for seeking a Utah specific rule, citing the need to update the 18-year-old management structure that fails to keep pace with modern challenges of drought, climate change and rampant insect infestation killing millions of trees.

""Utah is not scheming to put more roads in forests,"" the narrator said, adding it is only asking for an updated rule that encompasses Utah's conditions that may differ from the rest of the nation.

But there are plenty of critics who say Utah's move for a modification of the rule is unnecessary and suspect, prompting some to threaten lawsuits or lobby personally in Washington, D.C.

Trout Unlimited sent Andy Rasmussen, the organization's Utah coordinator of the Sportsmen's Conservation Project, and Heidi Lewis, chairwoman of the Women's Initiative Council, and others to the nation's capital on Friday to press its case on keeping the current roadless rule intact.

""Trout Unlimited feels like it should not change and that we can work things out with programs already in place,"" Lewis said. ""Ultimately if you put roads in, you can't remove them.""

Kristin Murphy, Deseret News Linda Adams looks at the damage after the Dollar Ridge Fire in Fruitland on Wednesday, July 11, 2018. The fire destroyed her home, shed and camper.

Lewis added that Utah's prized Blue Ribbon fisheries would be threatened via changes to the roadless rule management.

The group met personally with Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, and staffers with other members of Utah's delegation.

""It was surprisingly positive,"" he said. ""They are definitely open to a path forward that does not include"" a revision of the rule, Rasmussen said, stressing that Utah's petition is especially concerning because it is so vague.

Rasmussen added the organization believes a better solution, and less costly one, would be an administrative agreement between Utah and the Forest Service, rather than wholesale makeover of the rule.

""I am with the governor on the goals as far as forest health and resiliency,"" he said, but added there should be an agreement that ""maintains the integrity of the roadless rule and still addresses (Utah) concerns.""

“The solicitor must uphold the law above all else about, above party politics and ideology. That was not the sense I got,” about Jorjani, said Manchin.

Manchin said he’s inclined to approve most nominees so long as they are qualified and ethical, but he was concerned that Jorjani showed a disregard for congressional intent.

“It concerns me Mr. Jorjani has spent the past two years he served as acting solicitor overturning prior interpretations of our public lands laws in a manner that is out of step with the congressional intent,” he said.

“I cannot a recall a nominee ever coming through this committee and responding to my requests for information by telling me to go ask somebody else,” Wyden said, adding that Jorjani would require “some pretty rigorous oversight” from the committee.

Manchin said Wyden’s questions “lacked the response it deserved” from Jorjani, who sidestepped questions about the department’s public records office and whether they had missed litigation deadlines for producing documents.

"Kris Kobach turned down Homeland Security position, says only ‘czar’ can solve border crisis",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/22/kris-kobach-turned-down-homeland-security-position/,"Kris Kobach said Wednesday he turned down an immigration adviser’s position at Homeland Security because it doesn’t carry enough weight to be able to solve the border crisis.

Mr. Kobach, in an exclusive interview with The Washington Times, said only a position inside the White House, a “czar”-style post, would have the access and oversight to achieve what President Trump is striving for.

He said he wishes the best for Ken Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general whom Mr. Trump did pick to take the as-yet undefined advisory role at Homeland Security.

But Mr. Kobach, a former Kansas secretary of state, said a non-confirmed subordinate position in one department can’t cut through the bureaucracy that’s preventing Mr. Trump from securing the border.

“I told him I wasn’t interested if I couldn’t get the job done,” he said to The Times. “It’s something that requires the White House to be directly engaged and moving the chess pieces on the table very quickly. A subordinate official at any one of those agencies isn’t going to be able to get it done.”

Frustrated by the massive migrant surge at the border, Mr. Trump last month orchestrated a shakeup at Homeland Security, ousting Secretary Kristjen Nielsen and acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ronald D. Vitiello.

Mr. Trump said at the time he wanted a tougher direction.

A month and half later, the numbers at the border are worse, and it’s unclear what steps have been taken to change the incentives that spurred a record number of families to jump the U.S.-Mexico boundary last month.

The president was considering creating an “immigration czar” position, which would have crossed department lines and coordinated strategy from the top, presumably with the direct imprimatur of Mr. Trump.

In the end, the president went with the adviser’s position at Homeland Security. It’s not clear why he squelched the czar idea.

Mr. Kobach, architect of some of the most innovative and controversial state policies to crack down on illegal immigration during the Obama years, said it will take a czar-style post to make the changes the president wants.

“I discussed with the president the position Ken is now evidently going to take, but I said I wasn’t interested in it,” Mr. Kobach said. “It requires extraordinary coordination of multiple agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor and even the Department of Interior. That can only be done effectively either from the White House or at a Cabinet-level position.

“I hope I’m wrong, and I wish Ken the best. And I hope he is able to move the needle and truly want him to succeed,” Mr. Kobach said. “But I just fear that the position of a subordinate officer, not Senate confirmed, in the Department of Homeland Security just won’t be able to get it done.”

Mr. Kobach was the target of a leak earlier this week to The New York Times, which reported on his list of 10 conditions for taking the czar’s post. Among them were an office in the West Wing of the White House and walk-in privileges to see the president — both likely critical to a job that would require cracking heads across multiple departments.

He also asked for access to a jet to be on the border weekly, time to be with his family in Kansas and a promise he’d eventually be nominated as Homeland Security secretary.

Mr. Kobach on Wednesday said he expects to continue to offer advice to Mr. Trump.

“I still meet regularly with the president to discuss immigration issues,” he said. “I stand ready to help the president in any way.”

Mr. Kobach said he would have come to the job with a list of ideas the president could tackle without needing to rely on Congress.

He’s publicly written about four of them: releasing new rules to replace the Flores court settlement that forces the catch-and-release of immigrant families living in the U.S. illegally; revoke the Obama-era policy that grants parole to asylum-seekers while they await their cases, which in practice means they get work permits and food stamps; construct massive facilities to process and hold asylum-seekers; and pressure Mexico to sign a “safe third country” deal, which would mean asylum-seekers who cross its territory could be immediately sent back over the border.

Each of those moves could help change the incentives that spurred some 65,000 family-unit migrants to jump the border last month, though the safe third country agreement may be the biggest.

“If anything’s a silver bullet, that is a silver bullet,” Mr. Kobach said. “A subordinate official at DHS isn’t going to have any authority to get that done.”

Whatever steps Mr. Trump decides on, Mr. Kobach said there are “easily 50 significant executive actions” he could do without having to go to Congress for approval.

Instead, Mr. Trump last week delivered a speech laying out a plan to revamp the legal immigration system. The speech seemed like a non sequitur coming amid a border crisis related to illegal immigration.

USDA: Don’t add foodborne illness to summer menu,https://www.masslive.com,"['Anne-Gerard Flynn', 'Special To The Republican']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/05/usda-dont-add-foodborne-illness-to-summer-menu.html,"Rates of foodborne illnesses increase during the summer.

According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the season’s hot and humid weather causes environmental bacteria to grow faster and, of course, food is more exposed to possible contamination with summer’s many outdoor activities.

“We receive thousands of different questions from consumers regarding food safety during the summer,"" said Adam Ghering of FSIS’ Office of Public Affairs and Consumer Education.

“Many of those questions are linked to the weather. Severe storms and power outages routinely impact food safety during the summer.”

He added, “In general, perishable foods will stay safe in a refrigerator for four hours when the door remains closed.”

“If the power is out for longer, you can transfer foods to a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs. Foods in the freezer will be safe for approximately 48 hours, 24 hours if the fridge is half full,” said Ghering, adding further information on what food is still considered save to consume after a power outage is available online or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-674-6854.

Ghering said that the “other topic that we receive many questions about is cooking outdoors.”

“Cooking away from the kitchen can be fun but it also requires a good deal of preparation to ensure everything goes smoothly,” he said.

“Bringing water for washing hands, utensils and other equipment is something that can be easily overlooked. Moist towelettes can be a good ‘touch-up’ when your hands get dirty but the most effective method is soap and water.”

He also recommended a cooler will “to keep your food cold, just remember to keep replenishing ice as it melts” and “any type of food thermometer will provide you with the internal temperature of your meat and thereby help you prevent foodborne illness.”

“Any type of improper handling of your food can cause illness but not properly cooking and cooling meat and poultry is vital during summer months,” Ghering said.

“Meat and poultry can quickly brown when grilled but that doesn’t mean they are safe to eat.”

He called probe food thermometers “which you can keep in meat and poultry while cooking” a “great addition to your grilling equipment” in particular.

USDA tips to avoid food poisoning that is estimated to cause some 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths in the United States annually include:

Perishable food should not sit out for more than two hours at room temperature and no more than an hour when the temperature is above 90 degrees.

Pack beverages in one cooler and perishable food in another cooler and place cooler in shade when possible, even in car.

If grilling away from home, bring your own water for preparation and cleaning if unsure of availability of clean water supply.

Use a meat thermometer to ensure harmful bacteria are destroyed. Cook beef, pork, lamb and veal to internal minimum safe temperatures of 145 degrees; ground meats, 160 degrees; whole poultry, poultry breasts and ground poultry, 165 degrees.

Keep cooked meats at 140 degrees or warmer by setting them to the side of the grill rack, not directly over the coals where they could overcook. They may also be kept hot in an oven set at approximately 200 degrees in a chafing dish, slow cooker or warming tray.

Leftovers should be stored within two hours of cooking. Divide them into smaller portions and refrigerate or freeze in covered shallow containers for quicker cooling."
Democrats grill Trump Interior chief for saying he hasn't 'lost sleep' over climate change,https://thehill.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/445016-dems-grills-interior-head-over-climate-change-comments,"Democrats grilled President Trump's new Interior secretary on Wednesday over his recent comments that he hasn't ""lost any sleep"" over aspects of climate change.

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt appeared before a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, but faced more questions about his response to climate change and a slew of ethical concerns than about his budget.

Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) centered his questions entirely on Bernhardt’s ""sleep"" comment, flanked by a staffer holding photos of climate-related disasters in Puerto Rico, California and Texas, listing off the number of people who died in the disasters and how much damage they caused.

""Do you lose sleep over it?"" Merkley asked after each example.

“I think it’s an issue that need to be addressed, but I don’t lose sleep over it,” Bernhardt responded.

“The policies you’re promoting are doing enormous damage to our planet,” Merkley said, calling the agency's policies “an immoral thing to do to the generations to come.”

Merkley told the secretary he should “maybe lose some sleep and maybe decide to be part of the solution” on climate change.

Bernhardt later said: “We completely respect that the climate is changing, and we need to study and address it,” and listed divisions of the department he said are making such efforts.

Some of Bernhardt's comments echoed his past assertion that the legislative branch needs to take a greater role in directing the department to respond to climate change.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, subcommittee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) agreed, saying it shouldn’t fall to one secretary to make such determinations, and criticized her colleagues for ""rhetorical"" questioning of the secretary.

“I think the secretary, in response to rhetorical questions, is just kind of pointing out the obvious that the authority rests with Congress,” she said.

But Democrats have criticized Bernhardt for not viewing climate change as part of his job, with Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) arguing that Bernhardt is ignoring the intent of legislation.

“Blaming Congress is a dodge,"" Udall said.

He also raised conflict of interest concerns related to Bernhardt's past as a lobbyist.

“We could spend this entire hearing probing your various conflicts of interest,"" Udall said. ""It’s clear you’re making decisions that benefit former clients instead of the American people.""

Senators on both sides of the aisle also pressed Bernhardt to limit offshore drilling and clarify the department’s position on the issue after pausing the development of its five-year offshore drilling plan.

In responding to a question from Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) Bernhardt said litigation was the driver behind halting the plan’s development.

“I’ve paused it until I figure out a pathway,” Bernhardt said, nodding to an Alaska case that would bar drilling in the Arctic.

“I’m glad you’ve paused it and hope you permanently pause it,” Van Hollen replied.

The Trump administration’s $30 billion budget request for the Interior Department would be a cut from last year’s budget, though Bernhardt noted it is larger than what the department requested last year.

Republicans praised aspects of the budget that would help deal with the maintenance backlog in national parks and funds included to protect the Everglades."
