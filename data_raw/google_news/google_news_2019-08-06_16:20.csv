New York Times headline of Trump's remarks on mass shootings ignites backlash,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gerren Keith Gaynor', 'Gerren Keith Gaynor Is A Digital Editor At Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/new-york-times-headline-trump,"A New York Times headline about President Trump’s remarks on the recent mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton drew condemnation online – including from some Democratic presidential candidates – and was subsequently changed late Monday.

The newspaper summarized Trump’s comments, in which he denounced hate and white supremacy, with the headline “Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism” on the front page of its first edition.

A photograph of Tuesday’s first edition was tweeted out by journalist Nate Silver Monday night and was quickly slammed by critics who accused the Gray Lady of inaccurately representing Trump’s comments.

NEW YORK TIMES NEEDS TO 'LOOK IN THE MIRROR' IF IT THINKS MSNBC, CNN ARE TOO PARTISAN, CRITICS SAY

Some Twitter users threatened to cancel their subscriptions and urged others to do the same.

“I canceled my subscription,” tweeted author and CNN contributor Joan Walsh, adding, “I can’t keep rewarding such awful news judgement.”

Prominent Democrats in Washington also took aim at the Times, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

“Let this front page serve as a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by – and often relies upon – the cowardice of mainstream institutions,” the freshman congresswoman tweeted.

Presidential candidates, many of whom blamed Trump’s rhetoric for the El Paso, Texas, shooting that left at least 22 dead, also decried the headline.

New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted, “That’s not what happened.”

“Lives literally depend on you doing better, NYT. Please do,” wrote Sen. Cory Booker.

A photograph of the Times’ second edition of the front page hours later revealed that the headline had been changed to “Assailing Hate But Not Guns.” Its website also showed a similar headline: “Trump Condemns Bigotry but Doesn’t Call for Major New Guns Laws.”

Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy acknowledged in a statement the original headline was problematic.

""The original headline was flawed and was changed for all editions of the paper following the first edition,"" the statement read. ""The headline in question never appeared online, only in the first print edition."""
Opinion | The Nihilist in Chief,https://www.nytimes.com,['Ross Douthat'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/opinion/trump-el-paso-dayton-shootings.html,"Here I would dissent, mildly, from the desire to tell a mostly ideological story in the aftermath of El Paso, and declare war on “white nationalism” — a war the left wants because it has decided that all conservatism can be reduced to white supremacy, and the right wants as a way of rebutting and rejecting that reductionism.

By all means disable 8Chan and give the F.B.I. new marching orders; by all means condemn racism more vigorously than this compromised president can do. But recognize we’re dealing with a pattern of mass shootings, encompassing both the weekend’s horrors, where the personal commonalities between the shooters are clearly more important than the political ones. Which suggests that the white nationalism of internet failsons is like the allegiance to an imaginary caliphate that motivated the terrorists whose depredations helped get Trump elected in the first place. It’s often just a carapace, a flag of convenience, a performance for the vast TV-and-online audience that now attends these grisly spectacles, with a malignant narcissism and nihilism underneath.

And this is what really links Trump to all these empty male killers, white nationalists and pornogrind singers alike. Like them he is a creature of our late-modern anti-culture, our internet-accelerated dissolution of normal human bonds. Like them he plainly believes in nothing but his ego, his vanity, his sense of spite and grievance, and the self he sees reflected in the mirror of television, mass media, online.

Because he is rich and famous and powerful, he can get that attention with a tweet about his enemies, and then experience the rush of a cable-news segment about him. He doesn’t need to plot some great crime to lead the news; he just has to run for president. But having him as president — having him as a political exemplar for his party, and a cultural exemplar of manhood for his supporters and opponents both — is a constant ratification of the idea that we exist as celebrities or influencers or we don’t exist at all, and that our common life is essentially a form of reality television where it doesn’t matter if you’re the heel or hero so long as you’re the star.

One recurring question taken up in this column is whether something good might come out of the Trump era. I keep returning to this issue because unlike many conservatives who opposed him in 2016, I actually agree with, or am sympathetic toward, versions of ideas that Trump has championed — the idea of a more populist and worker-friendly conservative economics, the idea of a foreign policy with a more realpolitik and anti-interventionist spirit, the idea that decelerating low-skilled immigration would benefit the common good, the idea that our meritocratic, faux-cosmopolitan elite has badly misgoverned the republic."
An economist says Trump is right: Investment is down and the Fed should help,https://finance.yahoo.com,['Alexandra Canal'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/economist-says-trump-is-right-on-fed-needing-to-do-more-110000998.html,"Stocks saw their worst day of the year on Monday, after Beijing suggested it was weaponizing its currency by devaluing it— the latest sticking point in an ongoing U.S.-China trade war.

After America retaliated by formally labeling China a “currency manipulator” — something that hasn’t been done in over 2 decades — it sparked new market fears about the economic fallout.

President Donald Trump has hammered the Federal Reserve for not taking more aggressive steps to cut rates — and at least one economist says he agrees, as the outlook worsens.

“I’ve been a forecaster my entire professional life and one thing we always look at is where’s investment going — because investment determines future hiring, future productivity, and future real wages and real incomes,” Milken Institute chief economist William Lee told Yahoo Finance during a recent interview.

“Investment is crashing — not only in the U.S. but around the world so that’s the thing I am most concerned with,” he added.

And the Federal Reserve could do more to help, according to Lee.

Why Jerome Powell needs to channel Europe's Mario Draghi, according to one economist More

“We need to have a policy back-stop to reassure confidence among producers and investors...that’s something the Fed has failed to do,” Lee said.

He compared Fed chairman Jerome Powell to European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, who has embraced a ‘We’ll do everything it takes’ to back-stop the economy,” Lee said.

“And if he were to do that I’d think we’d have much more solid growth going forward,” he added.

Interest rates too high?

China’s unexpected currency intervention provided an opening for Trump to once again target the Fed over its interest rate policy, despite the central bank's decision to cut rates by 25 basis points last week.

“It’s called ‘currency manipulation,’” Trump said in a Twitter post. “Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!”

China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It’s called “currency manipulation.” Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 5, 2019

Late Monday, the U.S. officially accused China of manipulating its currency, and Beijing moved to limit the damage. But there could be pause for China to fully weaponize its currency moving forward.

“If [China does] let the exchange rate go, domestic residents that are holding yuan assets are going to say, ‘My God this stuff is worth less than other global assets’ so there could be a massive capital outflow,” Lee warned, citing Beijing’s 2015 attempt to devalue the yuan.

And when it comes to lower interest rates, Lee explained the president just might have a point.

“What President Trump is trying to do is get the rates down on the short-end because that is what the Federal Reserve can control,” the economist said.

“But remember the long-end — the 10-year treasury (TNX) and the 30-year Treasury — are dropped down to the 170s now because global interest rates are also incredibly low,” he added.

The yield on the 10-year note dropped Monday to its lowest level since 2016.

Both Europe and Japan have implemented below-zero interest rates, in an unconventional bid to boost growth and inflation.

“The U.S. having such high long-term rates is incompatible and really misses the line with the global economy,” he added.

On Monday, the Dow (DJI) shed as many as 961.63 points at the lows of the day, with tech stocks including Apple (AAPL) leading declines.

Trade bellwethers like Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) also saw steep losses as China allowed the yuan (CNHUSD=X) to weaken past seven per U.S. dollar (DX-Y.NYB) for the first time in over 10 years.

Opinion | Trump Is a White Nationalist Who Inspires Terrorism,https://www.nytimes.com,['Michelle Goldberg'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/opinion/trump-white-supremacy.html,"A decade ago, Daryl Johnson, then a senior terrorism analyst at the Department of Homeland Security, wrote a report about the growing danger of right-wing extremism in America. Citing economic dislocation, the election of the first African-American president and fury about immigration, he concluded that “the threat posed by lone wolves and small terrorist cells is more pronounced than in past years.”

When the report leaked, conservative political figures sputtered with outrage, indignant that their ideology was being linked to terrorism. The report warned, correctly, that right-wing radicals would try to recruit disgruntled military veterans, which conservatives saw as a slur on the troops. Homeland Security, cowed, withdrew the document. In May 2009, Johnson’s unit, the domestic terrorism team, was disbanded, and he left government the following year.

Johnson was prescient, though only up to a point. He expected right-wing militancy to escalate throughout Barack Obama’s administration, but to subside if a Republican followed him. Ordinarily, the far-right turns to terrorism when it feels powerless; the Oklahoma City bombing happened during Bill Clinton’s presidency, and all assassinations of abortion providers in the United States have taken place during Democratic administrations. During Republican presidencies, paranoid right-wing demagogy tends to recede, and with it, right-wing violence.

But that pattern doesn’t hold when the president himself is a paranoid right-wing demagogue.

“The fact that they’re still operating at a high level during a Republican administration goes against all the trending I’ve seen in 40 years,” Johnson told me. Donald Trump has kept the far right excited and agitated. “He is basically the fuel that’s been poured onto a fire,” said Johnson."
DHS Official: Trump Can’t Admit ‘This Is Terrorism’,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dhs-official-on-el-paso-and-dayton-trump-cant-admit-this-is-terrorism,"After a weekend of carnage, President Trump said some things that sounded heartening. But current and former law enforcement officials say the president’s words aren’t enough—and they fear it’s all he has to offer.

Thirty-one people were killed between attacks on public places in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in the span of 12 hours this past weekend. While authorities say they have no motive yet for the Dayton attack, officials said the accused El Paso attacker wrote a manifesto justifying the mass murder of Hispanic people to stop their “invasion” of the U.S. Federal prosecutors said they’re considering domestic terrorism charges for the attacker. (Days earlier, a gunman expressing similar racist views killed three people at a food festival in California.)

“This is a clear manifestation of the political discourse that has taken place in the country over the past two years or so,” one Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told The Daily Beast. “It cannot be blamed on mental health. This is an ideology-driven hate crime. This is terrorism and the White House has trouble labeling it as such. It is very frustrating.”

In remarks Monday from the White House, the president blamed violent video games and mental health problems for the carnage. He called for the implementation of red flag laws, also known as risk protection orders, that let people petition a judge to have the guns of their friends and family taken away if they worry that person will harm others. He even went so far to say “ our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy” —something he has shied away from in the past.

The DHS official called the remarks “demoralizing,” noting the president’s effort to spread the blame around.

Despite the president’s call for reforms, current and former law enforcement officials say they aren’t satisfied. Sources say white supremacy is a significant threat to U.S. national security, and one mention in a 10-minute presidential speech won’t cut it.

“It is a good step to recognize the threat of white supremacy, but words alone cannot solve the problem,” said Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent who specialized in counterterrorism cases. “Action speaks louder than words. What kind of policy, legislations, designation, and funding is the administration willing to propose, support, and authorize in order to counter this emerging threat? This is where the rubber meets the road.”

Some officials said they put little stock in Trump’s words, worrying that the president would, as in the past, backtrack on his statements on white supremacy.

Others said Trump’s brief condemnation of the ideology meant little following his statements earlier in the day that linked the weekend’s shootings to the need for new immigration legislation—the accused El Paso shooter said immigration was destroying the country.

“I am concerned that white supremacist thought leaders will view his tweet linking immigration reform with background checks as a tacit signal that he still supports their agenda,” said John Cohen, the former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “It is mind-boggling he would blend the two issues. I don’t think there is a thorough understanding of the issues at the White House.”

Despite the concern surrounding Trump’s rhetoric on white supremacy, the intelligence community appears to be taking a new, active step in addressing the threat. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is hosting a conference on domestic terrorism with the FBI and DHS next month, according to a person familiar with the plans. An invitation to the event said the conference will scrutinize the federal government’s response to the threat in light of the recent deadly attacks by white supremacists on synagogues in Pennsylvania and California and mosques in New Zealand.

If Trump’s speech was any indication of where the White House plans to focus its efforts following the fatal shootings over the weekend, it seems white supremacy is an afterthought.

The president focused his speech on tracking individuals with mental illnesses.

“Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,” Trump said. “We must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement.”

Authorities have not offered evidence that the accused gunmen in El Paso and Dayton were mentally ill. The American Psychological Association said in response to Trump’s remarks: “Blaming mental illness for the gun violence in our country is simplistic and inaccurate and goes against the scientific evidence currently available.”

Trump went on to say that he directed the Department of Justice to work with other law enforcement agencies and social media companies to better detect people he said were mentally ill and liable to kill.

“We must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs,” Trump said.

Federal law enforcement agencies have in the past worked with DHS as well as state and local law enforcement to track people who may endanger others, including veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with criminal pasts. National Security Agency software company Beware at one point let local police departments calculate individuals’ threat levels by collecting things like arrest reports, property records, and social media postings. Meanwhile, the FBI tracks potential terrorist attacks by opening official investigations. Many of those probes have focused on Muslim terrorist suspects following 9/11 and the rise of ISIS.

The only question now, law enforcement officials say, is whether the president will order a crackdown on white supremacist violence.

“The president did what presidents should do, which is condemn bigotry and hatred,” said George Salim, a former DHS official who now works at the Anti-Defamation League. “But what’s needed is resources, strategy, and policy. And the real measure of these horrible atrocities is if the resources, strategy, and policy of the federal government matches the president’s comments today.

“How many lives need to be lost before action is accelerated and the administration works with Congress? The time is now.”"
China responds to US after Treasury designates Beijing a 'currency manipulator',https://www.cnbc.com,['Sam Meredith'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/trade-war-china-responds-to-us-after-claim-of-being-a-currency-manipulator.html,"China's central bank has firmly rejected the U.S. Treasury's designation of Beijing as a currency manipulator, saying the accusation has ""seriously"" undermined the international financial order and risked further market turmoil.

The response from the People's Bank of China comes at a time of rapidly intensifying trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

On Monday, the U.S. Treasury accused Beijing of deliberately influencing the exchange rate between the yuan and the U.S. dollar to gain an ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade.""

The move fulfills President Donald Trump's promise to recognize China as a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994.

The announcement followed a sharp drop in the yuan against the dollar, with the Chinese currency breaching the 7-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008. A drop in a currency's value makes that country's products cheaper on the international market.

""The United States disregards the facts and unreasonably affixes China with the label of 'currency manipulators,' which is a behavior that harms others and oneself,"" the PBOC said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The Chinese side firmly opposes this.""

The PBOC said it would not only ""seriously undermine the international financial order, but also trigger financial market turmoil. It will also greatly hinder international trade and the global economic recovery, and ultimately will suffer from it.""

China's central bank set the yuan's official reference point at stronger than the key 7 yuan-to-the-dollar point on Tuesday.

The move appeared to calm financial markets, initially rocked by fears the U.S.-China trade war was devolving into a currency war.

Late last week, China promised to fight back after Trump vowed to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had not been hit with U.S. duties."
"USDA science agencies’ relocation may have violated law, inspector general report says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'August At Pm', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/08/05/usda-science-agencies-relocation-may-have-violated-law-inspector-general-report-says/,"

A plan to move two Agriculture Department scientific agencies from Washington to Kansas City may have run afoul of the 2018 appropriations act, according to a report released Monday from the USDA’s Office of Inspector General.

In August 2018, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue unveiled a plan to relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees $1.7 billion in scientific grants and funding, and the Economic Research Service, a federal statistical agency that publishes influential reports on agricultural trade and rural America. Both agencies lease office space in the District.

USDA selected the Kansas City region as the new home for these agencies in June 2019, in what Perdue has billed as a cost-saving decision. About two-thirds of nearly 400 employees refused the reassignment and will lose their jobs. “This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, told The Washington Post last month.

The department has the legal authority to move the agencies, per the USDA inspector general’s investigation. But USDA also needs budgetary approval from Congress to fund the moves, the inspector general’s office said, which the department did not obtain.

In the fall, USDA awarded a $340,000 contract to the accounting firm Ernst & Young to assist with the relocation. The 2018 omnibus spending bill required USDA to receive congressional approval before spending this money. “That prior approval did not appear to have been granted,” the inspector general report says.

This expense may have also violated the Antideficiency Act, the report said, which prevents federal employees from involving the government “in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made.”

Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), who requested the inspector general’s investigation in September 2018, exhorted USDA to follow the law. “The Secretary must follow the will of Congress and refrain from moving forward with the relocation,” they said in a joint statement Monday, “until Congress approves the use of funds for those purposes as directed by the fiscal year 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act.”

In a list of recommendations in the report, the inspector general’s office advised USDA to seek congressional approval.

USDA management refused to do so. “To say the department was out of step with budgetary requirements disregards the authority given to the executive branch by the U.S. Constitution,” according to a statement provided by USDA. It continued: “Since the inspector general affirms the department has the legal authority and we do not agree with the unconstitutional budgetary provision, this case is closed.”

On Friday, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, in a keynote speech at a Republican Party gala in South Carolina, said of the attrition at the agencies: “By simply saying to people, ‘You know what, we’re going to take you outside the bubble, outside the Beltway, outside this liberal haven of Washington, D.C., and move you out in the real part of the country,' and they quit — what a wonderful way to sort of streamline government.”

Judge questions Barr's handling of Mueller findings,https://thehill.com,[],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/456236-judge-questions-barrs-handling-of-mueller-findings,"A federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Monday pressed Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers on why the public shouldn’t be allowed to see redacted portions of former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerTrump calls for probe of Obama book deal Democrats express private disappointment with Mueller testimony Kellyanne Conway: 'I'd like to know' if Mueller read his own report MORE’s report, suggesting that he may be willing to consider releasing at least some of the restricted document.

Judge Reggie Walton, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, posed the questions during a hearing on a pair of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits seeking the redacted portions of the report.

The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and BuzzFeed News reporter Jason Leopold filed the lawsuits earlier this year. The cases have since been consolidated, and attorneys for each party split the arguments during Monday’s hearing.

Walton in particular raised concerns about Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrThe Humanist case for abolishing the death penalty Senators renew request for domestic threats documents from FBI, DOJ after shootings Judge questions Barr's handling of Mueller findings MORE’s initial handling of Mueller’s report, indicating that he believed there were discrepancies in how Barr characterized the report and the former special counsel’s actual findings.

“I do have some concerns because it seems to me difficult to reconcile the contents of the Mueller report and statements made by the attorney general” about the report, Walton said.

The judge pointed to a letter authored by Barr weeks ahead of the report's release that said Mueller determined there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election and Barr’s suggestion that the president was cleared by the report.

Mueller has since stated that his office did not investigate collusion but instead whether any Trump campaign officials conspired with Russians in 2016.

DOJ lawyer Courtney Enlow pushed back, saying that Barr was not required to release the report at all under the special counsel regulations but did so anyway. She said the attorney general's actions were in “good faith.”

But EPIC attorney Alan Butler raised concerns over the timeline of the redactions. The DOJ released a second redacted version of the Mueller report in response to the FOIA lawsuits weeks after the initial report. But Butler noted that the exemptions in the FOIA version of the report were effectively the same as the redactions made in the originally released version of Mueller's report.

Judge Walton raised that prospect to Enlow, suggesting that the DOJ officials tasked with making the FOIA exemptions could have been following directions from higher-ups. He cited his own time working in the DOJ, saying that sometimes “the body does what the head wants.”

Enlow said that Barr worked with members of the special counsel’s office to make the redactions and that the information withheld under FOIA in that version of the report was in line with FOIA exemptions.

Attorneys for those seeking the unredacted portions of the report pressed Walton to request that the disputed redactions be given to him privately so that he could review them and determine if any of the information was already publicly available and no longer needed to redacted.

Enlow argued that rulings in previous FOIA cases mean that the administration doesn’t necessarily have to make that information publicly available.

However, Walton appeared skeptical. At several times throughout the hearing, he noted the high level of public interest in the redacted versions of the documents.

Mathew Topic, who was arguing on behalf of Leopold in court, also noted that releasing more details of the report could help resolve disputes about the origins of the Mueller investigation.

Topic pointed to Trump repeatedly referring to the probe as a politically motivated “witch hunt” and said that making the investigators’ findings fully available could help affirm or disprove those claims.

“That information has strong public interest in multiple ways,” Topic said of the details redacted because of privacy interests.

Enlow countered by saying Americans contacted by Russians during the 2016 election could be thrust into the public spotlight if that information was released and that being publicly tied to the investigation “places stigma on that person.”

Among the redacted information in the report being sought in these cases is grand jury information.

But Enlow, in arguing that Walton should not make the information public, cited an opinion from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals handed down earlier this year that found a court doesn’t have the inherent authority to release grand jury materials.

And she said that a suggestion from Tropic that an FOIA exemption made in relation to grand jury materials appeared related to Trump’s questioning in the probe as “baseless” speculation.

Topic had questioned why information appearing to relate to Trump’s questioning was redacted under the grand jury provision, when the president never appeared before a grand jury.

Walton did not provide a timeline as to when he might issue a decision, saying that he is facing a “heavy” caseload at the moment.

But he noted the high level of public interest in the case — and the inevitable prospect that whatever ruling he issues will be appealed — in saying he will work to make a decision soon."
Who has the upper hand in the U.S.-China trade war?,https://www.marketwatch.com,['Charles Hankla'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/who-has-the-upper-hand-in-the-us-china-trade-war-2019-08-05,"President Donald Trump recently escalated his trade war with China, threatening to impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion of untaxed Chinese imports.

If the new tariff goes into effect in September as promised, virtually all Chinese exports to the U.S. would be subject to levies ranging from 10% to 25%. China retaliated by letting the value of its currency fall to the lowest level in more than a decade and halting all crop imports.

Many Americans like me are now wondering: Is there any end in sight?

How to win an economic war

As a scholar of trade policy, I’ve repeatedly made the point that free exchange is a positive-sum game — meaning every participating country can benefit — rather than zero-sum, as Trump seems to believe. This is why commercial disputes are certain to harm all participants.

I believe the United States could have avoided its current predicament by using the World Trade Organization’s existing dispute resolution process to address its justifiable concerns with Chinese behavior.

Still, from the perspective of a single country, starting a trade war could potentially be justified if the end result ultimately shifts the terms of trade in its favor.

Such a victory can only be achieved when the country has more bargaining leverage than its opponent — in other words when it can impose more pain on its adversary than it experiences itself.

And the longer the trade war continues, the more concessions that country will have to win in order to compensate for the damage caused.

So, after nearly 18 months of escalating disputes between the U.S. and China, where are we? Is either side winning, and can any concessions justify the economic harm that both sides have already experienced?

China’s pain

First and foremost, it has become increasingly clear that the trade war is hurting the economies of both countries. Neither will emerge from this conflict unscathed.

Unfortunately, however, the last 18 months have done little to clarify who is winning — that is, who is hurting less and can credibly hold out for longer.

Take China. Before the trade war, it was already facing a number of significant challenges, first among them how to effect a transition from its current reliance on cheap manufacturing to the production of higher value-added goods. China’s political stability is also somewhat precarious, as evidenced by recent events in Hong Kong and Xianjing, as well as Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s authoritarian crackdown.

Moreover, China’s economic growth has slowed to a 27-year low of 6.2%. And perhaps more ominously for the country, there are growing signs that foreign companies from America and elsewhere are looking outside China as they expand their sourcing, production and distribution activities.

Of course, China’s growth rate still makes it among the fastest-expanding economies in the world, so the recent slowdown can hardly be termed a crisis. And the shift away from China, limited as it is, began before the trade war, spurred on by rising prices, intellectual property theft and other issues.

Not necessarily America’s gain

The problem for the U.S. is that Americans are also increasingly feeling the pinch.

Perhaps most notably, farmers, many of whom continue to support Trump, are beginning to tire of the sacrifices they are making for his uncompromising positions. With the Chinese government threatening to retaliate if Trump follows through on the new tariffs, their willingness to go along may be even more sorely tested.

To keep agriculture on side, the Trump administration has channeled billions of dollars in subsidies to those hurt by his trade policy. But this approach also has its political costs, with more fiscally conservative backers of the president balking at the price tag.

From a broader perspective, recent studies have undercut Trump’s claim that Chinese companies are bearing the brunt of the tariff payments, showing that the bulk of costs are passed to U.S. companies and consumers. And the stock market DJIA, +0.37% is reacting very negatively to the latest Trump threats.

Read: Why U.S. stocks remain vulnerable as Trump trade tweets revive global growth jitters

It is true that the overall American economy remains strong, with expanding employment and a fast, though slowing, growth rate of 2.1% in the most recent period. But China has one more strategic advantage that could make a substantial difference: It can wait out Trump’s presidency.

If the Trump administration’s approach to trade represented a bipartisan consensus, the U.S. could keep up the pressure over the long term. Containment policy during the Cold War, in which the United States committed itself to curbing Soviet influence, represents the classic example of a consensus that was credibly maintained, in one form or another, across several administrations.

But because the tariffs are so associated with Trump’s personality, the Chinese government can afford to wait for a new president. If a Democrat wins in 2020, he or she will likely maintain a harder line on China than we saw before Trump, but will probably repudiate the current president’s penchant for punitive and precipitous tariffs.

In a sense, then, America’s negotiating credibility has become yet another casualty of its polarized politics.

In other words: No end in sight

In the final analysis, then, China may have the most to lose from the ongoing dispute. But the U.S. bargaining position is more politically vulnerable.

And the Chinese can credibly claim that buckling under American pressure would be unacceptable to their domestic audience.

Studies of shooting wars indicate that they tend to continue until events on the ground reveal which side is likely to win. The same is surely true for trade wars.

Since neither side is clearly winning or losing, we have probably not seen the end of this conflict.

"China is manipulating its currency, U.S. Treasury Department declares",https://www.marketwatch.com,['Mike Murphy'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-is-manipulating-its-currency-us-treasury-department-declares-2019-08-05,"The U.S. Treasury Department designated China as a currency manipulator on Monday afternoon, after the yuan’s value against the dollar fell below a “line in the sand” and intensified trade tensions.

In a statement, the Treasury Department said Secretary Steve Mnuchin, “under the auspices of President Trump,” has determined that China is a currency manipulator.

“As a result of this determination, Secretary Mnuchin will engage with the International Monetary Fund to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China’s latest actions,” the Treasury department said, explaining: “In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past. The context of these actions and the implausibility of China’s market stability rationale confirm that the purpose of China’s currency devaluation is to gain unfair competitive advantage in international trade.”

The statement added that the People’s Bank of China “has extensive experience manipulating its currency and remains prepared to do so on an ongoing basis.”

It’s the first time the U.S. has labeled China as a currency manipulator since 1994, and could open the door to new sanctions.

It’s also a reversal for the Treasury Department, which in May declined to give China that label. But President Donald Trump has pressed for that designation.

“China has always used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories, hurt our jobs, depress our workers’ wages and harm our farmers’ prices. Not anymore!” Trump tweeted Monday before Treasury’s announcement.

China’s currency CNYUSD, +0.3458% weakened early Monday, trading at more than 7 yuan per U.S. dollar for the first time in more than a decade.

The perceived willingness by China to use the yuan as a trade weapon led to a huge selloff on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.44% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.49% falling almost 3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.62% slid 3.5%."

The Trump administration has temporarily frozen and ordered a review of several key foreign aid funds that Congress has already approved, in a move that critics fear could lead to another attempted rollback of foreign aid.

The Office of Management and Budget sent a letter to the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development on Saturday, notifying them of the action, which took effect one minute before midnight that day.

The OMB asked the agencies for a balance sheet of foreign aid projects that have not yet been funded. Michael P. Duffey, the associate director for national security programs at OMB, wrote that no more money can be obligated from those funds until three days after OMB receives the numbers, a process that could take days if not weeks.

The letter, viewed by The Washington Post, lists eight areas that cover a variety of assistance: international organizations; peacekeeping operations and activities; international narcotics control and law enforcement; development aid; assistance for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia; economic support funding; foreign military financing programs; and global health programs.

An administration official said the funds targeted for review are above budgetary limits proposed by President Trump. They include big-ticket items like contributions to the United Nations and smaller items like solar panels in the Caribbean, schools in Uzbekistan and soccer programs in Central America.

Traditionally, a significant portion of foreign aid funding is obligated toward the end of a fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30. But this year the pot is bigger, in part because the administration has cut aid to the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and for the Palestinians.

According to people familiar with the process, the named funds could be as little as $2 billion and as much as $4 billion.

The State Department and USAID declined to comment, referring questions to OMB.

“It is incumbent on all federal agencies to properly use funds provided by Congress,” said Rachel Semmel, the OMB spokeswoman. “In an effort to ensure accountability, OMB has requested the current status of several foreign assistance accounts to identify the amount of funding that is unobligated. On behalf of American taxpayers, OMB has an obligation to ensure their money is being used wisely.”

Trump has proposed steep cuts in foreign aid in all of his budget requests, but Congress has restored the funding.

Last year, OMB asked the State Department and USAID to provide a similar balance sheet of unobligated projects just six weeks before the end of the budget year. It said money for projects considered “unnecessary” — potentially as much as $3 billion — could be returned to the Treasury, a process known as rescission

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued against the rescission championed by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, and Congress pushed against what it viewed as a backdoor attempt to get around its spending authority, so the administration dropped the proposal. The Government Accountability Office, in a decision last December, rebuked the idea of an attempted rescission so late in the budget year, saying there must be enough time for a “prudent obligation” that could take weeks or even months. This year, Pompeo was in Australia when the letter was sent and Congress was near the beginning of a recess.

No decisions have been made, and the information requested from the agencies is purely for the purpose of review. But the memory of the failed attempt to slash foreign aid last year has led some in the broader foreign aid community to be concerned that Mulvaney, who remains head of OMB and is the acting White House chief of staff, will try again.

“He’s tried again and again to take a sledgehammer to the most minuscule yet high impact part of the budget,” said Liz Schrayer, president of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a network of businesses and organizations that advocate for international development. “He keeps losing, because Congress has seen in a bipartisan fashion these cuts are reckless, and these funds are in America’s security interest. I think we’ll see that again.”

A senior Democratic aide said that it appears the administration is preparing to circumvent Congress with a rescission package and that it can expect a fight.

“Irrelevant of what the Trump administration may wish, Congress still has the power of the purse and we appropriated these funds because they are necessary to protect our interests and national security,” said the aide, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans under consideration. “We are in touch with the State Department and are demanding answers. This scheme would set the precedent for this and all future administrations to ignore spending bills and eliminate spending obligations by jamming Congress with end-of-fiscal year rescission packages.”"
Proposed Bill Wants Tech Companies To Pay Out the Nose if DOJ Inquiry Uncovers Antitrust Violations,https://gizmodo.com,"['Alyse Stanley', 'About The Author', 'Nights', 'Weekend Reporter']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/proposed-bill-wants-tech-companies-to-pay-out-the-nose-1836939956,"Image: Charlie Neibergall (AP)

U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Richard Blumenthal proposed antitrust legislation Friday that, if passed, could give the Justice Department’s recently launched probe into monopoly concerns among big tech companies some serious teeth if any violations come to light.

The two Democrats call it the “Monopolization Deterrence Act,” Reuters reported. This legislation would grant the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission the ability to levy civil penalties when companies break antitrust law, up to 15 percent of the company’s total U.S. revenue or 30 percent of its U.S. revenue in affected markets.

Certain companies have grown so powerful that the fear of earning an injunction for monopolization offenses no longer works as a successful deterrent, prompting the need for “serious financial consequences,” Klobuchar, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for next year’s presidential election, said in a statement about the bill on her website.

“Our legislation would empower our antitrust watchdogs with new tools to deter monopolization of market power and hold bad actors accountable,” Blumenthal said in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. “American consumers and workers are being crushed by corporate consolidation, and our outdated laws have failed to keep pace with our modern economy.”

Whether the bill specifically names Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, or any other companies involved in the Justice Department’s probe, they seem like likely targets of this legislation given its timing. Klobuchar also previously headed efforts in June to provide Congress with more details about these investigations before they launched, according to her office’s statement.

As part of its review, the Justice Department plans to analyze how these big tech companies have secured their market power and whether their practices have “reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers,” per a DOJ statement.

The move comes just weeks after the FTC hit Facebook with a $5 billion fine in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which breached roughly 87 million Facebook users’ personal data. Considering the company made $15.08 billion in revenue in this year’s first quarter alone, Democrats at the time said the commission “failed miserably” in its ruling. While privacy violations and antitrust violations are two entirely different beasts, the way this new bill specifies possible fines as a proportion of a company’s earnings could very well be in response to their dissatisfaction with how the FTC’s handled punishing the big tech company previously."
10-year Treasury yield steady after breaking under 1.7% in overnight trading,https://www.cnbc.com,['Sam Meredith'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/us-bonds-10-year-treasury-yield-in-focus-amid-us-china-trade-war.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note held steady Tuesday morning after breaking under 1.7% earlier in the session for the first time since the fall of 2016.

At around 11:19 a.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 1.736%, off a low of 1.672% hit in overnight trading. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was slightly lower at 2.272%.

The uptick in yields came after China's central bank indicated that it wants the country's currency to strengthen against the U.S. dollar. Overnight, the People's Bank of China set the midpoint for the yuan at a level stronger than the key 7 yuan-to-dollar rate. The yuan breached that level for the first time since 2008 on Monday.

Investors took the announcement from the PBOC as welcome relief from the prior session's fears that China wouldn't support the yuan against the greenback in a burgeoning currency war. Many thought the yuan's depreciation could be an attempt by Beijing to juice its exports and aggravate the trade war between the globe's two largest economies.

Those anxieties sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling more than 750 points on Monday as all three of Wall Street's notched their worst day of the year. The stock onslaught fostered a bid for less risky assets like U.S. debt as yields on maturities across the board sank to multiyear lows.

The angst showed no signs of slowing late Monday after the U.S. Treasury officially designated China as a ""currency manipulator, "" following a sharp fall in the value of the Chinese yuan against the dollar.

A protracted trade dispute between the U.S. and China has now dragged on for more than a year. Both countries have slapped additional tariffs on each other's goods worth billions of dollars, and the escalating tensions have spooked markets and hurt global economic growth outlook.

Late last week, China vowed to retaliate after President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports.

On the data front, the latest monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) will be released at around 10 a.m. ET.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury is set to auction $38 billion in 3-year notes on Tuesday."
"As climate reckoning arrives over agriculture, USDA’s scientists face censorship",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/climate-ipcc-usda-agriculture-emissions-science-relocation-fallout-trump-845a61311bd3/,"A government climate scientist who says the Trump administration buried a groundbreaking report he authored has left the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in protest over the “political views” top officials allegedly imposed on his work.

Politico reported Monday that Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist who worked at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) for more than 20 years, quit due to an increasingly political atmosphere at the agency. Ziska had worked on a major rice study last year, one that found rising levels of carbon dioxide could imperil the critical source of sustenance for some 600 million people globally. According to Ziska’s work, the mineral and protein content in rice, along with key vitamins, is expected to drop as greenhouse gas levels rise.

Agency scientists have accused department officials of seeking to bury that report, among others, in keeping with President Donald Trump’s stance denying and downplaying climate change. USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue has similarly dismissed global warming as “weather patterns.”

USDA claims the study wasn’t publicized because of disagreement among career officials. But Ziska told Politico that the reason the study was buried is down to political ideology and the administration’s unwillingness to embrace established climate science.

“There was a sense [at USDA] that if the science agreed with the politics, then the policymakers would consider it to be ‘good science,’ and if it didn’t agree with the politics, then it was something that was flawed and needed to be done again,” he said.

The scientist’s departure coincides with a summary copy of a highly-anticipated U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on land use being leaked this week. The report emphasizes that global food production must become more sustainable in order to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.

His resignation also comes as the agency is still reeling from a controversial relocation effort connected to disputes over scientific integrity.

The department is set to lose a staggering number of career officials over a deeply contested relocation plan. Perdue announced in June that staffers with USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would be asked to relocate to Kansas City, which straddles Kansas and Missouri. Over 500 staffers were given until July 15 to decide whether to relocate by September 30.

More than half of those staffers reportedly declined to move and have effectively chosen to resign — a dramatic loss of institutional knowledge and career staff who have worked with the department for decades.

USDA has argued that the move is a cost-saving effort to bring the department closer to farm country. But former USDA officials and the union representing employees have rejected that narrative. Many say it is an attempt to force out knowledgeable researchers and scientists, as well as a retaliation for the climate science work produced by some staffers at USDA.

Conversations about the link between agriculture and climate change, however, are only set to escalate. Last year, an IPCC report warned that the world had only 12 years left before crossing a dangerous threshold of global warming — one that would yield climate impacts on a scale not seen before. A leaked copy of this year’s report focuses on land use and the role of agriculture in mitigating climate change.

According to the draft, which is currently being debated in Geneva before its release later this week, cutting carbon emissions from sources like cars and power plants will only go so far. Agriculture, forestry, and other land-use practices are producing roughly a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, the report says, with cattle and rice fields in particular generating around 50% of methane emissions. That has contributed heavily to climate impacts, the draft finds, with the situation only set to worsen.

“Climate change exacerbates land degradation through increases in rainfall intensity, flooding, drought frequency and severity, heat stress, wind, sea-level rise and wave action,” the document states.

In addition to changing how people use land, the IPCC draft underscores that switching to vegetarian and vegan diets may be a critical part of staving off the worst climate impacts.

That refrain may sound familiar to some. Critics of the proposed Green New Deal — a blueprint for radically shifting the United States to net-zero emissions — have argued the climate plan will “ban cows” and deprive Americans of hamburgers. The proposal itself does not move to bar bovines from the country but it does single out agriculture as a major source of greenhouse gases and a sector in need of overhauling if the United States is to zero-out emissions. The IPCC’s findings are therefore likely to draw more attention to the climate science realities dogging agriculture.

High profile exits at USDA are also likely to fuel scrutiny of the Trump administration’s attitudes towards the sector’s relationship with climate science. And other major exits over climate change are also driving headlines. Rod Schoonover, a former senior analyst in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department, wrote in an op-ed last week that the White House had blocked the release of his report on climate change and national security.

“The stated reason,” Schoonover said, “was that the scientific foundation of the analysis did not comport with the administration’s position on climate change.”"

(Jim Bourg/Reuters)

In response to the mass shootings that took place over the weekend, the Department of Justice has begun studying the impact of legislation that would make such attacks a capital crime.

Attorney General William Barr discussed the proposal as one of a number of potential responses to the two attacks that together claimed 31 lives over the weekend, CNN reported Monday.

Currently, federal law holds that the death penalty can be applied in cases where an attacker uses a weapon of mass destruction, such as an explosive, but has no similar provision for mass-casualty attacks perpetrated with a firearm. When mass-shootings occur, federal prosecutors resort to other laws, such as those criminalizing hate crimes, to secure the maximum possible sentence.

In order to draft legislation, Congress would have to define what qualifies as a “mass-shooting.” The FBI defines such shootings as those with four or more victims, while previous federal legislation defined them as those in which three or more people are shot.

At least 22 people were killed in El Paso, Texas on Saturday after a lone gunman opened fire in a Walmart. The perpetrator, who is currently in federal custody, drafted an anti-immigrant manifesto that detailed his motivations for the attack. He may face hate-crime charges in addition to capital-murder charges.

Another nine people were killed hours after the El Paso attack in the downtown district of Dayton, Ohio, after a young man opened fire on night-time revelers with a semi-automatic rifle. The shooter was killed on the scene after exchanging fire with police officers.

President Trump addressed the nation Monday morning, issuing a call for national unity and lamenting the “culture” of violence propagated by movies and video games. He did not mention gun-control legislation.

In a statement issued Monday, Democratic leaders urged Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to call lawmakers back from their August recess to advance background-check legislation that was passed by the Democrat-controlled House earlier this year."
"California Plan Embraced by Ford, VW Had Been Rejected by EPA",https://finance.yahoo.com,['Ryan Beene'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-plan-embraced-ford-vw-201442320.html,"(Bloomberg) -- A recent compromise between four major automakers and California’s clean-air regulator on fuel efficiency had already been rejected by the Trump administration months earlier as not “a productive alternative.”

The deal -- which Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co., BMW AG and Volkswagen AG announced on July 25 alongside the California Air Resources Board -- eases the pace of annual efficiency improvements required under current Obama-era rules but is tougher than the Trump administration’s proposal to cap mileage requirements at 2020 levels.

Key elements of the pact were contained in a November 2018 summary of California’s proposal that was prepared by Environmental Protection Agency staff for Bill Wehrum, then-assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, according to excerpts of the presentation viewed by Bloomberg.

CARB spokesman Stanley Young confirmed on Friday that the state had offered the plan to the EPA last November. The previously unreported detail sheds new light on the months-long battle between between Washington and Sacramento over the mileage rules that automakers urged President Donald Trump to re-evaluate during his first weeks in office.

“Looking back, it seems that they were never interested in negotiations or discussions,” Young said. He added that the four automakers’ support of California’s compromise “highlights the fact that our proposal is both feasible and realistic.”

Relations between EPA and CARB officials have become tense, with each side blaming the other for the breakdown of talks. In a June 20 letter to GOP lawmakers, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said California’s counteroffer hadn’t yet been endorsed by the state’s governor and attorney general when it was presented to EPA. He accused CARB Chairman Mary Nichols of being “unable or unwilling to be a good-faith negotiator.”

The Trump administration’s 2018 proposal said capping fuel economy standards at 2020 levels would lead to less-expensive new cars than under the current rules. The agencies argued more-affordable cars would allow consumers to replace their older vehicles with newer, safer ones more rapidly and avoid thousands of traffic fatalities, claims that experts and EPA career staff have disputed.

In a Bloomberg TV interview in early February, the EPA’s Wheeler said the state’s proposal suggested “just taking the Obama numbers and stretching that an additional year. And that doesn’t really get to the lives saved or the reducing the price of the automobiles to where we would like it to be.”

The White House abandoned discussions with California officials a few weeks later, saying, “Despite the administration’s best efforts to reach a common-sense solution, it is time to acknowledge that CARB has failed to put forward a productive alternative” after the federal proposal was released.

The four-company pact with California also highlights a growing chasm between the Trump administration and the auto industry, which after urging the administration to retool Obama-era mileage standards has since pushed back on the resulting plan that recommended capping requirements after 2020.

That plan, put forth last year by the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, also proposed stripping California of its authority to regulate automobile greenhouse gas emissions. The state and others have vowed to fight in court to retain that power, and automakers fear that prolonged litigation will roil business plans that depend on predictable fuel economy standards.

In June, a group of 17 major carmakers unsuccessfully asked Trump to resume talks with California, saying a pact for unified California-U.S. standards will “enhance our ability to invest and innovate by avoiding an extended period of litigation and instability.”

California’s deal with the four carmakers -- and the one pitched to the EPA last fall -- pushes the 2025 efficiency target back to 2026, lowering the pace of gains each year compared to the current rules starting in 2022. Automakers would get more help to reach those targets from additional compliance credits earned by selling electric vehicles, and wouldn’t have to account for carbon emissions by the power plants that generate electricity used by battery-powered cars.

Energy Department wants to build nuclear test reactor,https://www.latimes.com,"['The Associated Press Is An Independent', 'Not-For-Profit News Cooperative Headquartered In New York City.']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-05/energy-department-wants-to-build-nuclear-test-reactor,"A new nuclear test reactor is needed as part of an effort to revamp the nation’s fading nuclear power industry by developing safer fuel and power plants, the U.S. Department of Energy said Monday.

The federal agency said it would prepare an environmental impact statement as part of the process to build the test reactor in Idaho or Tennessee by the end of 2025. Public comments on the environmental review are being taken through Sept. 4.

The Versatile Test Reactor would be the first new test reactor built in the United States in decades and give the nation a dedicated “fast-neutron-spectrum” testing capability. Such reactors are called fast reactors.

“This testing capability is essential for the United States to modernize its nuclear energy infrastructure and for developing transformational nuclear energy technologies that reduce waste generation and enhance nuclear security,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry said in a statement.

Americans have been wary of nuclear power since the core from Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island underwent a partial meltdown in 1979 — one of the nation’s worst nuclear accidents. That was followed by a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine exploding and burning in 1986. In 2011, an earthquake and tsunami led to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan where the cores of three reactors suffered meltdowns after cooling systems failed.

Federal officials say the proposed test reactor would help create new and safer fuels, materials and reactors being developed by civilian companies in the United States.

“If this capability is not available to U.S. innovators as soon as possible, the ongoing shift of nuclear technology dominance to other international states such as China and the Russian Federation will accelerate, to the detriment of the U.S. nuclear industrial sector,” said Rita Baranwal, the Energy Department’s assistant secretary for nuclear energy.

The Energy Department had a fast reactor, the Experimental Breeder Reactor II, operating in eastern Idaho until it was shut down in 1994 as the nation turned away from nuclear power.

Edwin Lyman, senior scientist and acting director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, said fast reactors such as the proposed Versatile Test Reactor are less safe than current reactors.

Most nuclear reactors in use now are “light-water” reactors fueled by uranium and cooled with water. Lyman said the test reactor would be cooled with harder-to-control liquid sodium and likely fueled by plutonium, increasing potential nuclear terrorism risks because plutonium can be used to make nuclear weapons.

“There is nothing good about these reactors,” he said. “I think there is a love of plutonium in the [Energy] Department that is irrational.”

Revamping the nation’s nuclear power is part of a strategy to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by generating carbon-free electricity with nuclear power. The strategy was initiated under the Obama administration and continuing under the Trump administration, despite Trump’s downplaying of global warming.

Reducing spent nuclear fuel, federal officials say, is also an objective of the new test reactor. The United States has no permanent repository for about 77,000 tons of radioactive spent fuel, stored mainly at the commercial nuclear power plants where they were used to produce electricity.

But Lyman said fast reactors would produce waste even more hazardous and difficult to dispose.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, at the end of December there were 98 nuclear reactors at 59 power plants producing about 20% of the nation’s energy. Most of the reactors are decades old, and many are having a tough time competing economically with other forms of energy production.

The Energy Department is considering building the test reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory in eastern Idaho or the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee.

On a related front, late last year the Energy Department restarted the Transient Test Reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory to test new nuclear fuels. That facility had been on standby since 1994."
EPA submits final controversial car emissions rule to the White House,https://thehill.com,[],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456206-epa-submits-final-controversial-car-emissions-rule-to-the-white,"The White House is reviewing the final policy that would roll back Obama-era standards for vehicle emissions.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Transportation submitted the finalized Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule to the White House for review on Saturday, the second-to-last step before the controversial rule is implemented.

“Today, after reviewing hundreds of thousands of public comments and undertaking extensive scientific and economic analyses, EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) together have initiated formal interagency review for the draft SAFE Vehicles Final Rule,” the agencies said in a joint statement.

“EPA and NHTSA firmly believe that this rule will benefit all Americans by improving the U.S. fleet’s fuel economy, reducing air pollution, helping make new vehicles more affordable for all Americans and, because new vehicles are safer than ever, ultimately saving thousands of lives and reducing the number of Americans seriously injured in car crashes.” ADVERTISEMENT

The final draft of the rule submitted to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will not become public until the rule is complete.

The agencies first submitted their drafts of the vehicle emissions rules for model years 2021-2026 passenger cars and light trucks in August 2018, to immediate backlash.

Environmental groups and lawmakers across the country have criticized the rule for weakening air pollution standards for cars.

The finalization of the rule is expected to be heavily litigated, including through lawsuits threatened by a number of state attorneys general.

News of the rule’s near-imminent implementation comes shortly after California struck a deal with a handful of automakers to keep their emissions cuts in line with the regulations laid out in the Obama-era rule. California had worked hand in hand with the Obama administration to determine stringent air pollution standards for cars.

The state maintains it has the right to establish its own strong air quality standards under the Clean Air Act, and auto manufactuers have long sought one national standard for vehicles across the country.

EPA and the Department of Transportation said when the rule is finalized it will be a “win for all Americans.”"

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump proclaimed that ""hate has no place in America"" after a pair of mass shootings killed 30 people last weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

But Trump himself has been accused of stoking racial tensions.

Trump has created controversy for years with incendiary rhetoric that is often directed at people of color – from his branding of the Central Park Five as “muggers and murderers” to his peddling of the false “birther” conspiracy against then-President Barack Obama to his denigrating of a former African-American aide as a “dog"" to his attacks against four Democratic congresswomen of color.

Here are more than a dozen times when Trump has fueled racial tensions:

Trump’s attacks against four liberal Democratic congresswomen – all women of color – started Sunday with a series of tweets in which he suggested they should “go back” to their country of origin. The remarks were met with a barrage of criticism, but Trump refused to back down, saying they “hate our country” and that “if they don’t like it, let them leave.”

Three of the congresswomen – Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. – were born in the United States. The fourth, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was born in Somalia, but her family fled that country’s civil war when she was 8 years old and eventually settled in Minneapolis. She became an American citizen at age 17.

Trump continued his attack on all four, sometimes dubbed “the Squad,” during a fiery rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, drawing jeers and chants of ""send her back"" as he mentioned their names. The rally cemented the notion that Trump is using the recent controversy as a theme of his reelection campaign to draw a distinction between himself and Democrats.

Omarosa Manigault Newman

Trump furiously attacked former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, who is black, calling her “a dog” and a “crazed crying lowlife.”

Trump’s rampage last summer against his former aide came after Manigault Newman wrote a book about her White House tenure that was highly critical of the president. Manigault Newman also released a tape in which she and three other officials in Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign discussed the possibility of another tape in which Trump supposedly uses a racial slur.

Rumors about a racist tape, supposedly from outtakes of Trump's television program ""The Apprentice,"" on which Manigault Newman was a contestant, surfaced during the last month of the campaign. Manigault Newman has claimed that she has heard the tape, but no audio has publicly surfaced with Trump using the ""n"" word.

But on the tape Manigault Newman released, campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson could be heard saying, “He said it. He is embarrassed by it.""

Trump, who denies making the remark, unleashed a tirade against Newman on Twitter.

“When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out,"" the president tweeted about Manigault Newman. ""Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!""

He was referring to John Kelly, who at the time was White House chief of staff and fired Manigault Newman nine months earlier.

LeBron James and Don Lemon

Basketball star LeBron James sat down with CNN's Don Lemon for an interview last August after he cut the ribbon on his foundation's new I Promise School in his native Akron, Ohio.

James spoke at length on the intersection of sports, culture and politics. He said during the interview that Trump was ""using sports to kinda divide us, and that's something that I can't relate to.""

Not long after, the president tweeted about the interview and James, belittling the intelligence of both the basketball player and Lemon.

""Lebron (sic) James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon,"" Trump tweeted. ""He made Lebron (sic) look smart, which isn’t easy to do. I like Mike!""

Lemon didn’t mince words when he talked about the controversy for nine minutes on CNN.

""The president has called a lot of people stupid,"" Lemon said. ""Some of those people are white. But I would just like to note that referring to an African American as dumb — remember this is America — is one of the oldest canards of America’s racist past and present: that black people are of inferior intelligence.""

He continued: ""This president traffics in racism and is fueled by bullying.""

Maxine Waters

One of Trump's favorite targets has been Congresswoman Maxine Waters.

He has criticized the California Democrat's intelligence many times, saying she has an ""extraordinarily low I.Q.""

He has repeated the phrase at countless rallies and over Twitter.

""Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party,"" Trump posted on Twitter in June. ""She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!""

Charlottesville

Trump's comments after a white nationalists’ rally in Charlottesville, Va., has been dubbed by critics as one of the lowest points in his presidency.

Trump said there were ""fine people on both sides"" of the rally — both the counterprotesters and those members of the alt-right who did Nazi salutes and chants.

Trump also said ""both sides"" were to blame for the violence. A woman who was protesting against the white nationalists was killed after a car rammed into a group marching down a street.

The president's comments after the rally fluctuated from condemning the white nationalists, Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan to then again blaming both sides for what happened.

MS-13 'animals'

Trump has used the word ""animal"" many times to describe those accused of crimes, whether it's gang members or terrorists in the U.S. or abroad.

In May 2018, Trump was criticized after using the word ""animals"" to describe people crossing the border. At first, many took his comments as immigrants were animals. The White House clarified that the president was dubbing MS-13 gang members animals.

During a discussion about MS-13, Trump said: ""We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — and we’re stopping a lot of them — but we’re taking people out of the country. You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals. And we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.""

Many of the president's critics said the comments were dehumanizing and shouldn't be used no matter who it's being used to describe.

NFL players

As NFL protests picked up steam and more and more players refused to stand for the National Anthem, Trump chimed in.

""Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son-of-a-bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!'"" Trump said at a rally in 2017.

The players who took a knee were protesting police brutality and racism after a number of high-profile cases where black men had been shot and killed by police officers.

Faced with criticism, Trump did what he frequently does. He took to Twitter again.

""The NFL players are at it again – taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the National Anthem. Numerous players, from different teams, wanted to show their 'outrage' at something that most of them are unable to define,"" Trump tweeted.

Judge in Trump University case

Trump once argued that a judge involved in his Trump University court case ruled against him because of the judge's heritage.

Trump claimed it was a conflict of interest to have U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel handling his case because he is of Mexican descent. Curiel was born in the United States.

Trump said that Curiel’s heritage meant the judge doesn't like him because he wants to build a wall between the United States and Mexico.

""I have had horrible rulings, I have been treated unfairly by this judge,"" said in June 2016 during his campaign for president. ""Now this judge is of Mexican heritage, I'm building a wall.""

'Shithole' countries

During immigration talks in the Oval Office in January 2018, Trump reportedly grew frustrated, using a crude description of Haiti, El Salvador and African countries, according to a report from The Washington Post.

""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Trump reportedly told lawmakers.

The president then suggested that the U.S. try to increase immigration from countries like Norway, whose prime minister he had recently met.

Obama ‘birther’ conspiracy

Well before he became president, Trump was one of the loudest voices of the ""birther"" conspiracy.

He claimed that then-president Obama was not born in the U.S. and even went as far as claiming that he'd sent investigators to Hawaii, where Obama was born.

Even after Obama released a long-form version of his birth certificate, hoping to quell the conspiracy, Trump kept floating the idea that Obama was an illegitimate president.

He largely avoided the subject during his 2016 presidential campaign but did eventually acknowledge Obama was born in the U.S. while also falsely claiming Hillary Clinton was to blame for creating the conspiracy.

Muslim Gold Star parents

Critics, including some fellow Republicans, blasted Trump's feud with the Muslim parents of a fallen soldier.

Khizr Khan, who lost a son in the Iraq war, spoke out against Trump multiple times, most notably during the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.

Khan assailed Trump for proposals that would bar Muslim entry into the United States and may not have allowed his son into the United States had they been in place. Khan urged Trump to read the U.S. Constitution and told him ""you have sacrificed nothing.""

Responding, Trump suggested that the Clinton campaign wrote Khan's convention speech and that Khan's wife did not speak at the convention because she was forbidden.

Trump continued to tweet about the Khans, saying the story shouldn't be about him but rather ""radical Islamic terrorism and the U.S.""

""Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same — Nice!"" Trump said in another tweet.

A number of Republicans took aim at Trump with the controversy that surrounded the feud.

Then-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Trump has ""disparaged a fallen soldier’s parents"" and in the past ""has suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the United States — to say nothing of entering its service. I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump’s statement.""

Central Park Five

Trump has repeatedly disparaged a group of black and Latino men wrongly accused of assaulting a white female jogger in Central Park in 1989.

Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Korey Wise were all boys when they were convicted of raping Trisha Meili. They were then found innocent of the crime after convicted murder Matias Reyes in 2002 confessed to raping Meili, which was confirmed by DNA evidence. The city awarded the men $41 million in 2014, a decade after some of the men initially sued the city for how it handled the case.

In 1989, Trump, then a popular business mogul, spent $85,000 worth of ads published in The New York Times, The Daily News, The New York Post and New York Newsday in which he lamented crime in the city and claimed there was no more “law and order.”

'They admitted their guilt': 30 years of Trump's comments about the Central Park Five

Trump claimed the city was being ""ruled by the law of the streets, as roving bands of wild criminals roam our neighborhoods, dispensing their own vicious brand of twisted hatred on whomever they encounter.""

Trump said he hated ""these muggers and murderers.""

He has refused to back down, again calling them “muggers” on Twitter in 2013 and labeling the $41 “a disgrace.”

Around a month before the 2016 election, Trump stood by his opinion that the five men were guilty even though they have since been exonerated of the crime.

'Disgusting ... rodent infested' Baltimore

In July, Trump went after Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings on Twitter and slammed the Democrat's hometown of Baltimore, calling the majority-black city a ""disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess."" Cummings chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which has been probing Trump's finances.

In one tweet, Trump insinuated that ""billions of dollars have been pumped in"" to Baltimore over the years ""but to no avail"" and that people should ask Cummings why the money was ""stolen or wasted.""

Cummings passionately defended his hometown, saying he didn't ""have time for people who want to trash our city."""

Turning the page away from the politicization of investigations

A free society cannot stay free for long if the criminal-justice system becomes a political weapon, if that becomes our norm.

The most alarming aspect of the Trump–Russia investigation, and of the stark difference between the aggression with which it was pursued and the see-no-evil passivity of the Clinton emails caper, is the way the investigative process was used to influence political outcomes.

The way to right that wrong is to prevent it from becoming the new normal, not to turn the tables of abuse when power shifts from one side to the other. We can only make things worse by losing the distinction between rebuking errors in judgment and criminalizing them.

Ardent Trump supporters are growling over news that the FBI’s former director, James Comey, will not be prosecuted by the Justice Department for the mishandling of memoranda he wrote about his contacts with the president. The news has been reported by The Hill’s John Solomon and the Washington Post’s Devlin Barrett, among others.

Comey’s handling of his memos is one aspect of probes related to investigations attendant to the 2016 election, which are being conducted by Justice Department independent counsel Michael Horowitz. Indications are that Horowitz referred the memos issue to the Justice Department for possible prosecution and that, after reviewing the IG’s findings, Justice declined to pursue the matter as a criminal case.

Advertisement

That is the way things are supposed to work. The inspector general’s job is to ensure that colorable allegations of misconduct against Justice Department officials (including FBI officials) are thoroughly examined, so that all of the relevant facts are uncovered. The Justice Department then reviews the IG’s report, mindful of two imperatives that are in tension. On one hand, clear criminal misconduct must be prosecuted; otherwise we have a two-tiered justice system in which those we trust to enforce the law can violate it with impunity. On the other hand, poor judgment, while it should be censured and may be the basis for disciplinary action, must not be criminalized; otherwise, we discourage talented, honorable people from taking jobs that are all about excruciating judgment calls.

Advertisement

What happened in this instance? We don’t know yet — and that alone calls for restraint. It is no knock on Messrs. Solomon and Barrett, who are excellent reporters with good sources, to caution that we have not yet seen the IG report.

To be sure, many relevant facts are known. The Comey memos have been public for some time, the former director has testified about them in congressional hearings, and they were part of the mountain of information from which Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s staff derived their final report. Still, there is much we do not know. Past experience informs us that IG Horowitz is thorough and careful. His office has interviewed lots of witnesses and scrutinized government reports to which we do not have access. His report is not expected to be released until September. Until then, we won’t know what happened, and why. In the meantime, since I have known both Attorney General Bill Barr and former director Jim Comey for many years, I am confident about two things.

Advertisement

Advertisement

First, no one is better suited than Barr to weigh the pros and cons of prosecuting alleged government misconduct. He has prioritized the importance of resisting the politicization of law enforcement and he grasps the stakes involved. He is also a big enough boy to tune out the noise from the Trump–Comey feud: the president’s nonstop depiction of Comey as the reincarnation of Lavrentiy Beria, and the former director’s worn-thin moralizing about how “Trump eats your soul in small bites” — including Barr’s own. The attorney general is not going to authorize a prosecution in the absence of clear evidence of a serious crime.

Second, I do not believe that Jim Comey would willfully leak classified information. Unless and until someone can show me he did it, I am going to continue assuming he did not.

Advertisement

That does not mean his handling of the memos was model behavior, though. It seems to me that he played with fire.

The existence of the memos became known shortly after Comey was fired on May 9, 2017. It is only natural that they raised alarm. One would expect that if a president and an FBI director met several times, memos documenting those conversations would contain at least some classified information. Comey, moreover, brazenly acknowledged that he had orchestrated the leak of at least a portion of one memo to the New York Times. That is not normal.

Nevertheless, Comey is very smart. And you don’t have to agree with his politics or like his style to realize that he has spent much of his career protecting national security. By definition, when information is classified, that means its unauthorized disclosure could damage American national security. Might Comey mishandle classified information? Sure, it’s possible — plenty of smart, patriotic public officials have done that. But to me, it is implausible that Comey would knowingly do that, much less intentionally transmit classified intelligence to the media.

Advertisement

That said, the classified-information facet of this episode has been exaggerated. There were seven memos in all, totaling 15 pages. Our understanding is that Comey tried to avoid putting classified information in them, and believed he had succeeded. Yet after obtaining and accounting for all of them, the FBI designated two of them as “confidential,” the lowest level of classification. We do not know at this point (or, at least, I don’t know) whether the memo leaked to the Times — regarding the February 2017 Trump–Comey discussion of the investigation of former national-security adviser Michael Flynn — was one of the classified ones. But we can easily deduce that Comey neither intended it to be classified nor thought it was. At one point in the memo, Comey wrote, “NOTE: Because this is an unclassified document, I will be limited in how I describe what I said next.”

Advertisement

We know that Comey shared this memo with a friend (who is also a friend of mine, and who was his intermediary with the Times), and that he shared at least some of the memos with his lawyers (who are also friends of mine). From a classified-information standpoint, however, we are talking about a small number of documents, and it is unclear that Comey knew anything in them was classified. Even if he turned out to be wrong about that, it is highly unlikely that prosecutors could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was grossly negligent in mishandling them, much less that he willfully mishandled them.

To my mind, the issue here has never been criminal misconduct in connection with classified information. The relevant matters are the non-criminal but serious impropriety in the handling of non-public government information, and the failure to protect the confidentiality of communications as to which the president has a presumptive privilege — a privilege that subordinate executive officials are obliged to respect, regardless of whether they respect the president himself.

Advertisement

There is no problem with Comey’s having chosen to write the memos. Much is made of the fact that he did not trust President Trump and that he felt compelled to document their communications, even though he did not do that when he spoke with President Obama. So what? He is entitled to feel that way. He was under no duty either to write or to refrain from writing memos. As long as he recorded events fairly and honestly when he chose to report them, nothing more was required.

The problem, however, is that the former director seems to have regarded the memos as his own property, rather than the government’s. To the contrary, these were clearly accounts of government business compiled by a government official using government property on government time. The memos were not Comey’s to keep; and they were certainly not his to disseminate to the media.

Reports of non-public government business are sensitive, regardless of whether they contain classified information. Conversations between the president and top national-security officials are among the most sensitive. Top executive officers, such as the FBI director, are well aware that those communications are presumptively privileged, and that the privilege belongs to the president. The director can be cut some slack for keeping memos he wrote in his home rather than in his office — an FBI director is never off duty. But he’s got no business leaking government files of any kind to the media, and that goes double for memoranda about communications with the president — any president, end of story.

It makes no difference that, at the time of the leak, Comey was no longer the FBI director. A public official, particularly of such high rank, has continuing fiduciary duties upon leaving government service — even when the departure is against his will. Of course it was wrong for the administration to give conflicting rationales for Comey’s firing. It was also wrong for the president to goad the former director with a farcical, shades-of-Watergate tweet, suggesting there might be White House recordings of their conversations. There are many ways the former director could appropriately have responded to these provocations; leaking a government memo was not one of them.

Comey has said he was hoping to trigger the appointment of a special counsel. But he could have done that, in his new capacity as a private citizen, by arranging a press conference at which he called for the appointment of a special counsel. It would have gotten plenty of attention. Comey, a gifted public speaker, would have made a forceful presentation that would have gotten significant traction on Capitol Hill, where Democrats were already clamoring for a special counsel.

Advertisement

The former director’s decision to proceed by leaking to the media a government memo, documenting a sensitive but probably not classified meeting with the president, was wrong. It was the kind of behavior it is impossible to imagine that Comey, as FBI director, would abide if one of his subordinates had done it. Indeed, in Comey’s memo about the Flynn conversation, he describes speaking at length with Trump about the menace of leaks, about how they undermine the president’s capacity to do his job. He even recounts telling the president that he was “eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message.”

To leak the memo was unbecoming conduct. It is worthy of censure. That does not make it a felony.

The ongoing Justice Department and congressional inquiries into the investigations attendant to the 2016 election are wide-ranging. In assessing investigative overreach, it is vital to remember that the remedy for politicized law enforcement is not more politicized law enforcement. If officials with a commendable record of service to the country took steps they should not have taken out of lapses in judgment — including lapses driven by overwrought suspicions of impending danger to the nation — then there needs to be an accounting. We will also need to implement better oversight procedures to insure against a repetition.

That, however, does not mean crimes were committed. The president’s fans should remember that their main complaint has been that Donald Trump and his campaign were treated as suspects in heinous, traitorous crimes despite the absence of credible incriminating evidence. The investigators, too, are entitled not to be presumed guilty of crimes, even by those of us who are convinced that there were investigative irregularities.

Let’s get the facts first, and then we can decide whether laws were broken, and whether there has been misconduct worthy of prosecution. And when we decide, let’s bear in mind that a norm against criminalizing political disputes cannot be reestablished unless we commit to reestablishing it. That means keeping the political vendettas out of the investigations."
Veteran dies by suicide at VA Medical Center in Asheville,https://www.wspa.com,"['Christine Scarpelli', 'Wspa Staff']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.wspa.com/news/veteran-dies-by-suicide-at-va-medical-center-in-asheville/,"ASHEVILLE, N.C.

U.S. Stocks Plunge Most in 2019 on Trade Tension: Markets Wrap,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com,"['Rita Nazareth', 'Vildana Hajric']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-stocks-set-drop-trade-215712238.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Financial markets buckled after China escalated the trade war with the U.S., sending American stocks to the biggest drop this year and sparking a rally in global bonds. Gold surged with the yen.

More than $700 billion were wiped from the value of U.S. equities on Monday, with the S&P 500 Index plunging 3% and all but 11 companies in the gauge trading lower. Losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassed 700 points as Apple and IBM slid at least 4%. The Cboe Volatility Index surged about 40%. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped to the lowest since before President Donald Trump’s election. China’s yuan sank beyond 7 per dollar, a move that suggests the level is no longer a line in the sand for policy makers in Beijing.

Investors are starting to grasp the potential for a protracted conflict between the world’s two largest economies, with a Treasury-market recession indicator hitting the highest alert since 2007. As demand for haven assets spiked, gold made a run toward $1,500 an ounce and the Japanese yen extended its rally. Major cryptocurrencies, increasingly seen as a refuge during distressed times, climbed as Bitcoin approached $12,000. Fear gauges for the corporate bond market rose the most since March as traders rushed to hedge their positions.

“The trade war is now intensifying and it’s possible that a currency war will start as well,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. “Neither is good for the global economy and both will hurt equity markets.”

People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said the nation won’t use exchange rates as a tool in the escalating trade dispute. Yet for President Trump, the latest decline in the yuan is “called ‘currency manipulation”’. The American leader also indicated he’d like the Federal Reserve to act to counter the Chinese action. Swaps show bets the central bank will ease by 100 basis points by December 2020, a quarter point more than what was priced in after last week’s cut.

The trade war has been a consistent catalyst for market volatility and hopes of a resolution are now being sent even further out in the horizon, according to Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial Corp. While that could continue to challenge portfolios, investors should not make the mistake of trying to time the markets amid the sell-off, he said.

“This too shall eventually pass, and bouts of volatility in recent months have shown this can happen quickly,” said Loewengart.

These are some key events to watch out for this week:

Earnings from financial giants include: UniCredit, AIG, ABN Amro Bank, Standard Bank, Japan Post Bank.Five Asian central banks have rate decisions including India, Australia and New Zealand.A string of Fed policy makers speak this week, including St. Louis chief James Bullard on Tuesday and Chicago’s Charles Evans a day later. All are Federal Open Market Committee voters.

Here are the main moves in markets (all sizes and scopes are on a closing basis):

Stocks

The S&P 500 declined 3% to 2,844.74.The Stoxx Europe 600 Index decreased 2.3%.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dipped 2.3%.The MSCI Emerging Market Index slid 3.1%.

He Has Covered Rail', 'Trucking', 'Maritime Issues Since For A Variety Of Publications Based In The U.S.', 'The U.K. John Began Business Reporting In At Broadcasting', 'Cable Magazine. He Graduated Florida State University Majoring In English']",08-05-2019,2019,8,http://www.freightwaves.com/news/watchdog-agency-clears-epas-glider-truck-testing-practices,"Testing by federal regulators in 2017 that found air pollution from glider kits to be “many times” the level generated by new heavy-duty truck engines complied with approved standards, a government watchdog agency has found.

A July 31 audit conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Inspector General (EPA OIG) also confirmed that EPA staff have not been directed to work on a 2017 proposed rule that would have exempted glider trucks from stricter Phase 2 emissions requirements. That means that a 300-truck per manufacturer cap on glider kits remains in place.

Glider kits are a way for truck owners to buy a new truck with a remanufactured engine, often at a significant discount from a new truck and engine combination.

The OIG audit was conducted at the request of Republican lawmakers. Last year they questioned EPA’s testing processes at its National Vehicle and Fuels Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which were used in a 2017 EPA study on glider truck emissions. Opponents of the study, which found air emissions from gliders to be 43 to 55 times those of trucks with modern emission controls, also argued that Volvo [CXE: VOLVB.S.IX] had influenced the findings. Volvo and other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have supported tighter emissions controls after years of investing in clean-engine technology.

Both EPA and Volvo were cleared in the OIG’s audit. “The EPA complied with standard practices and relevant policies and procedures covering objectivity and integrity in planning and conducting its testing of glider vehicles in 2017,” according to the audit.

The OIG concluded that employees within EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) had received the required testing approvals and followed normal procedures in submitting the glider testing report. “The OIG also did not identify ethics violations within the scope of our audit by a former OTAQ Center Director.”

The audit did find minor issues with how EPA exercised its “donation acceptance authority” when officials there acquired the trucks used for its study. The OIG recommended that EPA officials evaluate whether it needs to develop further guidance or policies on accepting donated property.

The audit marks the latest development in a long-running controversy over how much glider kits pollute. Because the kits can be roughly 25 percent less costly than new truck cabs, they are in high demand by independent fleet operators from manufacturers such as Crossville, Tennessee-based Fitzgerald Glider Kits.

Fitzgerald commissioned a study conducted by Tennessee Technological University (Tennessee Tech) in 2017 that found glider engines do not pollute any more than modern OEM systems. The Tennessee Tech study was then used to lobby on behalf of a measure that allows rebuilt diesel engines to be exempt from the Obama-era emissions rules.

Trump judges face scrutiny over president's cases,https://thehill.com,[],08-04-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/456013-trump-judges-face-scrutiny-over-presidents-cases,"Federal judges nominated by President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer White Supremacist calls on Trump to stop using fear to motivate people Walmart employee urges workers to strike until the company's stores stop selling guns Biden: Violent video games 'not healthy' but aren't 'in and of itself why we have this carnage' MORE are facing a major public test as they handle cases that involve Trump personally or some of his most controversial policies.

New judges are already under pressure to carefully issue rulings as they learn the ropes of the federal judiciary. But three recently appointed district judges in D.C. — Trevor McFadden, Timothy Kelly and Carl Nichols — have found themselves and their rulings under a magnifying glass as they deal with cases involving Trump.

All three of the Trump-tapped judges have acted as their colleagues on the bench typically do, proceeding cautiously in the recent cases. And while legal experts disagreed over whether the judges are facing additional pressure over their rulings, they agreed that there is more attention on the cases, at least in the media.

“These judges realize that everybody's looking at them, and they're kind of behind the eight ball either way you look at it,” Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow in the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies Program, told The Hill.

“A decision for the administration could look like favoritism, or a decision against the administration can be taken as perhaps bending over backwards not to appear supportive of them,” he added.

In the last two weeks, McFadden and Nichols have both taken careful approaches to a lawsuit over a New York law that allows Congress to obtain the president’s state tax returns.

McFadden, who was confirmed by the Senate in October 2017, was initially assigned to the lawsuit over Trump’s New York tax returns because he was also assigned to a lawsuit over the president’s federal tax returns.

But McFadden disagreed with Trump’s personal lawyers who sought to have him also oversee the new case, ordering last week that the state tax return case be randomly reassigned to a new judge.

In his order, he highlighted the importance of adhering to rules about when cases can be considered related to avoid the appearance of judge shopping and to ensure to the public that judges are assigned to cases in an impartial manner.

Nichols, who was just confirmed by the Senate in May and is so new that his name hasn’t been added to the list of D.C. district judges on the court’s website, is now taking on the New York tax returns case in what appears to be his first-ever assignment.

He has been deliberate in his handling of an emergency motion from Trump to block Democratic lawmakers from requesting the president’s New York tax returns. After initially hearing arguments in the case, he asked the parties to try to reach an agreement themselves.

When they failed to do so, Nichols held a teleconference to get more information from those involved. And one day later, he issued an order that temporarily stops New York from handing over the returns to the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, after indicating to the parties that is how he would rule. The panel has not yet requested the returns.

Andy Grewal, a law professor at the University of Iowa, said that in the legal fights over Trump's tax returns, “it seems like both judges have been pretty cautious.”

But he said the judges’ cautious approach may have more to do with the nature of the issues before them, such as court shopping, than the fact that they are new to the bench.

Mike Stern, who served in the House Office of General Counsel from 1996 to 2004, said that the judges appear to be trying to handle lawsuits in as apolitical a manner as possible.

He said that McFadden’s actions in the tax returns case as well as one over border wall funding have been reasonable and that Nichols’s actions in the state tax return case are consistent with courts’ desire to try to not make a decision when there are disputes between different branches of government.

“If they can avoid having to make a decision, they will do that,” Stern said.

McFadden’s ruling on the tax returns case wasn’t his first high-profile case involving the president. Earlier this year, he presided over House Democrats’ lawsuit challenging the administration’s use of military funds for a border wall.

Before getting to the claims made in the lawsuit, the judge dedicated the first half of a three-hour hearing on the matter to whether he should even be allowed to oversee the proceeding. McFadden ultimately ruled that Democrats did not have standing to bring the case forward.

Kelly was first thrown into the spotlight when the White House revoked CNN correspondent Jim Acosta James (Jim) AcostaTrump judges face scrutiny over president's cases Playboy plans to appeal after reporter says his White House credentials were suspended Trump calls out Cincinnati's 'Democrat mayor' as protesters escorted out MORE's press credentials. The judge ruled against the administration in that case, ordering that the credentials be reinstated.

He also recently oversaw a lengthy hearing on a Trump policy. Kelly heard arguments for more than three hours last month on whether he should issue a temporary restraining order on a policy that would block migrants who pass through a third country from claiming asylum in the United States, with few exceptions.

Kelly, who was confirmed by the Senate in September 2017, was methodical in his line of questioning, pressing attorneys for both sides on the details of their arguments and frequently referring to documents laid out before him during the hearing.

As he wrapped up the proceeding, he noted the importance of both getting the case right and issuing a ruling quickly.

Kelly ultimately decided to not grant the temporary restraining order, in a win for the Trump administration. But that ruling was overshadowed just hours later, after San Francisco-based Judge Jon Tigar, an Obama appointee, issued a preliminary injunction against the asylum rule.

Some legal experts say that the Trump-appointed judges have been trying to be careful and are acting in ways that are consistent with common court practices.

But others who are following the legal cases closely are worried that Trump-appointed judges will go out of their way to act in ways that benefit the president.

Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who backs efforts to obtain Trump’s tax returns, said many Trump-appointed judges were nominated because of their conservative ideology. And he suggested they could feel pressure to show their loyalty to Republicans if they want to eventually be appointed to an appellate court or the Supreme Court.

“Their careers are tied in large measure to them continuing to be loyal,” he said.

But legal experts generally maintained that the judges are acting impartially and with the goal of reaching the best outcome possible.

“Speaking generally, we know that the party of the appointing president is a predictor of how judges will rule in cases, but it's not a very good predictor,” Wheeler said. “But most of the cases, it can be judged fairly cut and dry. The law is clear. The precedents are clear. There's really not much discretion to exercise.

“It's when you get to the cases in which the law is unclear, with new cases that lack a lot of precedents — that's when notions of public policy come into play,” he added.

Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law, pushed back on how much pressure the judges are under.

He argued that judges in certain circuits, such as D.C., may be more likely than those in other parts of the country to face high-profile cases during their first years. And he said that judges will rule impartially, regardless of which president appointed them to the bench.

“They’re considered judge material because they’re neutral and detached,” Blackman told The Hill."

Justice Department subpoenas Tyson Foods amid chicken price-fixing complaints,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/business/justice-department-subpoenas-tyson-foods-amid-chicken-price-fixing-complaints,"Tyson Foods, one of several U.S. chicken processors grappling with price-fixing lawsuits, said it has received subpoenas from the Justice Department for documents and information.

The disclosure in a regulatory filing on Monday followed a June request from the department's antitrust lawyers that U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin temporarily halt document and record production in a 3-year-old civil suit accusing the industry of artificially inflating the price of broiler chickens, starting in 2008. The case has been combined with similar actions in federal court in Chicago.

""We are fully cooperating with the Department of Justice's request,"" the Springdale, Arkansas-based company said in the filing. The Attorney General's Office in Florida requested information on possible anticompetitive behavior in the matter more than two years ago, the company said, and has followed up with a subpoena for all of the data submitted to federal investigators.

The Justice Department said in its civil filing that the delay on document production, a process known as discovery, was necessary to protect a grand jury investigation.

""There is very substantial overlap between the civil and criminal matters,"" Justice Department lawyers wrote. ""Although the requested stay may cause some short-term delay, granting the stay and allowing the grand jury investigation and any subsequent charges to streamline the court’s workload may significantly enhance judicial economy.""

Tyson Foods climbed 5.1% to $83.83 in New York trading on Monday after posting higher second-quarter profit than analysts had projected. Sales in its chicken business climbed 12%, as higher volume made up for a drop in prices, the company said.

Still, the poultry business isn't performing as well as executives want, CEO Noel White said on a conference call with investors Monday. Along with operational issues, he said, ""we experienced a slow start to the grilling season because of poor, wet weather, but we're expecting to finish the summer strong, especially back-to-school season and Labor Day weekend."""
U.S. State Department welcomes news of ceasefire in northwest Syria,https://www.reuters.com,"['Nandita Bose', 'Min Read']",08-04-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-syria-northwest/state-department-welcomes-news-of-ceasefire-in-northwest-syria-idUSKCN1UU00T,"FILE PHOTO: Turkish soldiers stand on a watch tower at the Atmeh crossing on the Syrian-Turkish border, as seen from the Syrian side, in Idlib governorate, Syria May 31, 2019. REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Saturday said it welcomed news of a ceasefire in Northwest Syria - the last rebel bastion in the country - and urged for an end to attacks on civilians.

Last week Syrian media reported that the ceasefire would take place as long as rebel fighters implement the terms of a de-escalation agreement brokered last year by Russia and Turkey.

The wave of violence in northwest Syria since late April has killed more than 400 civilians and forced more than 440,000 to flee toward the Turkish border, according to the United Nations.

“The United States believes there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict, and only a political solution can ensure a stable and secure future for all Syrians,” the State Department said in a statement.

“We further believe the only viable path to a political solution is the U.N.-led political process in Geneva, including constitutional reform and U.N.-supervised elections,” the statement said.

The United States will support the work of U.N. Special Envoy Geir Pedersen and the United Nations to advance a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process that would create a permanent, peaceful, and political end to the conflict, the State Department added.

The region - including Idlib province and parts of nearby Hama - was part of the last major stronghold of armed opposition to President Bashar al-Assad, who has vowed to reclaim all of Syria.

The Department also commended efforts by Turkey and Russia to restore the cease fire they agreed in September 2018."
10-year Treasury yield plunges below 1.74% after China counters US trade action,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/05/us-bonds-10-year-treasury-yield-falls-to-nearly-3-year-low.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 1.74% on Monday, its lowest level since November 2016, after China countered new U.S. tariffs, escalating the protracted trade war between globe's two biggest economies.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, used as a benchmark for mortgage and auto loan rates, fell 12 basis points to 1.735%, its lowest level since Nov. 9, 2016. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell 9 basis points to 2.293%, while the rate on the 2-year Treasury dropped 12 basis points to 1.581%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

The 10-year Treasury note yield, down more than 30 basis points in August, returned less than the 3-month Treasury bill at 2.017%.

The bid for Treasurys and pivot away from stocks came after actions by China fueled a new wave of trade anxiety across global markets.

China, which has in the past tinkered with its currency to boost its exports, allowed the yuan to fall to its lowest level in more than a decade, making Chinese exports cheaper. The onshore yuan broke above 7 per U.S. dollar, drawing the online ire of President Donald Trump, who voiced his complaint on Twitter.

""China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It's called 'currency manipulation.' Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!""

Trump's criticism on Monday came less than three months after his Treasury Department decided not to label China a currency manipulator. Despite promises to label Beijing as such during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, the administration has passed on five opportunities to do so thus far.

Bloomberg News also reported that Beijing has asked state-owned companies to refrain from buying U.S. agricultural goods.

These moves came four days after Trump announced that the U.S. on Sept. 1 would impose a 10% tariff the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had eluded duties. The news pushed the S&P 500 to its worst weekly performance of the year. The S&P 500 dropped 31% last week. The Dow had its second-biggest weekly drop of 2019 last week, sliding 2.6%."
Commerce Department names rural development director,https://www.al.com,"['William Thornton', 'Wthornton Al.Com']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.al.com/business/2019/08/commerce-department-names-rural-development-director.html,"Alabama’s rural communities now have a state position devoted to helping with economic development projects.

Department of Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield announced today that Brenda Tuck has been hired as the department’s first rural development manager.

Tuck will assist rural counties and communities in competing for job-creating projects, providing technical assistance and training.

It’s an area she knows well. She previously served in economic development positions in Marengo, Dallas and Wilcox counties and has been regional workforce council liaison to the Commerce Department’s Workforce Development Division. She also spent seven years as a partner with Selma consulting firm Alford & Associates and five years in economic development at Pioneer Electric Cooperative.

Tuck said she looks forward to working with rural counties and their leaders.

“Rural communities in Alabama can benefit from having a go-to person who can connect them with the resources they need to improve their economic development prospects,” Tuck said.

Alabama in recent years has made a priority of rural economic development through several initiatives. In 2015 the state began offering incentives to qualified projects in targeted counties as a bid to spur rural job creation. The Commerce Department says about 16 projects have qualified, with about $1 billion in investments and 1,400 jobs. This year the Alabama Legislature approved increasing the number of counties eligible for enhanced incentives.

Commerce Secretary Greg Canfield said Tuck’s background makes her “the ideal choice to help rural communities navigate the economic development process.”

“Brenda has extensive experience working on the front lines of economic development in rural Alabama counties, so she knows the specific challenges these areas face when it comes to competing for projects,” Canfield said."
Housing Authority's Gene Bell retires: 'I’ve been the luckiest guy in the world’,https://www.citizen-times.com,"['John Boyle', 'Published A.M.

Growing up on a farm in rural Kentucky, Gene Bell learned the value — and the price — of hard physical labor.

""A lot of hogs, a lot of burley (tobacco),” Bell said, adding that tobacco in particular was labor intensive. “When I started it, you had to top it and sucker it, and then you had to cut it and put it in the barn. Then strip it, press it and take it the warehouse. There’s a whole art to it.”

To prevent nicotine poisoning, he had to wear a hat, a long-sleeved shirt and safety glasses, all in Kentucky's oppressive summer heat.

But an incident beyond tobacco harvesting really convinced Bell he needed to find a way out of the fields, most likely through higher education.

Like a lot of older men in those days, Bell's grandfather often wore a truss, a type of padded belt, to hold in hernias. One day when he was out digging post holes, the truss failed and his grandfather’s intestines poured through the hernias. Other men had to work furiously to tuck them back into his abdomen.

Bell threw up.

“I thought, ‘You don’t have to worry about me not going to college, bro,"" he said with a laugh.

Now, six decades later, Bell has retired after a 25-year career with the Housing Authority of the City of Asheville, including the past 14 as CEO. He spent 20 years before that in the business world.

Bell will continue working part-time with the authority, strictly to see through a project he views as his baby: the transformation of the 96-unit Lee Walker Heights public housing development into a 212-unit mixed-income and mixed-use neighborhood.

Bell was honored July 25 with a farewell gathering at the Arthur R. Edington Education & Career Center, a program attended by about 130 friends, family members and coworkers. Asheville Vice Mayor Gwen Wisler read a proclamation declaring the date ""Gene Bell Day,"" and Buncombe County Commissioner Amanda Edwards noted the county plans to offer a similar proclamation at the Aug. 6 Board of Commissioners meeting.

A steady stream of speakers talked about how much Bell, who has served on dozens of boards and committees, has meant to the city, public housing and to them personally. They also described him as a sometimes strict father figure who stressed accountability, a man obsessed with punctuality and efficiency who each day carried a handwritten to-do list in his pocket.

But he also has been a leader always willing to give someone a second chance or a hand up, several people said.

All about relationships

The Rev. Jim Abbott, former pastor of St. Matthias Episcopal Church and a longtime friend, said Bell simply committed himself to the community early on, and he had a knack for connecting the dots between education, poverty and jobs. Bell carved out time for community service, whether it was serving on the Asheville City Schools board or on the board of Muddy Sneakers, a program designed to get kids outdoors.

""I don't think many great things went on in this community over the last 25 years that don't have your fingerprints on them,"" Abbott said.

Shaunda Sandford, coordinator of the Housing Authority's Family Self-Sufficiency Program, talked about Bell's love of the outdoors. He took her hiking for the first time, showing her that ""black people can go hiking and enjoy it,"" she said, drawing laughter from the crowd.

Bell repeatedly said his job, as well as life, really comes down to one simple theme: respecting and caring about people.

(Photo: ANGELI WRIGHT/ASHEVILLE CITIZEN TIMES)

“I believe the most important thing in this world is relationships,” Bell said at his retirement event. ""Now, people have a lot of philosophical definitions of that, but the true meaning for your existence is relationships. You’ve got to help people. If we helped people as much as we deter people, it would be a lot easier.”

Bell said he's particularly proud of his work with the Residents Councils in the various housing developments.

Crystal Reid, president of the Residents Council for Lee Walker Heights and Klondyke Homes, said before the event that those relationships have been mutually beneficial. She lives in Klondyke and previously lived in Lee Walker.

""He’s a very neutral man and he keeps things transparent, and that’s one quality I greatly appreciate in him,"" Reid said. ""He's a very balanced man. He's not one to go toward the negative or the positive. He keeps it in the middle so everyone has a chance to say their piece.""

Relationships have always been precious to Bell, as well as tenuous at times.

Bell’s mother died when he was 11, in hindsight a harbinger of the loss of many of the people closest to Bell. He lost his first wife, Sharon, in 2015; and his daughter, Angela, who died from an aneurysm at age 40 in 2013. Bell also has a son, Shannon, 44, who is partially disabled after suffering a stroke.

While he's a little gruff on the exterior and known for his sometimes colorful language, Bell is also known for his optimism and genuinely caring about others.

At the Edington Center, Bell directly addressed the losses.

""Since I started with the housing authority — I think I can get through this — I’ve lost my daughter, my wife, my father, mother-in-law, six aunts, two uncles, eight first cousins, two mentors,” Bell said. “The reason that I can continue to go on is because when I look out here, it’s about you all. I can’t do anything about my losses, but I can damn sure do something about the people who are living.”

David Nash, who replaces Bell as CEO at HACA, said Bell was well-known for storytelling, regaling people with tales of life on the farm or his grandfather's frugality. Sometimes Bell would talk about his early career as one of the first African American managers at IBM.

""At some point I realized he wasn’t just doing this with staff, that he was doing it with the whole community — and by the whole community, I mean the African American community, the white community, the broader community of Asheville,"" Nash said. ""He didn’t care whether your name was Smith or Cecil, or whether it was Wanda or Shevonda. He could make a connection with people, he can make a connection with people. And he can really make people feel warm and welcome.""

Allison Smith, the property manager for HACA's Pisgah View Apartments, said Bell has always been ""firm and fair,"" balancing safety with livability.

""I think he's just a father figure for anyone who's walked the halls at (the Housing Authority),"" Smith said. ""He was there for everybody.""

Jovan Aiken, a maintenance technician with the Authority for about a year, said Bell helped a lot of people with jobs and ""never left anybody hanging or out to dry.""

Despite the early loss of his mother, Bell said he felt blessed to have grown up with both grandfathers within a mile. “I had a lot of love — as much as I could stand,"" he said. ""I’ve been the luckiest guy in the world.”

A business career came first

Bell graduated from Xavier University in Cincinnati with a degree in business management, then spent 20 years working for IBM, the international computer and management giant. He had upper level management stints in Lexington, Kentucky; Cincinnati;Cleveland, then at IBM headquarters in New Jersey.

Eventually, ""they asked me to move to Charlotte, and at that time it was all about money,” Bell said, noting he was the human relations manager at the time.

“I stayed two years and decided to do something different,” Bell said, adding that he was going to have to relocate once again, and he had a daughter in high school. “So I resigned and bought a construction company. I grew up doing construction work.”

In 1989, bad luck struck much of the Carolinas in the form of Hurricane Hugo, which left a trail of destruction far inland, including extensive damage to homes and other buildings in and around Charlotte.

“After Hugo, we had more business than we could take,” Bell said. “People remember when you treat them right.”

Bell had started coming to Asheville in the early 1970s and was a frequent visitor throughout the ‘70s and 80s with his first wife. In 1994, they moved to Asheville, after Bell met former HACA Director David Jones at an insurance conference. Bell had been working for the Charlotte Housing Authority for two years.

At Bell's retirement party, Jones recounted how heavily he recruited Bell.

""Boy, did I check him out,"" Jones said. ""The harder I checked, the better he looked. Not only was he a good manager and a good person, he reached out into the neighborhoods.""

Looking 'to chill a little bit'

Bell joined Asheville's Housing Authority as director of maintenance and building, but he had no intention of taking the top job.

“I came here to kind of chill a little bit,” Bell said. “I wanted to remodel the house and ride my motorcycle.”

When a boating accident claimed the life of Michael Godwin, who was expected to replaced Jones as CEO, Bell's name rose to the top as the next natural next leader. From childhood, Bell has had a strong sense of service built into his life, and he knew he could do that job — and that he should.

Bell and Jones, having done the same job for so long, truly appreciate each other's service. Bell says Jones was a fine mentor and kept his distance after leaving.

“When Dave left, I think he came to the office one time in a year, maybe two times in a year,” Bell said. “I will do the same thing. If you were ever going to follow in someone’s footsteps, he was the one. He was a gentleman and a scholar.”

Despite the demands of the job, Bell has also felt a calling to serve the community in other ways. Over the years, he has served on the Asheville City Schools board, chaired the Housing Coalition, and he now chairs the Buncombe County Planning Board. He's been on the city’s Civil Service Board, as well as holding several posts with public housing entities in the state and region.

He’s chaired the board of the Young Men’s Institute, and been involved with Buncombe County’s Capital Fund Commission, Read to Succeed and the Isaac Coleman Grant Committee. As a school board member, Bell pushed hard for the new Isaac Dickson Elementary School and Asheville Middle School.

Successes and some lingering problems, including crime

Bell is not one to tout his own accomplishments, but he is “really proud” that the housing authority went to HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration system in which all residents get a housing voucher. That’s allowed a lot of residents to live in other places than public housing units, and it gives them the freedom to move.

The program can pay up to 35 percent of their gross adjusted income. The Housing Authority now has about 3,000 vouchers and about 5,000 residents.

More: New Asheville policy could help some of its poorest residents buy homes

Bell also noted all of the HACA units — Pisgah View, Deaverview, Hillcrest, Klondyke and the Livingston Street apartments, as well as Lee Walker Heights — have been renovated or upgraded during his tenure.

Yet he'll quickly list the “great relationship with resident councils” among his top successes

He also considers surveillance cameras installation in developments to be a major help in curtailing crime, although some residents bristled at what they considered a loss of privacy. “It was tough in the beginning,” Bell allowed.

Bell said is proud the authority's ""banned"" list, typically reserved for residents who've committed serious crimes or threatened physical violence, is the smallest it's been during his tenure.

Crime remains a problem in the city's poorest neighborhoods, which include public housing developments. At a presentation to City Council in late June, Asheville Police Department Deputy Chief Jim Baumstark said gun violence — homicides, robberies and aggravated assaults — has risen 55% in three years.

Baumstark said two public housing complexes in West Asheville and one near downtown account for ""more than half of all calls for gunshot wounds, gun discharges and persons with guns."" Five of the top 10 locations from which calls originated were in and around public housing communities, police said.

Bell acknowledges crime remains a problem, but he also touches on one of his mantras, an opinion shared by other African American leaders in the city: “The problem we’ve experienced is the perpetrators of our crime are (usually) not residents of (public) housing.”

Carl Mumpower, a former Asheville City Councilman who often volunteered in public housing and worked closely with Bell, says Bell ""has carried one of the toughest leadership roles in our community with maturity, balance and courage.""

A conservative who has run for Congress and chaired Buncombe County's Republican Party, Mumpower has been critical of public housing at times, particularly the scourge of drug dealing.

""The drug and criminal culture continues to thrive in public housing,"" Mumpower said. ""That said, it was always my sense that Mr. Bell tried to find solutions and was open to any help he could get. Most of the time there wasn’t much, and that’s not a fight you can win alone.""

Looking for speed, and flat running spots

While he'll stay busy with the Lee Walker project, a $36.5 million transformation, Bell will have a much reduced work schedule. That'll leave time for his other loves, including his family, running and fast vehicles.

An avid runner, Bell has logged scores of races over the years, including a few marathons and 10K’s. Time has taken a toll, though.

“I do maybe 1-3 miles now,” Bell said. “I’m always looking for flat places to run.”

Bell and his wife, Patricia, live in a nice brick rancher in between the Livingston Heights public housing apartments and Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, a home Bell overhauled upon moving in. He’s always gotten a chuckle out of people who suggest he’s out of touch with public housing residents.

“I tell them, ‘I live a block away from public housing,’” Bell said.

While he’s not an extravagant man when it comes to clothes or perks, Bell does have one indulgence: fast vehicles. An avid motorcyclist, his pride and joy is a 790-pound 2013 Harley-Davidson Street Glide dripping with chrome.

When it comes to four wheels, it’s a 2013 Mercedes Benz AMG coupe with an enormous V8 motor and a growl like a Rottweiller on high alert. Bell bought it used, but he knows it still looks like an extravagance.

“You can’t make it logical,” he said.

The Bells have known each other for 27 years, but they just married last December.

Patricia Bell said she’s always been impressed by her husband’s ability to find the good in life.

“He never concentrates on the negatives in life,” she said while sitting in their living room. “It’s all about the good things.”

“And the people that are left,” Bell quickly adds.

At his daughter’s memorial service, Patricia Bell was moved by how Gene Bell concentrated on “nothing but the good times” they had together.

She’s less sanguine about his penchant for speed in the Mercedes.

“The first time I got in there and he stomped the gas, I thought, ‘You’re not 17 or 18 years old,’” Patricia said with a laugh.

Bell said they just completed a 2,450-mile trip up north, so he's pretty sure they're compatible.

He's equally sure he's done right by his community and coworkers over his long career.

Why Dave Norquist is the perfect choice for DOD's deputy secretary,https://thehill.com,[],08-04-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/455923-why-dave-norquist-is-the-perfect-choice-for-dods-deputy-secretary,"When the Senate confirmed David Norquist by voice vote, it not only demonstrated his overwhelming popularity on Capitol Hill but also, at long last, emplaced the top level of the Pentagon’s leadership after a half-year hiatus. Norquist, previously confirmed as Pentagon comptroller and chief financial officer, had been acting as deputy secretary ever since James Mattis James Norman MattisWhy Dave Norquist is the perfect choice for DOD's deputy secretary Five questions for Trump's new defense secretary on first major tour Trump taps Texas Rep.

In fact, Norquist was not even formally the acting deputy; he was “performing the duties of deputy secretary,” a weird formulation intended to comply with the terms of the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

Dave Norquist has admirers beyond Capitol Hill. Equally important are his popularity inside the Pentagon, his successful tenure as Pentagon comptroller, and his broad-based experience. Both his colleagues on the E Ring — whether in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs, and the Service department leaderships — and their staffs respected his judgment, even as he had to make difficult funding allocation decisions.

In addition, as chief financial officer and unlike any of his predecessors, myself included, he successfully oversaw the first-ever, department-wide audit, covering over $2.7 trillion in assets and $2.6 trillion in liabilities. His experience as a partner in the Kearney accounting firm, which focuses on government practice, certainly helped him in this regard. As he was the first to acknowledge, the audit was far from complete. It was by no means what is termed a “clean audit.” Nevertheless, it represented the largest audit of its kind anywhere, and for that he rightly deserved the kudos that he received.

Norquist is no mere accountant, however. He was serving as a key staffer on the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee when I hired him as my deputy. He brought with him not only a fine reputation for diligence and collegiality on the Hill, but also experience in the bowels of the Pentagon as both as a presidential management intern (as the internship program was then called) and then as an Army resource analyst. He also spent time working in the United Kingdom, and his international experience proved exceedingly valuable as he took the lead in managing budget matters arising from the occupation of Iraq.

In that latter capacity, he worked closely with not only key allies, but also the leadership of the State Department’s economics bureau — no small feat at a time when the Department of Defense (DOD) and State were at loggerheads on most issues relating to Iraq.

Norquist’s background and demeanor, therefore, will serve him exceedingly well as the Defense Department’s chief operating officer and as Secretary of Defense Mark Esper Mark EsperChina 'won't stand idly by' if US puts missiles in Asia-Pacific region Esper: US won't 'overreact' to North Korean missile launches Pentagon chief: US would prevent 'unacceptable' Turkish invasion of Syria MORE’s stand-in when Esper is away from Washington. His in-depth knowledge of programs and budgets will ensure that DOD makes the most of the recent budget agreement that will provide the department with stable funding through fiscal year 2021. His international experience as deputy under secretary will serve him in good stead as he interacts with counterparts, both defense ministers and their deputies, worldwide. And his ability to work closely and well with other departments will perhaps provide some comity to an executive branch that often has been chaotic.

Far too many vacancies remain in the Pentagon. This is an exceedingly troublesome circumstance for a department that would have to oversee wartime operations at short notice. Nevertheless, with DOD’s top two positions filled, the civilian leadership that is essential for managing the government’s largest department, both in war and in peace, at last is firmly in place.

Dov S. Zakheim is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and vice chairman of the board for the Foreign Policy Research Institute. He was under secretary of Defense (comptroller) and chief financial officer for the Department of Defense from 2001 to 2004 and a deputy under secretary of Defense from 1985 to 1987."
DOJ will not prosecute Comey for leaking memos after IG referral: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-will-not-prosecute-comey-for-leaking-memos-after-ig-referral-source,"The Justice Department has decided against prosecuting former FBI Director James Comey for leaking classified information following a referral from the department’s inspector general, sources familiar with the deliberations told Fox News.

“Everyone at the DOJ involved in the decision said it wasn’t a close call,” one official said. “They all thought this could not be prosecuted.”

COMEY HEARING: EX-FBI DIRECTOR SAYS HE LEAKED MEMO TO SPUR SPECIAL COUNSEL APPOINTMENT

Comey penned memos memorializing his interactions with President Trump in the days leading up to his firing. He then passed those documents to a friend, Columbia University Law Professor Daniel Richman, who gave them to The New York Times. Comey admitted to that arrangement during congressional testimony.

After the fact, the FBI classified two of those memos as “confidential.”

DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz had referred Comey for potential prosecution as part of an internal review.

But one of the key factors leading to the DOJ declining to prosecute apparently was the fact that the two memos were labeled “confidential” after he set in motion the chain of events that led to them ending up with the press.

Richman, now serving as an attorney to Comey, told Fox News he had ""no comment"" on the prosecutorial decision on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Fox News has learned that the release of Horowitz’s report is “imminent,” according to another source familiar with the investigation.

The report related to Comey’s leaks is separate from Horowitz’s review of alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses. That report’s release is delayed, according to sources, due to the potential components of Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham’s investigation into alleged improper government surveillance.

Horowitz publicly confirmed last year that his office was investigating Comey for his handling of classified information as part of memos he shared documenting his discussions with the president.

In June 2018, during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Horowitz said he “received a referral on that from the FBI,” and was “handling that referral.”

IG CONFIRMS COMEY UNDER INVESTIGATION OVER MEMO HANDLING

“We will issue a report when the matter is complete and consistent with the law and rules,” Horowitz said at the time.

Comey last year also confirmed to Fox News that the inspector general’s office had interviewed him with regard to memos, but downplayed the questions over classified information as “frivolous”—saying the real issue was whether he complied with internal policies.

Fox News learned last year that Horowitz was looking at whether classified information was given to unauthorized sources as part of a broader review of Comey’s communications outside the bureau—including media contact.

Comey, whom Trump fired in May 2017, denied that sharing the memos with his legal team constituted a leak of classified information. Instead, he compared the process to keeping “a diary.”

“I didn’t consider it part of an FBI file,” Comey told Fox News' Bret Baier last year. “It was my personal aide-memoire…I always thought of it as mine.”

In his testimony in June 2017 before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said he made the decision to document the interactions with the president in a way that would not trigger security classification.

COMEY SAYS DOJ WATCHDOG INTERVIEWED HIM OVER HANDLING OF MEMOS

But in seven Comey memos handed over to Congress in April 2018, eight of the 15 pages had redactions under classified exceptions.

Comey, during his June 2017 testimony, said he deliberately leaked a memo from a key meeting with Trump to a friend after he was fired in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel.

“I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter—I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel,” Comey testified.

“I was worried that the media was camping at the end of my driveway, my wife and I were going away,” Comey said. “I was worried it would be like feeding seagulls at the beach if it was I who gave it to the media, so I asked my friend to.”

The New York Times published the report with Comey’s memos on May 16, 2017, revealing the contents of the memo which said the president asked him to shut down the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn in an Oval Office meeting.

EPA helps with mercury cleanup in U.P. after kids find bottle in old garage,https://www.mlive.com,"['Benjamin Raven', 'Braven Mlive.Com']",08-05-2019,2019,8,https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/08/epa-helps-with-mercury-cleanup-in-up-after-kids-find-bottle-in-old-garage.html,"A mercury spill in the Upper Peninsula has been reportedly contained to the site thanks to the work of federal, local and state officials.

The spill was reported back on July 28 at an abandoned garage and vacant lot in Miss City, according to local reports. Officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ontonagon County Emergency Management and Western Upper Peninsula Health Department responded to the spill.

A regional spokesperson with the EPA did not immediately return MLive’s request for an update Monday morning, Aug. 5.

WLUV-TV reports the incident was reported to local law enforcement after children found a bottle containing mercury in the abandoned garage. The outlet says the children’s home is also being monitored for mercury levels.

The Daily Mining Gazette reports the children took the mercury out and played with it for what was described as “a while.” Mike Kocher, emergency services director in Ontonagon County, told the newspaper that “they just played with it” and didn’t ingest any.

The scene itself in Mass City was reportedly cleared before the weekend, but mercury levels in the air continue to be monitored.

“This is a perfect example of how different agencies support each other during an incident,” Kocher told ABC 10 News in the U.P.

“Everything starts and ends locally but when the call goes out, we coordinate, communicate and cooperate with a variety of response organizations to bring things to a successful conclusion, with the ultimate goal always being the safety of our residents.”

In the event of a mercury spill larger than that of a thermometer break, the EPA advises everyone to leave the area, open all windows/doors to the outside, turn the temperature down, and to shut all doors to other parts of the house/structure.

The federal agency then advises -- in bold red text -- to not vacuum the spill and to call the local health department or fire department for the next steps.

“Any time one pound or more of mercury is released to the environment, it is mandatory to call the National Response Center,” the EPA writes on its website.

“The NRC hotline operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Call 800-424-8802. Note that because mercury is heavy, only two tablespoons of mercury weigh about one pound.”"

The children's lawyer was incensed. Her two tiny clients — one of them blind — had been in a shelter for three months, separated from their mother.

The family had traveled from Mexico to the United States, reaching Nogales, Arizona, on March 1, 2018. Officials at the border found that the mother, Nadia Pulido, had ""credible"" reasons for seeking asylum from an ex-partner who, she says, beat her and stalked her after their relationship ended.

But U.S. Customs and Border Protection still sent Pulido into an adult detention center run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She had an hour to say goodbye and try to assure her blind daughter, 6, and sobbing 3-year-old son that she'd see them in a couple of hours.

""A couple of hours turned into months. Painful months,"" Pulido recalled in an interview.

To help the children, pro bono attorney Maite Garcia turned to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. She filed a complaint with the office on June 7 of last year, explaining that Pulido's daughter was ""completely blind and requires assistance for daily living"" and would be better off with her stepfather, a U.S. citizen.

Nearly two weeks went by before the civil rights office replied.

""The issues you raise are very important to us,"" CRCL finally said in its emailed response. Then came a disclaimer: ""Please be advised that our complaint process does not provide individuals with legal rights or remedies. ... Instead, we use complaints like yours to find and address problems in DHS policy and its implementation.""

That was the last Garcia heard from the nearly 100-person office in Washington, D.C.

The tepid response from the department's civil rights office bolsters objections — not least from former staff — that the DHS watchdog is failing to stop rights abuses as they're happening inside a detention system that's expanding rapidly under the Trump administration.

The ineffectual handling of individual complaints adds to criticism that DHS leaders no longer heed recommendations from the agency's own civil rights experts.

""Put yourself in the shoes of the person who's sitting in the cell or who's separated from their parent or who's wondering where their child is,"" former CRCL staff attorney and adviser Ellen Gallagher said.

A recent whistleblower, Gallagher has accused the civil rights office of failing to investigate multiple individual complaints alleging unjustified solitary confinement of detainees in ICE custody. Gallagher is now with DHS' Office of Inspector General, a separate internal watchdog specializing in issuing reports after lengthy investigations.

""It seems to mislead the public, to invite complaints involving specific information about the individual or the family and the alleged violation, if Civil Rights and Civil Liberties had no intention of specifically investigating or resolving those individual complaints,"" Gallagher said.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has insisted that DHS has ""layers of oversight"" to correct abuses. ""We have good supervisory oversight, and we hold people accountable,"" he said during a July 9 interview on CNN in response to questions about filthy conditions in CBP holding facilities.

Gallagher's impression, however, is that the civil rights office ""was actually fairly intimidated by ICE and CBP and did not want to engage in activity that might offend either. That is an odd and even disturbing posture for an oversight authority.""

Internal CRCL log: a flood of complaints

Some CRCL staff members say that individual employees contact CBP or ICE to try to informally resolve civil rights complaints. But they can only advise agencies, they say, because their office isn't set up to halt abuses as they happen.

Cameron Quinn, chief of the civil rights office and an appointee of President Trump, declined a request for an interview. Another CRCL official responded in writing to questions, asking not to be quoted by name.

""CRCL does not have authority to remedy individual complaints but instead focuses on systemic issues"" at DHS, the official wrote. The office does have authority, however, to seek ""remedies"" for people facing disability discrimination, the official said, declining to elaborate.

""With regard to family separations,"" the official said, ""CRCL investigated the issue from a policy and process standpoint."" The civil rights office then sent its recommendations to ICE and Customs and Border Protection in a memo. CRCL declined to release the memo, calling it a ""deliberative"" document.

CRCL, the official added, still has ""open investigations"" into the separations of children under age 5, the separations of children with disabilities and standards for separating families based on parental criminal history.

The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties was created along with the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The office's mission is to advise the powerful federal department and prevent civil rights violations such as the post-Sept. 11 roundups of Muslims without due process. But some insiders say CRCL has always lacked teeth.

Last year, the civil rights office proved especially weak as complaints about due process concerns and family separations began pouring in — nearly 850 in the first half of 2018 alone, logged into a CRCL database. An independent journalist obtained a copy through a Freedom of Information Act request and then shared it with the Center for Public Integrity and NPR.

The complaints referenced more than 380 separated children 10 years old or younger, of which more than 120 children were age 5 or younger.

More than 140 complaints arrived before the Trump administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy on April 6, 2018. More than 160 cases of separation referenced in the log were carried out before that date. The zero-tolerance policy required separating families so that CBP could hold all adults for prosecution, even for a first-time misdemeanor illegal entry.

Former and current staff in the civil rights office say their colleagues were so upset by allegations in the complaints that they openly wept at desks as they reviewed the cases.

By May of last year, senior staff in the office had urged Quinn, in an internal memo, to challenge the separations. ""CRCL should express great concern over our exclusion from these critical decisions,"" which CRCL has the authority to review, the memo said. ""Deliberately harming children to deter parental behavior would require an exceedingly strong justification to pass muster as a reasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, among other concerns.""

Lawyer and former CRCL senior adviser Scott Shuchart, who resigned from the office last year, said his and other advisers' concerns were ""blown off"" by CBP and other DHS leadership in meetings.

One complaint to CRCL in January 2018 reported that CBP separated a 4-month-old infant from a Mexican father who had prior immigration violations but feared being sent back to Mexico.

Another reported that an 8-year-old said CBP officers ""kicked him and/or hit him with a shoe"" to wake him. Dozens of other complaints described children upset about their parents' uncertain whereabouts and abrupt disappearance — including a 14-year-old in CBP custody who said he was separated after a meal break and was then ""told by officers that his father would be deported.""

About 95% of all complaints logged came from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, a unit within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that's responsible for migrant-children shelters.

Former senior staff in this federal resettlement office say the volume of complaints is unprecedented. Robert Carey, ORR director during the final two years of Barack Obama's presidency, said he thinks ORR employees were trying to stop separations by filing complaints.

""You probably have a deeply traumatized, possibly hysterical child that you're trying to care for,"" Carey said. ""I'm guessing some of those cases would require ... the intervention of a therapist, particularly if you're talking about, in some instances, young children.""

HHS officials declined to make leaders in its Office of Refugee Resettlement available for an interview.

Most other complaints came from nonprofit legal aid groups — including 18 filed by the Phoenix-based Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, where Maite Garcia works.

The complaint about Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son appears on page 276 of CRCL's 366-page document.

Another Florence complaint filed on June 14 of last year appears on page 321. It raises objections to CBP's separation of a Guatemalan mother from her 17-year-old son — who is unable to hear or speak — without regard for his disability. The boy could have qualified to be ""paroled"" into the U.S., a conditional form of humanitarian release. But that never happened — and the case shows how a formal complaint can wither in the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Deaf boy's mom taken away

The story of the mother and her deaf son ""exhibits the cruelty, the chaos"" of how migrants are treated, said Elizabeth Jordan, an attorney with Denver's Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center. She represented the mother while the woman was in ICE lockup in Colorado.

On April 25 of last year, the mother and her 17-year-old deaf son approached CBP officers after crossing the Arizona border and asked to apply for asylum.

The boy and his mother now live in Florida, where they are in the process of applying for asylum. In an interview, the mother, who asked that her name not be disclosed, said she'd worked previously in the state, sending money to Guatemala to rent a room for her son and pay his tuition at a school for the deaf there. She eventually returned to Guatemala to care for her son and her own frail mother.

Three months after she got there, her mother died, and her deaf son lost his primary caregiver. He'd long been bullied in Guatemala, and thieves had robbed him at gunpoint. Mother and son both set out for the United States some months later.

""I don't do this for me. I do it for him,"" she said, ""because I'm not going to be alive for all of his life.""

After Customs and Border Protection took her and her son into custody near San Luis, Ariz., the mother said, officers ignored her pleas to keep them together rather than place them in cages segregated by age and gender. Her son, she told the officers, needed her to interpret. When she protested further that her son was mute, she said an officer answered, ""He won't need to do much talking where he's going.""

At some point, while her son was asleep, guards took her out of her cage, the mother said, and transported her to an ICE detention center pending prosecution. She said she was told ""you have to pay for what you did"" because she'd been turned away at the border the year before. She was sentenced to 30 days in an Arizona jail for reentry and then transferred to an ICE detention center in Colorado, pending deportation.

Meanwhile, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had sent her son on a long bus ride to an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter in Arizona, where his only means of communication was drawing pictures.

For more than a month, the mother pleaded in vain with detention guards, first in Arizona and then in Colorado, to arrange a video call so she could at least see and sign with her son. Medical records from the boy's time in the shelter indicate he was distraught: He struck his head against walls and cut himself with a paper clip. In an interview in Florida, interpreted by his mother, he said that to prevent him from getting out of bed one night, he was physically restrained.

""She was profoundly distressed and so worried about him,"" lawyer Jordan said of the mother. ""This is a person who has devoted her life to keeping him safe and getting the best she can for him. And then, for her to be totally unable to check in on him for weeks ...""

A round of emails between the boy's attorneys and DHS' civil rights office ultimately went nowhere.

Initially, a CRCL adviser seemed to be working on the Florence project's June 2018 complaint, arguing that the deaf boy merited humanitarian parole and that for two months the shelter hadn't ""provided him with the appropriate accommodations"" for his disability. The adviser wrote that the civil rights office was ""reviewing your concerns""; he asked for proof the boy was deaf.

In July 2018, one of the boy's lawyers emailed CRCL to write that when CBP held the boy in custody, he ""was able to understand that the agents were mocking him"" because they didn't believe he was deaf.

The lawyer further argued that CBP, ICE and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency in charge of shelters, were all in violation of disability rights because they had failed to arrange a video call between the boy and his mother.

The official from the civil rights office then replied that he was ""unable to look into [the boy's] ongoing concerns"" because the teenager had been transferred by CPB, which is within DHS' jurisdiction, to ORR, which is not.

Instead, he suggested, the civil rights office could investigate the mother's concerns because she was in ICE custody, which, like CBP and CRCL, falls under DHS. The boy's attorneys gave the civil rights official contact information for Jordan, the mother's Colorado lawyer.

By that time, Jordan had already been emailing local ICE officials repeated pleas to set up a video call. The call finally happened — nearly three months after U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers had separated the mother and her son. But it wasn't because of action by DHS' civil rights office, Jordan said. It was because DHS was by then under court order to put separated migrant family members in touch with one another by phone and then reunite them.

""In my interactions with individual CRCL officers,"" Jordan said, ""I don't get the sense that they're out to lunch or bad people. I think that they just ultimately can't get much done. I think it comes from being really hamstrung by the fact that they have to work with ICE and get ICE to concur in their recommendations and actually make changes.""

In the children's interest

Although Trump ended his zero-tolerance policy in June 2018 after a public outcry, U.S. border agents have continued to separate families due to parents' criminal records, even for minor offenses, or because of prior deportations.

Immigrant rights groups have long pressed DHS to consider the children's interests, and they've noted that family separation ""causes great harm, disrupting emotional and psychological well-being.""

For failed asylum-seeker Nadia Pulido, the groups' pressure came too late.

Pulido was born in Mexico but is a fluent English-speaker who arrived in California as an undocumented child and was raised by relatives. She could have qualified for a special visa for abandoned children, but no one sought such a visa on her behalf. When she was ""literally just young, stupid and hanging around the wrong crowd,"" she said, she was convicted of robbery and deported.

Because of that history, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and ICE chose to send her children to a shelter and keep her in detention last year while her asylum case went forward.

ICE could have released her on humanitarian parole. Instead, she was held in detention for eight months, until she lost her asylum bid. She could have appealed, but that would have meant more detention — and more time apart from her young children. In the end, Pulido agreed to be deported to Mexico.

After four months in a shelter, Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son were finally released to her husband, a U.S. citizen. Attorneys for the children and Pulido believe a federal lawsuit that led to a court order unifying migrant families was likely a factor. And they doubt their complaint to DHS' civil rights office did anything to hasten the children's release.

In Mexico, where the kids have now joined her, Pulido said she's still scared. To support her need for refuge, she presented Mexican police reports about incidents involving her ex-partner; and in her asylum application, she wrote that he assaulted her while she was pregnant and held a gun to her head.

""We were leaving Mexico to seek help in the United States,"" she said, ""to stay free of danger.""

Interior secretary will be allowed to meet with former fossil fuel clients starting this weekend,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/interior-secretarys-ethics-pledge-is-set-to-expire-this-weekend-729e7e959374/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s ethics recusal will expire on Saturday. The ethics pledge banned Bernhardt from decisions involving his former firm’s clients for two years.

Bernhardt was also not able to meet with these companies, unless five or more other stakeholders were present and nothing relating specifically to the companies was discussed.

But all of this is set to change on August 3.

Prior to joining the Interior Department in 2017, Bernhardt worked as a lobbyist for the oil and gas industry via the Colorado law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

Among the firm’s 22 clients that Bernhardt was prohibited from engaging with for two years under his ethics recusal were energy companies Halliburton, Eni, and Statoil (now known as Equinor). Other clients included industry groups such as the U.S. Oil and Gas Association and the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).

The end of Bernhardt’s recusal was marked on Friday by a ribbon-cutting ceremony hosted by the Clean Water Fund at a park across from the D.C. Interior headquarters.

During his time in the Trump administration, Bernhardt’s ethical issues have taken center stage. He has so many potential conflicts of interest to avoid that he carries around a card listing all of them so he doesn’t forget. A recent analysis by the Center for American Progress found that Bernhardt has more conflicts of interest than any other Trump Cabinet nominee. (ThinkProgress is an editorially independent news site housed at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.)

In April, Politico revealed that Bernhardt reportedly worked closely on matters he had pledged to recuse himself from. Just weeks after Bernhardt joined the administration, he was working on policies related key water infrastructure policy which he had worked on as a lobbyist. The ethics agreement had barred him from involving himself in “particular matters” with Westlands Water District for just one year, until August 2018.

The California water district is known for having tried to weaken the Endangered Species Act.

And in September 2018, an appearance by Bernhardt at a water industry forum in Colorado was canceled after department ethics officials concluded it could raise conflicts-of-interest concerns.

Public records released by the Western Values Project in February 2018 also that found Bernhardt’s former client, the IPAA, frequently communicated with Interior officials conducting a review of the department’s sage grouse policy. In March 2017, for instance, the IPAA thanked Bernhardt for his action as deputy secretary that benefited the oil and gas industry.

It’s not just Bernhardt though who has faced questions over conflicts of interest.

Just two weeks after Bernhardt was officially confirmed as head of the agency — following the departure of scandal-ridden former Secretary Ryan Zinke — the department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) confirmed an investigation into six other senior DOI officials who may have also potentially violated their ethics pledges due to interactions with former employers and clients.

At the same time, this week, a slew of controversial new appointments were welcomed at Interior.

William Perry Pendley, a former senior official from the Reagan administration, was appointed acting director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Pendley, former president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, has long fought to undo the federal government’s control over public lands.

In a 2016 National Review article, Pendley wrote: “The Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold… Westerners know that only getting title to much of the land in the West will bring real change.”

Pendley has in the past sued the Interior Department on behalf of the fossil fuel industry and has tried to undermine endangered species protections along with working to reduce the size of federal lands in favor of development.

Also this week, a climate denier tied to the coal industry was appointed as a senior adviser in the department. Christian Palich previously worked as the president of the pro-Trump Ohio Coal Association until 2017. Palich comes to the Interior this week from lobbying firm Siekman, Siekman & Associates, whose clients include Halliburton and pipeline firm Sunoco Logistics. He was also previously deputy associate administrator for congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Environmental Protection Agency.

Palich has made numerous Fox News appearances praising President Donald Trump’s environmental rollbacks and he has frequently doubted established climate science on Twitter, calling it “junk science.”

After Trump’s election, for example, he tweeted: “Time to push fight [sic] back on all the radical enviro regs that have been illegally been [sic] brought on America over last 8 yrs.”

And finally, after 10 years, the department now has a Senate-confirmed inspector general. Mark Greenblatt — an attorney who previously worked at the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General — will be responsible for investigating allegations of ethics violations by Bernhardt and others at the department.

When pressed by lawmakers earlier this year on his appointment, Greenblatt asserted he had “zero intent” of shutting down any ongoing investigations into the department’s operations."
F.B.I. Agents Raid South Bend Housing Authority Offices,https://www.nytimes.com,['Neil Vigdor'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/fbi-south-bend-housing-authority-buttigieg.html,"F.B.I. agents raided the offices of the Housing Authority of South Bend, Ind., on Wednesday, the second potential distraction back home for the presidential campaign of the city’s mayor, Pete Buttigieg.

No one was arrested during the raid, in which evidence collection teams visited the housing authority’s headquarters on Alonzo Watson Drive about 1 p.m. with a police officer and United States government trucks.

The agency, which runs nine low-income housing facilities in South Bend and is financed by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been beleaguered by complaints of financial mismanagement for much of the decade.

Such concerns prompted Mr. Buttigieg to replace all six commissioners on the housing authority’s board in 2015."

"At the US Education Department, applications for loan forgiveness languish",https://www.cnbc.com,['Annie Nova'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/02/under-betsy-devos-defrauded-students-find-it-hard-to-get-rid-of-debt.html,"When Morgan Marler's 5-year-old daughter, Lilian, asks her why she doesn't work anymore, Marler doesn't know what to say.

""I can't explain debt to her,"" Marler, 29, said. ""And how I went to school and it was all for nothing.""

Marler attended ITT Technical Institute, a now-shuttered for-profit school, between 2013 and 2016. The school has since been found to have misled students with false advertisements. Marler, for her part, was told students typically went on to make $70,000 a year. After she graduated, the best jobs she could find were at call centers that paid $10 an hour — less than she'd been making before she enrolled at the school.

Her associates degree at ITT left her with $30,000 in student loans, and she's asked the Department of Education to cancel her debt, but has yet to hear back. That was nearly three years ago.

A federal judge ruled last year that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' delays of an Obama-era regulation aimed at forgiving the student debt of defrauded students were illegal. Still, advocates say, the department continues to neglect the applications of those like Marler."
