Speaker Nancy Pelosi told senior Democrats that she’d like to see President Donald Trump “in prison” as she clashed with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler in a meeting on Tuesday night over whether to launch impeachment proceedings.

Pelosi met with Nadler (D-N.Y.) and several other top Democrats who are aggressively pursuing investigations against the president, according to multiple sources. Nadler and other committee leaders have been embroiled in a behind-the-scenes turf battle for weeks over ownership of the Democrats’ sprawling investigation into Trump.

Nadler pressed Pelosi to allow his committee to launch an impeachment inquiry against Trump — the second such request he’s made in recent weeks only to be rebuffed by the California Democrat and other senior leaders. Pelosi stood firm, reiterating that she isn’t open to the idea of impeaching Trump at this time.

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” Pelosi said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting. Instead of impeachment, Pelosi still prefers to see Trump defeated at the ballot box and then prosecuted for his alleged crimes, according to the sources.

They said she was expressing solidarity with pro-impeachment Democrats who want to hold the president accountable while disputing the idea that it is now time to take that step. Pelosi has long argued that certain conditions must be met before Democrats begin impeachment — public support and strong bipartisan backing, neither of which have so far materialized.

Other Democrats said Pelosi’s comment wasn’t that surprising given her previous criticisms of the president, including saying Trump “is engaged in a cover-up,” that his staff and family should stage an intervention and that the president’s actions “are villainous to the Constitution of the United States.”

Ashley Etienne, a Pelosi spokeswoman said Pelosi and the chairmen “had a productive meeting about the state of play with the Mueller report. They agreed to keep all options on the table and continue to move forward with an aggressive hearing and legislative strategy, as early as next week, to address the president’s corruption and abuses of power uncovered in the report.”

House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) were also present for the meeting. Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) — a vocal impeachment supporter whose panel is probing Trump’s finances — was not in attendance.

In Tuesday’s meeting, some committee chairs expressed frustration about the appearance that rank-and-file members — rather than party leaders — were leading the caucus’ oversight strategy, including what they do on impeachment, according to one source familiar with the meeting.

But not all committee leaders were supportive of the impeachment inquiry. Both Schiff and Neal argued that if Democrats are going to open an inquiry, they should also be prepared to impeach Trump, which the caucus isn’t ready to do, they said. Cummings also sided with Pelosi, according to a source.

Neal also grumbled about Democrats who have come out in favor of impeachment, saying it puts pressure on members in bordering congressional districts to explain why they don’t feel the same way. House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) — whose district touches Neal’s — came out for impeachment last week.

The meeting is just the latest example of the impeachment debate that is roiling the Democratic Caucus. Pelosi is facing continued pressure both publicly from some rank-and-file members and privately from committee leaders like Nadler, who are unhappy with the current strategy.

The gulf between Nadler and Pelosi was on full display Wednesday as the New York Democrat dodged questions about whether he and Pelosi were in agreement on Democrats’ impeachment strategy.

“We are investigating all of the things we would investigate, frankly, in an impeachment inquiry,” Nadler said on CNN. He then paused for several seconds when asked if he and Pelosi were “on the same page.”

“When that decision has to be made, it will be made not by any one individual, it will be made probably by the caucus as a whole,” Nadler added. “Certainly Nancy will have the largest single voice in it.”

Pelosi, meanwhile, is trying to publicly project unity — going so far as to defiantly declare Wednesday that “there is no controversy” within the caucus over impeachment.

“Make no mistake, we know exactly what path we’re on. We know exactly what actions we need to take,” Pelosi told reporters earlier Wednesday, hitting her palm on the podium for emphasis.

In reality, the speaker and her top lieutenants have been trying to tamp down a rebellion within the caucus, as close to 60 members have publicly declared they want to begin impeaching Trump.

Trump, meanwhile, has continued to stonewall Democrats’ every attempt to investigate his administration, personal finances and charges of obstruction of justice outlined by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Party leaders have tried to relieve some of the pressure by taking more aggressive public action against the White House’s repeated defiance, including scheduling a contempt vote on the House floor next week against Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn.

And Democratic leaders continue to emphasize that their methodical, step-by-step oversight process is working, pointing to recent federal court victories Democrats have secured against Trump’s efforts to block them. Nadler is also still trying to secure Mueller’s testimony before his committee.

But for a growing number of Democrats, including several members of the Judiciary Committee, opening impeachment proceedings is the only recourse.

Reps. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), all members of Democratic leadership and the Judiciary panel, first raised the idea of launching an impeachment inquiry during a private leadership meeting late last month only to be shot down by Pelosi.

Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) and other top Democrats met with Nadler separately that night as he again unsuccessfully argued for opening an impeachment inquiry.

Nadler, Raskin and other lawmakers say opening an inquiry doesn’t necessarily result in impeachment and would strengthen their legal case as Democrats pursue Trump in court in an effort to force him to comply with their investigations. But other Democrats argue that the public wouldn't understand the difference between an inquiry and actual impeachment, which would only further muddle the party's message in the run-up to the election.

Pelosi has repeatedly said she doesn’t think trying to impeach Trump is “worth it,” arguing that without the public on their side, the best way to beat the president is to persuade voters to kick him out of office in 2020. She and some other top Democrats worry that pursuing impeachment would swamp their legislative agenda and embolden the Republican base, possibly costing them the House next year and ensuring Trump’s reelection.

“I’m not feeling any pressure,” Pelosi told reporters Wednesday.

Which States Will Be Hit Hardest by Trump’s Tariffs on Mexico,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Karl Russell', 'Ana Swanson']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/business/economy/mexico-tariffs-state-by-state.html,"June 5, 2019

President Trump’s plan to force Mexico to take a tougher approach to enforcement of its border, by ramping up tariffs on its products, will ripple through the United States, with consumers around the country paying more for cars, TVs, bluejeans, beer, fresh vegetables and other products.

For state economies, the impact of these rising prices depends on how reliant their major industries — from automakers to food producers to energy companies — are on suppliers in Mexico.

A 5 percent tariff on all goods coming from Mexico is set to go into effect on Monday, unless officials from the two countries can work out a deal that will satisfy Mr. Trump. On Wednesday, Mexico’s foreign minister met with Vice President Mike Pence and other American officials to discuss solutions to stem the flood of migrants, mostly from Central American countries, that have come over the southwestern border.

Later in the day, Mr. Trump said no deal was reached. He plans to gradually ramp up his tariffs on Mexican goods to 25 percent by October."
Trump Administration Sharply Curtails Fetal Tissue Medical Research,https://www.nytimes.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/fetal-tissue-research.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced Wednesday that the federal government would sharply curtail federal spending on medical research that uses tissue from aborted fetuses, mainly by ending fetal-tissue research within the National Institutes of Health.

The move goes a long way toward fulfilling a top goal of anti-abortion groups that have lobbied hard for it; it is just the latest in a string of decisions that have pleased such groups. But scientists say the tissue is crucial for studies that benefit millions of patients.

Besides ending N.I.H. research, the Department of Health and Human Services said it would immediately cancel a $2 million-a-year contract with the University of California, San Francisco, for research involving fetal tissue from abortions; the contract started in 2013. Other university research projects would be subject to case-by-case review.

“Promoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trump’s administration,” the department said in a statement. It added that about 200 research projects involving fetal tissue and conducted at universities with N.I.H. grants would be allowed to continue until their funding expires, but that ethics advisory boards appointed by Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, would review and recommend whether to fund future individual projects involving aborted fetal tissue."

Donald Trump is not winging it.

Or at least he’s not totally winging it.

Story Continued Below

However improvisational his daily machinations on trade — presenting publicly as motivated by a random mix of mood and twitches of the news cycle, including the latest threat of tariffs against Mexico — Trump and his team are acting on a well-developed theory of the case, one that has been decades in the making.

In Trump’s case, that strategy is intuitive. He’s been saying since the 1980s — and by all evidence genuinely believes — that the United States is letting itself be played for the fool by foreign adversaries, on trade specifically and global competition generally. Strong nations robustly protect domestic industries and keep foreign competitors at heel. Back in the ’80s his focus was more typically Japan; in recent years, but long before 2016, he’s been focused on China.

In the case of his advisers, the theory of the case is more intellectual. They believe that the big bet free trade advocates made in the 1990s — that welcoming China into the WTO would encourage it to integrate into a rules-based global economy — has proved to be a loser. China, by these lights, is happy to take advantage of the U.S. and other players’ commitment to free trade and rules but will continue to steal and subsidize to advance its own interests.

This method to the apparent madness has emerged in interviews for the new Global Translations podcast — which launched Thursday — with people who have worked for Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. And it helps explain why the Trump administration has made such a break from the strategy of previous administrations.

“I and many others had deceived ourselves that China wanted to be just like us,” said Michael Pillsbury, an influential adviser to the Trump administration on China and author of the book, “The Hundred Year Marathon: China’s Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.”

“I finally woke up,” he said. “But I would not say everybody's awakened even at this point.”

The Trump doctrine marks a repudiation of decades of U.S. trade orthodoxy — that reached its high point in the 1990s, after the Soviet Union collapsed, and capitalism and liberalism appeared on the march. This “End of History” euphoria culminated in Clinton pushing past his party’s populist instincts on trade and embracing the elite view that the world was becoming more integrated, more rules-based, and more prosperous, and that this meant good things both for American and the rest of humanity.

In 1993, he signed into law NAFTA, which had been negotiated by the Bush administration, and enabled China’s accession into the WTO, stating in a 2000 speech: “By joining the WTO, China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products. It is agreeing to import one of democracy's most cherished values, economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people -- their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise. And when individuals have the power, not just to dream, but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.”

That democratic dream now appears dead — and with it American patience to wait for China to reform itself.

The China hawks in the White House believe now is the best — and perhaps last — moment for the U.S. to take dramatic economic action against China, even at the cost of roiling markets and upending a strong U.S. economy.

And they have tethered the rest of U.S. trade policy — demands of Canada, Mexico, Europe and Japan — to an aggressive agenda of increasingly squeezing China out of global supply chains while pressing for structural change in Beijing. When U.S. business leaders have warned, cajoled, and pleaded about the economic risks of a trade war, they have been rebuffed with the argument that it is precisely the strong economy that has wedged open a historic window of opportunity to make the move.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has described China as an “existential problem,” wants to use U.S. economic leverage to demand serious structural changes in China — while the U.S. still has that leverage.

The urgency behind the strategy concerns technology: China’s attempts to supercharge the growth of nascent tech industries by subsidizing them and forcing the handover of U.S. intellectual property. The goal is to leapfrog from its past status as a developing nation exporting cheap plastic wares to a leader in strategic emerging technologies that will define the next technological age — such as 5G and the next-generation internet, artificial intelligence and renewable energy.

China has copied U.S. technology, sometimes by requiring joint ventures and the sharing of intellectual property and other times by outright theft. The end of these forced technological transfers is Lighthizer’s central aim — even if they mean that soybean farmers will pay the price. If America fails to do so and becomes “number two in technology,” he told a congressional hearing in February, “then the world is going to look very different for our children.”

Pillsbury, the Trump adviser, said the administration fears not only losing a commercial rivalry — but enabling an Orwellian future in which an authoritarian Beijing controls global surveillance, directs online speech and embeds government control into the very plumbing of the internet.

“Their idea is the whole world will have this combination of [surveillance] cameras, your shopping patterns, what magazines you subscribe to, who your friends are, where you go based on your cell phone being geolocated,” with the aim of creating a social credit score, he said. “To what degree do you support the Communist Party of China? Have you ever criticized anything? And then when you apply to get a loan or to go to college or to do anything, your social credit score will tell how the government’s going to treat you.”

“Everybody in the world will be under this kind of system,” Pillsbury said of the authoritarian vision of the future.

Increasingly, the U.S. military is concerned, too. The 2018 national security strategy, signed by former Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis, asserts that China seeks “regional hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the United States to achieve global preeminence in the future.”

This big picture explains in part why the Trump administration has been willing to wrest open trade relations with allies in order to remake the terms of global trade — it’s not just about a better bilateral deal for the U.S., but about a particular approach to China. Take the steel tariffs against Canada and Mexico that were aimed at “closing the back door” to subsidized steel from China, among other places; and the insertion of language in the new North American agreement that would expel a country from the agreement if it entered into a free trade agreement with a “non-market economy,” or new requirements aimed at reducing the share of Chinese parts in North America car production. Likewise, the administration will have China in mind as it opens talks with Japan and Europe.

In Trumpland, the long-term goals apparently outweigh the short-term chaos and pain.

Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright, recalled a meeting with senior Trump administration officials and groups representing industries affected by tariffs, who argued that the economic effects of Trump’s economic policies would be undone by a trade war. “It was really one of the most brilliant presentations I’ve ever seen — PowerPoint graphics, the whole thing — that said, ‘If you do this, administration, if you do what you're talking about doing on trade,” he recalled, “you’re going to take back all the economic gains you’ve made from tax reform.”

“And everybody thought it was a mic drop moment, right? Aha! And everybody in the administration kind of looked at each other and said, ‘We know. You think we don't know that?’”

Over two decades, 9/11, the wars in the Middle East and the financial crisis and recovery, made action too difficult, according to Ujczo — and the possibility of a next recession could close the window. “If we don’t do this now, when will we ever do this? It’s really, I think, in the eyes of this administration, a now-or-never moment — and they may be right.”

While Democrats don’t agree with all of Trump’s tactics, long-standing concerns about China have been bipartisan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was an early opponent of China’s entry into the WTO. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has long decried Chinese currency manipulation. Schumer recently tweeted, “Hang tough on China, President @realDonaldTrump. Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.”

The Obama administration shared concerns about Chinese subsidies and technological theft but attempted to address them by negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a new agreement with 11 other nations. The idea was to encircle China by creating a free-trade zone with its neighbors and set high standards that China would eventually have to accept in order to join. In trying to sell the deal to a skeptical public in 2015, Obama said China had been “putting out feelers” about eventually joining the pact.

But the agreement lacked public and Congressional support amid a backlash against globalization. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement after he was elected and has opted instead for an increasingly bilateral approach to confronting China — using threats, tariffs and negotiations with other nations as a way to influence China. In many ways, it was the administration’s firmest rebuke of the international coalition-building approach of Republican and Democratic administrations that preceded it.

While critics of the TPP said it wasn’t enough to force structural changes in China, supporters say Trump gave up a powerful tool.

“I think [it] is perhaps the most significant strategic blunder in recent American history,” said Michael Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative under Obama. “We’ve lost that position for the United States at least for now, and we have created a void, a vacuum that China is quite effectively filling at the moment.”

Trump’s agenda doesn’t necessarily mean an end to trade. But it does mean surrendering faith in gauzy principles and far-reaching trade protocols. Instead, go toe-to-toe with trade competitors at times and in sectors of one’s own choosing — and know that adversaries won’t respect you unless you prove on occasion that you are willing to inflict pain on others (and accept it yourself) to win a conflict.

And it leaves open the possibility that the confrontation with China could embolden hawks on both sides.

“Over the next year or two we're going to find out — can we have a trade deal? Can we have some kind of reconciliation with China?” said Pillsbury. “Or… are we moving toward a new Cold War relationship?”"

Exclusive: Homeland Security watchdog finds 'egregious' conditions at ICE facilities in 2018,https://www.cnn.com,['Priscilla Alvarez'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/ice-detention-center-ig-report/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Homeland Security inspector general found expired food and dilapidated bathrooms during unannounced visits to four immigrant detention facilities in 2018, according to a report released Thursday .

The kitchen at one facility was in such poor shape -- with open packages of raw chicken leaking blood over refrigeration units -- that the kitchen manager was replaced while the IG inspection was ongoing.

The report describes conditions at facilities last year, but it comes amid a worsening situation along the US-Mexico border, where the number of migrants crossing the border illegally has surpassed previous years. The dramatic increase in arrivals -- the majority of whom are families and children -- has overwhelmed the Department of Homeland Security, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency reviewed in the latest report.

CNN was first to report on the IG's findings.

More than 144,000 migrants were encountered or arrested at the US-Mexico border in May, a roughly 32% increase over April and the highest monthly total in 13 years, Customs and Border Protection said Wednesday, including over 11,000 unaccompanied children.

As of Monday, there were around 52,000 single adults in ICE custody -- an all-time high that exceeds funding levels yet again, according to ICE.

The administration has also asked Congress for $4.5 billion in emergency funding for humanitarian assistance, border operations and mission support at the border.

New acting ICE Director Mark Morgan told reporters earlier this week that the administration is ""in the middle of a breaking point.""

The latest report obtained by CNN comes on the heels of a DHS IG report released Friday that found ""dangerous overcrowding"" and unsanitary conditions at an El Paso, Texas, Border Patrol processing facility following an unannounced inspection last month.

Prior to this year's surge of migrants, some of ICE's facilities were not up to standard, according to the new IG report. Between May and November 2018, the inspector general visited four ICE facilities: Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California; LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana; Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey; and Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado -- facilities that in total can hold nearly 5,000 detainees.

""Although the conditions varied among the facilities and not every problem was present at each, our observations, interviews with detainees and staff, and reviews of documents revealed several persistent issues,"" the report reads.

The IG observed unsanitary conditions in the bathrooms at the Adelanto and Essex facilities during their surprise visit. ""[W]e observed detainee bathrooms that were in poor condition, including mold and peeling paint on walls, floors, and showers, and unusable toilets,"" the report reads.

Other issues raised include spoiled food, lack of provisions, like lotion, that is required for detainees, and strip searches with no documented justification. The report notes that ICE detainees ""are held in civil, not criminal, custody, which is not supposed to be punitive.""

All four facilities had ""food service issues.""

""At Essex, the food handling in general was so substandard that ICE and facility leadership had the kitchen manager replaced during our inspection,"" the report reads. At that facility, the IG found open packages of raw chicken leaking blood over refrigeration units, lunch meat that appeared spoiled, and moldy bread.

In a response included in the report, ICE said it has resolved, or worked to resolve, the issues flagged by the IG since the visits. The agency said it is ""training staff on proper food handling, removing and replacing menu items with input from detainees, and conducting random food quality testing"" at Essex. The agency also reported improvements to food service in the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, which was dinged for food handling issues.

ICE said it's since made repairs to the bathrooms as well. The agency also acknowledged the lack of some toiletries and said it's improved the inventory for new detainees.

Open packaged raw meat and food items leaking blood, not relabeled and dated, observed by OIG at the Essex facility on July 24, 2018 (left); food not properly labeled or stared at LaSalle facility on August 7, 2018 (center); and unlabeled food with no description or date at Aurora facility on November 6, 2018 (right).

Some of the conditions observed at Adelanto and Essex facilities were brought to the attention of ICE ahead of Thursday's report.

A DHS IG report last September laid out concerns about nooses in detainee cells, misuse of solitary confinement and delayed medical care at the Adelanto facility. The alert was part of the ongoing review of ICE's detention facilities.

Braided bedsheets hanging from vents -- referred to as nooses by staff and detainees -- were found in about 15 cells inspectors visited, according to the report. That's a violation of ICE standards, the report says, and ""shows a disregard for detainee health and safety.""

One detainee told inspectors: ""I've seen a few attempted suicides using the braided sheets by the vents and then the guards laugh at them and call them 'suicide failures' once they are back from medical.""

ICE said at the time that it had scheduled a contractor to inspect the facility and an additional detention facility review."

After catastrophic floodwaters submerged wide stretches of southern Louisiana in 2016, displaced homeowners and officials criticized the federal recovery effort as dangerously slow, leaving thousands of people homeless for months.

Auditors in the Department of Homeland Security inspector general’s office confirmed problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s performance in Louisiana — and in 11 other states hit over five years by hurricanes, mudslides and other disasters.

But the auditors’ boss, John V. Kelly, instead directed them to produce what they called “feel good reports” that airbrushed most problems and portrayed emergency responders as heroes overcoming vast challenges, according to interviews and a new internal review.

The watchdog concluded that FEMA’s response in Louisiana, where 13 people died in the disaster, was a huge success, a “remarkable,” “resilient and mission focused” effort that “provided hope and a way forward” for flooded communities.

Under pressure from Congress, the inspector general in 2017 retracted and purged from its website the Louisiana flooding report, and then followed the next year by retracting a dozen other audits of FEMA’s initial responses. The office called them “not compliant” with federal auditing standards.

Now the oversight agency, which evaluates the performance of FEMA and the rest of Homeland Security, has turned the spotlight on itself. Last month it released a 14-month internal review of how Kelly, a career government auditor who rose to acting inspector general in late 2017, chose to flatter FEMA’s staff in some reports, instead of hold them accountable.

Kelly’s staff routinely praised FEMA’s initial disaster responses from 2012 to 2017 with “superlative language,” investigators found — and they followed a formula. Each audit found the response “effective and efficient.” Some reports used fawning terms.

They identified challenges FEMA faced. But invariably they praised the agency for overcoming them. Other negative information, if it pointed to systemic problems, was removed from drafts and sometimes placed in separate “spin-off reports,” the internal review found. The audits made no recommendations for improvements.

Investigators determined that Kelly didn’t just direct his staff to remove negative findings. He potentially compromised their objectivity by praising FEMA’s work ethic to the auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response.

The review concluded the office had not met its own standards.

“Our prior approach resulted in unacceptable failures,” Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, wrote to the head of the internal review team on May 21, calling the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable . . . not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to “hold ourselves to the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.” Kelly recused himself from the review.

Costello noted that the flawed audits represent a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s otherwise hard-hitting oversight of FEMA.

In an interview with The Washington Post, Kelly denied directing his staff to sanitize its initial disaster reports. “There was no motivation to make FEMA look good,” he said.

He sent his staff an apology when the internal review was made public on May 23.

“I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective,” Kelly wrote. “While I did not intend to set that tone with respect to the [FEMA] reports, I obviously did.”

Kelly, 64, oversees a staff of 600 auditors and investigators charged with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the third-largest federal agency. He plans to retire when the Senate confirms a permanent chief. President Trump has nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) and experienced federal investigator.

The internal review did not find that Kelly “was improperly influenced by a personal or family relationship,” spokeswoman Arlen Morales said in an email. Nor did investigators find any “deliberate effort to benefit FEMA for personal gain,” she said.

Kelly has not faced discipline for coaxing his staff to produce the flawed reports.

“Because Mr. Kelly is the senior-most official in our organization, no one within [the office] has authority to impose corrective action upon him,” Morales said.

Important oversight

Across the federal government, agencies depend on inspectors general to provide them with independent, fact-driven analysis of their performance, conducting audits and investigations to ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent wisely.

Emergency management experts said that oversight, particularly from auditors on the ground as a disaster is unfolding, is crucial to improving the response, especially in ensuring that contracts are properly administered.

“I read a couple of those [retracted reports] and realized they weren’t good enough to help me,” said W. Craig Fugate, FEMA administrator for eight years under President Barack Obama.

“We’re not that good,” Fugate said of how the reports characterized FEMA’s performance. “The whole idea of the IG going out early was to find things we could do to take corrective action then.”

Even with improvements to emergency response in the deeply flawed aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, FEMA’s performance still is closely watched by local communities and Congress, where disaster response in the Trump administration has become particularly politicized.

Congress agreed only this week to send billions of dollars in long-delayed relief to lingering recovery efforts from multiple natural disasters, including Puerto Rico’s 2017 hurricane.

[‘The colony within the colony’: Puerto Rico fumes as FEMA deliberates over remote hospital]

John Roth, who preceded Kelly as inspector general and promoted him to his second-in-command, called the flawed reports an aberration and described Kelly’s oversight of other FEMA operations “unstinting.”

“This was not a rogue IG gone bad,” Roth said, calling Kelly as “as square and true blue as you could get.” Roth acknowledged, though, that the mistakes underscore a challenge for inspectors general, who want to maintain credibility with the agencies they oversee while they are issuing critical reports.

After Hurricane Isaac, which killed 41 people in Louisiana and caused more than $3 billion in damage in 2012, auditors found several problems and proposed fixes on the ground before Kelly intervened.

Kelly wanted to “downplay all the negatives” because he believed the agency’s “overall” response was “good,” the review found.

So the report cast the problems as “pressing challenges” for FEMA that included a shortage of experienced staff and a slow response from headquarters to requests from field staff. FEMA met the challenges, the since-retracted report said.

Auditors emphasized the good that arose from problems. Slow processing of funding requests were blamed on a byzantine process.

After Hurricane Sandy pummeled New York and New Jersey in 2012, Kelly told the staff in an email to alter their draft audits. Since “FEMA’s initial response was generally good for both disasters at all locations it would be best if all three reports were similar,” Kelly wrote, referring to both Isaac and Sandy.

'Feel good' reports

The audits became known among the staff as “feel good” reports.

When tornadoes struck Oklahoma in May and June of 2013, a supervisor who reported to Kelly tamped down the efforts of auditing teams that wanted to be more critical.

“Yes, we will identify some problems, but the point is — how did FEMA overcome them?” the supervisor wrote to the auditing team, copying Kelly.

“These are feel-good reports to tell the public how well FEMA initially responds to disasters,” the supervisor wrote. The reports were not to identify “systemic problems.”

Kelly did not correct or clarify any of the assertions made in the email, the internal review said. “These opportunities allow us to write quick, meaningful reports that actually help FEMA, and FEMA usually loves the reports,” the supervisor wrote.

Months later, when catastrophic flooding devastated wide swaths of Colorado, auditors again tried to include their concerns about FEMA’s shortcomings, but “those efforts were ultimately rebuffed,” investigators found.

The team wrote two spin-off reports following the flooding that found serious problems with the response. Disaster survivors who could not communicate in English or Spanish had problems finding FEMA staff to help them register for disaster aid. And the agency hired only half the workers that it needed for a proper response.

Kelly did not dispute investigators’ conclusions about the retracted reports. He defended his approach, telling them he “thought a report with a single message would be clearer and less likely to get lost or be ignored by FEMA,” the internal review said.

It was the message the inspector general conveyed after the Louisiana flooding in 2016 that caught the attention of House Republicans. As they complained that FEMA was spending too much money on mobile homes that took months to arrive, the team supervisor changed the draft report to add language that discounted their complaints, investigators found.

Instead, the audit characterized FEMA’s response in heroic terms, including “superlative language,” and said members of Congress were misguided in their criticism.

“The IG is telling us ‘everything’s fine,’ when it obviously wasn’t. It just never matched up,” recalled former Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who was chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. “I wonder how much more pain was inflicted [on disaster victims] by the fact that people weren’t being held accountable in real time.”

The committee had held two hearings on the flooding after Chaffetz’s staff and two congressmen, including Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.), who represents the flooded area, had flown to Baton Rouge to tour the damage.

An elderly man had died in a FEMA trailer with faulty air conditioning. The committee staff kept waiting for the inspector general’s team to release its audit, hoping that professionals would confirm their observations and press FEMA to do better, recalled Mike Howell, a former staffer who worked on the issue.

But when the report came out, lawmakers were shocked — and livid.

“Our jaws just dropped,” Howell recalled. “They said everything is fine. I said, ‘Did you even look at this issue, that issue and the man’s death? All of the unoccupied FEMA trailers sitting on lots? The people still not in their houses who can’t get a straight answer from FEMA?’ They had no answer and we were enraged.”

In a report issued in October 2018 that criticized FEMA’s disaster response, committee Republicans also took the inspector general to task.

A manager interviewed by the committee called the reports “useless” but said the staff “kept producing them because that was what [Deputy Inspector General] John Kelly wanted.”

The internal review has led to changes: a new practice of rotating auditors to “promote the objectivity and independence,” a reduced “reliance on testimonial evidence” and an increased “reliance on source documentation.”

The office is also training auditors to comply with auditing standards and ways to maintain independence from the people and agencies they are evaluating.

Costello, the deputy inspector general, said in an email, “We have all learned from this experience and are determined not to repeat these mistakes.”"

"CNN analyst Mudd: Christopher Steele should not talk to DOJ, could turn into 'car wreck'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cnn-phil-mudd-christopher-steele-should-not-talk-to-doj,"A former FBI official and frequent critic of President Trump said Tuesday that Christopher Steele should avoid being questioned by the Justice Department, warning it could turn out disastrously for the former British spy.

Phil Mudd was responding on CNN to reports that Steele agreed to be questioned by investigators about his salacious and unverified dossier on Trump's ties to Russia.

Steele's interview would reportedly happen within weeks in London and it would come on the heels of Attorney General Bill Barr appointing a U.S. attorney to review the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.

The DOJ inspector general is also looking into how Steele's Democrat-funded dossier was used by the FBI to secure surveillance warrants for a former Trump campaign adviser in 2016, despite questions about its credibility.

Mudd said this could turn into a ""car wreck"" for Steele if he goes forward.

""If you go to car races looking for car wrecks, this is significant. This will be a car wreck,"" said Mudd, doubting whether Steele will have sufficient answers on how he compiled the dossier.

“I can’t believe he has perfect answers about the origins of the Steele dossier. I’m not even sure why he’s showing up. If I were him, I’d go to Disney World. I would not go to the Department of Justice, because it will not end up well,"" he said.

Mudd then speculated that Steele wants to be interviewed in an attempt to clear his name so he can resume doing the same kind of work in the private sector.

“Let me give you how this game ends. Christopher Steele shows up in front of the Department of Justice and I’m guessing doesn’t have terrific answers for the quality of the information in that Steele dossier,” said Mudd.

Republicans have long accused former FBI officials of relying too heavily on Steele's dossier in 2016, when a counterintelligence investigation was launched into the Trump campaign."

Mark Morgan, who took the job in early May after leading the U.S. Border Patrol, also defended ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) against those who would like to see it abolished, in particular, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

“If you talk about abolishing ICE, it is absolutely irresponsible,” Morgan told Ingraham. “Last year alone 34,000 criminal arrests, 5,000 gang members arrested. Thousands of cases of child smuggling exploitation, human trafficking.”

Democrats lurching toward potential impeachment and ramping up their probes of President Donald Trump are becoming increasingly worried that the Justice Department will subvert their efforts.

An internal DOJ watchdog report on the origins of the Russia probe is expected to spotlight potential political bias by FBI agents at the heart of the Russia probe. The report, due out as soon as this month and as late as October, could raise pointed questions about the FBI’s decision-making at the time — handing Trump a bludgeon in his long-running campaign to accuse the bureau of mounting a “coup” against him.

Story Continued Below

They fear the report, by DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is respected by lawmakers from both parties, will diminish any momentum Democrats are seeking in their efforts to convince Americans that Trump obstructed the Russia investigation, later taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller.

“Their whole point is to go on a wild goose chase and then to create a chain of implausible connections that show that the special counsel report — and what we’re doing — is somehow fruit of the poisonous tree. It’s absurd,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Judiciary and Oversight committees, said in an interview.

Members of both parties largely acknowledge that the results of the inspector general’s report are likely to bode poorly for the senior FBI officials who decided to launch the investigation into Trump’s presidential campaign — in turn, giving Trump and his allies much-needed political firepower against House Democrats who are seeking to highlight the evidence laid out in Mueller’s report.

Beginning next week, Democrats are pursuing an aggressive public-relations strategy aimed at illuminating the evidence, as laid out in Mueller’s report, that Trump sought to thwart or otherwise shut down the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. That pursuit — part of an effort by Democratic leaders to make the case to the public that Trump should be impeached — could face significant roadblocks if Republicans get their way.

And it’s not just the IG report that could disrupt Democrats’ plans. Trump recently gave Attorney General William Barr broad authority to declassify information about how the Russia probe began — an order that prompted Democrats to warn of selective declassification that wouldn’t tell the full story.

“I don’t think it will throw us off track, but it will certainly give Republicans ammunition to try to divert attention away from the specifics of the Mueller investigation,” said Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. “It’s a profound breach of confidence that the legislative branch has in the executive branch, and a profound disruption in the intelligence apparatus worldwide.”

In particular, the inspector general’s report is likely to embolden Trump and give his allies new ammunition to discredit Democrats’ pursuit of Trump’s personal finances and additional evidence that he obstructed justice — probes that Republicans have long derided as politically motivated and an abuse of congressional authority.

“Because Inspector General Horowitz is known for calling balls and strikes, any validity that he offers in his report that substantiates some of the things that conservative members have been saying for some time … will change the narrative overnight,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a top Trump ally, said in an interview.

Trump is likely to latch on to any hint of evidence that would suggest that an anti-Trump bias permeated the upper echelons of the FBI. His allies on Capitol Hill have been parroting those claims of bias, in addition to allegations that senior officials leaked information to the media and inappropriately relied upon salacious and unverified claims about Trump that were outlined in a controversial dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

“Just like [Democrats] waited for the Mueller report to come out, they should wait for the IG’s report to come out,” Meadows added. “Because the IG’s report will actually go at the root of improper motivations on the investigation.”

Democrats, wary of Republicans’ narrative becoming dominant, are preemptively trying to dispel those claims.

“If there’s really a ‘deep state’ within DOJ to tank Donald Trump, then they should’ve revealed in 2016 that they had a counterintelligence investigation ongoing with regard to the Trump campaign,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), who sits on the Intelligence and Oversight committees. “The fact that they reopened the Hillary Clinton investigation on the eve of the election is potent proof that there’s no deep state conspiracy at DOJ against Donald Trump.”

“There’s nothing there. It’s a big nothingburger,” Krishnamoorthi added.

The release of the IG report will mark the second time in two years that Horowitz’s work will have become a flashpoint in Congress’ efforts to get to the bottom of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Last year, he issued a report on the FBI’s handling of the 2016 Hillary Clinton probe, concluding that he couldn’t find evidence that political bias affected any decisions in the investigation.

His bottom-line finding heartened Democrats, but Horowitz also revealed he was continuing to probe potential bias in the opening of the FBI’s Russia probe, launched just weeks after the Clinton investigation ended in July 2016. One of the agents involved in both investigations, Peter Strzok, has become a fixture for Republicans, who unearthed thousands of text messages last year in which Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page sharply criticized Trump.

“[W]e did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the [Clinton probe] was free from bias,” Horowitz concluded in that report.

Though Horowitz concluded that potential bias was unlikely to have affected the Clinton probe — in part because of multiple layers of decision-making at the FBI — he drew no conclusions on whether Strzok’s personal views infected his actions in the Russia probe, telling lawmakers last year that it was still under review.

V.A. Prepares for Major Shift in Veterans’ Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jennifer Steinhauer'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/va-health-care-veterans.html,"In the 2018 fiscal year, 1.7 million veterans used some form of private care. That number, based on the department’s eligibility projections, could increase as much as 30 percent under the new Mission Act, adding just over a half-million veterans to the pool seeking private care — although both critics and supporters of the change believe that number is low.

“I think it’s safe to assume that over the next several years you will see more veterans getting their health care in the community,” said Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America — an advocacy group with ties to the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch — which has pursued expanding the use of private health care for veterans. Democrats on Capitol Hill agree.

Even so, it will take some time to see whether the expanded access to private care results in a gentle migration of veterans who are not being well served by nearby V.A. centers, or in a shift of a significant share of veteran care to an increasingly expensive private health care marketplace, starving the V.A., as critics have warned. The quality of care in the private system, as well as wait times within it, will be closely monitored by both opponents and supporters of private care.

“I don’t expect a flood of veterans coming in tomorrow or next week saying I want to go into the private sector,” Robert Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, said Tuesday in an interview. “I’m confident that we will have a good rollout. I’m looking forward to it.” Mr. Wilkie said he will visit the V.A. in Salem, Va., on Thursday to observe the start there.

Mr. Wilkie has repeatedly said that most veterans would continue to seek care at department health care centers because they largely like the care and the understanding of veterans’ issues. Several studies underscore the V.A.’s popularity."
State Department suspends funding of anti-Iran Group which targeted journalists and activists,https://www.cnn.com,['Alex Marquardt'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/us-suspends-funding-anti-iran-group/index.html,"(CNN) The US State Department has suspended funding for an organization whose hardline stance against the Iranian regime saw it targeting American journalists, activists and academics whom they didn't consider tough enough on Tehran, according to a State Department spokesperson.

The Iran Disinformation Project claims it ""exposes and counters the nefarious influence of one of the world's few remaining totalitarian regimes."" It has been funded through the State Department's Global Engagement Center which combats foreign propaganda and disinformation.

But the organization was so aggressive that social media accounts linked to it went after people it perceived to be too soft on Iran, at a time when the Trump administration is exerting what it calls ""maximum pressure,"" ratcheting up military and economic pressure on Iran after pulling out of the landmark nuclear deal known as the JCPOA.

The Guardian was first to report that the State Department had suspended funding.

Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post columnist and CNN contributor, told CNN Wednesday that an account associated with the organization was ""attacking me, other journalists, human rights advocates and others who have taken a more nuanced approach to US Iran relations and are opposed to war and crippling sanctions on that country.""

Rezaian, who is Iranian-American, spent 18 months in prison in Tehran and is a firm and frequent critic of the regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a column Wednesday, he highlighted the organization's ""slander and libel"" against American citizens.

""For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran's 'mouthpieces,' 'apologists,' 'collaborators,' and 'lobbyists' in the West,"" he wrote.

Another target was Human Rights Watch's Tara Sepehri Far who researches human rights abuses in Iran. She recently wrote that American sanctions are ""collectively punishing"" ordinary Iranians and limiting their access to medicine.

In an April 25 tweet, the IranDisinfo account called Far a ""supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime"" and accused her of ""working hard to prove [Foreign Minister Javad Zarif's] claims.""

On Friday, Far tweeted: ""Many of us accepted that toxic slandering is part of the cost of being an analyst or doing human rights work in a very polarized climate of the US government's maximum pressure campaign, but now we realize that part of the slandering is actually being funded by US taxpayers.""

The State Department says it suspended the organization's funding on May 31, until it ""takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work.""

""The bulk of the work by @IranDisinfo has been in line with the scope of a project with the Department of State. We have, however, identified recent tweets that fall outside the scope of the project to counter foreign state propaganda or disinformation,"" a State Department spokesperson said.

The Global Engagement Center was set up in April 2016 under President Barack Obama and refocused after the presidential election primarily to combat Russian disinformation campaigns in the wake of their meddling in the campaign. Brett Bruen, who served as director of global engagement under Obama, said it was funded with $80 million.

""The problem was the Trump administration didn't really want to spend it because that meant recognizing that what Russia was doing on information warfare was a real threat,"" Bruen told CNN on Wednesday in an appearance alongside Rezaian.

""Instead what they have chosen to do is to spend that money and threaten American activists, threaten American journalists like Jason who don't agree with the Trump administration's stand on Iran. That's rather alarming and its quite dangerous,"" he added.

CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that the Global Engagement Center was refocused to combat Russian disinformation after the 2016 election and that Brett Bruen was Director of Global Engagement under President Obama."
Commerce officials to answer on census citizenship question amid contempt threat,https://thehill.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/447119-commerce-officials-agree-to-interviews-on-census-citizenship-question-amid,"The House Oversight and Reform Committee said Wednesday that three Commerce Department officials have agreed to sit for voluntary interviews as committee Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsPelosi privately told Democrats she wants Trump 'in prison': report Pelosi privately told Democrats she wants Trump 'in prison': report Judge says he's not ready to rule on new claims about census citizenship question MORE (D-Md.) threatens a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrNadler: 'It may very well come to' opening a formal impeachment inquiry Nadler: 'It may very well come to' opening a formal impeachment inquiry Judge says he's not ready to rule on new claims about census citizenship question MORE and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossJudge says he's not ready to rule on new claims about census citizenship question Judge says he's not ready to rule on new claims about census citizenship question Supreme Court should postpone decision on Trump's citizenship census question MORE in contempt.

The committee said in a statement that the Commerce Department agreed late Tuesday to let the committee conduct interviews with the three agency officials — general counsel Peter Davidson, deputy chief of staff and policy director Earl Comstock, and former senior adviser and counsel to the secretary James Uthmeier — after Cummings circulated a resolution to subpoena the men.

That subpoena vote has now been delayed, according to the panel. The committee is seeking the current and former officials' testimony as part of their investigation into the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The panel said Wednesday that it had first requested transcribed interviews with the officials on March 20 and sent letters requesting the interviews directly to the men on May 7.

Cummings on Wednesday also reiterated his threat to hold contempt votes within his committee for Barr and Ross if they fail to turn over certain documents on the citizenship question by Thursday.

“Our Committee has a constitutional responsibility to oversee the Census, and we will not relinquish this responsibility because of a coordinated effort to obstruct our investigation by the Trump Administration,” Cummings said in a statement. “If [the documents] are not produced by tomorrow, we will be forced to move forward with holding Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross in contempt of Congress.”

“These documents are critical to our oversight efforts, and we plan to use them in our interviews of top Administration officials in the coming weeks.”

Cummings first announced Monday that he was scheduling committee votes to hold Ross and Barr in contempt after they failed to comply with congressional subpoenas for documents about the citizenship question.

The announcement came on the heels of new evidence filed last week in a court case challenging the citizenship question's addition to the 2020 census, alleging that a late GOP redistricting strategist played in a role in the question's orchestration and that Trump officials obscured his involvement. The claims undercut the administration's assertion that the question is necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act.

The Department of Justice sought to refute the claims in a court filing Monday, claiming that Trump officials involved in the question did not lie in their testimony and were unaware of a 2015 study the strategist, Thomas Hofeller, conducted showing that asking about citizenship would help Republicans in redistricting.

But the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the new allegations, said in a court filing late Tuesday that the Justice Department ""does not deny that damning new evidence reveals hyper-partisan and racially discriminatory motives at the root of the citizenship question.""

A federal judge in New York will hold a hearing Wednesday afternoon on whether to impose sanctions on Trump officials in light of the new evidence.

The Supreme Court is also set to issue in the coming weeks its decision on whether the citizenship question will be allowed on the 2020 census."
DOE offers plan to speed nuclear waste cleanup at SRS,https://www.thestate.com,"['The State', 'Raf Casert', 'John Leicester', 'Associated Press']",,,,https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/article231181298.html,"The Savannah River Site near Aiken is home to deadly high-level nuclear waste File photograph

The U.S. Department of Energy is proposing to ship what has long been considered some of the world’s most deadly nuclear waste from South Carolina to burial grounds in the western United States under a plan to reclassify some of the atomic refuse as less dangerous.

According to plans, the energy department would classify some of the Savannah River Site’s high-level waste as low-level waste, a type of atomic refuse that is considered less toxic. That, in turn, would allow the material to be shipped to low-level nuclear waste disposal sites in the deserts of Utah and Texas.

“We want to look at taking the waste stream in South Carolina and reclassifying it and moving it out of state,’’ said Paul Dabbar, the energy department’s undersecretary for science.





As it stands, the country does not have a high-level waste burial ground, meaning SRS must keep the deadly waste at the Aiken area weapons complex indefinitely.

The DOE’s plan for reclassifying and shipping waste from SRS is part of a larger proposal to change the definition of nuclear waste at weapons complexes in other parts of the country. The agency says it has historically considered much of the waste that resulted from Cold War weapons production to be high-level. Now, it will consider how radioactive the material is, the DOE said.

In addition to the Savannah River Site, nuclear weapons sites in Washington and Idaho that also have high level waste could benefit from the department’s plan to change the definition of nuclear waste, the agency said.

The SRS proposal and a companion plan for nuclear sites across the country, released Wednesday, drew immediate criticism from environmental groups, which said the plans are potentially dangerous.





But the Department of Energy says reclassifying some of the high level waste would occur only after a thorough analysis and environmental studies.





Federal records show the agency will look at whether 10,000 gallons of Savannah River Site wastewater should still should be classified as high level waste or downgraded to another category. For now, the DOE said it is only considering the 10,000 gallons for disposal at a licensed faciliity outside South Carolina, records show. The wastewater comes from the Defense Waste Processing Facility, an industrial plant that converts high-level waste into glass in an effort to neutralize its danger.

Reclassifying waste would speed cleanup at the Savannah River Site, the agency said. The 310-square-mile weapons complex has tons of atomic refuse left over from Cold War weapons production. Much of that waste is held in about four-dozen aging tanks, some of which have cracked. A handful of tanks have been emptied, but most still contain waste.

Nuclear waste disposal is a hot button issue in South Carolina, where leaders have expressed frustration with the Department of Energy’s failure to clean up high level atomic refuse through the years.

Gov. Henry McMaster found out about the DOE plan Monday during a phone call with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the governor’s office said. McMaster likes what he’s seen so far, spokesman Brian Symmes said.

“If the department’s study and analysis shows that this waste can be safely reclassified and transferred elsewhere, then the governor is in full support of any plan that would reduce risk in South Carolina,’’ Symmes said in an email.





Attorney General Alan Wilson’s office also said he hopes any rules change would result in the removal of radioactive waste from South Carolina.

Critics said redefining high level waste and shipping it to low level waste dumps in the West would only shift the problem from South Carolina to other communities.

Don Hancock, who follows nuclear issues for the Southwest Research and Information Center, said the plan would not go over well with some residents of Texas and Utah. Low-level waste disposal sites were not designed to take highly radioactive material.

Geoff Fettus, who tracks nuclear waste issues for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said reclassifying waste might also allow officials at SRS to avoid cleaning up some material altogether.





Fettus said that if some of the waste at SRS is no longer considered high level, the DOE could leave the material there and walk away. If that happens, it would not be the first time at SRS. In 2002, the energy department offered plans to reclassify waste so some residual material could remain in the tanks.

“That is the big thing,’’ Fettus said. “I think this is just as much about what stays in the tanks, as to what comes out.’’

Fettus said the environmental group has serious reservations about the plan being advanced by President Donald Trump.





“The Trump administration is moving to fundamentally alter more than 50 years of national consensus on how the most toxic, radioactive and dangerous waste in the world is managed and ultimately disposed of,’’ Fettus told The State newspaper. “No matter what they call it, this waste needs a permanent, well-protected disposal option to guard it for generations to come.’’

Tom Clements, who heads Savannah River Site Watch, also said the proposal is unwise and unsafe.





“DOE’s questionable rewriting of the regulations is simply a cost-cutting measure designed to get thousands of HLW (high level waste) containers dumped off site,’’ he said in an email.

Any waste that is reclassified would not be sent to South Carolina’s Barnwell County low-level nuclear waste site near SRS, but to commercial facilities near the Texas-New Mexico border and in Utah, energy officials said. The low-level Utah waste site is owned by the same company that runs the aging Barnwell County low-level waste dump, which has leaked.





“It allows us to dispose of this into facilities ... in Texas or in Utah,’’ Dabbar said.





“We are very excited about actually increasing the pace of reducing risk in South Carolina,’’ he said.

In a news release Wednesday, the DOE said the agency has for decades managed reprocessing waste streams as high level waste, regardless of how radioactive the material is. But it now plans to look at the waste more carefully to determine if some of it is less radioactive. Less dangerous material could be disposed of, according to plans.





“Recognizing this failure, this administration is proposing a responsible, results-driven solution that will finally open potential avenues for the safe treatment and removal of the lower level waste currently housed in three states,” Dabbar said in the news release. “DOE is going to analyze each waste stream and manage it in accordance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards, with the goal of getting the lower-level waste out of these states without sacrificing public safety.”





The DOE’s proposal to study reclassifying SRS waste and shipping it off-site to low-level waste dumps was released Wednesday but is part of a plan under discussion since last fall. That plan, which drew thousands of public comments, said the DOE would redefine its interpretation of high-level waste. On Wednesday, the agency department said how it would redefine the waste."
Interior has 5 versions of the secretary's schedule -- but they don't always match,https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/david-bernhardt-conflicting-calendars-interior/index.html,"Washington (CNN) During the early days of the Trump administration, lawmakers and government watchdogs complained agencies weren't turning over Cabinet secretaries' schedules as has been practice. Now, one department has presented those groups with the opposite problem, creating new questions about a lack of consistency and transparency.

The Interior Department has released five different versions of Secretary David Bernhardt's schedule for the first five months of 2019.

The department released Google calendar entries, two versions of daily cards -- which are synopses of the secretary's calendar given to him as a reminder of upcoming events, according to Interior -- briefing book pages and secretary's schedules, which are released on the same section of the Interior website as press releases.

But many of these sources give conflicting information when compared side by side on any given day.

With none of the five sources apparently being the definitive record, it raises questions about what the secretary is actually using to schedule his days and why the public doesn't have access to it.

Conflicting schedules

Take January 10 of this year.

At 9:30 a.m., Bernhardt had a meeting titled ""deputy secretary lapse working group."" Or did he? That information comes from his Google calendar entry, a schedule page and the daily cards for that day. So, it seems clear.

But the briefing book entry for the day says Bernhardt attended a staff meeting at that time. Is that the same meeting or a different one?

Then, according to the briefing book, he had two vaguely described entries -- another staff meeting at 11 a.m. and an ""external lunch off the record"" at noon.

So, what do the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page have at that time? No mention of an 11 a.m. meeting, but an additional 11:45 a.m. meeting with Matt Pottinger and Eric Johnson (NSC) and no mention of a 12 p.m. lunch but a 12:30 p.m. meeting with Brian Jack (OPA), according to the Google calendar and daily cards. NSC stands for the National Security Council and OPA stands for Office of Political Affairs, an office in the White House. The department schedule page seems to confirm that information in a more opaque way, listing an 11:45 a.m. meeting with NSC and a 12:30 p.m. meeting with OPA.

Depending on which calendar you pick, at 2 p.m., Bernhardt either had a meeting with ""Bremberg & Leggit (DPC)"" according to the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page, or he had an ""external call - TRCP,"" according to the briefing book. TRCP stands for Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. A spokesperson for the group confirmed that a member of their organization had a phone call with Bernhardt on that day and time.

At 4:15 p.m., Bernhardt was either in a staff meeting, according to his Google calendar and secretary's schedule page, or he was in an ""AS/WS Operations Meeting,"" according to two versions of the daily cards for that day.

Maybe those are the same, since an operations meeting would presumably be with staff. And that's just one day.

""Like most (if not all) of us, the Secretary of the Interior has a daily schedule that is subject to constant change,"" Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said.

""Appointments that were expected get canceled, unexpected appointments arise and plans get interrupted by events. The department seeks to ensure that the public has access to the secretary's activities by posting online the various tools used to plan his day by different staff members,"" Block said. ""We are constantly working to ensure that the public has a window into the work the secretary is doing on behalf of the American people.""

Five calendars, no consensus

Not all of the calendars conflict every day. On certain days, all five versions of Bernhardt's schedule line up. In some cases, external meetings that don't include meeting attendees on the daily cards have meeting attendees listed in the secretary's schedule page for the same day. Since mid-March, versions of the secretary's schedule pages have included more names of meeting participants.

But there are too many discrepancies to know what the secretary is doing other days. On February 21, there are at least three discrepancies between the name or subject of the meeting, and another 10 instances of meetings and departure times not listed on all the calendars.

And it's not just the entries themselves that don't line up. The different sources of Bernhardt's scheduling information don't cover all five months of 2019. The department posted Google calendar entries from January to May, two versions of daily cards from January to April 16, briefing book pages from January to March and webpages with the the secretary's schedule page from January to March and April 28 to May 24.

The Center for Western Priorities, a watchdog group that focuses on environmental issues and has been critical of the Trump administration, feels the deluge of contradictory information is not just a matter of sloppy record keeping, but rather a concerted effort to conceal the secretary's activities from the public.

""Despite numerous requests from the public, the press, and Congress, David Bernhardt still refuses to release his actual calendar -- the one that tells him not just where to go, but what his meetings are about,"" Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss told CNN. ""It's not just a lack of transparency. It's Bernhardt taking repeated steps to conceal his actions.""

Some of the entries include vague terms like ""external"" and ""internal"" meeting, which Bernhardt has been criticized for in the past, because it gives little insight into who he's meeting with and for what purpose they're meeting.

A CNN review found 88 entries in Bernhardt's daily cards that use the term ""external"" or ""intergovernmental"" to describe a meeting without any further details.

""No one keeps a day planner that only says 'internal briefing' and 'external meeting' with no details. You simply couldn't' function,"" Weiss said.

Calendar controversy continues

Bernhardt, a former fossil fuel lobbyist, previously came under scrutiny from watchdog groups and Democratic members of Congress for not releasing his full schedule publicly. When asked by the House Natural Resources Committee to provide his complete schedule earlier this year, Bernhardt said he had ""not personally maintained a calendar for years,"" and that he had ""no intention of doing so now,"" in a letter to the committee.

A week before his confirmation vote in the Senate, Interior published hundreds of pages of documents containing new details about some meetings that were left off of previous versions of Bernahrdt's calendars.

The House Oversight Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee requested interviews with four Interior staff members to further investigate recordkeeping practices at the department in March.

Before becoming secretary, Bernhardt served as deputy secretary to former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. When Zinke resigned amid a host of ethics scandals at the end of 2018, Bernhardt stepped in to lead the agency in an acting role and was confirmed to the post in April.

When Zinke announced his resignation in December, he referred to the allegations against him as ""false.""

""I love working for the President and am incredibly proud of all the good work we've accomplished together,"" Zinke wrote on Twitter. ""However, after 30 years of public service, I cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations."""
Talks Between Democrats and Justice Dept. in Doubt Over Barr Contempt Vote,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/us/politics/trump-hope-hicks-annie-donaldson.html,"Under subpoenas issued by the Judiciary Committee, the two witnesses had been instructed to deliver on Tuesday a range of documents related to their work in the White House, including notes and records related to some of Mr. Trump’s attempts to thwart federal investigators — attempts documented by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in the report he completed in March.

Mr. Nadler said that Ms. Hicks, who also served as a top aide on Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, did produce some documents related to her work before the election. He called it a “show of good faith,” though a copy of a letter from Ms. Hicks’s lawyer obtained by The New York Times says she handed over only four documents containing email chains.

In addition to documents, the subpoenas call for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson to testify publicly this month — and there was no indication on Tuesday whether they would comply. Mr. Nadler made clear his position that both were still expected to show up before the panel. Ms. Hicks has been subpoenaed to appear on June 19 and Ms. Donaldson on June 24.

[Read the Judiciary Committee subpoenas for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson.]

But there appears to be little chance either former aide will testify, bolstering the case made by a growing number of House Democrats that the president is actively obstructing another branch of government from doing its constitutionally sanctioned oversight function, and that impeachment proceedings are the only proportional response.

The White House issued similar instructions not to cooperate last month to Mr. McGahn, who had served as one of the most important witnesses in Mr. Mueller’s investigation into obstruction of justice. He ultimately did not produce a single document or appear for a hearing. If it does not alter course for the Justice Department, the House is poised to hold Mr. McGahn in contempt of Congress next week, as well, and take the dispute to court to try to enforce its subpoena — steps that could soon follow for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson if they do not show up to the Judiciary Committee’s hearings.

With potential star witnesses off limits and Mr. Mueller reluctant to testify, Democrats have for now been left to try to figure out other ways to bring Mr. Mueller’s 448-page report to life. On Monday, Mr. Nadler announced that his committee would hold a series of hearings on the report with former federal prosecutors, legal experts and John W. Dean, who went to jail for his role in the Watergate affair.

Republicans, who remain closely aligned with the president, have repeatedly accused Democrats of being less interested in the truth than in manufacturing a conflict with the White House that could provide a pretext for impeachment. They painted the possibility of new talks between the two sides on Tuesday as further evidence Democrats had been acting irresponsibly."

Faulkner used to be an “outside lobbyist” for Raytheon. The emergency declaration used reportedly cited rising tensions between U.S. and Iran to bypass congressional oversight.

On the morning of July 4, 1801, a bareheaded President Thomas Jefferson, his “grey locks waving in the air,” watched from the front steps of the White House as crowds celebrated America’s 25th birthday with a military parade, horse races and cockfights. At noon, the president opened the doors to greet guests including ordinary citizens, diplomats, military officers and five Cherokee chiefs.

The Marine Band played in the entrance hall. Inside, about 100 guests were served cakes, wine and punch. “All appeared to be cheerful, all happy. Mr. Jefferson mingled promiscuously with the citizens,” said a woman who attended the event.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump’s plans to insert himself into the celebration of Fourth of July by delivering a speech at the Lincoln Memorial came under attack by House Democrats, who warned it “could create the appearance of a televised, partisan campaign rally on the Mall at public expense.”

[House Democrats attack Trump’s plans to speak at Fourth of July celebration]

In contrast to Trump, early presidents took part in more low-key events. Presidents George Washington and John Adams attended celebrations in various towns around the country. Adams, however, did spark the association of celebrations with the Fourth of July. After Congress approved the Declaration of Independence in July of 1776, Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, that the date “ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other from this time forward forever more.”

As the first president to reside in the White House on a July 4, Jefferson started the tradition of holding receptions on Independence Day. President James Madison hosted “heads of departments” one year. In 1825, President John Quincy Adams went to Capitol Hill to hear a reading of the Declaration of Independence before hosting a White House gathering.

In 1841, President John Tyler hosted a dinner that included turtle soup made from a 300-pound turtle from Key West, Fla. “That evening Tyler and his guests walked out onto Lafayette Square to enjoy a fireworks display,” according to the White House Historical Association.

In 1845, President James K. Polk featured fireworks at the White House itself. Unfortunately, the presidential pyrotechnics had a tragic end. Nearly 8,000 people gathered “to witness a most magnificent display of fireworks,” the Washington Union reported. Near the close of the display, 12 rockets were accidentally fired into the crowd. “Mr. James Knowles, a worthy and industrious citizen of Washington, was transfixed through the heart by one and was instantly killed.” A woman, Georgiana Ferguson, also was hit and died the next day.

July 4 was a fateful day for some presidents as well. Both John Adams and Jefferson died on that day in 1826. President James Monroe died on July 4, 1831. Then there was President Zachary Taylor. On a steamy July 4, 1850, “Old Rough and Ready” walked over to ceremonies at the location where the Washington Monument was being built. Later, back at the White House, he gulped down cherries and iced milk. He came down with cholera and died on July 9.

In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln gave what became known as his “Fourth of July” speech from a second-floor window of the White House to a crowd accompanied by a band celebrating the fall of Vicksburg. The date was July 7, but the speech got its name because Lincoln talked about the importance of the Fourth of July to the nation.

President Ulysses S. Grant began a new July 4 tradition for presidents in 1872, according to research by James Heintze, author of “The Fourth of July Encyclopedia.” Grant left town and went to Long Beach, N.J. In 1892, President Benjamin Harrison spent the Fourth in Cape May, N.J. In 1902 President Theodore Roosevelt traveled to Pittsburgh, where he gave a speech to 200,000 people.

In 1909, President William Howard Taft was at his new “summer White House” in Beverly, Mass., when the District of Columbia conducted its first official Independence Day celebration. More than 40,000 people turned out to see daylight and evening fireworks on the Ellipse behind the White House. The celebrations have continued every year since.

President Harry S. Truman is the only president to ever take an active role in the Washington celebration. With more than 150,000 people at the Mall on July 4, 1951, for the 175th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, Truman gave a speech from the Washington Monument about progress in the Korean War.

President Richard Nixon videotaped a message that was played on the Mall at July 4 ceremonies in 1970 when bottle-throwing anti-Vietnam War protesters disrupted the event.

In 1976, the nation celebrated its bicentennial year with a record of more than 1 million people jamming onto the Mall. President Gerald Ford watched from the White House after speaking at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.

President Ronald Reagan got involved in the 1983 Washington celebration when his Interior Secretary James Watt banned the Beach Boys from singing at festivities on the Mall. Watt said the group would draw “the wrong element.” He replaced the rock group with the family-friendly U.S. Army Blues band and Las Vegas crooner Wayne Newton.

President Reagan, at the behest of his wife, Nancy, overturned the ban. Mrs. Reagan said her children grew up listening to the Beach Boys’ music, and the group’s members “are fine, outstanding people.” The group didn’t perform that year, but it did the next before more than half a million people. Lead singer Mike Love drew cheers when he addressed the crowd as “all you undesirable elements.”

President Bill Clinton reviewed Navy ships in New York on July 4, 2000. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama presided over naturalization ceremonies for new U.S. citizens. Last year on July 4, President Trump and his wife, Melania, hosted a White House picnic for military families.

This year President Trump has tweeted about a “Salute To America” that would feature “an address by your favorite President, me.” Trump plans to speak from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Critics said that would turn the historically nonpartisan celebration into a Trump political rally.

It’s too soon to say how the plans will work out. What does seem certain about this year’s July 4 celebration is that, in more ways than one, there will be fireworks.

"Mallinckrodt paid 'kickbacks' to keep drug price high, and stuck taxpayers with bill, DOJ lawsuit says",https://www.cnn.com,['Wayne Drash'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/health/mallinckrodt-lawsuit-doj/index.html,"(CNN) The pharmaceutical company responsible for one of the largest drug price increases in US history ""knowingly paid illegal kickbacks"" as part of an elaborate scheme to make millions and stick the American taxpayer with the bill, the US Department of Justice said Wednesday in a lawsuit filed against Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals.

In its complaint, the government demanded a jury trial that would put front and center the actions of the company at the heart of a 97,000% drug price hike. The price of Mallinckrodt's anti-inflammatory drug Acthar -- best known for treating babies with a debilitating seizure disorder -- has gone from $40 a vial in 2000 to nearly $39,000 today.

The complaint was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by US Attorney William McSwain. Mallinckrodt could face fines of nearly $240 million if found liable.

The government alleged Mallinckrodt used a foundation, called the Chronic Disease Fund, as a conduit to pay kickbacks as part of the scheme to maintain the high price of Acthar.

""The scheme allowed the Company to continually raise Acthar's price yet market it as 'free' to patients and doctors, shifting the drug's ever-increasing cost to Medicare,"" the government said in its complaint. ""As a result of its conduct, Mallinckrodt caused the submission of millions of dollars in false Medicare claims for Acthar.""

"DOJ reveals Dems acknowledged Barr subpoena was 'overbroad'; Nadler fires back, offers to meet 'without conditions'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-fires-back-after-house-dems-announce-barr-contempt-vote-dubs-subpoena-unworkably-overbroad,"Hours after the Department of Justice (DOJ) slammed House Democrats for planning a contempt vote against Attorney General Bill Barr -- and charged that Democrats had privately admitted their subpoena requests were ""overbroad"" -- House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler announced late Tuesday that he is open to negotiating with the DOJ ""without conditions.""

The remarkable turn of events reopened the possibility that Barr's contempt vote may be postponed or canceled, if both sides return to the negotiating table. Nadler, however, pointedly refused to cancel the planned contempt vote prior to beginning any new negotiations, as the DOJ had demanded.

At the same time, Nadler criticized what he called DOJ ""brinksmanship,"" and blamed the Justice Department for purportedly cutting off negotiations on May 7.

The brouhaha began Tuesday morning with a DOJ letter, written by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, that blasted House Democrats and Nadler, D-N.Y., for announcing they would vote next week on whether to hold Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SCHOLAR: CONGRESS HEADING INTO 'WORLD OF HURT' WITH BARR CONTEMPT VOTE

In its letter to Nadler, the DOJ publicly revealed that Democrats had acknowledged in a May 24 letter they were open to ""further negotiations"" regarding concerns that their subpoena demands were ""unworkably overbroad."" Nevertheless, Democrats announced just days later their plans to hold Barr in contempt for allegedly failing to comply with those demands.

The DOJ said it was ""prepared to resume negotiations with the committee regarding accommodation of its narrowed Subpoena"" -- as long as Democrats removed the ""threat of an imminent vote by the House of Representatives to hold the attorney general in contempt.""

""The department was disappointed by the committee's abrupt termination of ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching a reasonable accommodation that respects both sides' legitimate interests regarding the materials sought,"" Boyd wrote to Nadler. ""Further, the department is disappointed by news reports indicating that Democratic leaders have scheduled a contempt vote in the House of Representatives for June 11, 2019.""

In his response late Tuesday, Nadler took issue with the DOJ's characterization of Democrats' May 24 letter, and insisted that Democrats had ""always remained open to continuing negotiations. ... We are here and ready to negotiate as early as tomorrow morning.""

""I ... take exception to your characterization of how our prior accommodation efforts ended,"" Nadler wrote back to Boyd. ""Contrary to the account in your letter, the Committee has always remained open to continuing negotiations. We had an offer on the table late on the evening of May 7 when the Department suddenly declared an end to the accommodation process. My staff was still in their offices after the close of business hours awaiting a counteroffer when the Department broke off negotiations with a letter demanding that the contempt vote—scheduled to begin the next day— be cancelled if we wished to proceed with the accommodations process.""

Nadler continued: ""At any rate, we are ready to proceed without conditions—as shown by the initiative we took with our detailed May 24 offer. I should add that, contrary to your argument that the Committee’s continuing accommodation efforts somehow suggest that our prior requests were overbroad, our offer to compromise was intended to respond to your prior objections by seeking a middle ground. We urge the Department to do the same.""

The DOJ's letter, meanwhile, had called on the House Judiciary Committee to ""moot"" its May 8 vote to hold Barr in contempt, which the DOJ called ""premature and unnecessary."" That vote came after congressional Democrats subpoenaed Mueller's full and unredacted report on his probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.

WHY DID MUELLER EDIT TRANSCRIPT OF VOICEMAIL WITH FLYNN LAWYER TO ELIMINATE KEY DISCLAIMERS?

Republicans have countered that federal law protecting secretive grand-jury information would prevent Barr from turning over the entirety of the report. The DOJ has offered Democrats the opportunity to review the report, minus those grand jury-related redactions, in a secure setting -- but those offers have been rebuffed. (In a rare public statement last week, Mueller specifically remarked, ""I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith"" in deciding to make the report ""largely public."")

""It would hardly make sense for the full House of Representatives to act upon the committee's prior recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt for not complying with a subpoena that even the committee now appears to acknowledge was overbroad in seeking immediate disclosure of the entirety of the special counsel's investigative files,” Boyd wrote.

That was a conspicuous reference to the previously unreported May 24 letter to the DOJ, in which the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wrote to privately emphasize ""the Committee's willingness to engage in further negotiations to resolve this dispute"" -- only to resort to public political posturing, the DOJ charged.

The Democrat-led committee also offered to ""identify specific materials that if produced would be deemed to satisfy the subpoena"" in an effort to make the subpoena more workable, according to the DOJ, which quoted the Committee's letter verbatim.

""In your May 24, 2019, letter, the committee appears to recognize that the subpoena is unworkably overbroad and offers -- for the first time -- to narrow the subpoena's scope to cover a much more limited set of documents,"" the DOJ wrote. ""The department believes that the committee's new offer reflects a more reasonable request and could mitigate some of the legal barriers to disclosure that we have discussed.""

ANALYSIS: BARR DETERMINED TO FIND TRUTH BEHIND ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE -- AND DEMS ARE WORRIED

The letter continued: ""The committee held its contempt vote only 19 days after issuing the subpoena. Traditionally, congressional committees have only proceeded with contempt votes after lengthy periods of negotiations have failed to reach an accommodation. For example, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee negotiated with the department over the Operation Fast and Furious subpoena for months, and only voted to cite Attorney General [Eric] Holder for contempt 252 days after issuing its subpoena.""

Since 1975, according to the DOJ, ""committees and subcommittees have averaged 103 days between issuing a subpoena to an executive branch official and holding a contempt vote. By any measure, the committee rushed its decision and bears responsibility for the termination of the accommodation process.”

But in his letter, Nadler took issues with those characterizations.

""We cannot agree that the House’s sense of urgency here is 'premature and unnecessary,'"" Nadler wrote. ""It has been over 100 days since we first initiated the accommodations process on February 22, 2019. The pace with which we are proceeding is consistent with the exceptional urgency of this matter: an attack on our elections that was welcomed by our President and benefitted his campaign, followed by acts of obstruction by the President designed to interfere with the investigation of that attack. All of this misconduct was documented by the Special Counsel in the documents we now seek.""

In a statement, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., highlighted the DOJ's revelation that Nadler apparently signaled a willingness to work with the DOJ.

“After racing to hold Attorney General Barr in contempt, Chairman Nadler finally seems ready to join the Justice Department at the negotiating table,"" Collins said. ""When Judiciary Democrats wield subpoena power like a sword instead of a plow, their investigations bear little fruit. The House Intelligence Committee has shown us that working with the Justice Department in good faith yields documents. Abusing subpoena and contempt authority, however, has left the Judiciary Committee with little to show for its obsessively unreasonable demands.""

As for McGahn, the White House has instructed its former top lawyer not to testify, saying he is legally immune from being compelled to testify about privileged discussions occurring in the course of his official duties. Democrats have responded that McGahn waived that privilege by agreeing to speak to Mueller.

Trump did not assert executive privilege to shield any aspect of the Mueller report itself, and has derided Democrats' efforts as politically motivated attempts to keep what he's called the ""Russia collusion hoax"" alive -- and to distract from or derail -- Barr's own ongoing probes into Justice Department and FBI misconduct.

News of the planned contempt vote came days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation. Last month, Barr appointed the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, John Durham, to lead the investigation, which is to focus on the use of FBI informants and the alleged improper issuance of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to monitor a variety of individuals, including former Trump aide Carter Page.

A Barr contempt vote would be historic, but not unprecedented. In 2012, the GOP-controlled House's vote to hold the attorney general at that time, Holder, in contempt for failing to comply with investigations into the Obama administration's failed gun-running sting operation, ""Fast and Furious."" Holder became the first-ever sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress in that manner.

The resolution scheduled for a June 11 floor vote would allow the Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement of its subpoenas in federal court.

Such an approach would rule out so-called ""inherent contempt,"" a process in which Congress technically can enforce contempt citations on its own -- whether by arrest or fine. In May, Barr reportedly joked about that possibility with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, asking, ""Did you bring your handcuffs?""

US Commerce Department offers solution for obtaining minerals critical to the military,https://www.defensenews.com,"['Kelsey Reichmann', 'Kelsey Reichmann Is A General Assignment Editorial Fellow Supporting Defense News', 'Fifth Domain', 'Federal Times. She Attended California State University.']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2019/06/05/us-commerce-department-offers-solution-for-obtaining-minerals-critical-to-the-military/,"A report by the U.S. Commerce Department recommends the government strengthen relations with foreign companies that provide minerals critical to military development.

The report was released Tuesday amid a trade war between the United States and China.

“The United States is heavily dependent on critical mineral imports. If China or Russia were to stop exports to the United States and its allies for a prolonged period — similar to China’s rare earths embargo in 2010 — an extended supply disruption could cause significant shocks throughout U.S. and foreign critical mineral supply chains,” the report states.

The report also notes that the U.S. is import-reliant on 31 of the 35 minerals designated as critical by the Department of the Interior. Furthermore, the U.S. completely relies on imports for 14 of these minerals.

The report also says the country’s imports of “critical mineral commodities” exceed 50 percent of its annual consumption. These rare earth minerals are often used in the production of aircraft, computers and GPS systems.

Last year China produced 78 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals, according to researchers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

“These critical minerals are often overlooked but modern life without them would be impossible,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a news release. “Through the recommendations detailed in this report, the Federal government will take unprecedented action to ensure that the United States will not be cut off from these vital minerals.”

One solution to this problem is to enhance international trade and cooperation in relation to rare earth minerals, according to the report.

However, the Government Accountability Office in April found that the U.S. is reliant on China for several critical minerals. And China has noted that it could cut off the U.S. from some rare earth minerals should the trade war continue.

The report from the Department of Commerce proposes a continued expansion of rare earth minerals trading with Canada, Australia, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. It notably does not include China.

The report does, however, mention China as an area to which American production companies relocated, and it called for more investment in the National Defense Stockpile program.

The NDS program, which would provide critical materials to support industrial investments to help civilian needs in an emergency, is not financially sustainable, according to the report."
Thousands of Brits Protest Trump’s Visit Alongside 16-Foot Farting Presidential Robot,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Jamie Ross'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-in-britain-thousands-of-brits-protest-presidents-visit-alongside-16-foot-farting-robot,"LONDON—Thousands of Brits took to the streets here Tuesday, where they marched alongside a 16-foot farting robot of Donald Trump and held aloft huge photos of John McCain in an attempt to trigger the president.

The protests—which saw thousands brave the typical British weather shielded by umbrellas emblazoned with anti-Trump slogans, EU flags, and the LGBTQ rainbow symbol—went within meters of Downing Street, where the president must have heard creatively foul-mouthed chants, although he still insists there have been no protests against him at all.

Protesters were kept away from the gates of Downing Street for Trump’s arrival and departure for talks with Theresa May. However, the thousands occupied a large stretch of central London, marching from Trafalgar Square past the government buildings of Whitehall and eventually arriving outside parliament to hear a speech by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.

As always, the protesters in Britain clearly put a lot of effort into their preparations to mock Trump. The most eye-catching part of the parade was a huge robotic statue named the Trump Dump, which featured the gigantic president atop a golden toilet, with a smartphone in his agitating hand. It emitted farting noises and the catchphrase “no collusion.”

“I wanted to honor him by showing him in all his glory,” the monster’s creator, Don Lessem, explained to The Daily Beast, claiming it cost him $25,000 of his own cash. “It’s 16 feet, which is the size of his ego. We wanted to match that. It needs to be a little more orange I think, but we tried to do it as proportionally accurate as possible, so his penis is three millimeters.”

Lessem’s ultimate goal is to crowdfund an effort to bring the robot to Washington, D.C. for the July 4 celebrations, but he was proud to give it its “world debut” to coincide with the president’s trip to London.

There were thousands of slightly less extravagant attempts to ridicule the president during his visit. On Monday, he dubiously claimed that he had been greeted by “tremendous crowds of well wishers” rather than protests and that there was “great love all around” on his first state visit.

On the contrary, the crowd couldn’t have displayed any more antipathy for him, even though there appeared to be smaller numbers than a huge protest against him last year. Signs showed various degrees of exasperation, ranging from the playful “Who invited this wally anyway?” to the frank “You’re a racist twat, mate,” to the laconic “Fuck this fucking fucker.”

One popular choice appeared to be showing images of the late Senator John McCain, following reports last week that the White House ordered the USS John S. McCain to be hidden from Trump’s sight in Japan.

Jeffrey Kaser Paradi explained to The Daily Beast: “I never thought I’d be holding a photograph of a Republican ever in my life, but after last week when the White House instructed the Navy to cover up the name of the battleship for fear of triggering Donald Trump. You know, I’d just hate for him to see an image of him on his trip here to the U.K..”

The protest was largely good-natured and police seemed relaxed. It was clear that the protest was also about Britain’s own political crises, with the anti-Trump marchers displaying a lot of support for the European Union and the pro-Trump marchers being very supportive of Brexit.

There were some scenes in the crowd that perhaps went slightly too far when the two sides clashed. One small, paper U.S. flag was torn from one pro-Trump marcher and stomped upon, while a Make America Great Again hat was snatched from the head of a Trump supporter and dumped in a fresh pile of dung left behind by one of the police horses.

But the anti-Trump marchers’ activity was largely limited to chants and songs, a lot of which were based on classic British music. For example, a somewhat predictable remix of Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall” that replaced the word “brick” with something a little ruder.

Trump supporters were vastly outnumbered, largely white and male, and they were significantly angrier than the anti-Trump marchers. They marched with QAnon and anti-George Soros flags, were abusive toward rival protesters, and many proudly espoused extreme right-wing views.

One group calling itself Scots for Trump gathered at the protest with a big banner and were led by a well-known activist, Alistair McConnachie, who has previously made headlines in Scotland for denying that Jews were murdered in gas chambers in Nazi Germany. “That’s not something I would speak about because whenever you speak about it only gets yourself into hot water,” he told The Daily Beast when questioned about it.

McConnachie’s main beliefs appeared to be supporting Trump for “standing up very strongly for the principle of borders,” while also campaigning vociferously against Scottish independence. Asked why he supports a rigid border system between Mexico and the U.S. but argues so strongly against it between England and Scotland, his only attempt at an explanation was that the Scottish border “only exists in the imagination.”

During a press conference with May later Tuesday, Trump wrongly claimed there were “thousands of people” on the streets cheering him on both days of his visit so far and that he didn’t see any protesters. He does have supporters, but from Tuesday afternoon’s evidence they appeared to be nothing more than a handful of oddballs with extreme views.

Trump could be confused or, more likely, willfully wrong. But if he wants to see the evidence for himself he need only pop outside, with an umbrella."
US makes hurdles even higher for visa applicants,https://www.cnn.com,['Rafia Zakaria'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/opinions/visa-applications-social-media-requirements-zakaria/index.html,"Rafia Zakaria is the author of ""The Upstairs Wife: An Intimate History of Pakistan"" (Beacon 2015) and ""Veil"" (Bloomsbury 2017).

(CNN) In the latest in the slew of controversial and restrictive immigration provisions put in place by the Trump administration, the US State Department announced this week that nonimmigrant visa forms had been updated to require ""most"" visa applicants to provide information about ""their social media handles along with other information"" going back five years. In a diffident statement to The New York Times, the State Department played down the potential impact of the new requirement, saying: ""We already request certain contact information, travel history, family member information, and previous addresses from all visa applicants."" The new screening requirements, officials added, were put in place to ""protect US citizens.""

Rafia Zakaria

Both premises, that the demand for social media information is not more intrusive than other existing provisions and that it is required to protect American citizens, are questionable at best.

When applicants fill out a visa application for a nonimmigrant visa to the United States, one of the primary things they must provide is evidence that they do not intend to overstay their visas. Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USCS 1184(b)) states : ""Every alien ... shall be presumed to be an immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer, at the time of application for admission, that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant status."" In plain language, this means that in the process of applying for a visa, the presumption is against the applicant, who must prove to the satisfaction of the consular officer that he or she will not come to the United States and never leave.

Sharing five years of social media posts, likes, retweets and other information is likely to make it even harder for nonimmigrant visa applicants to satisfy the requirements. When considered against the legal requirements, these measures seem designed to provide consular officers more reasons to reject those applying for nonimmigrant visas. This is a particular problem, given the fact that the consular officer has total discretion and those whose applications are denied cannot appeal the decision

Social media posts from three or four or five years ago, ones that say something like, ""I wish I could get away from here,"" or, ""I wish I lived in New York,"" could be construed as evidence of the intent to stay, as could any number of the ambiguous or reactive statements that people routinely make on social media platforms.

EPA exempts farms from reporting pollution tied to animal waste,https://thehill.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447151-epa-exempts-farms-from-reporting-pollution-tied-to-animal-waste,"A new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would lift requirements for major farms to report the pollution they emit through animal waste.

The rule, released late Tuesday, spurred criticism from environmental groups who say nearby communities would no longer have access to information about harmful gasses being released into the air.

ADVERTISEMENT

Across many industrial farms in the U.S., animal waste is collected and stored in open pits often called lagoons. As the manure decomposes it emits

ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which are linked

to respiratory issues and other health problems.

People who live near farms have long complained of the odor, but they also attribute asthma, headaches, nausea and a stinging sensation in their lungs to farm pollution.

Farms have called the reporting requirements onerous.

“I appreciate this administration’s deregulatory approach toward the American farmer and rancher, who need a reprieve from government red tape,” Sen. Pat Roberts Charles (Pat) Patrick RobertsEPA exempts farms from reporting pollution tied to animal waste EPA exempts farms from reporting pollution tied to animal waste Conservatives spark threat of bloody GOP primaries MORE (R-Kan.) said in a statement lauding the rule.

The rule gives farms and the EPA the latest win in what has been a long battle between the agency, Congress and environmental groups to determine to what extent large farms must report pollution that could be hazardous to human health.

Large farms have been required to report pollution tied to animal waste since the 1980s, but the George W. Bush Administration first tried to carve out an exception in 2008. Environmental groups sued and won the resulting court battle nearly a decade later in 2017. Trump’s EPA then issued a guidance exempting farms from reporting pollution tied to animal waste, which spurred more lawsuits.

Carrie Apfel, an Earthjustice attorney who helped sued over the guidance, said the group will also sue over the new rule.

She said Congress made clear under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act that this information must be passed to state and local governments so that emergency responders and neighbors know how to respond to nearby pollution.

A lot of the health impacts from farms disproportionately impact low income and communities of color, she said. People with chronic health problems are seeking medical care from doctors who are asking what they might be exposed to — information they currently can only get from the reports.

EPA has maintained that Congress intended to remove state-level reporting requirements for farm waste when it got rid of the federal ones -- something environmental groups dispute.

The agency told The Hill on Wednesday that it received comments from farmers that reporting requirements for air emissions from animal waste would be confusing and unnecessary.

Farm groups issued statements hailing the new rule.

“Routine emissions from agricultural operations are not a threat to local communities,” the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said in a statement. “We are glad to see EPA fully implement the law by providing relief from burdensome state and local reporting requirements.”

Does VA have a secret wait list for health care? Key members of Congress want to know.,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'The Washington Post', 'Chris Gray', 'Wei-Huan Chen', 'Staff Writer', 'Samantha Ketterer', 'Brian T. Smith', 'Cary Darling']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Does-VA-have-a-secret-wait-list-for-health-care-13938065.php,"WASHINGTON - Key members of Congress want the Trump administration to address charges of a ""secret"" Veterans Affairs wait list that has a higher number of patients seeking medical care than information publicly available.

Allegations about significantly different data regarding veterans awaiting treatment on internal and public records were made by Jereme P. Whiteman, VA's national director of clinic practice management, in a Washington Post Federal Insider column published online Monday.

The article reported on a letter he sent to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie last week that said, ""In September last year I discovered a secret VA wait list. I disclosed this wait list within my VHA chain of command. Since that date I have been retaliated against by officials within my chain of command. Furthermore, the agency has taken steps to conceal this wait list from the public.""

The monthly number of veterans awaiting care on the internal list is about three times greater than the numbers on the public list.

A VA spokesman said Whiteman's allegations are false. ""VA's electronic wait list (EWL) has two components - one administrative and one clinical,"" said Curt Cashour, the department's press secretary.

The clinical number is public and shows the number of veterans waiting for medical care. ""The administrative component of the EWL has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment,"" he added, ""and tracks routine actions, such as facility and provider transfer requests.""

Top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans' affairs committees are not satisfied with that response.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Wilkie, Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., chairman of the House committee, and Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the Senate panel, said Cashour's explanation ""is, at best, confusing.""

""We, therefore, ask VA to provide - by the end of this week - a more thorough explanation for the existence of two sets of reports on wait time for veterans' health care. In fulfilling this request, VA should provide the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs with the reports described by the article and the appropriate VA officials should make themselves available for a briefing to the Committees.""

A statement from the office of Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee, the top Republican on the House panel, said, ""Dr. Roe has asked VA about these allegations and will continue looking into them.""

Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations, said the ""allegations of a secret internal wait list for veterans - that exceeds the public wait list by three-fold - are deeply disturbing. . . . Congress must get to the bottom of these claims by verifying the accuracy of these internal VA documents and ensuring transparency and accountability for our nation's veterans and the American people.""

Connolly praised whistleblowers and said they ""must be protected"" against reprisals by managers. In addition to reporting his charges about the dual wait lists with VA's Office of the Medical Inspector and the department's Office of Inspector General, Whiteman has filed retaliation complaints with the VA whistleblower protection office and the Office of Special Counsel, which protects whistleblowers across the government.

Inspector General Michael Missal said his office received Whiteman's information and is considering the next steps for his office.

In one example of retaliation, Whiteman said he led a team that implemented a text messaging system to remind patients of their appointments. It cut the number of missed sessions and saved the department millions of dollars. Although he was the team leader, he was the only member who did not get a performance award for the project.

Whiteman's allegations come five years after a national uproar over phony wait lists rocked the VA. That scandal pushed then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki from office and led to a series of agency reforms. Robert McDonald, who followed Shinseki in office, apologized to veterans in September 2014 congressional testimony and promised to rebuild trust.

He said the VA increased primary care staffing, developed an automated system for tracking new patients and contacted 266,000 veterans ""to get them off wait lists and into clinics.""

On Tuesday, Cashour said the VA now is ""seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than before."" According to Cashour:

- VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments in fiscal 2018, 623,000 more than the previous year.

- All VA health care facilities now provide same-day services in primary and mental health.

- VA is posting online wait times for every one of its medical centers across the country, and they are updated weekly.

- Regularly updated access data are available online for all VA medical centers and community-based outpatient clinics.

""Veterans are more satisfied with wait times,"" Cashour said, ""than they have been previously."""
EPA chief attacks the media in speech to agency science advisers,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-wheeler-tells-agency-science-advisors-not-to-believe-the-media-a9d8587fc5f5/,"The head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Andrew Wheeler, chose to go “off script” Wednesday morning when he warned the agency’s Science Advisory Board (SAB) against trusting the media.

“I caution you to be careful what you read in the media,” Wheeler said, concluding his remarks to the public meeting — the first time the SAB has meet in a year.

Wheeler was specifically referring to a tweet by Yahoo News journalist Alexander Nazaryan on Monday which quoted Wheeler telling the National Press Club, “‘The media does a disservice to the American public’ by reporting on global warming, says EPA head Andrew Wheeler. Wants more positive coverage.”

And indeed, on Monday, Wheeler did take time to list five things he believes the press “consistently gets wrong” — this included reporting that the environment is getting worse. Instead, the press should be talking more about how it’s been getting better since the 1970s, Wheeler argued.

Nazaryan’s tweet was quickly circulated around the internet, including by a New York Times journalist and the Sierra Club. In response, the EPA sent out a press release stating that the tweet was “misleading,” and accused the Yahoo journalist of choosing to “deliberately spread false information on Twitter.”

This argument was reiterated on Wednesday by Wheeler, who said the fact that the Sierra Club started promoting the tweet made him wonder whether the media and environmental groups were “colluding” for fundraising purposes.

Under the Trump administration, however, the EPA has actively worked to rollback environmental protections, often in line with fossil fuel or other industry interests. Most recently this includes challenging the underlying risk calculations that support clean air rules.

The media has played a critical role in reporting on, and investigating, not just these various policy decisions but also potential ethics controversies and conflicts of interest plaguing the agency.

But Wheeler urged scientists not to trust the media and come to him or other top EPA officials if they had questions or concerns.

This isn’t the first time that the Trump administration’s EPA has “fact-checked” the media or been antagonistic toward reporters. Last year, reporters from major news outlets, including the Associated Press and CNN, were banned from attending a summit on harmful chemicals; one journalist was even forcibly removed by security.

And in September 2017, the EPA’s press office sent out a press release titled “EPA Response To The AP’s Misleading Story,” which accused AP reporter Michael Biesecker of writing an “incredibly misleading story” about Superfund sites and Hurricane Harvey. (The EPA did not, however, contradict any facts in Biesecker’s story.)

Meanwhile, the EPA has used articles written by climate science deniers, including the Heartland Institute and the Daily Caller, as their own press releases rather than citing expert staff members — a move which the National Association of Science Writers labeled “unprofessional” and “unethical.”

All of this is part of the larger confrontational relationship with the press promoted by President Donald Trump, who consistently calls media “fake news” and has repeatedly encouraged violence against the media."

That's essentially the Justice Department's message to Carnival Corporation, which just got busted, again, for its ships polluting the waters they sail in, and for trying to cover it all up, the New York Times reports. The company's Princess Cruises had already been convicted and sentenced in April 2017 on felony charges related to one of its ships dumping oil-contaminated waste, and staff then trying to conceal those actions, per a DOJ statement. For those infractions, Princess had to pony up $40 million and was placed on ""environmental probation."" Now an additional $20 million penalty against Carnival and Princess has been tacked on, with six probation violations noted, including dumping plastic into Bahamian waters from the Carnival Elation.

Other violations cited in the court filing Monday include falsifying environmental training records on two cruise ships, as well as interfering with court-supervised inspections. ""A corporation is responsible to its shareholders and board of directors to be profitable, but not by breaking the law and destroying the very environment in which it navigates for profit,"" says US Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan for the Southern District of Florida. ""Carnival's failure to comply with the terms of its probation and later, its attempt to drown its deceit goes against the fiber of corporate compliance."" Per the Miami Herald, via the Times, Carnival's CEO, Arnold Donald, said at a Monday hearing, ""I do take responsibility for the problems we have. I am extremely disappointed that we've had them."" He pledged that the company is ""fully committed"" to resolving these issues. (Read more Carnival Cruise Lines stories.)

"Energy Department Plans to Reclassify High-Level Toxic Waste as Low-Level, Angering Environmental Advocates",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Audrey Mcnamara'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/energy-department-plans-to-reclassify-high-level-toxic-waste-as-low-level-angering-environmental-advocates,"The Trump administration’s Department of Energy on Wednesday announced plans to reclassify dangerous, high-level radioactive waste as low-level in a move that has sparked alarm among environmental advocates. The plan would shift authority over toxic waste disposal to the federal government, making it easier to transfer the high-level radioactive waste to new sites. The change would effect more than 100 million gallons of high-level waste currently stored in South Carolina, Washington, and Idaho, allowing it to be shipped to low-level nuclear waste disposal sites in the deserts of Utah and Texas, according to the National Resource Defense Council. The DOE says the move would also save $40 billion in cleanup costs. The reclassification would only occur after a thorough analysis and environmental studies, according to the DOE.

The change was immediately criticized by the NRDC, as well as some government officials in the affected states. Washington Governor Jay Inslee (D) and Attorney General Bob Ferguson released a statement condemning the administration’s actions. “The Trump Administration is showing disdain and disregard for state authority with these actions,” the statement read. “The Trump administration is moving to fundamentally alter more than 50 years of national consensus on how the most toxic and radioactive waste in the world is managed and ultimately disposed of,” said Geoff Fettus, a senior attorney at NRDC, in a statement. “No matter what they call it, this waste needs a permanent, well-protected disposal option to guard it for generations to come.”"
Why Trump's Vietnam comments matter on D-Day,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/d-day-anniversary-us-presidents-service/index.html,"(CNN) On the 75th anniversary of a defining battle of the defining war of human history so far, it's clear that military service has never been less important to American voters.

Six US presidents served overseas during World War II, but none since President George H.W. Bush have gone abroad, if they served at all. At this point, we might get a President who served in Afghanistan or Iraq -- that's South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard or Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton -- but it's almost certain the US will never have a commander in chief who served in Vietnam.

It has had three, including Trump, who found a way around the draft. That's old news, but it doesn't mean Trump won't still have to answer questions about it, as he did in Wednesday's interview with the British journalist Piers Morgan, who asked him if he would have liked to have served.

Trump ""was never a fan"" of Vietnam

The interview was conducted in the underground bunker where Winston Churchill led the British government during the Blitz and World War II.

""Do you wish you'd been able to serve? Would you have liked to serve your country?"" Morgan asked.

Trump replied by questioning Vietnam, mirroring some of the anti-war sentiment of the '60s and '70s.

""Well I was never a fan of that war. I'll be honest with you. I thought it was a terrible war. I thought it was very far away. Nobody ever -- you're talking about Vietnam at that time and nobody ever heard of the country,"" Trump said, adding the non sequitur that, today, the government of Vietnam has been successful negotiating in global trade.

He went on to say that he wasn't active in protesting the war as a young man, but he didn't think the US should ever have taken part.

""But, uh, nobody heard of Vietnam and then say well what are we doing. So many people dying. So I was never a fan of -- this isn't like I'm fighting against Nazi Germany. I'm fighting -- we're fighting against Hitler. And I was like a lot of people. Now I wasn't out in the streets marching. I wasn't saying, you know, I'm going to move to Canada, which a lot of people did. But no, I was not a fan of that war. That war was not something that we should have been involved in.""

Senator calls Trump a coward

Trump's comments drew a stinging rebuke from Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the Illinois Democrat and veteran who lost her legs in a helicopter accident while deployed to Iraq.

Appearing on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" Wednesday night, she called Trump a coward.

""I don't know anyone who has served in uniform, especially in combat, who would say they are a fan of war,"" she said. ""In fact, I opposed the Iraq war, but volunteered to go when my unit was deployed.""

#CadetBoneSpurs: no one cares whether you were a ""fan"" of the Vietnam War. No one believes you were medically unfit to serve.

Making up for lack of service with spending

Trump said he's making up for his lack of military service by being President.

""Would you have liked to have served generally - perhaps in another (way)?"" Morgan asked.

""I would not have minded that at all. I would have been honored. But I think I make up for it now. I mean look, $700 billion I gave last year and then this year $716 billion and I think I'm making up for it rapidly because we are rebuilding our military at a level that it's never seen before.""

This deserves a quick fact check. Trump did not personally give the military $700 billion or $716 billion. Congress did, when it passed appropriations bills last year. Trump signed them, and it is his administration's responsibility to now spend the money.

But it says something about how he views his role as President and the dismissive way he's treated Congress and its responsibilities, that he takes personal credit for spending taxpayer money.

It's also more than a bit awkward for him to argue that the military will be built up to a level it's never seen before under him when he's preparing to commemorate D-Day, when the entire country was mobilized in the war effort. More than 16 million Americans served in World War II from a US population of around 140 million in 1940. It was a total war, even for the US, which was far from any of the front lines.

The portion of the population that served in World War II is much larger than the portion that served during Vietnam, when more than 8.7 million Americans were in the military from a population of 203 million in 1970.

Despite the conflict in Afghanistan lasting longer than any in US history, fewer and fewer Americans have served in the military. The VA does not list a total number of service members during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but there are currently about 1.3 million people in the military, coming from a population of close to 341 million, according to Census projections

6 Presidents served overseas in World War II

In the years after World War II, military service was almost a prerequisite for politicians and presidents for generations during and after World War II. Dwight Eisenhower, who was Supreme Allied Commander during World War II and gave the order for D-Day 75 years ago, went on to serve two terms as President. He ended hostilities in the Korean War shortly after taking office.

No more.

No presidents with Vietnam service

Three of the last four US presidents -- Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Trump -- had no military service at all. George W. Bush was a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard -- his way around Vietnam.

Two other politicians who were of military age during Vietnam are running against Trump as Democrats. They also deferred military service or sought to be exempt. All three are in their 70s, which makes it likely this is the last presidential election in which a Vietnam-era politician will be featured.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent who is running for President as a Democrat, applied to be a conscientious objector during Vietnam . The application was ultimately rejected, but he was too old to be drafted at that point. In 2015, he said during a CNN debate that he's no longer a pacifist.

Two other politicians who came of age during Vietnam are running in the Democratic primary. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee received a student deferment and had a high draft number for his birth year, as did former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper

Plenty of Vietnam veterans have sought the White House, including medal of honor winner Bob Kerrey, who did not get very far. Several Vietnam veterans got their party's nomination, including Al Gore, John Kerry and John McCain.

Since the election of Bill Clinton over decorated former military pilot and wartime president George H.W. Bush in 1992, American voters have shown that avoiding service during Vietnam is not a dealbreaker.

A new generation of warrior politicians

A real question in 2020 is whether it's a desirable plus. There has been no draft since Vietnam, and there have been many fewer Americans serving in the military.

But there are multiple younger presidential aspirants who volunteered for the military and served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Gabbard has made her military service a centerpiece of her campaign and cites it as the impetus for her platform of disentangling the US from foreign conflicts.

Global Opinions writer

Even after spending a year and a half in prison in Tehran, I knew that if I wanted to go on writing about Iran, I would be a target for plenty of public attacks despite the abuse I had suffered at the hands of the Islamic Republic. And so it has been.

But I never imagined the U.S. State Department would be funding my attackers.

Last week, several astute Iran watchers drew attention to a series of inflammatory tweets associated with the Iran Disinformation Project, a State Department-funded initiative that its website claims “brings to light disinformation emanating from the Islamic Republic of Iran via official rhetoric, state propaganda outlets, social media manipulation and more.”

So the @StateDept uses taxpayer money to fund online attacks on @HRW because the organization is researching the human cost of US sanctions in #Iran.



Is this even legal? https://t.co/PGVuizRq93 — Negar Mortazavi (@NegarMortazavi) May 30, 2019

What other @StateDept funded organizations claiming to promote democracy in #Iran are using taxpayer money to harass, intimidate, threaten and slander American journalists & academics?

Follow the money folks. — Farnaz Fassihi (@farnazfassihi) May 31, 2019

On Friday, in response to the complaints, the State Department suspended the initiative’s funding “until the implementer takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work,” a department official said.

One of the “steps” thus far has been to delete many of the tweets in question. But that is hardly sufficient.

Ironically, the Iran Disinformation Project was funded by the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which was begun to combat online extremism and propaganda.

The targets of the tweets included think-tank analysts, human rights activists and journalists (including me). The common thread is that we are all perceived by regime change proponents and supporters of the Trump administration’s so-called maximum pressure policy to be soft on Iran because we are critical of crushing economic sanctions and the threat of the use of military force against it.

For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran’s “mouthpieces,” “apologists,” “collaborators,” and “lobbyists” in the West.

I won’t speak for others who have been attacked, and my own views are irrelevant to this situation. From what I can see, though, we all appear to share the view that Iran should be secular and democratic. The main difference between us and those spreading these falsehoods against us is how we envision that change in Iranian politics coming about.

As a matter of principle, I try to avoid impeding anyone else’s right to free expression — even when it’s used to attack me. If a claim against me is demonstrably false, I will state it clearly and openly. Yet, I believe it’s important to allow others — even faceless ones hiding behind anonymous social media accounts — the opportunity to criticize me, my work and my credentials. It’s part of what you sign up for when you take this job.

I also openly acknowledge that others who have been abused by Iran (such as me) have the right to hold whatever political positions they choose and the right to defend and promote them passionately. Yes, even if it means they advocate war or sanctions directed at the people of that country. They have their views and I have mine.

Slander and libel are a different story, however, and @IranDisinfo may have crossed the line.

What Bahman Kalbasi, one of the #IranDisinfo mouthpieces in @BBC doesn't tell you, is that the number of Jews in #Iran before the Islamic Revolution was around 100K. After the mass executions, assassinations, and confiscation of properties, now the number is less than 10K. https://t.co/rfhb6kwFk1 — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) May 28, 2019

In the past 16 months, thousands of protestors have been arrested in #Iran, and most are anonymous. @sepehrifar of @hrw, a supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime, instead of documenting+proving these human rights violations, is working hard to prove @JZarif's claims. https://t.co/CvWzqULihT — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) April 25, 2019

So we’re faced with the irony that an initiative aimed at combating Tehran’s disinformation campaigns is resorting to disinformation campaigns of its own, using taxpayer funds to spread lies about U.S. citizens. We need programs that fight the spread of falsehoods and propaganda, but such efforts shouldn’t combat lies with other lies — and certainly not with public funding.

This is just one more small incident in the long moment of reckoning our democracy is facing. It will pass quickly, but it’s an important stress test.

How can individuals who are not willing to adhere to the norms of American civil society be entrusted with resources to promote civil society in other countries?

The State Department can easily fix the problem. It needs to perform a transparent assessment of who received the funding and why. Once the facts are clear, the grant should be terminated.

Transparency and accountability are fundamental to the rule of law. Anyone who claims otherwise cannot be entrusted with taxpayer money to promote American ideals — at home or abroad.

At the heart of the matter lies a fundamental question: Do we support our long-cherished ideals of democratic fair play or the “by any means necessary” approach that is becoming more prevalent in the current political climate?

Put personal politics aside for a moment and look back through history. Do peddlers of disinformation contribute or detract from our health as a society? The answer is obvious, and the State Department should take a clear stance on the side of honest and responsible discourse.

If the State Department declines to address the issue, Congress should investigate.

"Democrats grill FBI, DHS officials on white supremacy threat",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-grill-trump-administration-officials-white-supremacy-threat/story?id=63478001,"House Democrats grilled officials from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security in a Tuesday hearing focused on how the Trump administration is addressing the growing threat of violent white supremacist extremists.

The House Oversight subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties hearing, titled 'Confronting White Supremacy: Adequacy of the Federal Response,' was the latest effort by Democrats to spotlight ways they say the Trump administration has systematically cut back on resources used to address threats from domestic extremists even as the FBI has reported a 30-40% rise in domestic terrorism cases just since October.

Federal officials in attendance at Tuesday's hearing included FBI Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Michael McGarrity, FBI Deputy Assistant Director for Criminal Investigations Calvin Shivers and DHS Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Neumann.

Committee chairman Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., opened the hearing by raising issue with the amount of resources he says the FBI devotes towards investigating cases of international terrorism versus domestic terrorism.

Citing figures from the Anti-Defamation League, Raskin noted that from 2009-2018, far-right extremism was responsible for 73% of extremist murders, while international terrorism was responsible for 23% of terrorism deaths.

""The FBI has testified the bureau allocates its resources almost exactly backwards than the problem would suggest,"" Raskin said. ""Devoting 80% of field agents to stopping international terrorism including Islamic extremism and only 20% to stopping domestic terrorism including far right and white supremacist extremism.""

But McGarrity pointed to the success that FBI agents have so far had in disrupting potential domestic attacks in the past several months, and said successful arrests prior to domestic attacks actually outnumbered those arrested prior to attacks in international terror cases.

""In fiscal year 2018 FBI (Joint Terrorism Task Forces) across the country proactively arrested approximately 115 subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations before they could mobilize into violence,"" McGarrity said. ""So far (since Oct. 1 of last year), our JTTFs have disrupted approximately 66 subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations by arrest.""

Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, D-Fla., pressed Neumann on a report that the department recently disbanded and slashed funding for a section of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, which focused on producing reports on domestic terrorism and which Democrats warn could result in a reduction of available data on threats from white supremacist groups.

Neumann countered that the funding dedicated to the department was only inflated due to millions in grant funding committed during the Obama administration, but later in the hearing gave a candid assessment regarding DHS' overall counterterrorism strategy, saying that the administration is actively working to find ways to improve its prevention strategy.

""We know we're not doing enough,"" Neumann said. ""Things haven't been institutionalized. In order for government to work, we have to institutionalize it, you either need to authorize it through Congress or you need to get it in executive order or national security presidential memoranda.""

Following the terror attack on several mosques in New Zealand in March carried out by an alleged white supremacist, President Donald Trump told reporters he didn't see white nationalism as a rising threat to the U.S.

The hearing followed a briefing just two weeks earlier from a senior FBI counterterrorism official who gave sobering statistics to reporters regarding the domestic threat environment.

The official revealed the FBI currently has a total of just under 5,000 open terrorism cases, including 850 domestic terror-related cases, and acknowledged that far more Americans have been killed in domestic terror attacks than Islamic terror attacks since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

According to the official, a significant issue that the bureau faces is that the federal criminal code has made it more challenging to bring charges against domestic terror suspects than in cases involving international terrorism or foreign terrorist organizations.

That's because, according to the FBI Agents Association, ""domestic terrorism"" itself is not a federal crime.

""Domestic terrorism is about political violence,"" Tom O'Connor, the president of the FBI Agents Association said in a statement to ABC News. ""Congress must do everything in its power to provide law enforcement with the tools needed to combat this threat to our country.""

Investigators often are forced to rely on other federal crimes to charge suspects with or rely on state or local laws, such as in the recent case of Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson, who despite being accused in court of plotting mass murder ""on a scale rarely seen in this country,"" is currently facing only gun and drug charges from U.S. attorneys in Maryland.

And while then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions initially described the Charlottesville, Virginia attack by James Fields Jr., which resulted in the death of Heather Heyer, as ""the definition of domestic terrorism,"" Fields in March pleaded guilty to 29 counts of violating federal hate crime law.

The issue surfaced in a contentious exchange between Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and McGarrity, where McGarrity was pressed on why the 2015 Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, and last year's Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh were treated as ""hate crime incidents"" rather than acts of domestic terrorism.

""That's not correct,"" McGarrity said, pointing out that while the attacks are considered instances of domestic terrorism by the Department of Justice, ""there's no domestic terrorism charge.""

In an emotional exchange on the subject later in the hearing, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-MI, read a death threat letter sent to her and fellow Muslim congresswoman Rep. Ilhan Omar that cited the New Zealand mosque attacks and remarked, ""the only good Muslim is a dead one.""

""How is that not enough to fall under domestic terrorism?"" Tlaib said through tears. ""How come we don't have enough tools right now to pull these people in?""

McGarrity expressed sympathy for Tlaib and urged her to bring her concerns directly to the Department of Justice, after earlier noting he personally would welcome Congress passing a law that makes domestic terrorism a federal crime.

“I will say as a former prosecutor and as a former investigator, I want every tool in the tool box,” McGarrity said."
Opioid drugmaker Insys Chairman Steven Meyer quits after settlement with DoJ,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-insys-moves/opioid-drugmaker-insys-chairman-steven-meyer-quits-after-settlement-with-doj-idUSKCN1T71EO,"(Reuters) - Insys Therapeutics Inc said on Thursday Chairman Steven Meyer and board member Pierre Lapalme will resign, a day after the opioid drugmaker agreed to settle a kickback probe with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ).

Meyer and Lapalme, on Sunday, notified the company of their decision to resign, effective upon the execution of the DoJ agreement, the company said.

Insys has agreed to pay $225 million and an operating unit of the company will plead guilty to fraud relating to kickbacks to doctors for prescribing highly addictive opioid, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Wednesday.

The settlement followed the May 2 conviction by a federal jury in Boston of five former Insys executives, including founder and former billionaire John Kapoor, of racketeering charges for contributing to the nation’s opioid epidemic.

The decision to resign from the board is not due to any disagreements relating to the company’s operations, policies or practices, Insys said.

Meyer has served as the chairman of Insys since 2017, while Lapalme has been a member of the board since 2011."

USDA calls Indiana farm workers' actions 'unacceptable',https://www.theindychannel.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.theindychannel.com/news/call-6-investigators/usda-calls-indiana-farm-workers-actions-unacceptable,"FAIR OAKS, Ind. — The Indiana State Board of Animal Health is working with law enforcement concerning allegations of animal abuse and mistreatment at Fair Oaks Farms in northwest Indiana.

Indiana State Veterinarian Bret D. Marsh has directed the Board of Animal Health (BOAH) staff to collaborate with local law enforcement regarding any appropriate next steps they may take, said spokeswoman Denise Derrer.

The Newton County Sheriff's Office has opened an investigation after the Animal Recovery Mission, a Florida-based animal welfare group, released undercover footage gathered between August and November 2018 after one of their investigators was hired as a calf care employee at the Fair Oaks Farms Prairies Edge North Barn.

The undercover video captured employees throwing calves in and out of their huts, calves kicked and slammed to the ground, a worker sitting on top of a calf.

The state was not made aware of the video or abuse allegations until June 4, said Derrer.

“No representative of ARM has contacted BOAH to report their concerns and findings or share video images they gathered,” said Derrer. “After watching the video, BOAH officials reviewed compliance records and complaint logs for Fair Oaks Farms. No reports of animal abuse or neglect have been filed with the agency since the farms’ founding in the mid-1990s.”

RTV6 also checked with the United States Department of Agriculture, which deferred to Indiana and local agencies.

“The actions depicted on the Animal Recovery Mission video are unacceptable,” read a USDA statement to RTV6. “USDA has full confidence that Indiana state and local authorities will investigate this particular case and take appropriate action.”

The USDA statement said Fair Oaks Farms is not a federally inspected slaughter facility, and therefore is not within USDA’s regulatory authority.

“However, any allegations of animal cruelty must be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated by the proper authorities to ensure all animals are treated with care and dignity,” read the USDA statement.

USDA's authority to regulate the treatment of animals includes the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act and the Animal Welfare Act. The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act protects animals when they are presented for slaughter at federally inspected establishments, according to the agency.

The Animal Welfare Act allows the USDA to ensure the proper care of live animals when used in biomedical research, testing, and exhibition.

“Policies for humane handling of animals consist of a combined effort of federal, state, and local authorities, as well as private industry,” read the statement. “When animals fall within our authorities, USDA acts to prevent animal cruelty such as this. The animals depicted in this video do not fall within our authority.”

PREVIOUS STORY | Undercover video shows animal cruelty at Fair Oaks Farms, founder admits

Fair Oaks Farms founder Mike McCloskey provided the following statement to RTV6 Tuesday in which he called the employees’ actions “despicable.”

“This morning I was made aware of an animal abuse video that the group Animal Recovery Mission (ARM) produced and has released to the public and the press. Most of the footage for this video was captured on one of the dairies that belongs to Fair Oaks Farms. While we were made aware a couple months ago of the fact that ARM had gone undercover at Fair Oaks Farms, and had proactively made a statement ( link ), we had no idea what kind of footage had been captured or what – if any – abuse had occurred.

It is with great disappointment to find, after closely reviewing the released ARM video, that there were five individuals committing multiple instances of animal cruelty and despicable judgement. Of the five, four were our employees and one was a 3rd party truck driver who was picking up calves. Of the four who were our employees, three had already been terminated prior to us being made aware months ago of the undercover ARM operation, as they were identified by their co-workers as being abusive of our animals and reported to management. So, in this instance our policy of cow care training - “see something, say something” - worked. After reviewing the video frame-by-frame, those three employees are responsible for the overwhelming majority of offenses seen in this video.

Unfortunately, the fourth employee’s animal abuse was not caught at that same time. Although he underwent another training session in animal care when we discovered there was an undercover ARM operation on our farm, after viewing the extent of his animal abuse, he is being terminated today.

As to the individual who worked for the transportation company, today, we will notify the company that he works for and he will not be allowed on our farms again. It is our position that any companies that come in contact with transportation of our animals, should be well-versed in and adhere to our industry’s animal welfare practices which can be found in FARM ( https://nationaldairyfarm.com [nationaldairyfarm.com ).

Months ago, when I first learned of the undercover activity, I requested a 3rd party review and we went through a re-training process throughout the dairies. While the review came back favorable, I am not letting my guard down and will institute more thorough monitoring and training so that this abuse can never happen again. This video and any future videos will be immediately handed over to the authorities for review and potential prosecution.

Regardless, I am disgusted by and take full responsibility for the actions seen in the footage, as it goes against everything that we stand for in regards to responsible cow care and comfort. The employees featured in the video exercised a complete and total disregard for the documented training that all employees go through to ensure the comfort, safety and well-being of our animals.

It is a shock and an eye-opener for us to discover that under our watch, we had employees who showed disregard for our animals, our processes and for the rule of law. This ARM video shines a light on an area that – despite our thorough training, employee onboarding procedures and overall commitment to animal welfare – needs improvement. However, as I have stated before, the fact that ARM takes months before notifying owners or authorities regarding on-going animal abuse is concerning. I have personally reached out to ARM’s founder, Richard Kudo, to discuss a more symbiotic relationship but he has yet to reach back.

A full investigation of all aspects of the video is underway, during and after which disciplinary action will be taken, including termination and criminal prosecution, of any and all employees and managers who have violated either our animal care practices or the law or both.

The statement that we grow and sell drugs on our farms is false. The plants featured in the video are an invasive perennial species that is rampant on farms all over the Midwest. With that said, I am disappointed to learn of potential drug use on our properties. Months ago, the individual seen smoking by the barn and doing drugs in a truck was turned in by his co-workers to one of our managers. That manager notified local law enforcement about the drug use and, accordingly, a police report is on file.

It is with a heavy heart that I prepare this statement today. As a veterinarian whose life and work is dedicated to the care, comfort and safety of all animals, this has affected me deeply. I am disappointed for not being aware of this kind of awful treatment occurring and I take full responsibility for what has happened. I also take full responsibility to correct and ensure that every employee understands, embraces and practices the core values on which our organization stands.

I am and will continue to be deeply involved in the resolution of this matter, down to every one of our employees, so that I can guarantee that these actions never again occur on any of our farms.”

The Newton County sheriff said his office has requested the names and identifiers of those terminated for animal cruelty by Fair Oaks Dairy Farms.

Barr promised to convene civil rights leaders to discuss police reform efforts.

Barr said that he would convene a meeting of civil rights leaders to discuss a Justice Department directive restricting the use of consent decrees to force reforms at troubled police departments. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)

Toward the end of his confirmation hearing, Attorney General William P. Barr was pressed about his predecessor’s controversial directive restricting the Justice Department’s use of court-enforced agreements to push through reforms in troubled police departments.

Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential hopeful, sought a commitment from the attorney general to, within 90 days, meet with civil rights groups concerned with its impact.

“I’m very happy to convene that group. I’m not sure about 90 days. Give me 120,” Barr said with a laugh.

“Okay, that’s fine. That’s the agreement then. Within 120 days,” Harris responded.

[Democrats demand documents on Justice Dept. police reform efforts under Trump]

Barr made the deadline with a little more than a week to spare. On Tuesday, a gathering was set at the Justice Department. But in the end, the meeting turned into a conversation between Barr and just one civil rights leader: Frederick Misilo, president of the Arc, which advocates for people with intellectual disabilities.

Six other groups invited — the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Human Rights Campaign, UnidosUS, the National Fair Housing Alliance and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund — did not attend.

The episode demonstrates how the relationship between the Justice Department and groups that advocate for civil rights has become politically fraught in the Trump administration. In a letter, 11 advocacy groups said Barr had ignored an earlier request they made for a meeting through the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, only to convene a later gathering that “excluded many of the undersigned organizations that have successfully addressed unconstitutional policing practices in communities across the country.”

“To have a conversation about the topic without some of our key partners really would have undermined the meeting, and it would not have been a meeting with the level of integrity and clarity that we wanted to have,” said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP. He said that his group was open to a dialogue with the Justice Department but that the current status of their relationship was “nonexistent.”

A Justice Department official said the groups invited were chosen because they had been vocal about the Justice Department’s use of court-enforced consent decrees to bring about police and other types of reform, and it was “disappointing that these groups didn’t come to the table.”

“The attorney general clearly spent the time to listen to this one president, and if there were more folks, we would have had more perspectives, but they kind of just wanted to play the political games,” the official said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal Justice Department reaction.

The official said Barr is still reviewing the directive at issue: a memo issued by Attorney General Jeff Sessions just before he left the Justice Department in November. The memo restricted the department’s use of consent decrees to impose reforms on local government, requiring that two senior political appointees approve such pacts and mandating that they be limited in time to just three years.

The Obama administration had used such decrees aggressively in response to concerns about police shootings and alleged misconduct, and civil rights advocates feared that their abandonment in the Trump administration would stifle reforms. In the letter to Barr, the civil rights groups said the Sessions directive “undermines the federal government’s most effective tool for ensuring constitutional policing practices by police departments,” and urged Barr to rescind it.

Misilo said he and Barr had “a helpful conversation with regard to the challenges presented with the attorney general’s memo.” His group, he said, is concerned in particular about how it might affect the Justice Department’s actions against local governments that act in ways that hurt people with intellectual disabilities.

Misilo said that the discussion lasted about 40 minutes and that Barr offered no firm commitments “except an openness to take our interests under advisement.”

“We felt that it would be an opportunity to really express our grave concern about the Sessions memo, and having gone through the meeting with the attorney general, we’re grateful for the invitation, and we felt that the meeting was productive,” he said.

Jesselyn McCurdy, deputy director of the ACLU’s Washington Legislative Office, said the ACLU had tentatively accepted the invitation, but withdrew when it determined that the Justice Department had “cherry picked” the participants.

“We appreciate being, I guess, on their radar list to invite us to some of these meetings, but really what’s more important than just the invitation to meetings is their willingness to actually engage and listen to our concerns and our suggestions to address the concerns,” McCurdy said.

Kelly Laco, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that the meeting “centered on the critical role that state and federal partnerships have in ensuring that the fundamental rights of individuals, including disability rights, are protected through quality assurance and compliance on these matters.”

She said Barr was “committed to vigorous enforcement of federal civil rights laws and has directed the Department to continue its diligent work on these matters,” and that the “door remains open to groups who wish to discuss these important civil and constitutional issues.”

Misilo said the Justice Department informed his group in the days before the meeting that theother groups would not be attending, and he responded he would still be there.

“It’s their decision to make,” Misilo said, adding later, “This is an opportunity that we felt we owed to our constituency to participate in that discussion with the attorney general.”

Barr is also expected to meet soon with government and police leaders to discuss the same topic. The official said that the Justice Department is still working through another commitment he made to Harris during his confirmation hearing: turning over a list of consent decrees it has withdrawn from since the Sessions memo."

In addition to words of praise from Republicans and some Democrats, several environmental groups said they plan to endorse Wallace, citing his background and their experience working with him. His work on protecting habitat for the sage-grouse also seems to have won over a number of green groups.

The National Park Conservation Association (NPCA), Ducks Unlimited and the National Wildlife Refuge Association all have or will endorse Wallace. Other groups are staying silent instead of opposing his nomination.

“In NPCA’s experience, Wallace understands the many diverse opinions surrounding national parks and has shown his commitment to inclusive community-based dialogue and solutions,” the association wrote in a letter to senators. “He has been a dedicated participant and leader in public lands and wildlife management and most recently has demonstrated his ability to bring diverse stakeholders together to preserve sage grouse habitat in Wyoming.”

In confirmed, Wallace would be the first assistant secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks since 2011.

Before his career as a lobbyist, Wallace worked for the National Park Service, both as a park ranger right out of college and later as a congressional liaison for NPS during the Reagan administration. He also worked as chief of staff for former Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) and later as the Republican director of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

In both hearings, Wallace stressed his willingness to work in a bipartisan manner and improve the contentious relationship between the government and partners at the state, tribal, and local level who have a strong interest in federal land management.

“Partner is an easy word to say, but a hard word to implement,” he told senators Wednesday. “The federal government always shows up as the alpha, and that’s a model I will work to better equalize.”

Green groups have largely been at odds with Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency since Trump took office, flagging ethical issues among the top brass and bemoaning the number of former lobbyists employed at the agencies.

And not all environmental groups have high praise for Wallace.

“Just when you thought the Trump administration couldn’t possibly fill the swamp with any more lobbyists, they nominate another one whose former employer has business before Interior,"" Chris Saeger, executive director of the Western Values Project, said in a statement. ""Following in ex-mega lobbyist turned-Interior Secretary [David] Bernhardt’s footsteps, Wallace would immediately be in a position to influence decisions that could benefit the special interests he used to work for.”

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee have yet to schedule votes on Wallace's nomination."
Flandreau tribe sues USDA over industrial hemp plan,https://www.ksfy.com,['Ricardo Lewis'],,,,https://www.ksfy.com/content/news/Flandreau-tribe-sues-USDA-over-industrial-hemp-plan-510890311.html,"The Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe was in court Wednesday asking to be granted a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction that would allow the tribe to start growing hemp on their land before establishing United States Department of Agriculture regulations.

The tribe submitted a hemp production plan back in March that they said should have been reviewed within 60 days and now they're arguing that time frame has been exceeded.

At the motions hearing Wednesday, the tribe asked a federal judge to allow them to move forward with the plan while the case continues but the judge won't be issuing an opinion until within the next day.

Production of industrial hemp is a hot commodity that's on the minds of farmers in many states and tribal lands. The Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe is suing the USDA and Secretary Sonny Perdue over the tribe's plan to grow hemp.

""The tribe has submitted a plan to the USDA that meets seven factors that congress put into place to ensure appropriate testing’s in place and things in that nature,"" Tribal Attorney, Seth Pearman said.

The only way the USDA could deny the plan is if it didn't comply with those factors such as a plan to dispose of the plants or procedures to conduct annual inspections.

The 2018 farm bill states, all plans go through the USDA and must be reviewed within 60 days.

""And wouldn't do so until regulations were passed sometime in the fall of 2019 which we believe is a clear violation of the 2018 farm bill,"" Pearman said.

But in court documents the USDA states those intentions to issue regulations in the fall of 2019 was to accommodate the 2020 planting season.

It also says they've announced its commitment to review state and tribal plans within the 60 days but they emphasize that wouldn't go into effect until regulations are effective.

""So what we'll have to do after we receive the opinion is review it and then make a decision based on what actions are next,"" Pearman said.

At the hearing, the attorney representing the USDA said that this is not an emergency and is not an extraordinary situation. They simply can't review plans consistently until some sort of regulations are in place.

The tribe said they've been preparing for this crop for some time now.

""And if we're unable to get into this season we would face potential losses of up to 17 million dollars and in doing so we would have to look at cutting some of those essential programs,"" Pearman said.

He added with the loss of that 17 million dollars it would have a huge impact on the tribe and its members. The USDA said in the court documents it was slowed by the recent government shutdown and that's why they have yet to establish industrial hemp regulations.

The USDA is currently in the process of reviewing and drafting those guidelines and regulations.

Warren calls for replacing Commerce Department in jobs plan,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-commerce-department-in-latest-policy-proposal,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Tuesday called for doing away with the Department of Commerce and several other smaller agencies, and replacing them with a new department responsible for creating new jobs.

Warren, who currently sits in the middle of the pack in a crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders, wrote in a post on Medium that this new department would have “the sole responsibility to create and defend quality, sustainable American job.”

“The new Department — the Department of Economic Development — will replace the Commerce Department, subsume other agencies like the Small Business Administration and the Patent and Trademark Office, and include research and development programs, worker training programs, and export and trade authorities like the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,” Warren wrote.

She added: “The new Department will have a single goal: creating and defending good American jobs.”

2020 DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT BIDEN AT CALIFORNIA CONVENTION

Warren’s new proposal is part of her ""economic patriotism"" agenda – one of a series of ambitious policy proposals that have become a trademark of her campaign – and comes ahead of her first campaign tour of Michigan. The state, which was once a Democratic stronghold, went to President Trump in the 2016 presidential election – largely thanks to Trump’s appeal with blue-collar workers in the state’s manufacturing base.

Warren’s visit to Detroit and Lansing, and her economic proposal, are both aimed squarely at Midwesterners who have watched millions of manufacturing jobs disappear in recent decades.

“My Administration will pursue fundamental, structural changes in our government’s approach to the economy, finally putting American workers and middle-class prosperity ahead of multinational profits and Wall Street bonuses,” she wrote on Medium.

The Trump campaign mocked Warren's call for ""economic patriotism"" as a recycled Obama idea.

But it's also unclear how Warren would turn some of her most costly policies into reality, especially if Democrats don't win back control of the Senate in next year's elections. The last time Congress approved a significant new Cabinet-level department was 2002, when the Department of Homeland Security was created. And the $2 trillion price tag of Warren's clean energy manufacturing plan would prompt plenty of Republican critics.

That plank of her agenda is directly tied to the Green New Deal, a framework for dramatically cutting the nation's dependence on fossil fuels that's championed by rising liberal star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

WARREN THE LATEST 2020 DEMOCRAT TO LAND ON TIME MAGAZINE COVER

As outlined in her Green Manufacturing Plan for America – another policy proposal she released on Tuesday – Warren would pay for her program with proceeds from her proposed new tax on corporate profits and by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies and rolling back some provisions of the GOP's 2017 tax law.

“According to the independent Moody’s analysis of my plan, nearly its entire cost is covered by my Real Corporate Profits Tax — a tax that ensures that the very largest and most profitable American corporations don’t pay zero corporate income tax — ending federal oil and gas subsidies, and closing corporate tax loopholes that promote moving good jobs overseas,” Warren wrote.

Warren is betting that her campaign pledges will power her forward with Midwestern swing voters who are open to deserting Trump. Her clean manufacturing plan comes hours after another Democratic contender, former Vice President Joe Biden, released his own Green New Deal-linked agenda, which would spend $1.7 trillion over 10 years.

Biden is perceived as a threat to Trump in the Midwest, but Michigan Democrats see ample room for Warren to break through in a state that's twice elected women to its highest office. And although Warren burnished her reputation as an advocate for the working class by criticizing the bailout of Wall Street banks while serving as a watchdog of the government's 2008 financial rescue, she spoke more favorably at that time of the agreement that spent billions of dollars to keep U.S. automakers afloat, a position she is sure to highlight in Michigan.

""Wages have not grown, and people look at layoffs being imminent or threatened, not just in the auto industry,"" said former Michigan Democratic Party chairman, Mark Brewer. ""They're looking for somebody on their side, who understands their problems. Why Trump had such appeal in 2016 was that he tapped into that economic anxiety.""

"Charges of Politics in Census Debate Are ‘Smoke and Mirrors,’ Justice Dept. Says",https://www.nytimes.com,['Michael Wines'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/us/census-citizenship-question-hofeller.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department issued a withering rebuke on Monday to assertions that a Republican political operative helped draft the department’s request to place a citizenship question on the 2020 census, a decision whose legality the Supreme Court is likely to decide within weeks.

In a brief filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, the department said flatly that the operative, Thomas B. Hofeller, had no role in its request to the Commerce Department in December 2017 for a citizenship question.

“There is no smoking gun here; only smoke and mirrors,” the department’s brief stated. Some supporting evidence filed by plaintiffs in a lawsuit seeking to block the citizenship question “reads more like the product a conspiracy theorist than a careful legal analysis.”

The department’s filing is the latest counterpunch in a lengthy legal battle between the Trump administration and a host of state and local officials and advocacy groups. Those plaintiffs argue that the question is central to a political scheme by the administration to skew census results to the Republican Party’s benefit by reducing the head count of traditionally Democratic slices of the population like immigrants."
DOJ May Investigate Google Again Over Antitrust Issues,https://www.seroundtable.com,['Barry Schwartz'],,,,https://www.seroundtable.com/doj-google-antitrust-issues-27679.html,"The Wall Street Journal reported (WP link) that the Department of Justice may open up an antitrust probe against Google again.

Let me directly upfront that I know very little about legal issues, little about the DOJ and government politics and law. I know when I watch congressional or senate questioning about a topic I know about, it shows how little our government reps know about the topic.

I know Google won a previous antitrust case years ago. But this case, if it is happening, is unclear:

The exact focus of the Justice Department’s investigation is unclear. The department began work on the matter after brokering an agreement with the government’s other antitrust agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to take the lead on antitrust oversight of Google, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.

The folks at WebmasterWorld are saying some fun things:

We'll have to wait and see what happens. In the past these things have ""started"" and never gone anywhere.

I am sure that ""Alphabet"" anticipated this since a very long time, and is prepared ... so that, at the end nothing will really change happy!

Its about freakin time. Obviously I’m not the only who who’s been writing letters!

Looks like FTC, Justice, and Congress are all taking up investigations. Google (Alphabet, Search, Ad biz, YouTube), Facebook, Amazon ... all are up for investigation(s).

The icing on the cake is Google's restraint of trade - not allowing websites to link to each other. I'll make damn sure the DOJ knows about that little infraction.

Greg Sterling who is way smarter than me wrote it up at Search Engine Land earlier this week. Also Rand Fishkin wrote up his thoughts at Sparktoro. Rand also posted this stream of thoughts on Twitter:

First, the argument/case being made is NOT: ""Google has a monopoly in search and that's wrong/unfair"".

The DOJ (and concerned citizens) are arguing: ""Google used its monopoly in search to give themselves unfair advantages in other businesses"".

/2 — Rand Fishkin (@randfish) June 2, 2019

And now with Google Hotels/Flights, are they treating all travel competitors fairly in search? Does everyone get the same opportunity for visibility (in both paid & organic), or does Google give favored treatment to Alphabet-owned properties? /4 — Rand Fishkin (@randfish) June 2, 2019

These are the types of questions that show use of monopoly power in one business/field to unfairly compete in others. That's where the issues are, and that's where I'll focus my post. If you have Qs, suggested links, examples, etc. I would LOVE help! Thanks all 🙏 /fin — Rand Fishkin (@randfish) June 2, 2019

If there are other parts of Google's behavior you think are clear cut cases of anti-competitive behavior, or unfair use of monopoly power that I should cover, please let me know (esp. if you've got good resources I can check out/cite). Thanks! — Rand Fishkin (@randfish) June 3, 2019

I honestly have no real thoughts on this. When it comes to politics, taxes, and governments - I personally find I rather spend my time working on stuff I can make a real impact with. So I spend the time and energy on other things than that topic. I just have zero interest in these topics - I know, I am weird.

If some law comes out where Google needs to make changes, then I'd cover that and what it means to the SEO community. I think we have some time for that...

DHS inspecting North Carolina election equipment amid fears Russia hacked it during 2016 election,https://thehill.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/447173-dhs-inspecting-north-carolina-election-equipment-amid-fears-russia,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will examine the equipment used in a North Carolina county during the 2016 election that was supplied by a company whose system was later discovered to have been attacked by Russian hackers.

NPR reports that the inspection comes three years after laptops used to check in voters in Durham County malfunctioned on Election Day in 2016. The faulty laptops reportedly told people they had already voted that day, even though that was not the case.

Election officials stopped using the laptops and switched to paper poll books to ensure voters could cast their ballots without further issues.

Florida-based VR Systems, the vendor that supplied the equipment, was discovered in 2017 to be a target of Russian attempts to interfere in U.S. elections, prompting fresh concern over the malfunctioning equipment.

Now, DHS will inspect the equipment as it seeks to better understand the extent of Russia’s interference efforts.

""This support may help to provide a better understanding of previous issues and help to secure the 2020 elections,"" Sara Sendek, a spokesperson for DHS, told NPR.

Ron DeSantis Ronald Dion DeSantisDHS inspecting North Carolina election equipment amid fears Russia hacked it during 2016 election DHS inspecting North Carolina election equipment amid fears Russia hacked it during 2016 election Florida senators back push for federal help with red tide MORE (R) said the FBI notified him that Russians successfully infiltrated two county election systems during the 2016 election.
