Trump's grandiose July 4th plan says everything about his presidency,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/donald-trump-july-4-military-politics-parade/index.html,"(CNN) Donald Trump's attempt to make July Fourth great again is turning into an eloquent metaphor for the excesses and polarization of his presidency.

His choreography for tanks on the National Mall , war plane flyovers, his own televised address and a longer than normal red, white and blue fireworks display means that even Independence Day -- for generations a rare unifying moment -- will be politicized.

Instead of the ""Salute to America"" that he has proclaimed, Trump's critics fear he's really plotting a salute to himself.

His latest grandiose photo op appears to be a reflection of his own vanity, obsession with crowd sizes, craving for the spotlight, penchant for military hardware and his flirtations with authoritarianism.

But from the President's perspective, he's on to a winner. Cries of outrage from Democrats and the media at Trump's hijacking of the July Fourth celebrations will not offend all Americans. For a lot of them, it may be a welcome display of the country's strength.

And by serving as the arbiter of patriotism -- as he did during the controversy over kneeling NFL players -- and as a strong commander-in-chief, Trump is also laying a political trap.

On national TV, he can pose once again as the patriotic and defiant scourge of elites who sneer at the values of heartland Americans -- the strategy he used to win election in 2016 and on which he is banking to claim a second term.

""We're going to have a great Fourth of July in Washington DC,"" Trump said, laying out his plans with almost boyish enthusiasm on Monday. ""It will be like no other, and it is special, and I hope a lot of people come.""

But as Trump has made his presidency an exercise in self-flattery and has rarely striven for national unity, the omens are not looking great for a heartwarming non-partisan evening.

As well as indulging his narcissism, the July Fourth event is highlighting his typical profligacy with public money, questionable ethics, a lack of transparency and a measure of chaos in the last minute organization.

The actual cost of all the extra security -- a flight time for the aircraft used as Air Force One that is expected to buzz the crowd -- has not yet been released by the White House.

""The American people deserve to know how much of their money the president is spending to turn their July 4th celebration into a de facto campaign rally,"" three Democratic lawmakers said in a letter to the Interior Department.

In the post-9/11 era, presidents have generally entertained service members and their families at private events at the White House.

But Republican operatives are also handing out tickets to VIPs and donors as well as general admission entry for Trump's speech in the rarified historic air near the Lincoln Memorial where Martin Luther King Jr. orated his ""dream."" Normally, the spot where Trump's stage stands is one of the best spots to watch the July Fourth fireworks.

White House questions patriotism of critics

As with his plan to change Air Force One's livery , the President is attempting to impose his own definition of patriotism and is using the military as a political backdrop -- a familiar ploy.

""The Pentagon & our great Military Leaders are thrilled to be doing this & showing to the American people, among other things, the strongest and most advanced Military anywhere in the World. Incredible Flyovers & biggest ever Fireworks!"" Trump tweeted.

The President's repeated veneration of America's armed forces can come across as hypocritical given that he did not serve and agreed with Howard Stern that sexually transmitted diseases represented his own personal Vietnam . He's also not shied away from attacking military heroes for political gain: He can't let go of his feud with John McCain -- even though the Arizona senator, Vietnam prisoner of war and war hero died nearly a year ago.

Though many find Trump's showmanship distasteful, it's often rooted in a shrewd political hunch. Images of the commander-in-chief framed by the Stars and Stripes will go nicely in the campaign video library he is building to help his reelection.

And anyone who dissents -- including media organizations that are his favorite targets -- can be branded disrespectful of the troops and unpatriotic.

""You know what happened July 4, 1776?"" White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway asked a reporter in front of the White House Tuesday. ""Because it doesn't sound like you're even talking about the patriotism that undergirds it.""

Trump has promised a unifying speech to all of the nation, as if his mere presence at the event was not carving yet another line right down the middle of the country. But when asked Monday whether he was capable of a July Fourth speech that unites all Americans, Trump appeared to indicate he would take the partisan tone that he can rarely resist.

""What the Democrats plan is going to destroy the country and it is going to be horrible health care, horrible health care and everybody's taxes will go to 95%,"" he said.

The President wanted his own parade

Trump's idea for a big July Fourth spectacular appears to have originated on the Champs Elysees in Paris when he accompanied French President Emmanuel Macron to Bastille Day celebrations.

It may also be a way to placate his festering anger at reports that showed Barack Obama's inaugural crowd in 2008 to be larger than his own. After all, hundreds of thousands of people show up at the July Fourth fireworks, clogging the Mall and surrounding streets.

The President's plans for a vast American parade were confounded by spiraling costs and the logistical reality that the tracks of armored tanks would plow up Washington's roads -- the tanks in Trump's July Fourth display will be on a static display -- but he never let go of the idea of a big patriotic party.

Some critics blanch at the notion of the armed forces brought into Trump's celebration. Retired four-star Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal suggested that the values of citizenship and service could also be observed by honoring Peace Corps volunteers for instance.

""Tanks, planes, they are things, they are not the sinew of the nation,"" McChrystal told CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday.

McChrystal said that US armed forces proved their prowess on the battlefield: ""I don't think we need to bring them onto the National Mall to justify their effectiveness,"" he said.

After a foreign trip in which Trump once cozied up to autocrats like Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, his July Fourth parade may set off sinister echoes and raise questions about the optics of military might on the capital's streets.

After all, military parades are a staple of dictatorships. In places like China, North Korea and the former Soviet Union, such displays were as much an instrument of domestic repression as a sign to adversaries of overwhelming military strength.

The military parades and pageantry that Trump also admires in France and Britain meanwhile are hardly a display of current power -- they more often highlight the past military glories of long past colonial eras that are anathema to the values of July Fourth."
"Trump and R.N.C. Raised $105 Million in 2nd Quarter, a Sign He Will Have Far More Money Than in 2016",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Annie Karni', 'Maggie Haberman']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/politics/trump-fundraising.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee said on Tuesday they had raised $105 million in the second quarter of this year, outraising President Barack Obama in the equivalent period during his 2012 re-election campaign and signaling that Mr. Trump will have far more resources than he did in 2016.

The campaign and the committee said that they had a combined $100 million in cash on hand, and that they had raised more money online in the second quarter than in the first half of 2018. Mr. Trump and his committees raised $54 million, they said, and the Republican National Committee raised $51 million, money that can be plowed into television and digital advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts and other activities related to the 2020 election.

While Mr. Trump may be trailing the Democratic front-runners in the polls, his second-quarter numbers were a reminder that as an incumbent, he has advantages that were unavailable to him as an untraditional, first-time candidate in 2016.

Mr. Trump rose to the presidency with fewer staff members and less money than his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This time, he will have the Republican Party’s fund-raising mechanism, as well as the powers of the presidency, bolstering his raw personal appeal to his base, even as he tries to present himself as the outsider to the political establishment that he once was."
Trump's Fed pick Judy Shelton is a fan of the gold standard and other unusual economic policies,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/03/trumps-federal-reserve-pick-judy-sheltons-economic-policies.html,"Judy Shelton, U.S. executive director for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, stands for a photograph.

In tapping Judy Shelton to become one of two Federal Reserve Board governors, President Donald Trump selected one of the minority of mainstream economists supportive of a return to the gold standard and critical of central bank activity.

Shelton, who serves as the U.S. executive director at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, wrote as recently as last year in support of pegging the dollar to gold prices.

Trump announced his intention to nominate both Shelton and St. Louis Fed economist Christopher Waller via tweet on Tuesday.

Shelton's unorthodox monetary beliefs will likely draw questions from Senate lawmakers, who will ultimately need to approve Shelton and Waller to the Fed board.

In a post published by the libertarian think tank Cato Institute in 2018, Shelton drew a comparison between cryptocurrencies and gold.

""If the appeal of cryptocurrencies is their capacity to provide a common currency, and to maintain a uniform value for every issued unit, we need only consult historical experience to ascertain that these same qualities were achieved through the classical international gold standard,"" she wrote.

""In proposing a new international monetary system linked in some way to gold, America has an opportunity to secure continued prominence in global monetary affairs.""

The choice of Shelton may hint at Trump's growing frustration with Fed leaders and the direction of the central bank's monetary policy. Trump has argued that higher interest rates and so-called quantitative tightening have capped GDP growth and dampened the U.S. position in trade deliberations with Beijing.

Two previous Trump nominees, Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, bowed out of consideration after it became clear their confirmation process was in jeopardy.

Shelton, no fan of the Fed's, recently argued against an overly active central bank.

Questioned in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal opinion page whether the U.S. central bank should lower rates she said, ""The answer is yes.""

""When you have an economy primed to grow because of reduced taxes, less regulation, dynamic energy and trade reforms, you want to ensure maximum access to capital,"" she told the Journal. ""The Fed's practice of paying banks to keep money parked at the Fed in deposit accounts instead of going into the economy is unhealthy and distorting; the rate should come down quickly as the practice is phased out."""
Geraldo Rivera: Only reason Dems object to July 4th parade is because of Trump 'hatred',https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/geraldo-rivera-only-reason-dems-object-to-july-4th-parade-is-because-of-trump-hatred,"Fox News' Geraldo Rivera defended President Trump's Fourth of July parade plans saying that the only reason anyone opposed the celebration is their ""hatred"" for the president.

""This is a symbol of the partisan toxic malignant atmosphere that we have in our country. When you see how Republicans feel about the country right now according to the surveys and the way that Democrats feel about the country now according to the surveys. It is amazing,"" Rivera told guest host Dan Bongino on ""Hannity.""

DEMS FUME AS TRUMP MOVES TO AMEND DC'S JULY 4 CELEBRATION, POSSIBLY ADDRESS THE NATION

""People on the left hates our president so much that they are willing to just put a negative spin on anything. How many times have you seen a flyover and an athletic event? Everybody loves them except for when President Trump is the one proposing them.""

Rivera said Trump had become a ""synonym"" for the country, argued that his visit to North Korea should be celebrated by everyone and told critics of the president to ""get over themselves"" and celebrate America's Independence Day.

""The president went into North Korea, the first president ever. Everybody should be celebrating that but because this hatred of Donald Trump is so intense that he has become the synonym for the nation. I think it's very distressing. People should get over themselves,"" Rivera said.

DHS Inspector General Finds 'Dangerous Overcrowding' In Border Patrol Facilities,https://www.npr.org,"['Joel Rose', 'John Burnett']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/02/738179391/dhs-inspector-general-finds-dangerous-overcrowding-in-border-patrol-facilities,"DHS Inspector General Finds 'Dangerous Overcrowding' In Border Patrol Facilities

Enlarge this image toggle caption Office of Inspector General Office of Inspector General

The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General is warning about ""dangerous overcrowding"" in Border Patrol facilities in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas.

In a strongly worded report, the inspector general said the prolonged detention of migrants without proper food, hygiene or laundry facilities — some for more than a month — requires ""immediate attention and action.""

The report comes amid growing outrage over detention conditions for migrants and follows reports that migrant children were kept in squalid conditions without enough food and basic necessities in a Border Patrol station in West Texas.

Inspectors from DHS's Office of Inspector General in June visited Border Patrol facilities and ports of entry across the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, the busiest sector in the country for illegal border crossings.

""We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of DHS agents and officers, and to those detained,"" they wrote.

In its response to the report, the Department of Homeland Security says the surge of migrants crossing the Southern border has led to an ""acute and worsening crisis.""

""The current migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis are rapidly overwhelming the ability of the Federal Government to respond,"" DHS says.

In May, according to DHS, an average of more than 4,600 people a day crossed illegally or arrived at ports of entry without the proper documents, compared to less than 700 a day in the same period two years ago.

DHS says Customs and Border Protection facilities are at ""peak capacity"" and that the agency is adding detention capacity at three tent facilities in order to improve the conditions for migrants. CBP also says it ""continues to take steps to address the health and safety of those in custody,"" including by expanding medical services.

The inspector general's office released a report in May describing similarly dangerous overcrowding conditions in Border Patrol cells in the El Paso region.

The latest report from the Rio Grande Valley includes photos of migrants penned into overcrowded Border Patrol facilities — including one man pressing a cardboard sign to a cell window with the word ""Help.""

The inspectors quote one unnamed senior manager calling the situation a ""ticking time bomb.""

Inspectors found that hundreds of children were held for longer than the 72 hours, the maximum time federal rules allow. In some cases, kids were held for more than two weeks. And some adults were kept in standing-room-only cells, without access to showers, for more than a week.

Inspectors said Border Patrol management informed them there had been ""security incidents,"" such as detainees clogging toilets with Mylar blankets and socks in order to be released from their cells during maintenance.

""We ended our site visit at one Border Patrol facility early because our presence was agitating an already difficult situation,"" the inspectors wrote. ""Specifically, when detainees observed us, they banged on the cell windows, shouted, pressed notes to the window with their time in custody, and gestured to evidence of their time in custody (e.g., beards)."""
DOJ says citizenship question being dropped from 2020 Census: NY attorney general's office,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-says-citizenship-question-being-dropped-from-2020-census-ny-attorney-generals-office,"The New York attorney general’s office said Tuesday the Justice Department has decided to print the 2020 Census without the citizenship question sought by the Trump administration, ending a contentious legal dispute over an issue that could soon affect the makeup of Congress and the Electoral College.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that the question couldn't be added for now, but left open the possibility that additional arguments could change its mind. Civil rights groups argued that the Trump administration's reasons for including the question were merely pretextual efforts to discourage illegal immigrants from responding to the Census.

Population counts from the Census are used to apportion House seats among the 50 states, and a new electoral map based on the Census will be in effect for the 2024 presidential election. States receive votes in the Electoral College equal to the number of members in their congressional delegation, counting both House and Senate seats.

In a tweet on Monday, Daniel Jacobson, who worked in the White House Counsel’s Office under President Obama, said a trial attorney at the Justice Department told him that ""the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process"" without the citizenship question.

""We won,"" Jacobson wrote.

In a statement to Fox News, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tied the decision to the Supreme Court's ruling.

“I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census,"" Ross said. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

For his part, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., issued a less-than-celebratory statement calling for answers, even as he praised the decision to scrap the citizenship question.

""I am encouraged that Administration officials dropped President Trump’s unconstitutional plan to postpone the Census just because he lost the Supreme Court case,"" Cummings said. ""The Trump Administration put our country through more than a year of wasted time and squandered resources—all in the service of an illegal attempt to add a discriminatory question based on a pretext.""

Cummings continued: ""The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce must now turn over all of the documents our Committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, added, ""The exclusion of the citizenship question from the census is a victory for our democracy and for fair representation of all communities in this country.""

President Trump had tweeted that he had asked lawyers if the count can be delayed until the Supreme Court can reevaluate the matter, based on additional evidence supporting the administration's justifications for adding the citizenship question.

The Supreme Court, in its ruling last week, did not prohibit a citizenship question out of hand but dismissed the administration's provided rationale as insufficient.

However, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Fox News on Tuesday that the Supreme Court was unlikely to change its mind. Clarke's team successfully challenged the Trump administration on the use of the citizenship question in federal court in California, and was one of several groups to bring such lawsuits.

“The Supreme Court’s ruling left little opportunity for the administration to cure the defects with its decision to add a citizenship question and, most importantly, they were simply out of time given the impending deadline for printing forms,"" Clarke said.

Experts agreed that any delay could gum up the U.S. Census Bureau's finely calibrated timetable for the 10-year count. Monday was the deadline to start printing the 600 million documents that will be mailed to 130 million households for next April's census count.

CAL THOMAS: CENSORING THE CENSUS IS ABOUT POLITICS, NOT THE LAW

For months, the Trump administration had argued that the courts needed to decide quickly whether the citizenship question could be added to the 2020 census because of the looming deadline.

""I think it's very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal,"" Trump told reporters Monday. ""There's a big difference to me between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.""

Former President Barack Obama's administration didn't ask the citizenship question in the 2010 census. The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.

""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,"" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told Fox News.

From a logistical standpoint, any delay ""would be a nightmare,"" said John Thompson, who served as Census Bureau director during Obama's second term.

The bureau already has been in the process of signing almost 250 office leases across the U.S. and has hired 1,500 specialists partnering with community organizations to encourage people to participate in the census. More than 170,000 recruits already have filled out applications for the almost half-million positions being created for the count. The bureau has helped set up more than 1,500 committees nationwide working to get everyone to respond.

Furthermore, Congress would have to change the law for the count to be delayed because Title 13 of the U.S. Code mandates that it take place on April 1, 2020, Thompson said.

""I don't think there's any ambiguity, but I'm not a lawyer,"" Thompson said.

Fewer people are expected to fill out the questionnaires using paper than in years past because the bureau for the first time is relying on most respondents to use the Internet to answer questions. Still, printed postcards and letters are to be sent out next March reminding residents it's time to answer the questionnaire, and those who don't respond digitally are expected to be mailed paper questionnaires.

As recently as last week, the Trump administration's solicitor general wrote in court papers that the Census Bureau needed to finalize the questions by June. Any changes to the paper questionnaire after June would impair the bureau's ability to conduct the count in a timely manner, wrote the solicitor general, Noel Francisco.

More than two dozen Democrats in the U.S. Senate last week sent a letter urging Ross to drop any further pursuit of the citizenship question because it would delay the bureau's ability to conduct the count.

""The 2020 Census is less than half a year away, and any unnecessary delay in operations would impact the ability of the Census Bureau to count every person in our country,"" the letter read.

This past May, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines introduced legislation that would require the census to include a citizenship question.

""This is America,"" Daines told Fox News at the time. ""We are a sovereign nation. It's absurd that we don't know how many citizens and non-citizens are living in this country. That's why I'm introducing this bill to require a citizenship question on the census - and ensure that states harboring millions of illegal immigrants are not rewarded with additional taxpayer dollars.""

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., sued Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to obtain six years of President Trump's tax returns.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., is the latest step in a months-long battle with the Trump administration over the president's tax records. Democrats want the court to enforce a subpoena requesting the returns.

Mnuchin rejected the subpoena in May, citing guidance from the Department of Justice. At the time Mnuchin said the request lacked a ""legitimate legislative purpose.""

Democrats argue in the court filing that the committee has the right to access Trump's private tax information under Section 6103 of the U.S. tax code, which says, ""Treasury 'shall furnish' the Committee with 'any' requested tax return information"" from any U.S. citizen, including the president.

The filing states that the law was ""intended to provide the Committee with unfettered access to tax return information necessary to carry out its broad mandate to oversee Treasury, the IRS, and the Nation's tax laws. ""

Committee Republicans have sided with Mnuchin, calling the request baseless and dangerous. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the top Republican on Ways and Means, also said the lawsuit is motivated by partisanship and circumvents the usual committee process for requesting taxpayer information.

""The Democrats' partisan, flawed lawsuit continues their unprecedented and illegitimate pursuit to expose President Trump's private tax information,"" Brady said in a statement. ""This is a dangerous course of action.""

But many Democrats, including committee member Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., cheered the lawsuit as the next logical step in the effort to reveal details of Trump's business dealings both as a candidate and while in office.

""We are here today because Donald Trump and his enablers have sneered at our laws and avoided the thinnest accountability for their corruption,"" Pascrell said in a statement. ""The Ways and Means Committee must file this action to stand for rule of law."""
Bipartisan bill aims to stop child pornography trafficking on Defense Department's network,https://www.cnn.com,['Anna Laffrey'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/house-bill-defense-department-network-child-pornography/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill that would crack down on the use of the Department of Defense internet network for trafficking child pornography.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified over 5,000 individuals, several of whom are affiliated with the Defense Department, who subscribe to child pornography websites in an investigation called ""Project Flicker."" A subsequent inquiry by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service tagged hundreds of Defense Department affiliates as suspects in child pornography cases, according to a news release.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, and Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, would help the Defense Department stamp out use of its computers and network to access and share child pornography. The legislation would bolster training, improve technical capacities and require collaboration with both law enforcement and social service providers.

Spanberger, a former federal agent who worked on child exploitation and child pornography cases, called the abuse and exploitation of children through pornography ""horrific crimes.""

""The notion that the Department of Defense's network and Pentagon-issued computers may be used to view, create, or circulate such horrifying images is a shameful disgrace, and one we must fight head on,"" Spanberger said in a statement.

Brandon Judd: Ocasio-Cortez’s attacks on Border Patrol are outrageous and based on lies,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brandon Judd', 'Brandon Judd Is The President Of The']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/brandon-judd-ocasio-cortezs-attacks-on-border-patrol-are-outrageous-and-based-on-lies,"As the president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing 16,000 Border Patrol agents, I am personally and professionally offended by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s outrageous, inflammatory and false claims about the dedicated law enforcement officers I represent.

Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., once again tweeted Tuesday to describe our detention facilities for illegal immigrants as “concentration camps” – absurdly comparing these facilities to the death camps run by the Nazis who murdered 6 million Jews and millions of others during World War II.

This is a horrible insult to the memories of the innocent men, women and children slaughtered by the Nazis, and to our Border Patrol agents – implying that our agents are no different from the Nazi butchers. The outrageousness of this vicious slander is breathtaking – especially coming from a member of Congress.

OCASIO-CORTEZ REPEATS ‘CONCENTRATION CAMP’ COMPARISON, DESPITE CRITICISM OVER REMARK

I am disgusted by Ocasio-Cortez’s lies and her determination to needlessly and dangerously inflame public sentiment regarding the crisis on our southern border by abandoning facts and making wild and unsupported accusations.

The congresswoman is clearly using phrases designed to enrage the uninformed and to pander to a base that wants open borders and unlimited illegal immigration.

Ocasio-Cortez made an outrageous claim this week about a woman being told to drink toilet water in a detention facility. This false claim is easily disproven with actual video.

Ocasio-Cortez is basing her claim on a single female detainee who reportedly told the congresswoman that an agent told her to “drink toilet water.” That’s it.

The congresswoman is clearly not on a “fact-finding” mission – she is on a propaganda mission. She made up her mind long before visiting a detention facility in Texas that Border Patrol agents are bad people. And she obviously believes that all illegal immigrants are innocent victims, and that photo ops and lies can help her spread her propaganda to an uninformed public.

Instead, Ocasio-Cortez is playing politics with illegal immigrants. She seeks to raise her profile higher in the media and portray herself as the champion of the detainees – when she is in fact working against their best interests.

Ocasio-Cortez plays off people’s emotions. She is on record as saying facts don’t matter as long as she is “morally right.” Enough said.

I don’t use the word “propaganda” lightly. But it is widely understood to mean spreading information that is not true, but rather used to influence people and further an agenda while appealing to emotions. That is exactly what Ocasio-Cortez does.

I prefer using facts. The facts do not support Ocasio-Cortez. Detainees have never been told to drink toilet water. And Border Patrol agents are doing everything in their power to treat the illegal immigrants as humanely as possible under overcrowded conditions.

I find it interesting that every time Ocasio-Cortez is found to be wrong about something – and that’s quite often – she simply doubles down and redirects with new “information.”

In this case, when presented with facts about drinking fountains in jails being connected to toilets – with separate water lines – she says “yes, the drinking fountains are attached to the toilets, but the drinking fountains weren’t working.” This is not true and easily debunked with facts. Almost every facility we have is blanketed with video cameras.

Border Patrol agents have been vilified by some politicians and many in the mainstream media for decades, and 99 percent of the time this criticism is unfair and completely inaccurate.

By comparing Border Patrol agents to Nazis, Ocasio-Cortez is trying to dehumanize us. Interestingly, this is the same thing she accuses us of doing with the thousands upon thousands of illegal immigrants we are charged with arresting, detaining and caring for

Border Patrol agents do not drag thousands of innocent children across the border. We don’t risk their lives by exposing them to harsh weather and circumstances no child should be exposed to. Those deeds are carried out by their parents, relatives and the ruthless coyotes who profit from human misery.

We don’t write the immigration laws – Congress does. We don’t determine how much money and manpower we get to enforce those laws – Congress does.

Ocasio-Cortez can seek approval for any changes in the law and in funding that she wishes. But she should stop blaming us for enforcing the law and carrying out our assigned duties. We’re doing the best we can with what we have to work with.

Ocasio-Cortez voted not to fund better facilities and conditions for the illegal immigrants we detain. So if she wants to know who is responsible for wanting to continue the current conditions in these facilities all she has to do is look in the mirror, and look at other lawmakers who support her position. She can make excuses, but one has to legitimately question whose best interests she is looking out for.

The congresswoman is not a fiscal conservative, so her opposition to providing increased funding to help us better care for detainees is not caused by her desire to cut government spending.

Instead, Ocasio-Cortez is playing politics with illegal immigrants. She seeks to raise her profile higher in the media and portray herself as the champion of the detainees – when she is in fact working against their best interests.

I am proud of the Border Patrol agents who work tirelessly for the American public to uphold the rule of law and defend the sanctity of life.

I’m not blind to the fact that we will always have a few people in such a large organization who say and do unprofessional things. You can find a small percentage of people who act improperly among elected officials, members of the media, the medical profession, the clergy and in every other profession.

But I know for a fact that the vast majority of people I’ve worked with over the years in the Border Patrol are honorable, decent and hardworking public servants. Ocasio-Cortez should be ashamed of herself for trying to demonize us and turn public sentiment against us.

Trump administration won't ask about citizenship on census,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Gregory Wallace']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/doj-census-citizenship-question/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will not ask about citizenship status on the 2020 census , backing off a contentious effort to reinstate the question over objections from opponents who successfully argued to the Supreme Court that it would disenfranchise minority groups.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who originally directed the Census Bureau to add the question, said in a statement that he was moving ahead with printing the 2020 census despite his disagreement with the court's ruling last week.

""I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census,"" Ross said in a statement Tuesday. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.""

The order to print came suddenly, surprising attorneys who had challenged the Trump administration.

As recently as Monday, President Donald Trump had said his administration was looking for ways to delay the once-a-decade tally so that the question could be included.

""We're looking at that very strongly,"" he told reporters at the White House.

Trump cited the census' key role in determining how government resources are spent.

""I think it's very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal,"" he said. ""I think there's a big difference, to me, between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.""

Trump also said last week he was looking at pushing a delay in the population count over the issue, which he's positioned as part of his broader crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

""I have asked the lawyers if they can delay the Census, no matter how long, until the United States Supreme Court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter,"" he wrote on Twitter.

The government had initially said that Monday was the deadline to begin printing forms. As late as Monday afternoon, however, the administration asked a federal judge in Maryland for more time to decide how it would proceed following the Supreme Court decision.

On Tuesday afternoon, shortly before the rescheduled hearing was set to start, a Justice Department lawyer told plaintiffs the administration was moving ahead with printing.

""We can confirm that the decision has been made to print the 2020 Decennial Census questionnaire without a citizenship question, and that the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process,"" Kate Bailey, a trial attorney with the Justice Department, wrote in an email to other attorneys involved in the case on Tuesday.

In the Maryland hearing, Judge George Hazel instructed the parties to put in writing by next week an agreement on how the census would move forward, according to the one of the plaintiffs in the case, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

Supreme Court decision led to uncertainty

The outcome was uncertain until Tuesday because the Supreme Court ruling last week that blocked the question from appearing for the time being had left the door open for the administration to present a new rationale.

Since March 2018, Ross had justified the question as necessary to enforce voting protections, citing a request from the Justice Department. ""We are responding solely to the Department of Justice's request,"" Ross testified before Congress.

Critics saw holes in that case with the disclosure that Ross himself had asked the Justice Department to send such a letter. Communications between Ross and White House officials about the question emerged, and Ross was seen writing to an aide, ""I am mystified why nothing have (sic) been done in response to my months old request that we include the citizenship question. Why not?""

Most recently, challengers of the question presented an unpublished 2015 study by a Republican redistricting expert as evidence that citizenship data would benefit Republicans when new political boundaries are drawn based on the 2020 census.

The Supreme Court ultimately described Ross' explanation for including the question as ""contrived"" and ""incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency's priorities and decision-making process.""

The process of preparing a new justification was expected to take months, including a lengthy court review that could return to the Supreme Court, delaying the process of printing hundreds of millions of forms and other materials and preparing for the count.

Delaying the printing process is possible, but expensive, the Census Bureau's chief scientist told a court last year. He said it would be possible if ""exceptional resources"" are available. But a group of House Democrats signaled Tuesday they would not vote in favor of moving the census date.

""This is a victory on the eve of the Fourth of July we are celebrating equal justice for all,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James, one of multiple states, cities and other groups to challenge the question in court.

Dale Ho of the American Civil Liberties Union, which was part of the New York case, said, ""Everyone in America counts in the census, and today's decision means we all will.""

Attorneys involved in the challenges said the court has given the government until Monday to negotiate written wording.

""We're happy about the development but want to make sure it is thorough and complete,"" said Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which was among groups challenging the question.

He told CNN on Tuesday he was concerned that the administration might find other ways to undermine the count.

Even without the question on the census forms, it remains unclear if the Census Bureau will still publish a file of citizenship data when it releases the census results in early 2021. The bureau's chief scientist, John Abowd, said in May that regardless of the high court's decision, the bureau was operating as if it was still expected to produce the data using so-called administrative records compiled from government data.

If the bureau does so, it could set the stage for another legal battle over who counts for the purpose of drawing congressional districts.

The Census Bureau has not responded to a request for comment from CNN."
House Democrats file lawsuit to obtain Trump tax returns,https://www.cnn.com,"['Lauren Fox', 'Katelyn Polantz', 'Clare Foran', 'Ellie Kaufman']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/tax-return-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) The Democrat-led House Ways and Means Committee filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to enforce subpoenas and obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns, an escalation in a fight for the President's personal financial information.

The lawsuit was filed in D.C. District Court against Treasury and the IRS and their respective leaders, Steve Mnuchin and Charles Rettig.

House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal is seeking the President's tax returns using a little-known IRS provision known as 6103 , which allows the Chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee to request and obtain an individual's tax information for a legitimate legislative purpose.

The move comes months after Neal made his initial request for the President's tax information and as outside groups and other liberals on the Ways and Means Committee grew impatient with the pace of Neal's efforts. Neal initially made his request for Trump's tax returns on April 3. After a series of follow-up letters, the Treasury Department formally denied the request at the beginning of May, and Neal issued subpoenas to the IRS and Treasury Department on May 10.

""In refusing to comply with the statute, Defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the Nation's voluntary tax system,"" House attorneys wrote in the complaint.

Exclusive: Democrats investigating whistleblower claims Pompeo's security picked up Chinese food and his dog,https://www.cnn.com,['Michelle Kosinski'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/politics/pompeo-democrats-whistleblower-claims/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democrats on a key House congressional committee are investigating allegations from a whistleblower within the State Department about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his family's use of taxpayer-funded Diplomatic Security -- prompting agents to lament they are at times viewed as ""UberEats with guns"".

Congressional investigators, who asked for the committee not to be named as they carry out their inquiries, tell CNN that a State Department whistleblower has raised multiple issues over a period of months, about special agents being asked to carry out some questionable tasks for the Pompeo family.

In April, for example, an agent was asked to pick up Chinese food—without Pompeo in the car. The whistleblower said this led agents to complain that they are now serving as ""UberEats with guns,"" which has created a buzz within the department, according to multiple Democratic congressional aides who cited the whistleblower.

On another occasion, the whistleblower told aides, a Diplomatic Security special agent was given the job of picking up the Pompeo family dog from a groomer.

And CNN has seen a document given to the committee aides by the whistleblower showing that in January, Diplomatic Security was asked by a person in Pompeo's office to pick up his adult son from Union Station in Washington and bring him to the family home.

Lon Fairchild, the special agent in Charge of the Diplomatic Security Service, did not deny that the specific trips, such as the dog or the takeout food, were carried out by agents, but said in a statement, ""I was head of Secretary Pompeo's security detail since his first day on the job. At no point during my service did he or any member of his family ask me or any member of my team to act in any way that would be inconsistent with our professional obligation to protect the Secretary 24-hours a day, 7-days a week.""

A former senior Diplomatic Security official told CNN such tasks would not be appropriate—especially without the Secretary himself in the car at the time—unless some specific threat was identified that necessitated those trips. For example, they said when former Secretary of State Warren Christopher started in the job, he had hoped his agents would go get groceries for him, but had to be told that that's not what they do.

The Diplomatic Security Service is the law enforcement and security arm of the State Department tasked with protecting US diplomacy and diplomats worldwide and securing the integrity of US travel documents.

While protecting the security of the secretary of state is an important task for the service, there are concerns that agents may have been asked to carry out inappropriate tasks while assigned to Pompeo.

According to the Code of Federal Regulations, a federal employee ""shall not encourage, direct, coerce, or request a subordinate to use official time to perform activities other than those required in the performance of official duties or authorized in accordance with law or regulation.""

It is unclear if Pompeo requested the allegedly improper arrangements or whether they were made by someone on his staff without his knowledge.

But the whistleblower said there is a culture within Diplomatic Security to try and please the secretary and avoid upsetting him.

Former government ethics czar Walter Shaub told CNN ""sending subordinates to run personal errands for you is the very definition of misuse of position.""

Concerns about Susan Pompeo's security arrangements

Those personal-seeming tasks might be eye-catching, but congressional investigators say the State Department whistleblower told them the bigger issue causing concern among some agents is the question of why Pompeo's wife, Susan, has her own security detail, assigned to her in 2018, even while she is at home in the United States.

""There is a lot of confusion among agents over this, over why this is justified,"" one aide told CNN. ""Because according to this source they have seen nothing to indicate it is justified. In fact just the opposite. It's their understanding there was no finding of a high-enough level threat to merit this detail."" The whistleblower told these investigators that multiple special agents and supervisors within Diplomatic Security understood that a formal threat assessment had not been carried out, under longtime standard operating procedure, and that there is no specific threat against Susan Pompeo

Furthermore, the whistleblower told aides that shortly after Susan Pompeo received her personal security detail, in July 2018, agents were verbally told not to use her callsign—which is ""Shocker""—over the radios or publicly. The reason, according to one aide, citing the whistleblower, was that ""they knew it wasn't kosher.""

CNN has viewed an email from within the State Department confirming that she has an agent assigned to her, along with her callsign. The assistant secretary overseeing Diplomatic Security, Michael Evanoff, was included in the correspondence. The subject line says ""Shocker Detail.""

The former senior Diplomatic Security official who asked not to be identified said that such a full-time detail for a spouse is unusual and would only be assigned once a formal process was followed, assessing the need for such security. They said that the risk investigation would be performed by Diplomatic Security's Protective Intelligence and Investigations Division, in the Office of Threat and Intelligence Analysis. The former official told CNN this protocol has existed within Diplomatic Security for decades. And that in this person's lengthy tenure at Diplomatic Security, no spouse was ever given a security detail for more than a short, specific period of time.

One congressional aide told CNN that under the current administration, ""We have a lot of concerns over how things are being conducted within Diplomatic Security. There is a lack of transparency.""

A State Department spokesperson insisted that a threat assessment for Susan Pompeo was carried out by the Protective Intelligence and Investigations Division, but would not tell CNN when that happened.

""The provision of a protective detail to Mrs. Pompeo is expressly authorized by federal law. In this case, Diplomatic Security determined that the threat warranted the provision of such a protective detail to Mrs. Pompeo and began providing it as of July 28, 2018.""

In a statement, Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Michael Evanoff said, ""The Diplomatic Security Service has been protecting the spouse of the Secretary of State since the 1970s as the security threat dictates. We are a federal law enforcement agency, and this is an integral part of our core mission. Today the security threats against Secretary Pompeo and his family are unfortunately very real. The Diplomatic Security Service is proud to protect the Pompeo family from those who would harm the Secretary of State and the United States.""

Concerns about how Trump admin officials have used government resources

These questions about Pompeo are the latest in a slew of ethics allegations surrounding Trump administration Cabinet secretaries and their use of government resources.

Former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt left his position after a series of ethical questions about his security team; the former head of Health and Human Services, Tom Price , resigned after a scandal over his use of private planes; Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was assailed for extravagant taxpayer-funded furniture purchases . Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke stepped down amid probes of his real estate dealings and conduct in office. And Former Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin left that job under an ethics cloud after a damning inspector general report criticized him for improperly accepting gifts and misrepresenting travel plans.

The aides said another whistleblower has come forward, who worked on the State Department's executive seventh floor where the secretary of state and top aides are based—telling them that employees there have been told not to put information concerning Susan Pompeo into official emails, so that it would not be preserved in required recordkeeping.

The role Susan Pompeo has played within the State Department and when the secretary travels is another area of concern to congressional aides, Diplomatic Security officers and multiple sources within the State Department and the CIA, which Pompeo previously led.

Several sources told CNN when Susan Pompeo accompanies the secretary on certain trips she has not only had a dedicated special agent to tend to her, but also a State Department staffer.

They said that ahead of a recent trip to Kansas, during which she accompanied her husband, she had at times chaired meetings on trip logistics at the State Department, which raised eyebrows, including of senior State officials.

One person familiar with the situation called it ""the worst kept secret at State,"" telling CNN, ""[Secretary Pompeo] takes her on ... trips, has separate meetings, requiring control officers, motor pool assets, security, and time. It was especially brazen during the shutdown when people were actually called into the embassy while furloughed. Just one more thing killing morale at the department."""
Cruz: Overwhelmed DHS must start accepting private donations,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/cruz-overwhelmed-dhs-must-start-accepting-private-donations,"A Republican senator from a southern border state has urged the Department of Homeland Security to start accepting private donations, hoping the money will improve holding conditions and give Customs and Border Protection facilities on the U.S.-Mexico border additional needed help.



Senator Ted Cruz sent acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan a letter Tuesday urging him to create a process for the federal entity to accept money and supplies from faith-based groups, non-governmental organizations, and charities.

""Even with the additional supplemental emergency funding, I am confident that DHS and CBP can still use the generosity of the American people to help manage the humanitarian crisis on our border,"" Cruz wrote in the letter.

Cruz said he made the request because he had heard of individuals who wanted to help improve conditions inside the overcrowded facilities at ports of entry, but Border Patrol stations lacked a way to do so.

""This desire is laudable,"" Cruz wrote. ""But I understand that many of these organizations are currently having difficulties making donations because DHS and CBP currently lack procedures to accept their donations.""

The second-term senator did not make a recommendation for how DHS should go about making the operational change.

McAleenan is meeting with government officials in Honduras and El Salvador the first half of this week to discuss root causes and solutions to ""irregular migration"" from the northern region of Central America. DHS has not indicated if it will consider Cruz's request.

More than 600,000 people have been taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection personnel at and between ports of entry in the first eight months of fiscal 2019, which is more than the previous 12 months. More than half of that group are families.

CBP has said its facilities were designed for single adults to be held for up to 72 hours before being transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation.

Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement is responsible for taking unaccompanied children from CBP but has not had the space to do so, leading to overcrowded facilities with inefficient care for those temporarily living there."
House committee sues Trump admin for president's tax returns,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-committee-sues-trump-admin-for-presidents-tax-returns,"Failing to obtain President Trump’s tax returns via request or subpoena, the Democrat-led House Ways and Means Committee is now suing for them.

In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, the committee claimed the Trump administration was violating federal law by refusing to comply with its demands. A statute allows the committee to request an individual’s tax return information, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin shot down the request.

“In refusing to comply with the statute, Defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the Nation’s voluntary tax system,” the lawsuit said.

DEM WANTS TRUMP OFFICIALS JAILED FOR NOT TURNING OVER TAX RETURNS

The White House fought back, with an administration source telling Fox News that “the Justice Department will litigate this, but yes it will be challenged.”

Deputy Press Secretary Steven Groves said: “While the crisis at our southern border worsens, Democrats continue to focus their efforts on Presidential harassment. Chairman [Richard] Neal’s willingness to use his powerful Committee to go after his political opponents is a danger to democracy. The Committee has no legitimate legislative purpose for which it can demand the President’s tax returns, and it is evident that they are only interested in partisan games. The only thing more political than the Committee’s crusade for the President’s tax returns is its sham lawsuit.”

The committee claimed the law gave it “unfettered access to tax return information,” but Mnuchin had claimed the panel lacked a legitimate legislative purpose, which the Supreme Court said was necessary to make such inquiries. The committee claimed the law did not permit the Treasury Department to refuse and did not require any such legislative purpose.

Mnuchin was named as a defendant in the case, as was IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, as well as the IRS and Treasury Department. The IRS and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.

University of Iowa Law Professor Andy Grewal, who has written on the subject, said Tuesday he predicted the House committee may find early success in the lawsuit, but that the Supreme Court ultimately would rule that it did not have the power to bring the lawsuit.

“I would not be surprised if a district court orders the Treasury to turn over the returns,” Grewal tweeted. “But my prediction is that in this lawsuit or another, the Supreme Court says that the legislature lacks standing to sue the executive branch (ie, the case gets tossed out).”

In a separate comment to Fox News, Grewal warned of the precedent the lawsuit could set if it's successful.

""The committee has asserted an extraordinarily broad understanding of its own powers, saying that no one -- not the executive branch, not even the Supreme Court -- can question its motives,"" he said. ""Acceptance of that position would mean that Congress could issue subpoenas even when motivated by racism and bigotry. Courts may be hesitant to accept such a broad construction of the House's investigatory power.""

Despite claiming that it did not require any legislative purpose, the committee did claim it had one. The complaint alleged that the panel needed Trump’s tax return information because it was “investigating the IRS’s administration of various tax laws and policies relating to Presidential tax returns and tax law compliance by President Trump, including whether the IRS’s self-imposed policy of annually auditing the returns of sitting Presidents is working properly[.]”

Trump has said in the past that the reason he did not release his tax returns during the 2016 campaign, per tradition, was because he was under audit. The lawsuit cited a similar comment by Trump in April 2019, where he said he would not give Congress his tax returns while under audit.

The lawsuit also claimed the committee urgently needed the president's tax return information because of the consideration of tax legislation that ""would govern the next Presidential election,"" including bills that would require candidates in 2020 to disclose their tax returns.

TRUMP TAX RETURN STRATEGY COULD BACKFIRE, RECENT COURT DECISIONS INDICATE

Committee member Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-N.J., claimed that the lawsuit was a necessary measure due to the administration’s refusal to comply.

“Litigation is always a last resort. We are here today because Donald Trump and his enablers have sneered at our laws and avoided the thinnest accountability for their corruption. The Ways and Means Committee must file this action to stand for rule of law,” he said in a statement. “Despite Republicans’ efforts to cover-up, Americans cry out for oversight and voted in a new House to enforce that demand in November.”

Republicans on the committee, meanwhile, have been looking to take their own action. Top GOP member Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said after the lawsuit was filed that he was introducing a resolution against it.

“The Democrats’ partisan, flawed lawsuit continues their unprecedented and illegitimate pursuit to expose President Trump’s private tax information,” Brady said in a statement. “This is a dangerous course of action. For this reason, I am introducing a resolution to preserve the integrity of the People’s House from the attacks of the elite few and restore the voice of every American.”

These USDA employees face a stark choice: Move to Kansas City or be fired,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/01/these-usda-employees-face-stark-choice-move-kansas-city-or-be-fired/,"

Columnist

The Agriculture Department is offering employees a rare choice: accept a forced transfer to a post 1,000 miles away or be fired.

The Trump administration’s plan to move two agencies from the District to the Kansas City area includes a document with two blank boxes on it, sent to employees on June 13. Check one, it instructs: Accept the transfer by July 15 or “be separated by adverse action procedures.”

That means getting fired, with an opportunity to appeal the dismissal through what could be an expensive process. Getting fired could also make it more difficult to find another federal job in an area where the government dominates.

Although a limited number of buyouts and early retirement opportunities will be available for what union officials expect to be fewer than 15 percent of those affected, and while some USDA employees might find work in government positions elsewhere in the D.C. area, the disruption to employees generally will be substantial.

“Adverse action” can have another meaning that goes beyond the affected employees and more broadly hits taxpayers, organizations and businesses. In addition to the big hassle for workers, relocations could have an adverse impact — a major brain drain — on the work of the two agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Union officials estimate a strong majority of employees will decline reassignment. If that happens, the work of the small but important agencies could be seriously upset. Even before Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Kansas City region as the new location, but after officials said the agencies would be moving out of the District, department employees quit in droves, my colleague Ben Guarino reported last month.

“The current and projected attrition will curtail research data products that encompass commodity estimates, agricultural sector forecasts, food and farm economic and statistical indicators for U.S. agriculture, conservation, and food policy and markets,” said Kevin Hunt, a 10-year USDA employee, speaking as acting vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 3403 representing research service staff.

What the government calls “directed reassignments” to a different city are “very rare in the federal government. That's not something that is a common practice,” said Joanna Friedman, a federal employment lawyer with the Federal Practice Group. “This is unprecedented.”

When the Pentagon closed bases around the country starting in 2005, it forced many defense civilians to make a similar choice. “We lost a lot of talent in geographic moves,” said Jeffrey Neal, formerly the top personnel officer at the Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. “A 20 percent take-up rate is typical.”

Not only are government transfers like the USDA’s uncommon, but the size makes this one especially unusual. Typically, they are much smaller, said Neal, now a senior vice president with the ICF consulting firm. “Years ago, people were more likely to move with their jobs,” he added. “With most people living in two-wage-earner households, it is far more difficult to just pack up and go.”

Many, perhaps most, affected USDA employees are considering a third option — quit and find new work.

“I will be unemployed beyond Sept. 30,” which is the deadline for the District-based workers to report to the new location, Hunt said, “unless I can find another job.”

Of the 547 employees the department wants to move for the two agencies combined, 253 are with the Economic Research Service, 77 percent of its 329-person workforce. An additional 294 are with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 93 percent of its 315-person staff. News of the move prompted a surge of support for the union. Employees at the National Institute voted 137-2 to join AFGE two weeks ago. Last month’s vote at the economic service was 138-4.

When Perdue announced the moves to the Kansas City area, he said, “We did not undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to enhance long-term sustainability and success of these agencies. The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

But the USDA estimate of nearly $300 million in savings over 15 years is way off, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economics Association. Instead, it would cost taxpayers between $83 and $182 million, the analysis found. The USDA underestimated the true cost in part because it did not account for “the lost value of research from staffers who resign or retire rather than move,” the association reported.

A group of Democratic senators, including all four from Maryland and Virginia, has introduced legislation to keep the headquarters of the two agencies within the D.C. area.

Andrew Crane-Droesch, an economist with the research service, said he is not moving and is now looking for another job in the D.C. area. “Definitely the choice we face is move to Kansas City or lose our jobs,” he said. “I’m certainly not happy. I love my job, but I can’t move to Kansas City, and moreover, I don’t want to even if I could.”

Like Crane-Droesch, these staffers “have families, they are part of a community and they’ve been dedicated public servants,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations. “They deserve better than having such a radical and consequential do-or-die decision, which is hardly a fair choice, thrown at them at the last minute.”

U.S. states sue EPA for stricter asbestos rules,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Stempel', 'Min Read']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-asbestos-lawsuit/us-states-sue-epa-for-stricter-asbestos-rules-idUSKCN1TW3N6,"(Reuters) - Ten U.S. states and Washington, D.C. sued the Environmental Protection Agency to begin working on rules to tighten oversight of asbestos, and reduce the health risks that the substance poses to the public.

The attorneys general from California and Massachusetts, Xavier Becerra and Maura Healey, said on Monday they are leading the case, after the EPA denied the states’ petition that it collect more data on asbestos.

A spokesman for the EPA and its administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said the agency does not discuss pending litigation.

Asbestos is a carcinogen once used widely in fireproofing and insulation. Many companies stopped using it by the mid-1970s after it was linked to mesothelioma and other types of cancer.

Federal law still allows limited uses of asbestos, and Congress in 2016 amended the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to create a process for regulating the substance. Symptoms from asbestos exposure can take decades to surface.

“Asbestos is a known carcinogen that kills tens of thousands of people every year, yet the Trump administration is choosing to ignore the very serious health risks it poses,” Healey, a Democrat, said in a statement.

“There’s too much at stake to let the EPA ignore the danger that deadly asbestos poses to our communities, including to workers and children,” added Becerra, also a Democrat.

Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington state joined the lawsuit.

The EPA has said protecting people from asbestos exposure is a priority, including through an April rule giving it power to review asbestos products that were no longer on the market before they could be sold again in the United States.

In denying the states’ petition, the EPA determined that it was already aware of all current uses of asbestos, and had the essential information needed to assess the risks, according to the Federal Register.

But the states believe this denial was arbitrary and capricious, and violated the EPA’s obligations under the TSCA.

The lawsuit was filed late on Friday in the federal court in Oakland, California.

It is one of many lawsuits by Democratic-controlled or Democratic-leaning states challenging policies by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, including the rolling back of some environmental protections.

That means a treasury secretary who sees no issue with using a government plane to get a better shot of the solar eclipse; a HUD secretary who dropped $31,000 on a new dining set for his office; a transportation secretary who promotes the family business that has paid her millions; a former VA chief who thought it was totally fine to take his wife on a taxpayer-funded European vacation; a former Health and Human Services secretary who spent $400,000 on private jets; and a former EPA administrator whose deluge of grift included directing his staff to “find reasons for [him] to travel to Oklahoma, so [he] could be in his home state for long weekends at taxpayers’ expense.” Oh, and a current secretary of state who allegedly views his security detail as his own personal concierge.

CNN reports that Democrats “on a key House congressional committee” are investigating claims from a State Department whistleblower who’s raised “multiple issues” over several months about Mike Pompeo and his family’s use of taxpayer-funded Diplomatic Security. Those issues allegedly include:

Tasking an agent with picking up Chinese food (without Pompeo in the car), leading to internal complaints by staff whose job it is to protect the secretary that they are effectively “UberEats with guns.”

Assigning a special agent to pick up the Pompeo family dog from the groomer.

Telling an agent to pick up Pomepo’s adult son from Union Station in D.C. and drop him off at home.

Lon Fairchild, the special agent in charge of the Diplomatic Security Service, did not deny that any of the personal errands—which former government ethics official Walter Shaub called “the very definition of misuse of position”—were carried about by his staff, but said in a statement, “I was head of Secretary Pompeo’s security detail since his first day on the job. At no point during my service did he or any member of his family ask me or any member of my team to act in any way that would be inconsistent with our professional obligation to protect the Secretary 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.” (A former senior official in the DSS told CNN the tasks would be inappropriate unless “some specific threat was identified that necessitated those trips.” Former secretary of state Warren Christopher had apparently wanted his agents to pick up groceries for him but was told that wasn’t their job, which one would think was obvious.)

In addition to the issue of Pompeo allegedly viewing protective agents as personal assistants, and a culture within Diplomatic Security “to try and please the secretary and avoid upsetting him,” there are reportedly also questions among agents as to why Pompeo’s wife, Susan, was assigned her own personal detail beginning in 2018, including when she is home in the United States:"
"House panel sues Treasury, IRS over Trump's tax returns",https://www.reuters.com,"['Susan Heavey', 'Min Read']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-taxes/house-panel-sues-treasury-irs-over-trumps-tax-returns-idUSKCN1TX24Q,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives panel on Tuesday filed a long-awaited lawsuit in federal court to demand President Donald Trump’s individual and business tax returns.

The House Ways and Means Committee filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused a legal request for the records and defied two congressional subpoenas seeking the returns.

The filing sounded the starting gun in what is widely expected to be a lengthy legal battle that is likely to end in the Supreme Court.

There was no official comment from the Trump administration, but Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said: “We will respond to this latest effort at presidential harassment in court.”

Democrats want Trump’s tax records from 2013 to 2018, which legal experts have said could shed light on the president’s business dealings. Such a legal process, experts said, could unfold slowly and become an issue in the 2020 election.

Mnuchin refused to hand over the returns after House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal asked for the documents on April 3, under a federal law that says Treasury “shall furnish” such records upon request. The committee believes it is the first time an administration has denied such a request, the lawsuit said.

“In refusing to comply with the statute, defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people,” the lawsuit said.

Neal said in a statement that the panel was now pursuing the matter in court because of the administration’s “noncompliance.”

“The judiciary has been a bulwark against Trump’s steaming corruption and roughshod lawlessness. I have no doubt our lower courts will side with Congress,” Representative Bill Pascrell, a Ways and Means Democrat who has helped lead the campaign to obtain Trump’s returns, wrote on Twitter.

Democrats who wanted Neal to move to court more quickly expressed relief at the filing. “This long-overdue legal action is needed to keep this bad president from setting a bad precedent,” Representative Lloyd Doggett said in a statement.

Congressional Republicans condemned the effort as a dangerous political fishing expedition by Democrats that could “weaponize” confidential taxpayer information.

“The Democrats’ partisan, flawed lawsuit continues their unprecedented and illegitimate pursuit to expose President Trump’s private tax information,” Representative Kevin Brady, the top Republican on Neal’s committee, said in a statement.

Ways and Means is one of half a dozen panels in the lower house that are conducting investigations involving Trump and his administration, from his campaign’s contacts with Russians during the 2016 presidential race to the sprawling business interests he has not divested since taking office.

The White House is refusing to cooperate with most of them, setting up other expected legal battles.

Trump broke with a decades-old political precedent by refusing to release his returns as a presidential candidate in 2016 and he continues to do so as president, saying his tax returns are under IRS audit.

House Democrats are using Trump’s audit claim as grounds for seeking the returns. The lawsuit said the documents are needed to determine whether IRS audits are working properly, to examine how the agency administers tax policy where Trump is concerned and to ensure that Trump is complying with tax laws.

The lawsuit said the administration’s continued refusal to produce the materials “is depriving the committee of information necessary to complete its time-limited investigation, thereby impeding its most basic constitutional functions.”

It asked the court to force the administration to comply.

Neal could also have the option of requesting Trump’s state tax returns from the New York Department of Taxation and Finance. The state legislature voted in May to share tax return information with a congressional committee that asks for it.

It was not clear whether Neal has contemplated such a move."
Ground Truthing USDA’s June Acreage Report,https://www.fb.org,"['Credit', 'U.S. Department Of Agriculture']",,,,https://www.fb.org/market-intel/ground-truthing-usdas-june-acreage-report,"The 2019 growing season will go down as one of the most challenging planting seasons on record due to spring flooding and persistent rainfall across the Midwest. Planting progress for corn and soybeans was historically delayed, i.e., Crop Planting Delays Reach Historic Levels Resulting in High Levels of Uncertainty for 2019, and current expectations are for prevent plant crop insurance claims to exceed $1 billion and reach a record-high of 10 million acres.

USDA’s June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates recognized the challenges faced in the 2019 crop year and adjusted corn planted acreage down to 89.8 million acres, a reduction of 3 million acres from the department’s March estimate, and also reduced the crop yield from 176 bushels per acre to 166 bushels per acre.

USDA reversed course in its annual survey-based June Acreage Report. For the 2019/20 crop year, USDA indicated corn planted area at 91.7 million acres, up 3% or 2.6 million acres from prior-year levels, and down only slightly from March intentions of 92 million acres planted. Importantly, USDA’s June corn acreage estimate was up from the June WASDE projection and well above the average pre-report estimate of 86.6 million acres. Figures 1 and 2 highlight USDA’s corn acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

Following continued declines in new-crop soybean prices – due to substantially lower Chinese demand – USDA revealed soybean acres planted at 80 million acres, down 9.2 million acres, or 10%, from 2018 and down 4.6 million acres from March intentions. Soybean plantings in 2019 are expected to be the lowest since 2013, and plantings are expected to be lower in all 29 soybean-producing states. Figures 3 and 4 highlight USDA’s soybean acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

USDA Will Reinterview

It is an understatement to say USDA’s report surprised the corn market. New-crop corn futures fell by more than 19 cents and represented a $2.6 billion-reduction in the value of new-crop corn (based on WASDE production estimates). USDA acknowledged as much, indicating that 83% of the intended corn acreage had been planted at the time of the survey – well below the 10-year average.

In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the crop size and planted area, USDA announced that it will resurvey farmers in advance of the August 12 Crop Production report. Farmers in 14 states will be reinterviewed to determine their planted area of corn, soybeans and sorghum. Figure 5 identifies the states subject to acreage resurveys.

State Farm Bureau Perspective

To provide some additional perspective on corn and soybean acres planted, remaining to be planted or prevented from being planted, state Farm Bureaus in the reinterview region were contacted to get their ground-level perspective. Their responses follow.

Illinois – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 5%

A central Illinois farmer reported to me over this past weekend, that he had one field he originally planned to plant to corn, then was prevented-planting of corn on that field, and now he has just finished planting soybeans on that field. [Market Intel note: The planting of soybeans may have been motivated by the planting requirement associated with the Market Facilitation Program.]

Indiana – Corn Acres Up 3% and Soybean Acres Down 11%

Farmers in Indiana have given up on the hope of getting any more corn planted and did so several weeks ago. Prevent planted acres are all around the state, particularly in central and southern Indiana, where farmers have experienced rainfall far above normal. Corn can be seen in the state just popping out of the ground to knee high. Anticipated yields at this time will be far less than the 10-year average for farmers.

Kansas – Corn Acres Up 8% and Soybean Acres Down 1%

While a majority of intended Kansas corn acres have been planted, many of those acres went in during and after the USDA Risk Management Agency’s late planting period. In a few counties, up to 25% of the crop was either prevented from being planted or the planted corn is now under water.

The bulk of intended soybeans in Kansas are in or going in but a significant portion is later than intended; an early frost could be devastating.

Kansas grain sorghum planting is wrapping up, and it is suspected that at least in some areas of the state, forage crops may be substituted for intended grain sorghum acreage.

The Kansas cotton crop went in extremely late and estimates are that only about 50% to 60% of intended acres got planted this spring.

All crops are behind and will require near optimal temperatures and measured amounts of precipitation throughout the growing season. Again, an earlier than normal frost could be devastating.

Michigan – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 9%

There were a lot of acres planted over the weekend in central Michigan, but anything planted to corn recently will go to silage, not grain. The large dairy presence and need for forage in this area has caused a lot of farmers to keep planting corn with no intention of harvesting it for grain. Based on some informal surveys done a few weeks ago, I would estimate that around 65% of originally intended acres were planted to corn for grain.

Soybean progress is harder to estimate because there were still soybeans being planted over the weekend. It varies quite a bit across the state but the southeast and central [parts of the state] are probably the hardest-hit areas. Our media staff is creating a member survey that will go out tomorrow to help give us a better idea of actual acreage.

I think one thing that would help make USDA’s resurvey more accurate is if they give clear direction on how farmers should report prevent plant acreage, especially prevent plant land that gets planted to corn as a cover crop for silage.

Missouri – Corn Acres Down 3% and Soybean Acres Down 9%

Extreme flooding along the Mississippi, Missouri and internal state tributaries has wreaked havoc with corn planting in Missouri. Some land is still either covered or partially covered with water and will not be planted. April and the first half of May corn plantings were detrimentally impacted by frequent heavy rains causing thousands of acres to be replanted and/or forcing many farmers to leave undesirable stands due to the lateness of the season. Corn planted the last 10 days of May and into the first three weeks of June had better stands. 25-30% of the corn is normal, 50% is intermediate with very uneven stands and 20-25% is replant.

Ohio – Corn Acres Down 6% and Soybean Acres Down 6%

It is tough to nail down how accurate the latest USDA planting report is. Some of our economists don't believe it is super far off, but if we ask our farmers they claim much less has been planted. They are not thrilled to see the price slide with this latest report.

I was in Ottawa County in northwest Ohio yesterday and their Soil and Water in the county estimates that only 4% of the corn was planted and 30% of their beans. I would say that is definitely worse than most, but many of the surrounding counties experienced very serious planting issues as well. During my drive through northwest Ohio yesterday I saw a lot of weeds and barren fields.

If Ohio does not have a record for prevented plant acreage I will be surprised. And for crops that are planted, they are weeks behind, struggling to come up or already in need of replant. And how much can be replanted at this point? Probably not much.

South Dakota – Corn Acres Down 9% and Soybean Acres Down 22%

It looks like South Dakota will set the record for prevented planting acres by far. As always, there are differences around the state, but it sounds to me that on average the state will only be around 60% planted. On our farm, we were right at 50%. Some areas of the northeast part of the state are 80% to 90% percent planted. Down by Mitchell and Chamberlain areas, and between Pierre and Huron, some producers couldn't plant anything at all. There are some areas where you can drive several miles and not see a planted field.

Summary

USDA currently projects corn acres at 91.7 million acres, up 3% from prior-year levels, and soybean acres at 80 million acres, down 10% from 2018. However, given the historical delays in planting at the time of USDA’s acreage survey, USDA announced intentions to resurvey farmers in advance of the August Crop Production report. Feedback from state Farm Bureaus confirms the need to resurvey crop acreage, points to potential yield issues due to unfavorable growing conditions and supports a more substantial reduction in corn acres planted."
Vintage EPA photos reveal what US waterways looked like before pollution was regulated,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aylin Woodward'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/vintage-epa-photos-reveal-us-waterways-before-pollution-was-regulated-2019-6,"Just over 50 years ago, Ohio's Cuyahoga river caught fire.

The disaster prompted a public outcry that in part led to the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. The EPA was charged with regulating the country's polluted air and waterways, among other environmental objectives.

Soon after its founding, the agency dispatched 100 photographers to capture the US' environmental issues as part of a photo project called Documerica. The photographers took about 81,000 images, more than 20,000 of which were archived. At least 15,000 have been digitized by the National Archives, and the images now function as a kind of time capsule, revealing what states from California to New York looked like between 1971 and 1977.

Trump Says Conditions Are 'Disgraceful' in Major U.S. Cities,https://www.usnews.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-07-02/president-trump-says-conditions-are-disgraceful-in-major-us-cities,"President Donald Trump said Monday that U.S. cities struggling with challenges on the streets are ""usually sanctuary cities run by very liberal people."". The Associated Press

President Donald Trump said federal intervention might be needed to clean up the streets in major U.C. cities and appeared to boast about reducing homelessness in Washington during an interview with Fox News on Monday.

In an interview taped in Japan with host Tucker Carlson, the U.S. president addressed foreign policy and the power of big tech companies before the conversation turned toward the conditions in major U.S. cities.

After Carlson said that Osaka and Tokyo – two cities Trump visited during his trip to Japan for the G-20 meeting – were clean and didn't have graffiti or ""junkies,"" Trump agreed that U.S. cities such as New York and Los Angeles had major issues with what Carlson called ""filth.""

""It's a phenomena that started two years ago. It's disgraceful,"" Trump said.

""You can't have what's happening – where police officers are getting sick just by walking the beat,"" Trump continued. ""I mean, they're getting actually very sick.""

Although Trump didn't explicitly use the phrase ""homelessness"" during the interview, he appeared to blame the homeless population for playing a role in ruining cities and implied that many of them choose to be homeless out of personal preference.

""Some of them have mental problems where they don't even know they're living that way,"" Trump said. ""In fact, perhaps they like living that way. They can't do that. We cannot ruin our cities.""

He also suggested the federal government might get involved in decreasing the homeless population in major cities – though he didn't specify how. ""We're looking at it very seriously,"" he said. ""We may intercede. We may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up. It's inappropriate.""

Trump also boasted about cleaning up the streets of Washington after he became president.

""You know, I had a situation when I first became president,"" Trump said. ""We had certain areas of Washington, D.C., where that was starting to happen, and I ended it very quickly. I said, 'You can't do that.'""

Homelessness in the capital region has indeed decreased since Trump took office – dropping from 8,350 in 2016 to 6,904 in 2018, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness . But advocates for the homeless in Washington seem baffled by the president's comments, crediting the drop in homelessness to initiatives such as permanent housing and substance abuse treatment.

""I don't have a clue to what he's referencing,"" Michael L. Ferrell, the executive director of the service nonprofit D.C. Coalition for the Homeless, told The Washington Post . ""Those resources definitely predate the Trump administration.""

Trump said most U.S. cities are doing ""great,"" while adding that those struggling with challenges on the streets are ""usually sanctuary cities run by very liberal people."" He also appeared to suggest the U.S is going through an alarming increase in homelessness.

""We've never had this in our lives before in our country,"" he said.

Data from the National Alliance to End Homelessness, however, suggests otherwise.

Although homelessness did increase slightly by 0.3% between 2017 and 2018, it's been on a general downward trend for the past decade, according to the National Alliance ."
DOJ pushes Congress to permanently close loophole for knock-off fentanyl,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Clare Hymes'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doj-pushes-congress-to-permanently-close-loophole-for-knock-off-fentanyl/,"The Department of Justice is calling on Congress to enact into law a temporary order from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classifying fentanyl-like drugs as controlled substances. The 2018 order, which closed a legal loophole in U.S. drug laws that make Americans vulnerable to what are essentially knock-off versions of the opioid, was imposed on an emergency basis for two years and is set to expire in February 2020.

The drugs were previously able to dodge federal law due to their chemical makeup, which has slight modifications from the fentanyl compound. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is about 100 times stronger than morphine, and its analogues can be even more potent.

""From a policy and regulatory perspective, fentanyl-like substances need to be permanently scheduled as a class,"" said Katie Crytzer, the acting deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice. At a briefing with reporters Monday, she called the classification an ""urgent and necessary first step.""

John Martin, assistant administrator at the DEA, cited statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing more than 70,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2017. Nearly 48,000 of those deaths were caused by opioids, with approximately 29,000 stemming from use of fentanyl or fentanyl-like substances, Martin said.

If the government's current order expires without a plan in place to set permanent controls, Crytzer said, ""the department, its prosecutors and law enforcement would enter relatively unknown territory."" Crytzer said a lapse could have a serious impact on any ongoing or impending prosecutions.

According to the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, there were 863 federal defendants in fiscal year 2018 whose principal charge was related to fentanyl. However, the office only began including fentanyl analogues in their tracking as of October 2018.

The illicit substances are engineered to skirt and exploit gaps in U.S. drug laws, and largely enter the U.S. from foreign sources like Chinese criminal organizations, Mexican cartels and other traffickers. Officials say the analogues coming in from China are more potent, but traffickers from Mexico bring larger quantities of the drugs into the country.

""I can personally tell you how savvy these drug traffickers are,"" said Amanda Liskamm, director of opioid enforcement and prevention efforts in the deputy attorney general's office. ""When there is a gap in U.S. law they take full advantage of it, which results in more drugs and more deaths.""

Officials say the 2018 order has led to a ""significant decrease"" of fentanyl-like substances on the streets, and law enforcement is hoping that a more permanent continuation of the blanket classification will keep it that way. They noted that since the temporary emergency order has been in effect, law enforcement has only encountered three new fentanyl-related substances. Before the order, there were new analogues being discovered on a monthly basis.

Although Congress has been vocal on working to curb the opioid epidemic, they have yet to mark up the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act, or SOFA Act, which would permanently close this particular gap. Some hesitancy stems from concerns about how blanket scheduling could affect researchers, but Martin said that DOJ and DEA are working on an intergovernmental solution that benefits the researchers.

""They have some concerns but from where I'm standing, or sitting, I think we're trying to eliminate I guess the perception out there in the research community that it's going to be a hindrance for them to conduct research,"" Martin said. ""We absolutely don't want that perception to be there."""

Fresh Trouble: DOJ Subpoenas Boeing about Dreamliner Safety,https://marketrealist.com,['Anirudha Bhagat'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://marketrealist.com/2019/07/fresh-trouble-doj-subpoenas-boeing-about-dreamliner-safety/,"Subpoenaed over Dreamliner safety

The Boeing Company (BA) has encountered yet another problem—this time with its twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner planes. The US Department of Justice has reportedly subpoenaed the airplane maker regarding an ongoing investigation about 787 Dreamliner safety issues.

According to the Seattle Times, the Department of Justice is seeking records relating to 787 Dreamliner productions at Boeing’s South Carolina plant. The Federal Aviation Administration has been investigating two battery overheating incidents from 2013, following which Dreamliner planes remained grounded for several months.

The Department of Justice is investigating the allegations of the New York Times, which raised questions about the production process at Boeing’s South Carolina plant. In April, the Times made allegations about “shoddy work” and “flawed quality control” at the plant based on over one hundred pages of company documents, internal emails, and federal records.

The news agency stated that managers had pressured employees to finish work quickly to avoid production delays. In doing so, managers even ignored safety issues raised by employees. According to the Times‘ June 28 article, the Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed three complaints registered by employees at the South Carolina plant since September last year.

Fresh trouble for Boeing

The Department of Justice’s subpoena over Dreamliner planes has brought new trouble for Boeing, which is already facing worldwide criticism and criminal investigation over its fast-selling 737 MAX jets’ safety issues. The 737 MAX planes have been grounded worldwide since mid-March following two deadly accidents that occurred within the span of five months.

Due to their worldwide grounding, air carriers have denied taking deliveries of the MAX planes until safety concerns are cleared, thereby hurting Boeing’s overall shipments. In May 2019, the company’s overall commercial aircraft deliveries fell 56% year-over-year to 30 planes from 68 in May 2018.

Orders for Boeing 737 MAX planes have remained frozen since mid-March. The company has received some respite via several major orders for its Dreamliner jets in the last three months. During the first half of 2019, the company won ~55 orders for 787 Dreamliner planes. Therefore, any fresh findings regarding safety loopholes in the new model will likely severely impact Boeing’s commercial airplane orders and deliveries, hurting its financial results.

Stock performance

Shares of Boeing fell 2% on July 1. The stock has underperformed the iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), which allocates funds to companies engaged in the manufacturing, assembling, and distribution of aerospace and defense equipment. Boeing has returned 10.5% YTD (year-to-date), while ITA has returned 22.8%.

The stock’s YTD gains are much lower than those of its peers. Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Dynamics (GD), and United Technologies (UTX) have returned 38%, 16.1%, and 23.3%, respectively, YTD."

A Fountain Inn family is calling for help from the Department of Veterans Affairs before they end up without a home. Jacob Skelly served five years in the military, including a tour in Iraq. His time in the service ended when he was honorably discharged and diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He, his wife Autumn and their three kids now live in Fountain Inn. In large part, they rely on the money he collects the first of each month from the VA. ""He's 100 percent disabled, he's on a lot of medications and that's his money for our family,"" said Autumn, inside the family's home Tuesday. They checked their bank account Monday, but didn't find a check. Each month, it comes on the first. ""Find out didn't get paid,"" Skelly said. Nervous, they called the VA for answers. Autumn said she believes they were hacked and said the VA told them the account number for where that check had been deposited changed. ""They did an open investigation, but they told us that it could be six-eight weeks until we hear anything back,"" she said. Skelly said that isn't soon enough. ""By the time we could get that check, we could be evicted. We could lose our vehicles. We have three kids, food and the water bill and the electric bill, all the important things.""She says her husband was distraught, frantically making calls.""He was on the phone with them and he was, like 'What am I supposed to do?' He just started crying and they had no answers for him,"" she said. She's wondering how they were hacked. They want the VA to help and take measures so this doesn't happen to anyone else.

BREAKING … WSJ’S RICH RUBIN: “House Panel Sues U.S. Treasury for Trump Tax Returns”: “The House’s tax-writing committee sued the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service on Tuesday for access to President Trump’s tax returns, hoping federal judges will pry loose records that the administration has refused to hand over.

“The lawsuit from the House Ways and Means Committee puts the clash over Mr. Trump’s tax returns and audit records in the courts, exactly where Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have predicted for months that it would land.” WSJ … The 49-page lawsuit

PENCE CANCELS N.H. TRIP … ALYSSA FARAH (@vppresssec): “Something came up that required the @VP to remain in Washington, DC. It’s no cause for alarm. He looks forward to rescheduling the trip to New Hampshire very soon.”

DUCEY TO NIKE: TAKE A HIKE … ARIZONA REPUBLIC’S MARIA POLLETTA: “Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday slammed Nike for canceling the release of a shoe featuring an early design of the American flag, saying it had ‘bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism.’

“Calling Nike's decision a ‘shameful retreat’ on Twitter, the Republican leader vowed to withdraw millions in incentives recently promised to the company in exchange for opening a manufacturing plant in Goodyear with some 500 full-time jobs. …

“It’s unclear what role the state has in the deal between Nike and Goodyear. Ducey said he’d ordered the Arizona Commerce Authority to withdraw all financial incentives for Nike ‘under their discretion,’ but the development agreement approved by the Goodyear City Council on Monday contains no mention of the Arizona Commerce Authority.

“The deal waives nearly $1 million in permit and plan review fees the city would typically charge, and refers to the city reimbursing $1 million to the company for job creation. It’s possible the reimbursement could come through the Arizona Commerce Authority’s Arizona Competes Fund.” AZ Republic

JULY FOURTH HEADS UP -- @Kevinliptakcnn: “FAA says operations will be suspended at Reagan Airport from 6:15 p.m. to 7:45 p.m. ET for the July 4 flyovers, and again from 9 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. for the fireworks. In past years operations weren’t suspended because there weren't flyovers and fireworks were in another location.”

-- THE PRESIDENT TWEETS at 10:25 a.m.: “Big 4th of July in D.C. ‘Salute to America.’ The Pentagon & our great Military Leaders are thrilled to be doing this & showing to the American people, among other things, the strongest and most advanced Military anywhere in the World. Incredible Flyovers & biggest ever Fireworks!”

A message from The Government of Qatar: Qatar and the U.S. have a strong counter-terrorism relationship. One component of that relationship is the Al Udeid Air Base, which houses over 11,000 soldiers and is central to U.S. operations in the Persian Gulf. Learn more.

WHAT ELSE IS ON THE PRESIDENT’S MIND -- @realDonaldTrump at 10:51 a.m.: “Robert Mueller is being asked to testify yet again. He said he could only stick to the Report, & that is what he would and must do. After so much testimony & total transparency, this Witch Hunt must now end. No more Do Overs.

TRADE WARS … “Li Keqiang, Chinese Premier, Reaches Out to Trump and Business,” by NYT’s Keith Bradsher in Dalian, China: “A top Chinese leader made an unusually public effort on Tuesday to ease trade tensions somewhat with the United States, woo foreign investors and reassure his own country’s citizens that their economy remained on track.

“In meetings during the World Economic Forum in the Chinese port city of Dalian, Premier Li Keqiang, China’s No. 2 official, promised to cut tariffs, loosen limits on foreign investment, protect intellectual property and allow foreign companies to apply for China’s generous subsidies for research and development. … He also said that China would allow foreign financial services companies into its market a year earlier than previously promised, and that it would rewrite many rules on foreign investment.” NYT

-- THE TRUMP EFFECT -- “Japan, a Champion of Free Trade, Takes a Page From Trump’s Playbook,” by WSJ’s Mayumi Negishi in Tokyo and Eun-Young Jeong in Seoul: “Japan’s decision to use its technology exports as a weapon in diplomatic combat signals a strategy upheaval for a resource-poor country long aware of its vulnerability in an interconnected world.

“A day after Tokyo said it would curb exports to South Korea of materials used by semiconductor and display makers there, concern was rising in Japan about damage to the global technology supply chain as well as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s carefully nurtured image as a standard-bearer of free trade. … Mr. Abe has been watching as President Trump used targeted trade restrictions as a tool in economic diplomacy. …

“Japan has elections for Parliament’s upper house on July 21, and Mr. Abe’s move shores up support among his conservative base. Conservative magazines favored by Mr. Abe have been campaigning for tough action against South Korea.” WSJ

A PERSIAN GULF MYSTERY -- “To Evade Sanctions on Iran, Ships Vanish in Plain Sight,” by NYT’s Michael Forsythe and Ronen Bergman: “A week ago, a small tanker ship approached the Persian Gulf after a 19-day voyage from China. The captain, as required by international rules, reported the ship’s position, course, speed and another key detail: It was riding high in the water, meaning it was probably empty. Then the Chinese-owned ship, the Sino Energy 1, went silent and essentially vanished from the grid.

“It reported in again on Sunday, near the spot where it had vanished six days earlier, only now it was heading east, away from the Strait of Hormuz near Iran. If past patterns hold, the captain will soon report that it is riding low in the water, meaning its tanks are likely full. As the Trump administration’s sanctions on Iranian oil and petrochemical products have taken hold, some of the world’s shipping fleets have defied the restrictions by ‘going dark’ when they pick up cargo in Iranian ports, according to commercial analysts who track shipping data and intelligence from authorities in Israel, a country that backs the Trump crackdown.” NYT

NEWS YOU CAN USE -- “You Filed Returns. The IRS Compiled the Data. Here’s How the New Tax Law Is Working,” by WSJ’s Richard Rubin and Anthony DeBarros: “In the aggregate, the tax-filing season looked the same as it did the year before, with 79% of taxpayers getting refunds averaging $2,879, down only slightly from 80% and $2,908. But those totals mask some significant variation by income, according to newly released IRS statistics from tax returns filed through May 23.

“These preliminary tallies provide the first hard data from the government about the actual refunds, deductions and taxes reported at different income levels in the new system. … The fresh data shows that while refund statistics barely budged for lower- and middle-income workers, real movement occurred toward the upper end of the income distribution. Average refunds for taxpayers making between $100,000 and $250,000 dropped 10%, while average refunds for those between $250,000 and $500,000 rose by 11%.” WSJ

2020 WATCH -- “Trump and R.N.C. Raised $105 Million in 2nd Quarter, Outdoing Obama,” by NYT’s Annie Karni and Maggie Haberman: “Mr. Trump and his committees raised $54 million, they said, and the R.N.C. raised $51 million. The campaign officials did not say how many individual donors had contributed, or how many gave money in increments of $200 or less. The official report, which will include spending, will be filed with the Federal Election Commission on July 15.” NYT

-- HOLLY OTTERBEIN: “Sanders trails Buttigieg by millions in second-quarter money chase”: “Bernie Sanders raised $18 million over the past three months, his campaign announced Tuesday — trailing significantly behind Pete Buttigieg after leading the Democratic pack in the first quarter of 2019.

“Staffers said the Vermont senator has received more than 1 million individual contributions this year, and 45 percent of his donors are under the age of 40. He also transferred $6 million from previous campaign accounts, his aides said. Sanders' average donation was $18, less than his $27 per person contribution that became a rallying cry for him in 2016. More than 99 percent of the donations were $100 or less, his campaign said.” POLITICO

-- HOLLYWOOD PETE … “Mayor Pete Buttigieg is filming a campaign documentary,” by Axios’ Alexi McCammond and Sara Fischer: “Story Syndicate, a new production company founded by veteran filmmakers Liz Garbus and Dan Cogan, is creating a documentary on Mayor Pete Buttigieg, according to sources with knowledge of the film. …

“The independently backed documentary details Buttigieg’s rise to national attention, chronicling his stops on the campaign trail. Crews have already begun filming at several of Buttigieg’s campaign events, and attended the first Democratic debate in Miami to gather footage. … Sources say its future is contingent on the outcome of Buttigieg’s campaign.” Axios

-- FIRST PERSON … KATELYN BURNS for POLITICO MAGAZINE: “I’m Trans. The 2020 Candidates Don’t Know How to Pander to Me”: “The trans voting population isn’t large enough to swing an election or contribute significantly to a campaign’s bottom line. As a trans person, it’s easy for me to forget that these candidates aren’t competing for my vote as much as they’re trying to appeal to the woke progressives who have recently taken up the cause on behalf of the trans community.

“Incoherent promises might play well with the progressive base, but I’ve yet to hear a candidate effectively speak out about trans issues beyond calling out Trump’s trans military ban. Selling campaign Pride merchandise is one thing, but offering material plans to roll back Trump’s attacks on our community would be so much more compelling. Under this administration, my community has lost educational protections, protections in homeless shelters and the ability to serve in the military. Additionally, if we lose at the Supreme Court this fall, we stand to lose employment protections, and if a recently proposed administration rule is finalized, health care protections.” POLITICO Magazine

MARKEY BECOMES A MARK … STEPHANIE MURRAY in Boston: “‘That’s a Senate seat waiting for someone to take it’: The left targets Ed Markey,” by Stephanie Murray: “Recent polling shows Markey’s support among Massachusetts Democratic and unenrolled voters is a little shakier than he would like. … The senator’s favorability rating is an anemic 38 percent, with 25 percent of voters expressing an unfavorable view of him. More than a third of voters are either undecided (22 percent) or have never heard of him (14 percent), a bad omen for a pol who’s been in Congress for more than 40 years. …

“Markey isn’t the only incumbent in the state’s all-Democratic delegation looking over his shoulder. The well of pent-up progressive talent is also generating a handful of House primary challenges, including to longtime Reps. Richard Neal and Stephen Lynch, and four-term Rep. Joe Kennedy III.” POLITICO

THE POLICY PRIMARY -- “How Cory Booker would ‘virtually eliminate’ immigration detention,” by Ted Hesson: “Booker would phase out the use of private detention centers over a three-year period. The move would greatly reduce detention space, since for-profit companies operated roughly two-thirds of all beds in 2015, according to a report last year by the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute.

“Booker also proposes winding down detention contracts with state and county jails over the same three-year period. Under Booker’s plan, most immigrants would be monitored using ‘alternatives to detention.’ Immigration and Customs Enforcement currently uses various detention alternatives in a limited manner, including ankle bracelets, bonds, and check-ins by phone and in person.” POLITICO

“Huang Wan is known as Fiona and is married to the son of imprisoned former Chinese security chief Zhou Yongkang.

This is not the way to move USDA agencies out of Washington,https://thehill.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/451238-this-is-not-the-way-to-move-usda-agencies-out-of-washington,"The public debate over the announced move of the USDA Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture has focused on whether a move is sensible. Equally important is how this move has been planned and implemented.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue George (Sonny) Ervin PerdueThis is not the way to move USDA agencies out of Washington American farmers can't afford this administration's climate apathy Overnight Energy: New EPA rule could expand officials weighing in on FOIA requests | Trump plan to strip conservation fund gets bipartisan pushback | Agriculture chief downplays climate concerns MORE announced on June 13 that the 80 percent of staff at the two agencies will move to Kansas City by the end of September. He justified the move as putting the agencies closer to their agricultural constituency and as saving taxpayer money. I am one of the agricultural economists who wrote a critique of the USDA cost-benefit analysis, finding two major costs that were omitted from the USDA justification.

Our critique has been cited widely for disputing the USDA claim that the move would save taxpayer money. Two flaws in the measurement of costs drove our findings. The first was that the USDA analysis inflated the cost of remaining in Washington, D.C. It identified Kansas City as the least expensive place to locate outside of Washington that met its relocation criteria.

ADVERTISEMENT

By failing to compare this to the least expensive place inside Washington, they stacked the deck. The USDA real estate cost estimate would fall by $57-92 million in current 2019 dollars if it had compared sites outside the Beltway to the kind of alternatives that the General Services Administration would have identified in the District of Columbia, had it been asked to do so.

The second big cost we identified — and the one that turned the bottom line to a negative for taxpayers — resulted not from where these agencies are located, but rather from how the whole move process is being managed. This is the cost to the nation of lost research output when highly skilled researchers quit. On June 26, officials from the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents staff at both agencies, announced that internal surveys indicate that 80 percent of ERS researchers plan to resign or retire rather than move.

Even if half to three-quarters of relocating ERS and NIFA employees were to depart, as our analysis assumed, rebuilding expertise and productivity would be no easy job. These employees are overwhelmingly Ph.D. holders. They are not local hires in the Kansas City area. They are experts recruited in a national market. To attract replacements, the ERS and NIFA will have to compete with universities, research institutes, corporations and other federal agencies. Based on how competitive is the Ph.D job market in agricultural economics, we estimated that it will take four years of hiring 75-100 researchers annually to rebuild those agencies. Most of the new hires will be newly minted Ph.Ds, so they will need several years each to build the expertise in national scale agricultural issues and analytical methods of the employees who are departing. We calculate the monetary value of the lost research that is either not conducted or that trainees conduct less efficiently at $141 million - 203 million in 2019 dollars.

What is the value of agricultural and food research not conducted? I have written elsewhere about how much of what we know about America’s food comes from USDA research. Measuring economic values is tricky when markets are missing, and economists delight in quibbling over methods. Where we all agree is that there is a hidden cost when important work ceases to be performed.

Indeed, the very reasons that the United States government has formed agencies to perform research are that 1) this work would either not be done or not done equally well in the private sector, and 2) the benefits of the research work exceed its cost to taxpayers. So, when staff vacancies interrupt that research, taxpayers lose.

ADVERTISEMENT

Moving these agencies out of Washington, did not have to trigger a hemorrhage of expertise. We teach our undergraduate students that the functions of management are planning, implementation, and control. Had the consideration of an agency move begun as a planning process that engaged agency staff to weigh the benefits and costs of moving, they would have been aware, and they would have felt included and valued. Instead, they felt alarmed and alienated when Purdue announced on Aug. 8, 2018, that they would be relocated.

Many organizations with highly skilled employees make special efforts to retain experienced staff. A common way to do that while moving is to open a branch office and to entice seasoned employees to move with attractive incentives and time to work out the details.

Consider the gradual way that Amazon, which also relies upon a highly skilled workforce, is expanding into new facilities across the Potomac from where the USDA is extracting ERS and NIFA. Amazon is planning a ten-year buildup into its HQ2 in northern Virginia; USDA’s implementation approach was to give employees 32 days to decide and less than three months to pack up and move to Kansas City.

The sad truth is that if done right, the relocation of the ERS and NIFA outside of Washington, might have made sense for America’s taxpayers, farmers and food consumers. The plan’s failure to pass muster arises from the massive costs of alienating an expert workforce to the point that most quit. So far, about a quarter of ERS and NIFA employees are gone. The cost in lost staff and morale is high, but it is not too late to turn back.

We have reached the 11th hour. If Perdue wishes to hold on to USDA research capacity in agricultural markets, policy, and science, the time has come to cancel the relocation plan and stem the staff exodus. We may never know if moving these agencies outside Washington would have made sense for American’s taxpayers. What we do know is that as it has been managed, this move fails the benefit-cost test.

EPA challenges Flint over staffing at water treatment plant,https://www.mlive.com,['Ron Fonger'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2019/07/epa-challenges-flint-over-staffing-at-water-treatment-plant.html,"FLINT, MI -- More than three years after the city’s water crisis was recognized as a national emergency, Flint still doesn’t appear to have hired enough employees to insure its water treatment plant is properly operated, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says.

But a city spokeswoman says it’s the federal agency that “simply has its facts wrong.”

In a June 26 letter to Mayor Karen Weaver and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, the EPA asks “what the city will do to demonstrate that the Flint (plant) has the necessary, capable and qualified personnel on board so that the (Dort Highway plant) is properly operated at all times.”

Reports from treatment plant operators to the state have shown an operator trainee quit, causing inadequate staffing; that employees have been scheduled to work up to 80 hours per week; and that workers are fatigued “due to low staffing and long work weeks.”

Defiant mayor will fight 'unwarranted' oversight of Flint water system ""This man-made crisis occurred because the state, over the stringent objections of the city and its people, imposed its misguided policies on the people of the city of Flint,"" Weaver's letter says. ""The city is committed to remediating and recovering from this crisis ... However, this proposed (order) does nothing to substantively further the city's recovery and instead appears to be retaliatory and punitive.""

City spokeswoman Candice Mushatt said administrative changes at EPA during the past several months have led to erroneous information in the letter.

“These concerns were addressed and discussed originally with EGLE ...,” Mushatt said in an email to MLive-The Flint Journal. “As a result and through our regular voluntary agreement tracking meetings with EGLE and reporting this information to the EPA during monthly calls, we were able to address those concerns.”

“The resolution through the city’s (Department of Public Works) director, was to implement a four-foreman schedule, which will limit overtime to one shift,” she said. “A new operator foreman was trained and a day shift operator was also assigned as foreman.”

In a Monday, July 1, posting on its web site, EGLE said a resolution to accept funding and pay for the continued training of plant operators was also headed to the Flint City Council at its next meeting, that operator trainees who passed written exams last month must next take physical exams, and that all foremen who took a certification exam on May 30 passed.

Flint to keep contractor at water plant after city staff fail operator exams ""The city intends to begin a new recruitment process to hire an internal, permanent (operator in charge),"" Weaver wrote in a June 11 letter to Eric Oswald, director of DEQ's Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance Division.

Flint’s staffing at the treatment plant has been a federal concern since the EPA issued an order in January 2016, spelling out required actions for the city water system.

In her June 26 letter to Weaver, Cheryl Newton, EPA’s deputy regional administrator, said Flint has worked to try to resolve its staffing issues but appeared reluctant to hire additional staff “for fear of having to lay them off when the (water system) becomes more automated.”

“However, the city has yet to demonstrate that this requirement has been met on a continuous basis,” Newton’s letter says of staffing issues. “While the city continues its efforts to hire and train staff, the ability to provide adequate coverage on an ongoing basis is an EPA concern.”

In 2017, EPA also raised what it called “continued and significant concerns” that too few people were working in the water system and asked the city for a plan “to ensure ... the necessary, capable and qualified personnel” are hired.

Mushatt said the city expects to respond to the Newton letter this week."
Trump administration drops bid to put citizenship question on 2020 Census,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'Tara Bahrampour', 'Ann E. Marimow', 'The Washington Post', 'This Story Was Originally Published At Washingtonpost.Com.']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/2020-census-will-not-include-citizenship-question-doj-confirms/,"WASHINGTON – The Trump administration has dropped plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, the Justice Department said Tuesday, just days after the Supreme Court described the rationale for the question as “contrived.”

The decision was made after officials determined that there would not be enough time to continue the legal battle and meet the printing deadlines for the census questionnaire, according to people familiar with the matter.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Tuesday that “I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.”

The decision to eliminate the question was a victory for civil rights advocates concerned that the query would lead to an inaccurate count of immigrant communities that could skew political representation and federal funding.

“In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, the government had no choice but to proceed with printing the 2020 census forms without a citizenship question. Everyone in America counts in the census, and today’s decision means we all will,” said Dale Ho of the American Civil Liberties Union, the lawyer who argued the Supreme Court case.

The fate of the question has been the subject of legal and political wrangling since March 2018, when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced he planned to add it to the decennial survey, sparking a half-dozen lawsuits from states, cities, civil rights groups and others.

Just last week, President Donald Trump responded to the Supreme Court’s ruling temporarily blocking the question by saying he would seek to delay the census to give administration officials time to come up with a better explanation for why it should include a citizenship question.

Trump expressed disbelief again on Monday that the question could not be included and told reporters at the White House, “I think it’s very important – to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal? I think there’s a big difference, to me, between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.”

Instead of a delay, government lawyers by email notified those challenging the planned Census question of the administration’s decision to proceed without it.

The Census Bureau has started printing the questionnaires without the question, Ross said. He added that his “focus, and that of the bureau and the entire department, is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

Soon after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration, Justice Department officials said privately they determined they would have no choice but to drop the question from the 2020 census.

That is because the printer had a deadline that was merely days away, and officials knew there was no way that the court process could resolve favorably for them before that deadline, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss still pending litigation.

When Trump tweeted that he would explore delaying the census, some Justice Department officials were left scratching their heads, they said, because such a move would be legally impossible.

The White House asked the Justice Department how it might be able to add the question, including by possibly delaying the census, and the department explained that it wasn’t realistic or tenable, given time constraints and the Supreme Court’s ruling, said a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke under condition of anonymity because the person wasn’t authorized to speak about it publicly.

“I have to think that sanity prevailed with respect to the incredible disruption to our representational democracy that delaying the census would have caused,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee. “I doubt anyone at the Justice or Commerce departments could figure out how to overcome the constitutional and statutory hurdles.”

Critics of the question, including some inside the Census Bureau, said it could cause an undercount of millions of people in immigrant communities who would be afraid to return the form, leading to an inaccurate that could skew representation and apportionment in favor of Republican areas.

The government had said it needed the question in order to enforce the Voting Rights Act, and Ross initially told Congress he decided to add it in response to a December 2017 request from the Justice Department. But documents uncovered in the lawsuits suggested Ross was pushing for it months earlier, and that he pressed the Justice Department to issue the request.

In the Supreme Court’s splintered ruling Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that federal agencies must offer “genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” He was joined in by the court’s four liberal justices.

Data from the census, which every U.S. household is required to fill out, is used by businesses and by the government to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars in federal spending per year; it is also used to determine Congressional apportionment and redistricting. The form that goes to all households has not included a question related to citizenship since 1950.

Thomas Wolf, of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said Tuesday that the push to include such a question would have a lasting impact.

“Even if the citizenship question is dead, it has left damage in its wake. The question has not only distracted necessary attention for over a year from other key aspects of census preparation, but also raised widespread fears about the safety of participating in the census,” Wolf said in an e-mail.

“The administration must refocus its attention immediately on making sure that every person in this country is counted. It can start by launching a nation-wide advertising campaign to ensure everyone that no citizenship question will appear on the 2020 Census.”

The notice from the government came just hours before lawyers were scheduled for a conference call in a separate case in Maryland also challenging the Census question.

Judge George Hazel, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland in Greenbelt, was one of three federal judges who ruled earlier this year against the question, saying Ross violated administrative law and the enumeration clause of the Constitution by proposing to ask the citizenship status of household members on the form.

The issues before Hazel were different from those heard by the Supreme Court. The government’s path to adding the question had become more difficult in May after new evidence emerged showing a deceased Republican redistricting strategist had been in touch with some administration officials over adding the question.

The strategist, Thomas Hofeller, was author of a 2015 study that found adding the question would likely help Republicans and white voters in subsequent redistricting decisions; he had also been in touch with a census official about adding a citizenship question to the form, according to files found on hard drives belonging to him.

Hazel had ruled that plaintiffs had not provided sufficient evidence for charges that the government had conspired or intended to discriminate when it added the question, and plaintiffs had appealed.

After the Hofeller evidence emerged, however, Hazel said the new evidence merited further consideration, and a federal appeals court returned the case to his court. The Maryland case could have tied up the question in a separate legal battle that might have eventually reached the Supreme Court in its own right.

During the call with Hazel on Tuesday, government lawyers did not explain why the citizenship question was pulled off the table, said Denise Hulett, senior counsel with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who also was on the call.

She said Hazel asked for a written stipulation by Monday in the case before him that the Commerce Department “has given up its fight entirely” to include the question in the 2020 count.

Shankar Duraiswamy, the lead attorney in the Maryland case, called the Trump administration’s reversal Tuesday a victory for American democracy.

“A citizenship question would have risked a massive undercount in areas with large numbers of Latinos and immigrants, depriving them of their right to equal political representation and fair share of federal funding,” he said in an email.

Here's what it means: The VA is doubling down on telehealth efforts to expand its reach among rural vets.

The VA conducted over 1 million telehealth consultations last year, and a strategic partnership with Verizon should help it reach its lofty telehealth goals. Six million unique patients received VA treatment last year — a difficult task given there are only 172 VA medical centers nationwide — and telehealth could effectively expand VA providers' reach: The VA aims for all of its care providers to be telehealth enabled by the end of fiscal year 2021, according to a 2018 Veterans Health Administration notice.

The VA is concerned that there are fewer care options for rural vets — but hopes 4G-powered telehealth could provide reinforcements. The VA's major telehealth investments are almost primarily geared toward addressing the needs of the 4.7 million US veterans living in rural areas: Rural veterans may need to travel great distances between their homes and points of care — a problem exacerbated by uncertainty around the 21% of rural hospitals currently facing closure. Also, 27% of rural vets don't use the internet at home, likely due in part to a lack of broadband coverage: Nearly 40% of individuals in rural communities don't have broadband access compared with 4% in urban areas, per The Conversation. Nevertheless, the VA has had success with telehealth in rural areas: Of the 1 million telehealth visits last year, over half were made by rural veterans.

The bigger picture: Verizon likely sees the massive VA patient base as a proof-of-concept for a larger telehealth play on the horizon.

Verizon isn't the only major telecom player interested in telehealth, but its superior 4G network could still give it the long-term edge. In addition to its partnership with Verizon, the VA has previously tied up with two other major players in the telecom space — T-Mobile and Sprint— on telehealth initiatives. However, Verizon performed better than the competition in terms of 4G mobile video streaming, and it also had the widest coverage area, according to insights from OpenSignal.

And free 4G access for veterans could be just the first step in a larger 5G telehealth play from Verizon.Of the three telecom providers linked up with the VA, only Verizon has a web presence fully dedicated to 5G in healthcare. As we've previously covered, 5G is the next step in mobile connectivity, and it's prepped to have a major impact on the efficacy and speed of digital health tools. I (Zach) think we could see Verizon leveraging 4G performance data from VA Video Connect in attempts to work out a more ambitious, paid contract to provide 5G digital health services to VA medical centers in the near future. However, Verizon will need to improve its 5G network before that point and could find itself competing with the reach of a potentially merged T-Mobile/Sprint.

Department of Homeland Security must be ready to combat new and emerging threats,https://thehill.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/homeland-security/451345-department-of-homeland-security-must-be-ready-to-combat,"The threats America faces today are vast, evolving, and from new adversaries. We must take steps to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the agency tasked with identifying these threats and preventing harm to our nation, is able to attack these threats head on.

While DHS may be our nation’s newest department, it by no means our most modern. The department was created in the chaos of 9/11 to respond to the rise of global jihadist operations. While DHS has largely found success in stopping those threats before they ever reach our shores, it must today be prepared to handle cyberhackers, rival nation-states, and transnational criminal organizations, in addition to global jihadists.

Rising powers are using asymmetrical attacks to weaken our leadership role and global influence. China, Russia, Iran and North Korea all have state-sponsored programs designed to harm the United States. From satellites to social media, there isn’t an area free from intense competition.

For example, online influence efforts can destabilize our neighbors, affect migration flows and threaten the integrity of our elections here at home. China’s Belt and Road Initiative – infrastructure and investment initiatives across Europe and Asia – is holding our foreign partners hostage through cheap, state-back loans. Intellectual property theft means American innovation is being lifted straight out of our laboratories.

These threats either didn’t exist or weren’t on DHS’s radar when it was created in 2002.

Further, we are facing new challenges from terrorism at home and abroad. New technology has made online radicalization free, easy and anonymous. Acts of terrorism can be simple and viral. “Lone wolf” actors are difficult to identify and stop.

We need a department that can detect, prevent and respond to these emerging threats head on. To achieve this goal, recently I announced the American Security Agenda – a long-term effort by House Homeland Security Republicans to modernize and equip DHS for the threats of today as it prepares for the threats of tomorrow.

The American Security Agenda is founded on three pillars: giving DHS with the authority it needs to stay ahead of emerging threats; providing the department and its state, local and private sector partners with resources to deter terrorism; and improving the structure and management of DHS so that it can combat evolving threats.

Homeland Security Committee Republicans have already introduced five bills this in recent days. Their objectives range from securing our supply chains, identifying and mitigating transit threats, to combatting transnational security organizations.

However, these bills are just the start: more proposals are already in the works that we hope to introduce soon as part of our agenda.

This initiative imagines a DHS that is faster, smarter, and better equipped to preempt and combat rivals and adversaries across the globe. The American Security Agenda’s ultimate goal is the continued security of our homeland.

House Democrats sue Treasury for Trump’s tax returns,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/02/house-democrats-sue-treasury-for-trumps-tax-returns/,"WASHINGTON — House Democrats have upped the ante in their quest to see President Trump’s tax returns.

On Tuesday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) sued the Treasury Department in order to force the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the president’s returns.

Trump has never publicly released any of his tax returns, a break from presidential candidate tradition. He initially said during the 2016 campaign cycle that he would not be releasing them because he was under audit.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — one of the president’s longest-serving cabinet members — has denied multiple requests from Democrats to turn over the returns since the party took back the House in January.

He ignored a subpoena from Neal’s committee for six years of returns in May. He argued that the request lacked a “legitimate legislative purpose.”

In June, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel issued a 33-page opinion backing Mnuchin, arguing that because Neal wanted to make the president’s tax returns public, the request lacked a legitimate legislative function.

The Democrats filed the lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. It names the Treasury Department, the IRS, Mnuchin and Charles Rettig, commissioner of the IRS, as defendants.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Steven Groves labeled the filing a “sham lawsuit.”

“While the crisis at our southern border worsens, Democrats continue to focus their efforts on presidential harassment,” Groves told The Post via email.

“They are only interested in partisan games. The only thing more political than the committee’s crusade for the president’s tax returns is its sham lawsuit.”"

Vandal lists 'Putin' as 45th president on Eden Park monument,https://www.cincinnati.com,"['Cameron Knight', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/crime/crime-and-courts/2019/07/02/vandal-lists-putin-45th-president-park-monument/1625192001/,"CLOSE

The plaque in Presidential Grove in Eden Park was recently vandalized. (Photo: Used with permission)

A vandal has listed ""Putin"" as the 45th President of the United States on an Eden Park monument, park officials confirmed Monday.

A political statement writ in Sharpie got attention on Reddit Monday when someone posted a photo of the plaque in the park's Presidential Grove.

The simple lists of presidents ended with ""45 Putin,"" presumably referring to Russia President Vladimir Putin.

Trees have been planted in honor of each president at Presidential Grove since 1882. Many presidents handpicked the species of tree planted in the grove to represent them.

It's unclear when the vandalism took place, but the actual 45th President Donald Trump and Putin made headlines together last week at G-20 summit in Japan.

Trump was criticized for appearing to joke about Russia's meddling in the 2016 election with Putin.

Trump turned to Putin and wagged his finger with a smile.

""Don't meddle in the election, president,"" Trump said as cameras clicked and reporters shouted questions. Putin laughed.

Rocky Merz, business services division manager for the Cincinnati Park Board, said Monday he was aware of the vandalism and that it would be cleaned up Tuesday.

He explained Trump's nameplate was not damaged or removed from the plaque because the nameplates are only added at the end of a president's term. That president's tree is also planted at that time.

Merz said the plaque there has been vandalized many times over the years, and the targets have been presidents on both sides of the aisle.

House Judiciary calls for DOJ inspector general investigation into discrimination claims at FBI Academy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-judiciary-calls-for-doj-inspector-general-investigation-into-discrimination-claims-at-fbi-academy,"Bipartisan leaders of the House Judiciary Committee called for the Justice Department’s inspector general to open an investigation into allegations of discrimination against women at the FBI Academy earlier this week following a federal lawsuit alleging that Quantico is run like a “good old boy network.""

Sixteen former female trainees at the FBI filed a lawsuit in late May claiming that they and dozens of other women had been sexually harassed, subjected to a hostile work environment and outdated gender stereotypes, wrongly kicked out of the training program, unfairly forced to resign or made to think that the continuing the training would be futile, suffered retaliation, and more.

And top members of the congressional committee tasked with overseeing the FBI called the allegations “disturbing” and said that, if true, “such conduct cannot be tolerated.”

The letter, signed this week by two Democrats and two Republicans — Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York and ranking member Doug Collins of Georgia as well as Karen Bass of California and John Ratcliffe of Texas — said they believed America’s diversity should be reflected by the FBI’s agents, emphasized that the FBI’s selection process should be free from bias, and called on DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to look into it.

“We must ensure potential agents not be deterred from applying because they fear the possibility of such treatment,” they wrote. “We believe these detailed allegations require an investigation into the FBI’s training and selection prices for new agents.”

A representative for the FBI told the Washington Examiner that the bureau is “unable to comment on litigation” but that “the FBI is committed to fostering a work environment where all of our employees are valued and respected.”

“Diversity is one of our core values, and to effectively accomplish our mission of protecting the American people we need people of different genders, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives,” the representative said.

The federal lawsuit filed by female former trainees in May is directed at the training policies at the FBI and the conduct of its instructors at its agent training facility in Quantico, Virginia. The lawsuit claims FBI training guidelines are “highly subjective” and that “the uneven power dynamic at the FBI Academy puts female trainees at a distinct disadvantage.” And the lawsuit claims the subjective guidelines lets instructors misrepresent scenarios and fail women.

The complaint also alleges that when one of the women told former FBI Director James Comey of the allegations, Comey denied that discriminatory behavior was occurring and “instead suggested she use her ‘pain’ to reflect on her strengths and weaknesses.”

Mark Morgan, a former deputy assistant director at the FBI and the new acting chief of Customs and Border Protection, is also mentioned in the lawsuit.

David Shaffer, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told the Washington Examiner the FBI Academy relies upon “a completely subjective system that allows instructors to give rise to their own biases and beliefs with no accountability and oversight.”

Shaffer said that a common dynamic is that when a female trainee explains or defends her actions to an instructor, she is viewed being argumentative while when a male trainee does he is seen as standing up for himself.

Statistics provided by the FBI show that 20% of the special agents who are brought into the FBI are female. For the 2019 cycle, the FBI says that women made up 32% of those in the special agent basic field training course and 36% of those who had applied to be special agents. The FBI says that its 2019 target for female applications had been 33%, and the numbers reflect improvements from the 26% of special agent applications in the 2018 cycle and 22% in the 2017 cycle.

The FBI says that the total number of those who make it through the entire FBI special agent process — including application, training, and graduation — has held steady at just 6%.

If the DOJ inspector takes up the issue of discrimination at Quantico, it wouldn’t be the first time. A 2003 inspector general report which looked into allegations of disciplinary double standards at the FBI uncovered instances of instructors making inappropriate comments towards some trainees.

When asked by the Washington Examiner whether the DOJ inspector general would be launching an inquiry following the request from congressional leaders, the watchdog office declined to say.

Shaffer said that an inspector general investigation “should be done of course,” but he said that Congress needed to take action too.

“They need to be doing their oversight of the agency and asking the hard questions — and not relying on the FBI to investigate themselves,” Shaffer said.

DOE Makes It Easier for Predatory For-Profit Coding Schools to Dupe Students,https://insights.dice.com,"['Nate Swanner', 'Nate Has Written For Publications Like Slashgear', 'The Next Web. When Not Opining About Tech', 'He S Likely Knee-Deep In Swift Methods']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://insights.dice.com/2019/07/02/doe-easier-predatory-coding-schools/,"Department of Education (DOE) Secretary Betsy DeVos is making a critical rule change that will allow for-profit schools and career certification providers to prey on unwitting students. It could also mean the proliferation of even more suspect coding schools.

In the summary of a document titled “Program Integrity: Gainful Employment,” the Office of Postsecondary Education, Department of Education writes:

The Secretary of the Department of Education (Department) amends the regulations on institutional eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), and the Student Assistance General Provisions to rescind the Department’s gainful employment (GE) regulations (2014 Rule).

The rule change is set to take affect July 1, 2020.

The “Gainful Employment” (GE) rule is a critical one. It requires for-profit colleges to make debt-to-earnings ratios available to students or potential students. This per-program ratio displays students’ earning potential so they could better understand their earnings and debt carried after graduation. (It was also a mandatory disclosure for schools that wanted federal funding.)

For example, if someone were to sign up for a 10-month web developer program at a cost of $18,000, the Gainful Employment rule meant the school would have to tell them what they’d make upon graduation (if they even found a job). The student (or potential student) would then know they were assuming $18,000 in debt, in addition to their potential earnings, which allowed them to make a more informed decision about whether they could afford the program.

Schools had to publicly post their debt-to-earnings figures, too, which the DOE now says is unfair. From its report:

The Department has determined that the GE regulations rely on a debt-to-earnings (D/E) rates formula that is fundamentally flawed and inconsistent with the requirements of currently available student loan repayment programs, fails to properly account for factors other than institutional or program quality that directly influence student earnings and other outcomes, fails to provide transparency regarding program-level debt and earnings outcomes for all academic programs, and wrongfully targets some academic programs and institutions while ignoring other programs that may result in lesser outcomes and higher student debt. Although the GE regulation applies to less-than-degree programs at non-profit institutions, this represents a very small percentage of academic programs offered by non-profit institutions

The DOE is arguing that for-profit schools are playing by different rules than non-profit schools, and that’s unfair. It’s also asserting a four-year degree in Computer Science and a 10-month certification in web development are not the same thing… but that both institutions should follow the same governance for reporting data, because for-profit schools are wrongfully targeted by the GE rule.

But there’s good reason for the GE rule: For-profit schools are notoriously suspect; for-profit certification provider ITT folded because it couldn’t display an appropriate debt-to-earnings ratio, which affected its federal funding and financial aid status. More recently, Woz U has raised eyebrows.

The DOE also tried to argue students’ inability to repay debt from for-profit schools was a socioeconomic concern, leaning on numbers that show those who enroll at for-profit schools (“proprietary,” in the snippet below) are less likely to come from stable, financially solvent backgrounds:

Students who enroll at proprietary institutions are far more likely to be financially independent (80 percent vs. 59 percent); part of an underrepresented minority group (52 percent vs. 44 percent); or a single parent (33 percent vs. 18 percent) than students enrolled at community colleges. Students enrolled at proprietary institutions are also slightly less likely to have a parent who completed high school (84 percent vs. 87 percent); and are much less likely to have a parent who completed a bachelor’s degree or higher (22 percent vs. 30 percent). These differences in characteristics may explain disparities in student outcomes, including higher borrowing levels and student loan defaults among students who enroll at proprietary institutions.

If your takeaway is that GE should apply to all post-secondary education programs, the DOE says that’s impossible because:

“The Department could not simply expand the GE regulations to include all title IV programs since the term ‘gainful employment’ is found only in section 102 of the [Higher Education Act of 1965]. This section extends title IV eligibility to non-degree programs at non-profit and institutions and all programs at proprietary institutions, and at the same time restricts the application of the GE regulations to those same programs and institutions. Therefore, without a statutory change, there was no way to expand the GE regulations to apply to all institutions.”

TL;DR: The DOE wants to take GE away rather than expand on it. Instead of making all schools more responsible, it wants to allow for-profit schools more opportunity to obfuscate their true value (or lack thereof) to students.

Third-party services such as CIRR serve as a destination to view the same data reported by schools under the GE rule, but it’s all based on voluntary reporting. If schools aren’t required to disclose such data, they may just not go through the trouble… or worse, use voluntary reporting as a means to outright lie.

Ditching the GE rule may be the most alarming step for DeVos’s DOE in its continued march to allow for-profit schools (including coding schools) to proliferate, but it’s not the first. In April, the DOE ended a program that forced for-profit schools to set aside funds in the event the school abruptly closed. This program was designed so those schools couldn’t take federal funding and run, but DeVos made it possible for schools to operate as fly-by-night swindlers.

As for the ‘why’ in all of this, we should remember Betsy DeVos was heavily invested in a company contracted by the DOE to hound students about loan repayments before being appointed to her post as Secretary – though it’s not clear if she’s completely divested from her holdings, or if they’re just in a trust to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. She also has (or had) holdings in an investment firm with direct ties to Laureate Education, which boasts of 875,000 students worldwide, including Minneapolis-based Walden University and its 40,000-plus students."
"U.S. slaps duties on steel from Vietnam originally produced in South Korea, Taiwan",https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-vietnam/us-slaps-duties-on-steel-from-vietnam-originally-produced-in-south-korea-taiwan-idUSKCN1TX2TE,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday it would impose duties of up to 456% on certain steel produced in South Korea or Taiwan that are then shipped to Vietnam for minor processing and finally exported to the United States.

The agency said in a statement that it had found corrosion-resistant steel products and cold-rolled steel produced in Vietnam using substrate of South Korean or Taiwanese origin had circumvented U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties.

The duties on South Korean and Taiwanese products were imposed in December 2015 and February 2016. Since those dates through April 2019, shipments of corrosion-resistant steel products and cold-rolled steel from Vietnam to the United States had increased by 332 percent and 916 percent compared with similar periods immediately before, the statement said.

It said the Commerce Department inquiry was initiated at the request of ArcelorMittal SA’s (MT.AS) U.S. unit, Nucor Corp (NUE.N), United States Steel Corp (X.N), Steel Dynamics Inc (STLD.O), California Steel Industries, and AK Steel Corp."
