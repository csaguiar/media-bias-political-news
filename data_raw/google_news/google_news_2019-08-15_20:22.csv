Israel Denies Entry to Omar and Tlaib After Trump’s Call to Block Them,https://www.nytimes.com,['Isabel Kershner'],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/world/middleeast/trump-israel-omar-tlaib.html,"His ambassador to Israel, David M. Friedman, said in a statement that the boycott movement was “no less than economic warfare” and that Israel had “every right to protect its borders” against activists who support it.

In lobbying a foreign government to bar members of the United States Congress, Mr. Trump crossed yet another line that other presidents generally respected. No matter how virulent their differences at home, presidents have traditionally not enlisted the help of overseas allies to take action against domestic political adversaries.

But Mr. Trump has demonstrated time and again over the last two and a half years that he sees little need to observe the norms that governed previous occupants of the White House, dismissing them either as antiquated or irrelevant if he recognized their existence at all. To Mr. Trump, politics is a contact sport with few limits and Ms. Omar and Ms. Tlaib have become two of his favorite targets.

In a statement, Ms. Omar called the actions by Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu “an affront” that had limited the ability of members of Congress to learn from both Israelis and Palestinians.

“Sadly, this is not a surprise given the public positions of Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has consistently resisted peace efforts, restricted the freedom of movement of Palestinians, limited public knowledge of the brutal realities of the occupation and aligned himself with Islamophobes like Donald Trump,” she said.

“The irony of the ‘only democracy’ in the Middle East making such a decision,” she said, “is that it is both an insult to democratic values and a chilling response to a visit by government officials from an allied nation.”"
Trump's purge of his own national security team is almost complete,https://www.cnn.com,['Zachary Cohen'],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/politics/dni-coats-gordon-last-day/index.html,"Washington (CNN) When Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and his deputy Sue Gordon leave their offices for the last time on Thursday, it will mark a turning point for an administration that has already endured the highest level of senior staff turnover in history.

Both Coats, who took on the role of intelligence chief in 2017, and Gordon, who started as his deputy a few months later, have outlasted a slew of their national security colleagues who left the Trump administration at various points over the last two years.

This ""is a defining day in the Trump administration's national security structure -- they have finally cleared out all the national security positions in terms of senior officials,"" said David Priess, a former CIA official who delivered the president's daily briefing in the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

""With all the twists and turns in the Trump administration and the national security establishment and intelligence community over the past two years, at least there has been stability in one way -- the DNI and his principal deputy have quietly remained an island of steadiness,"" Priess said. ""As of August 15, that changes.""

Trump's relationship with the intelligence community has been fraught from the very inception of his presidency, when the country's most senior spies and security chiefs sat the newly minted leader down to brief him about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and allegations that Moscow had material that could potentially compromise him.

Since taking office, Trump has repeatedly clashed with intelligence officials, including Coats, over their public comments acknowledging Russia not only interfered in 2016, but also poses a threat to future elections -- an assessment that was reaffirmed by former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which the President often characterized as a ""political witch hunt.""

Coats also drew Trump's ire when he appeared to contradict him on various issues during a Senate hearing earlier this year. Still, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have said that Coats' dedication to speaking the ""truth"" was a quality they not only respected, but believe is a prerequisite for any nominee to replace him.

Similarly, Gordon was widely viewed, both within the intelligence community and among Congressional lawmakers, as an experienced official with the integrity and professionalism to tell the President facts he might not want to hear.

However, White House officials have told CNN that the President was never going to allow Gordon to assume the acting or permanent position due to her perceived ties to intelligence officials like former CIA Director John Brennan and even Coats.

Thank you, DNI Coats and PDDNI Gordon, for your leadership and service to our country. pic.twitter.com/PN67clMxsC — Office of the DNI (@ODNIgov) August 15, 2019

When discussing his attempt to replace Coats with Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas on July 30, the President told reporters that the intelligence community needed ""somebody like that that's strong and can really rein it in. As you've all learned, the intelligence agencies have run amok. They've run amok.""

Coats' and Gordon's departures are ""a story that combines two different issues that have become entangled with each other,"" according to George Beebe, director of the Intelligence Project Center for a New National Interest.

One issue, he said, involves ""the management and leadership of the intelligence community itself and the role it's playing and should play in our national security system. The second is a domestic political story that has to do with Trump's election, his presidency, his agenda for his presidency and the fact that there are an awful lot of people in Washington and in the country who are fundamentally opposed to the Trump presidency,"" he said.

Beebe told CNN that it is difficult to understand the importance of Coats, Gordon and whoever the new leaders of the ODNI turn out to be, without getting into that domestic political story.

""The intelligence community is not supposed to be playing a political role in our tradition,"" he added. ""We're not supposed to have a secret police ... normally the impulse Americans have and Congress has and the media has is to want to place constraints on the intelligence community, to make sure they're staying within the lines.""

'Constrain the President'

""That dynamic has flipped now. People are seeing the intelligence community not as something that should be constrained, but something that should constrain the President,"" Beebe said.

Until Trump picks a nominee, Joseph Maguire, former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, will serve as the acting Director of National Intelligence.

A US intelligence official told CNN that Maguire is well respected among career professionals, particularly due to his military background.

Maguire is also seen as an experienced hand at a time when the US faces a myriad of national security challenges.

Tensions with Iran are escalating in the Persian Gulf, North Korea continues to develop its weapons capabilities, arms control experts warn of a potential nuclear arms race with Russia and trade tensions with China are intensifying, while Trump is discussing a drawdown of forces in Afghanistan and Syria.

Trump left the door open to nominating Maguire for the full-time job last week, but his future remains uncertain.

Meanwhile, Gordon's role will remain vacant, though Maguire can choose someone to perform those duties in the interim.

For both positions, the decision lies with Trump, but the White House's list of candidates for the DNI role has only grown in recent weeks, with no indication that a nomination is coming soon.

And if Trump's track record of dealing with national security vacancies is any indication, Maguire could serve in an acting capacity for a while.

Over the months that multiple geopolitical crises have been brewing, and since Trump took office, he has plowed through a Cabinet's worth of national security professionals.

Cabinet churn

The President has run through two national security advisers -- Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster. There have been rumblings of his unhappiness with his most recent pick, John Bolton. Trump has summarily fired a secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, by tweet after undercutting the former ExxonMobile CEO for months.

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis resigned, reportedly in frustration over Trump's decision to pull out of Syria.

The President has churned through two Homeland Security secretaries, John Kelly and Kirstjen Nielson, and a National Security Agency director, Mike Rogers. He's lost a deputy national security adviser, K.T. McFarland and an ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley. Michael Pompeo, Trump's former CIA director, has held on but moved over to helm the State Department.

Amid that churn, Coats and Gordon have been a steady, stabilizing influence, Priess said.

""The very fact that in this administration with the highest turnover in history, the people who are specifically designated to tell the truth to the President, whether he likes it or not, have remained in place, doing that day after day, means that by definition, they have been an island of stability,"" Priess added.

While Trump's decision to name Maguire as the acting replacement has appeared to be well received, he remains somewhat of an enigma despite his impressive military credentials and counterterrorism experience. Maguire is not widely considered to be part of the intelligence ""establishment,"" and sources close to him have told CNN that he has likely had limited interactions with the President.

But Maguire said that he has no problem speaking truth to power during the confirmation hearing for his job at the National Counterterrorism Center.

""I promise to tell the truth and to be able to represent the information and the hard analysis from the intelligence community professionals as accurately and as forthcoming as I possibly can, and I am more than willing to speak truth to power,"" he told Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Warner again emphasized the importance of that quality in a statement last week.

""When I supported Admiral Maguire's previous nomination, I made it clear I expected him to empower the intelligence professionals he led to do their important work free from political interference. Given the circumstances of his appointment as Acting DNI, it is more important than ever that Admiral Maguire stands by that commitment to speak truth to power,"" he said.

""His success or failure in this position will be judged by the quality of work produced by the intelligence community, not by how those intelligence products make the President feel,"" Warner added.

Trump: Philly shooter ‘should never have been allowed to be on the streets’,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-philly-shooter-should-never-have-been-allowed-to-be-on-the-street,"President Trump said Thursday that the suspect in the shooting of six police officers during a Philadelphia standoff should ""never have been allowed to be on the streets.""

The suspect, identified as Maurice Hill, 36, has a long record of gun-related convictions and of attempting to evade arrest, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. He is now in custody.

PHILADELPHIA SUSPECT IN CUSTODY AFTER HOURS-LONG ORDEAL THAT LEFT 6 OFFICERS WOUNDED

“The Philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets,” Trump tweeted Thursday morning. “He had a long and very dangerous criminal record. Looked like he was having a good time after his capture, and after wounding so many police. Long sentence – must get tougher on street crime.”

The suspect allegedly shot six officers during a standoff that began after two Narcotics Strike Force officers showed up at a multifamily home to serve a warrant, according to Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross, who said things “went awry almost immediately” when the suspect allegedly started firing.

The two officers were barricaded in separate rooms with several hostages before being evacuated five hours later. The incident began Wednesday at around 4:30 p.m. and the suspect was finally apprehended early Thursday morning. The suspect allegedly fired rounds out a window and up through the ceiling. He was armed with several handguns and an AR-15 rifle, officials told Fox News.

All six of the officers struck by bullets survived. Ross said it was “nothing short of a miracle that we don't have multiple officers killed today.”

After two previous mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio, Trump called for Congress to take action, particularly suggesting stronger background checks and red flag laws that could potentially keep dangerous individuals from obtaining firearms. Congress is currently on a summer recess, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., resisted calls to bring senators back early. But he said that when they return, these measures may be on the agenda.

"FBI 'indifferent' to possible China hack of Hillary Clinton's server, as State Department fought to protect her, interviews suggest",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-indifferent-to-possible-china-hack-of-hillary-clintons-server-as-state-department-fought-to-protect-her-interviews-suggest,"Interviews with intelligence community officials have revealed that senior FBI leaders ""seemed indifferent to evidence of a possible intrusion by a foreign adversary"" into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s non-government email server, and that State Department officials allegedly sought to ""downgrade classified material found on the server,"" according to Senate investigators still probing the matter.

The information was contained in a letter and interview transcripts sent Monday by the majority staff on the Senate Finance and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees to senior Senate Republicans including Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. The letter also noted that “neither the committees nor the FBI were able to confirm whether an intrusion into the server occurred.""

The review began after two August 2018 news articles ""alleged that a Chinese state-owned company hacked former Secretary Clinton’s nongovernment server and inserted code that forwarded nearly all of her emails to the foreign company,"" the letter stated, citing an article in The Daily Caller, and a later piece by Fox News.

'OMG' -- TOP CLINTON AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT ATTEMPT TO HACK SERVER IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

A source briefed on the matter confirmed to Fox News at the time that the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) was so concerned by the revelation that officials drove over to the FBI to inform agents -- including anti-Trump agent Peter Strzok -- of the development soon after it was discovered via the emails' metadata in late 2015 or early 2016.

The source said the hack was from a Chinese company, describing it as a front for Chinese intelligence.

The letter to Grassley continued: ""The reporting indicated that two Intelligence Community Inspector General [ICIG] officials – Frank Rucker and Jeanette McMillian – discovered the code and brought the possible intrusion to the attention of the FBI.""

In a December 2018 interview with Senate investigators concerning the reporting on the potential foreign hack, Rucker said Strzok -- then the deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division in charge of the Clinton investigation -- seemed ""aloof and dismissive.""

And Strzok didn't ask many questions, according to Rucker.

McMillian, meanwhile, said FBI employees were ""poker-faced"" during the roughly hourlong meeting about the potential breach, even though both the CIA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) had ""significant equities"" in the information contained on the server.

STATE DEPT IDENTIFIES 23 VIOLATIONS, 'MULTIPLE SECURITY VIOLATIONS' AMID ONGOING REVIEW OF CLINTON EMAILS

The FBI did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

McMillian told investigators the episode began when Rucker identified an email address in Clinton's email metadata as a potential ""live dropbox"" for all her emails, which a foreign actor could access.

When Rucker then Googled the email address on the suggestion of then-ICIG Charles McCullough, the name of a Chinese company, ""Shandong Carter Heavy Industry Machinery,"" popped up -- leading Rucker and McCullough to suspect Chinese involvement, according to Rucker's interview with investigators.

In April, the ICIG and Justice Department IG determined that the address apparently matched the one that former Clinton technology aide Paul Combetta -- who managed her server and thoroughly deleted a slew of her emails -- had created as a ""dummy"" to create backups of Clinton's emails.

However, the DOJ IG and ICIG said they “did not identify any information obtained by the FBI during the [Clinton email] Midyear investigation reflecting that Combetta’s dummy email account was associated with a Chinese company or the Chinese government.""

Throughout, according to McMillian's remarks to Senate investigators, FBI brass generally seemed ""impressed"" with Rucker's technical abilities in finding the apparent breach, and apparently took the issue seriously. McMillian specifically said Strzok had found the email account's presence in Clinton's metadata ""strange.""

McMillian said she made sure to tell the FBI that the ICIG was not trying to usurp the FBI's authority after bureau officials asked how it had found information about the potential breach. The FBI made clear the ICIG would provide information to the bureau, but not the other way around, McMillian and Rucker said.

A May 2016 email from Strzok, obtained by Fox News last year, said “we know foreign actors obtained access” to some Clinton emails, including at least one “secret” message “via compromises of the private email accounts” of Clinton staffers.

Strzok, earlier this month, filed a lawsuit against the bureau and the Justice Department – arguing that the FBI caved to the “unrelenting pressure” of the president when it fired him.

DOJ IG Michael Horowitz previously concluded that although he could not prove Strzok had let his political bias influence official decisions during the Clinton email investigation, he did not have confidence that Strzok had acted without bias at critical junctures in the probe.

In text messages with his then-lover, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, Strzok said on his government-issued phone that ""we'll stop"" Trump from becoming president, and called Trump supporters ""retarded.""

Separately, Rucker and McMillian offered more details into reports that the State Department sought to cover for Clinton by downgrading the classification of emails on the server.

FBI SCRAMBLED TO ANSWER TO CLINTON LAWYER IN DAYS BEFORE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, NEW DOCS REVEAL

“At first, State fought back against the intelligence community being involved,"" McMillian told investigators, before noting that they eventually relented.

McMillian claimed that two State Department employees tried to shield some of Clinton's emails from disclosure under the ""deliberative process"" exemption under the Freedom of Information Act -- rather than labeling the emails classified.

The employees, Austin Evers and Catherine Duval, did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment. Evers has since launched the organization American Oversight along with other former Obama administration officials. The group says it is devoted to uncovering ethics issues in the Trump administration.

Rucker also claimed that then-Ambassador Patrick Kennedy questioned ""whether certain emails should be provided to the intelligence community for review and fighting against classifying other emails,"" according to the Senate investigators.

The State Department didn't respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Interviews released in 2016, known as 302s, first revealed the serious allegation that Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public.

Fox News was told as far back as August 2015 that Kennedy was running interference on Capitol Hill. But Kennedy, in his FBI interview on Dec. 21, 2015, “categorically rejected” allegations of classified code tampering.

“In return for altering the classification, the possibility of additional slots for the FBI at missions overseas was discussed,” then-House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said at the time.

In a lengthy statement, the FBI denied it had agreed to declassify any emails in exchange for more overseas slots from the State Department.

The U.S. Treasury is about to flood the market with debt to fund a $1 trillion deficit. Here’s why that is a worry,https://www.marketwatch.com,"['Joy Wiltermuth', 'Markets Reporter']",08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-treasury-is-about-to-flood-the-market-with-debt-to-fund-a-1-trillion-deficit-heres-why-that-is-a-worry-2019-08-15,"There may be some limitations to the U.S. government’s borrowing after all.

An anticipated surge of U.S. borrowing in the global debt markets in the second half of this year is starting to create concern as Treasury is expected to ramp up its issuance of bills, notes and bonds to fund a soaring $1 trillion budget deficit.

The U.S. government’s budget gap has widened 27% compared to the first 10 months of fiscal 2018, as spending has risen 8% and receipts have grown by 3%. The federal fiscal year runs October through September. The Trump administration recently forecast a $1 trillion full-year shortfall, while the Congressional Budget Office is slightly more conservative, putting it at $896 billion.

Last month the U.S. Treasury laid out its plans to borrow $814 billion between July and December, after the Trump administration and Congress agreed to a two-year postponement of the U.S. debt ceiling, ensuring no government shutdown or a federal default.

Not only does the Treasury needs to borrow to cover the fiscal deficit created by Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and the inability of Congress to agree on spending cuts, but Treasury needs to rebuild its cash balance which was run down to pay the governments bills when the debt ceiling was hit in May.

The coming deluge of Treasury issuance has stoked worries on Wall Street about whether there is enough liquidity in the system in the short term to meet the supply without pushing up short-term borrowing costs and inverting the yield curve even further.

U.S. dollar liquidity is deteriorating and “is reaching a point where it may require drastic action if measures aren’t taken to address it soon,” warned Gaurav Saroliya, director of macro strategy at Oxford Economics, in a note on Wednesday.

To illustrate the concern, Saroliya pointed to the higher costs already faced by London-based banks lending to one other overnight in dollars, the popular dollar Libor-OIS spread, which has climbed in anticipation of the Treasury glut hitting markets.

This chart shows the rise of the 3-month dollar Libor-OIS spread since May, even as U.S. Treasury cash balances at the Federal Reserve have dropped from about $400 billion to closer to $150 billion.

Oxford Economics International funding squeeze

As the Treasury restores its cash balance with the coming supply, Saroliya expects liquidity woes to worsen, particularly in a scenario where long-term Treasury notes are yielding less than shorter-dated debt.

“With Treasury issuance set to surge in the wake of the recent debt-ceiling deal, an inverted yield curve could create a significant issuance indigestion in the market,” Saroliya wrote.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury 10-year note TMUBMUSD10Y, -5.06% yield briefly fell below the 2-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, -7.21% yield, an inversion of the funding curve that has foretold past economic slowdowns.

Meanwhile fears of an economic recession rattled U.S. stocks Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.39% closing down 800 points, its biggest one day fall this year, before some recovery on Thursday morning in the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, +0.25%.

Amid the stock market rout, the chances of a half percentage point cut in the federal funds rate in September rose to 30.4%. Markets are pricing in a 69.6% chance of a quarter-point interest rate cut next month.

Despite the rising Treasury debt issuance, investors globally have been buying U.S. government debt, pushing the 30-year U.S. bond TMUBMUSD30Y, -2.97% to a record low around 2.0% this week, as yields on many other developed country bonds are even lower with about $15 trillion worth of debt now offering negative yields.

Slowing global economic growth due to the U.S. - China trade war is resulting in central banks easing monetary policy, and an array of geopolitical risks from Brexit, to Italian political instability, the U.S. sanctions on Iran, and violent protests in Hong Kong are encouraging investors into the safe haven of U.S. debt.

But in the short-term money markets, the coming flood of U.S. Treasury debt issuance may cause some indigestion.

Bond dealers who underwrite the Treasury’s debt sales in the weekly auctions are already holding record amounts of U.S. Treasurys on their books as the fiscal deficit has increased. Now their need to borrow more cash in short-term money markets, using Treasuries as collateral, to buy even more government debt is pushing up short term rates.

A key risk barometer, the U.S. “repo” market, where cash is borrowed overnight using Treasurys for collateral, has signaled that liquidity is tightening.

Repo rates have climbed recently in relation to what the Federal Reserve pay banks to hold excess reserves. The rate that lenders have charged for cash in the market for Treasury repurchase agreements was 2.22% on Tuesday, compared with the 2.1% that the Federal Reserve pays banks to hold excess reserves, known as the IOER rate.

See: Rising Repo Rates Fuel Concern Over Mounting U.S. Debt

Liquidity may also be tightening in the market for short term borrowing of U.S. dollars internationally, known as the “foreign repo pool” where non-U.S. investors keep cash balances with the Federal Reserve, and the rising costs of currency hedging given the strength of the U.S. dollar may make investing in U.S. Treasury debt less appealing, Saroliya noted.

China and Japan were by far the largest foreign holders of Treasury securities, as of July 16, in the most recent report of holders.

For Saroliya, it all boils down to the Federal Reserve needing to act to preserve liquidity, perhaps by cutting benchmark U.S. rates by another 50 to 100 basis points or through another round of quantitative easing or bond buying.

“And that needs to be immediate!” Saroliya urged.

Earlier this month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Cabana also warned that the historically high levels of Treasury securities held by dealers could pose problems when it come to issuing more debt.

This chart shows dealer holdings of Treasury debt rising between January and July, at the same time custody holdings at the New York Fed have declined.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch

“We are concerned that the U.S. banking system is nearing reserve scarcity,” Cabana wrote in a note to clients. Ultimately, he said opening the Treasury “floodgates” would likely “force the Fed to start expanding its balance sheet by year-end.”

To be sure, not everyone sees doom in the U.S. adding to the already $22.4 trillion national debt.

“A lot of Street commentators have highlighted the fact that there is going to be a huge amount of supply in the Treasury market, and how that is going to affect rates,” said Robert Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, in an interview with MarketWatch.

“When you look at the space though this is a market that most people want to own at some point, especially given the fact that there are $15 trillion of bonds in negative yields,” he said. “It makes the U.S. look really attractive.”"
McAleenan: Employers will be held accountable for violating immigration law,https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/mcaleenan-illegal-immigration-ice-raids-employers,"U.S. employers looking to skirt immigration law are a major focus of the Department of Homeland Security, according to Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan.

Recent ICE raids on several food processing plants, including a Koch Foods operation in Morton, Miss., is evidence the Trump administration and the federal government are taking violations seriously, McAleenan said on the ""Fox News Rundown"" podcast.

""Employers that are going to take advantage of people here unlawfully and exploit that workforce in an anti-competitive way, that has to be a target for ICE, and it is a priority for Homeland Security investigations as we've seen with significant cases in Texas and Tennessee and more recently in Mississippi,"" he said.

""Those are targeted at the employers. And we're in the middle of a criminal investigation there: 14 warrants signed by a federal judge that were served last week. And believe me that the target is the employers.""

McAleenan also issued a warning to companies hoping to exploit illegal immigrants for financial gain.

""If you think you can shirk your duties under the law to hire workers that have valid immigration status in the United States, to pay their taxes and benefits appropriately, HSI is watching and we will be following up,"" he said.

He credited the low unemployment rate and vibrant economy as reasons for the influx of illegal immigrants seeking occupational opportunities.

""The employment magnet we have right now with under 4 percent unemployment with a booming economy, that's a huge pull factor,"" he told host Chris Foster.

He also spoke about the threat of acts of violence in the wake of mass shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio.

""We need people to come forward when they have a concern about an individual,"" he said.

""If they think they're on a path toward violence, if they're motivated by an ideology, if they're obsessed with an idea that's making them angry, they need to share that, they need to give a mental health professional, a school officer, a law enforcement professional a chance to stop that process from happening."""
Exclusive: Google Insider Turns Over 950 Pages Of Docs And Laptop To DOJ,https://saraacarter.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://saraacarter.com/exclusive-google-insider-turns-over-950-pages-of-docs-and-laptop-to-doj/,"A former Google insider claiming the company created algorithms to hide its political bias within artificial intelligence platforms – in effect targeting particular words, phrases and contexts to promote, alter, reference or manipulate perceptions of Internet content – delivered roughly 950 pages of documents to the Department of Justice’s Antitrust division Friday.

The former Google insider, who has already spoken in to the nonprofit organization Project Veritas, met with SaraACarter.com on several occasions last week. He was interviewed in silhouette, to conceal his identity, in group’s latest film, which they say exposes bias inside the social media platform.

Several weeks prior, the insider mailed a laptop to the DOJ containing the same information delivered on Friday, they said. The former insider is choosing to remain anonymous until Project Verita’s James O’Keefe reveals his identity tomorrow (Wednesday).

He told this reporter on his recent trip to Washington D.C. that the documents he turned over to the Justice Department will provide proof that Google has been manipulating the algorithms and the evidence of how it was done, the insider said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the House Judiciary Committee in December, 2018, that the search engine was not biased against conservatives. Pichai explained what algorithm’s are said Google’s algorithm was not offensive to conservatives because its artificial intelligence does not operate in that manner. He told lawmakers, “things like relevance, freshness, popularity, how other people are using it” are what drives the search results. Pichai said even if his programmers were anti-Republican, the process is so intricate that the artificial intelligence could not be manipulated and it was to complicated to train the algorithm to fit their bias.

Google did not immediately respond for comment on the insider’s claims, however, this story will be updated if comment is provided.

The insider says Google is aware most people are unaware or not knowledgeable about these advanced IT systems and therefore unable to determine who is telling the truth.

“I honestly think that a free market can fix this issue,” he told this reporter at a meeting in Washington D.C. “The issue is that the free market has been distorted and what’s happened is that the distortion is so grotesque and the engineering is so repulsive, all we need to do is just expose what’s going on. People can hear that it is bad but that can be bias. But when they see what Google has actually written with the documents, this will actually be taught in universities of what totalitarian states can do with this type of capability.”

“It will be so revolting that it doesn’t matter what the solution is, a solution will just form as a reaction to this manipulation they have done,” the Google insider said.

He said he’s asked himself many times if he’s overreacting “and every time I simply look back at the documents and realize that I am not.”

“It’s that bad,” he said. “Disclosing Google’s own words to the American public is something I am, must do, if I am to consider myself a good person. The world that google is building is not a place I, or you or our children want to live in.”

Another Google insider, who has come forward already, told O’Keefe and other media outlets recently that it is the programers at Google who use the algorithms to manipulate the information to advance its leftist agenda.

Greg Coppola, a software engineer, told Project Veritas that he doesn’t “have a smoking gun.”

However, “I’ve just been coding since I was ten, I have a Ph.D., I have five years of experience at Google, and I just know how algorithms are. They don’t write themselves. We write them to make them do what we want them to do.”

“I look at Search and I look at Google News, and I see what it’s doing,” he said. “I see Google executives go to Congress and say … that it’s not political, and I’m just so sure that that’s not true.”

Department of Justice officials declined to comment on the document dump. But SaraACarter.com has reviewed the documents and obtained proof from the Google insider that the documents were delivered to the DOJ.

The unnamed Google insider first spoke to O’Keefe’s Project Veritas. O’Keefe has been criticized by the left for outing the political bias of executives and employees of Google and other social media companies.

In the nonprofits most recent video, Project Veritas uses their undercover techniques to get Google employees to talk openly about their disdain for Trump and how their artificial intelligence operates.

Jenn Gennai, who heads Google’s Responsible Innovation Team, did not know she was being filmed by O’Keefe’s group. She told the undercover journalist that “the reason we launched our AI principals is because we’re not putting our line in the sand. They were not saying what’s fair and what’s equitable so we’re like, well we’re a big company, we’re going to say it.”"
Tyson aims to reduce USDA involvement in beef inspection at Kansas plant,https://theweek.com,"['Brendan Morrow', 'Steven Orlofsky', 'Kathryn Krawczyk']",08-14-2019,2019,8,https://theweek.com/speedreads/859008/tyson-aims-reduce-usda-involvement-beef-inspection-kansas-plant,"Tyson Foods is requesting that company employees at a Kansas beef plant take over some inspection responsibilities previously held by United States Department of Agriculture officials.

If enacted, the proposal would reduce the number of USDA inspectors present on the line in the factory for ""post-mortem, pre-sortation activities"" regarding food safety and disease conditions, per the proposal. The company's request to the USDA was written in March, and obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request by Food and Water Watch, a company that is suing Tyson, reports NBC News.

The USDA is considering the proposition, reports NBC News, which is in reference to the company's factory in Holcomb, Kansas.

According to the proposal, the requested changes aim to improve efficiency, work toward pathogen reduction, and ""allow better use of Agency's resources"" while providing equal outcomes to current inspection practices.

But consumer advocates are hesitant. Former USDA chief veterinarian Pat Basu told NBC News ""bypassing safeguards"" may result in missed signs of disease, drug injections, or bacteria due to lack of adequate training.

""It could be devastating for the whole country — you cannot turn it over,"" he told NBC News.

This isn't the first time the government has considering bowing out of certain inspection responsibilities. The Obama administration allowed an increase in privatized poultry inspection, reports NBC News, and the Trump administration announced a proposition to establish a ""new voluntary inspection system"" for pork plants.

State Dept. 'deeply concerned' by China threats as unrest in Hong Kong grows,https://www.politico.com,['Caitlin Oprysko'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/14/engel-mccaul-hong-kong-china-1463442,"House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel (left) and Rep. Michael McCaul wrote that the protests are ""the result of Beijing’s successive violations of their commitment to honor the will of the people of Hong Kong.” | Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo congress State Dept. 'deeply concerned' by China threats as unrest in Hong Kong grows

Bipartisan U.S. concern over the discord in Hong Kong is growing, as the State Department on Wednesday issued a travel warning for the region and expressed support for pro-democracy demonstrators there.

The bipartisan leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday condemned Chinese authorities' hostility to protesters and threats of military intervention in a joint statement, warning that should Beijing attempt to use force to shut down peaceful demonstrations, they “would be met with universal condemnation and swift consequences.”

Story Continued Below

“The House Foreign Affairs Committee has called upon Beijing to cease encroaching on Hong Kong’s autonomy — it is Beijing’s actions that are at the root of the frustration among the people of Hong Kong. No foreign powers are fomenting this dissent,” Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and ranking member Michael McCaul (R-Texas) wrote. ""It is the result of Beijing’s successive violations of their commitment to honor the will of the people of Hong Kong.”

Engel and McCaul expressed their “deep respect for the brave efforts of Hong Kong people from every walk of life who have demonstrated their clear desire for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.”

Separately, the State Department on Wednesday issued a travel advisory for Hong Kong due to the unrest, instructing travelers to exercise increased caution.

""Police have used a variety of crowd control measures, including the deployment of tear gas. The protests and confrontations have spilled over into neighborhoods other than those where the police have permitted marches or rallies,"" the notice reads.

The protests began earlier this spring in opposition to a since-suspended plan that would allow extraditions to mainland China. They've since grown broader in scope and have intensified in recent months leading up to this week, when demonstrators occupied the Hong Kong airport and effectively blocked air travel to and from the airport for two days in a row. Police there have grown increasingly confrontational, and clashes broke out periodically Tuesday. Beijing called the skirmishes ""a near-terrorist act.""

Satellite images have emerged purporting to show Chinese troops gathering near the border with Hong Kong, raising worries of a potential violent conflict. Lawmakers have compared the simmering tensions to the 1989 massacre of hundreds of peaceful protesters in Tiananmen Square, warning against a repeat.

A State spokesperson said Wednesday that the department was “deeply concerned” by reports of military movement along the border.

The State Department urged Beijing to abide by its commitments under the treaty that created the “one country, two system” administrative structure that governs Hong Kong. “We encourage China and all parties in Hong Kong to pursue a solution that respects the liberty of Hongkongers and Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, as enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration,” the spokesperson said.

“We condemn violence and urge all sides to exercise restraint, but remain staunch in our support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong. The ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong reflect the sentiment of Hongkongers and their broad and legitimate concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy. We categorically reject the false charge of foreign forces as the black hand behind the protests. The continued erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy puts at risk its long-established special status in international affairs.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday called the recent developments “extremely alarming"" and said that American officials had a responsibility to speak out in defense of the protesters, regardless of the crucial role China plays in American trade. “If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out elsewhere,"" she said.

“To the thousands of young people in Hong Kong who are speaking UP for human rights and speaking OUT against the Communist Party of China: we see you waving the American flag, and we hear you singing our national anthem,” wrote House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. “America stands for freedom. America stands with Hong Kong.”

Some of the strong language has underscored the delicate line U.S. lawmakers must walk — the desire to express support for democracy while not undermining the protesters' legitimacy, something Beijing has repeatedly sought to do.

Chinese propaganda has blamed the U.S. for the protests, suggesting the CIA had been pulling strings behind the scenes. Earlier this week, China's foreign minister accused the U.S. of fomenting dissent among ""anti-China rabble-rousers."" The State Department spokesperson denied U.S. involvement in the pro-democracy protests, where demonstrators have been seen waving American flags.

President Donald Trump has so far maintained some distance from the unrest in Asia, telling reporters on Tuesday: “The Hong Kong thing is a very tough situation. I hope it works out peacefully. I hope nobody gets hurt. I hope nobody gets killed.”

But at the White House, Trump aides have been watching events closely and worry that it could spiral out of control, according to a current and a former White House official.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross defended Trump’s dovish approach in an interview on CNBC Wednesday, questioning what role the U.S. could play in the conflict.

“This is an internal matter,” Ross said of Trump’s relative neutrality, noting that Trump has made clear he’s monitoring the situation. “He talked about the possibility of troop build-ups — so it’s not that we’re not watching it.”

Lawmakers, meanwhile, have taken a more active stance. In their letter on Wednesday, Engel and McCaul also denounced state-run media publishing information about a U.S. diplomat who met with activists, calling them ""the actions of a 'thuggish regime.'""

Acting DHS secretary on ICE facility attack in Texas: Rhetoric must be toned down,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/acting-dhs-secretary-ice-facility-attack-texas,"Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday on ""Fox & Friends"" that the latest attack on an ICE facility in Texas could be the result of politicians and pundits ""demonizing"" federal agents for enforcing existing laws.

After shots were fired into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office and another facility associated with the agency in San Antonio, Texas, early Tuesday, ICE said in a statement that, ""Political rhetoric and misinformation that various politicians, media outlets and activist groups recklessly disseminate to the American people regarding the ICE mission only serve to further encourage these violent acts.""

McAleenan agreed, calling on those who oppose the Trump administration's policies to tone down their rhetoric before someone gets hurt, noting that this is the fourth such incident targeting an ICE facility.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BOOSTS ABILITY TO DENY GREEN CARDS TO IMMIGRANTS USING WELFARE PROGRAMS

""I think the environment where we're demonizing law enforcement for doing their jobs, for enforcing the laws on the books, is concerning, it can be dangerous and it can result in people taking actions that are not supported by the facts,"" he said.

The FBI is investigating the ""targeted attack"" in which shots were fired at around 3 a.m. at an ICE building where two floors house administrative and executive offices, according to the San Antonio Express-News. The outlet reported another shooting occurred at a separate facility where an ICE contractor is located.

The Texas attack follows two separate incidents last month, when a man attacked an ICE building in Washington state and protesters raised a Mexican flag at a Colorado ICE facility.

Many on the left renewed their harsh criticism of ICE after 680 “removable aliens” were arrested last week at several Mississippi food processing plants where they were working. It was deemed the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in U.S. history.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said the raids were part of a ""campaign of terror"" by the Trump administration, while the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote in a letter to McAleenan that the purpose of the raids was ""to instill fear in Latino and immigrant communities at a time when Latinos are already living in terror.""

McAleenan said progress is being made when it comes to working with Mexico and Central American nations to stem the flow of migrants at the border, but the laws ""in the interior"" must also be enforced, including going after businesses who employ undocumented workers."
ANALYSIS: Who and what the Horowitz report is likely to cover,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/analysis-who-and-what-the-horowitz-report-is-likely-to-cover,"The 448-page report detailing special counsel Robert Mueller's two-year Trump-Russia investigation is public. Next up: Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report into how that investigation started.

That report, anticipated to be released after Congress returns from August recess, will come amid an ongoing contentious debate between Republicans who think the government unfairly targeted President Trump and Democrats who believe Trump deserved to be investigated for his alleged ties to Russia.

But what Horowitz's report, which is expected to delve into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the FBI's use of the salacious and unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, contains has been held close.

Still, recent developments have offered a sneak preview of the cast of characters who could make appearances when Horowitz explains what his team uncovered.

Former FBI Director James Comey received good news a couple weeks ago when the DOJ decided not to charge him over leaking his memos, despite a criminal referral from Horowitz, who concluded Comey leaked classified information and showed a lack of candor. But the leak inquiry was just a narrow slice of the broader investigation Horowitz launched in March of last year.

Horowitz is likely scrutinizing every aspect of the FISA approval process, and the head of the FBI plays an integral role. Comey signed three of the four FISA warrant applications and renewals targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, who was never charged with wrongdoing, during the Trump-Russia investigation. Comey defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier but admitted the dossier wasn't verified when he approved its use, and investigators were still working to verify its contents when he was fired in May 2017. The final FISA renewal happened a month later.

The FISA filings required approval from top members of the FBI and the Justice Department, so other possible targets of Horowitz's inquiry likely included the approvers of the four applications and renewals: Comey; Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates; Dana Boente, the only signatory in active government service and currently Trump’s top lawyer at the FBI; then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller to be special counsel the month before.

Mueller told Congress he wasn't involved in approving that final FISA warrant.

The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the Justice Department and the FBI made extensive use of Steele’s dossier, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Clinton campaign hired the firm through Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm and was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race.

Also last week, McCabe and former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, both fired during the Trump administration, separately sued the Justice Department alleging political bias played a role in their removals. Strzok demanded reinstatement and back pay, and McCabe demanded he receive his full retirement pension.

Horowitz has a history with both men. He previously concluded anti-Trump texts sent from Strzok to FBI lawyer Lisa Page, his mistress, not only showed Strzok was biased but also that he was willing to take official action to affect Trump's electoral prospects. Horowitz also concluded McCabe leaked information without authorization and ""lacked candor"" with investigators.

Horowitz's findings were cited in both their firings, and he's likely not done with them since both played prominent roles in the Trump-Russia investigation.

And last Thursday, FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from ""Russian conspiracy theories."" Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI.

Horowitz is also likely looking into the FBI's use of an article by Michael Isikoff to bolster its FISA filings. The FBI told the court it didn't think the piece was connected to the dossier, even though Isikoff only wrote it after meeting with Steele.

The Justice Department inspector general said when he launched the investigation last year at the behest of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements"" related to FISA filings against Page and review the DOJ’s and the FBI’s dealings with Steele. But while Horowitz said he would consider including other issues that arose during the investigation, Attorney General William Barr has since suggested the inquiry is narrow.

Former FBI General Counsel James Baker is also likely to be among those scrutinized, since he admitted he inserted himself into the FISA approval process and reviewed the first FISA application. Baker defended how the FBI handled the Steele dossier, claiming “we took it seriously” but “we didn’t necessarily take it literally.”

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Officials such as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec knew by October 2016 portions of Steele’s dossier were inaccurate. And State Department officials such as Jonathan Winer and Victoria Nuland seem to have been involved in spreading Steele's information within the U.S. government.

Many members of the media also received info from the Steele dossier, which may have contained Russian disinformation, at the behest of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.

The Steele dossier's central thesis was ""a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation"" between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Mueller didn't agree. Although Mueller concluded the Russians interfered in the 2016 presidential election, the investigation did not establish the Kremlin and Trump's campaign criminally conspired. Mueller’s report also shot down at least one of Steele’s biggest claims — that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen met with foreign hackers in Prague.

Horowitz reportedly “homed in” on Steele, and his team reportedly interviewed the ex-spy in June.

Meanwhile, Barr, along with U.S. Attorney John Durham, launched his own inquiry into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Trump gave him broad declassification authority to look into it."
Did Trump Brag About Crowd Sizes While Past Presidents Consoled Massacre Victims?,https://www.snopes.com,['Dan Macguill'],,,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-beto-crowds-el-paso-victims/,"In the aftermath of a spate of mass shootings in August 2019, attention turned to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tone in discussing the killings, and the wider issue of gun violence in the United States, as well as his comportment in visiting two of the cities affected, El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

Trump was criticized for smiling and offering a thumbs-up gesture while visiting an infant whose parents had been shot to death in a massacre in El Paso, and allegations that the president was using the tragedies as an opportunity to gain political capital extended to unfounded rumors that his administration had hired “fake” medical staff to pose with him at a hospital in Dayton.

On Aug. 9, the left-leaning Facebook page Occupy Democrats posted a meme that purported to highlight a stark difference in tone and decorum between Trump — who supposedly used a visit to El Paso to brag about crowd sizes and snipe at Democratic presidential candidate and former Congressman Beto O’Rourke — and his predecessors in the Oval Office — who purportedly offered words of comfort and solidarity in the aftermath of previous mass shootings.

We received multiple inquires from readers about the accuracy of the meme, which read as follows:

“Littleton, I can only say tonight that the prayers of the American people are with you.” — Bill Clinton, after Columbine. “This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech community — and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation.” — George H.W. [sic] Bush. “Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation. You are not alone.” — Barack Obama. “Crazy Beto only had like 400 people in a parking lot, they said his crowd was wonderful.” — Deplorable Trump, in El Paso.

The caption of the meme read: “SERIOUSLY, what is WRONG with Trump?!?! He REALLY said this to the El Paso victims.”

The Occupy Democrats meme was a largely accurate recounting of four post-shooting statements made by the four most recent occupants of the White House. (Strictly speaking, Trump was addressing medical staff who had treated victims of the El Paso shooting, rather than the victims themselves, and the second quotation was, apparently in error, attributed to George H.W. Bush, rather than George W. Bush.)

Despite the authenticity of the quotations, the meme presented an incomplete and rather misleading picture of Trump’s overall comportment in visiting El Paso after the August 2019 massacre there. While the president did indulge in side-sniping about a political opponent who had been fiercely critical of him (something his predecessors markedly did not do in similar circumstances), Trump did also offer words of solidarity and comfort to the victims of the August 2019 massacres, their families, and the wider communities affected by the shootings.

Clinton

The first quotation in the meme was taken from remarks Bill Clinton delivered in a White House press conference on April 20, 1999, the day of the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colorado. His speech can be read in full here, and viewed in full in the video below.

In the most relevant section, Clinton said:

“To the families who have lost their loved ones, to the parents who have lost their beloved children, to the wounded children and their families, to the people of the community of Littleton, I can only say tonight that the prayers of the American people are with you.”

﻿

Bush

The second quotation in the meme came from a speech that George W. Bush gave on April 17, 2007, during a convocation at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, the day after a student shot to death 32 people on that campus. The full text of his speech is available here, and it can be watched in full below.

In the section quoted by Occupy Democrats, Bush said:

“Laura and I have come to Blacksburg today with hearts full of sorrow. This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech community, and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation. We’ve come to express our sympathy. In this time of anguish, I hope you know that people all over this country are thinking about you and asking God to provide comfort for all who have been affected.”

Obama

The third quotation in the meme was taken from a speech Barack Obama gave during an interfaith vigil at Newtown High School on Dec. 16, 2012 — two days after a shooting massacre at nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

The speech can be read in full here, and watched in full in the video below. During the relevant section, Obama said:

“Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation. I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts. I can only hope it helps for you to know that you’re not alone in your grief. That our world, too, has been torn apart. That all across this land of ours, we have wept with you, and we’ve pulled our children tight. And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we will provide. Whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you, to ease this heavy load, we will gladly bear it. Newtown, you are not alone.”

Trump

The fourth and final quotation in the meme consisted of remarks Trump made while talking to hospital staff during a visit to University Medical Center in El Paso on Aug. 7, 2019, four days after a mass shooting at a Walmart store in that city.

Police in El Paso have linked the suspected shooter, Patrick Crusius, to a white nationalist manifesto posted online shortly before the massacre began. The author of the manifesto decried what he characterized as a “Hispanic invasion of Texas” and espoused the discredited “white genocide” theory.

Although the manifesto’s author, thought by El Paso police to be the suspected Walmart shooter, stipulated that his anti-immigrant sentiment predated the elevation of Trump to the presidency, some observers have pointed out areas of overlap between how the president talks about immigration and immigrants, and how the manifesto addressed them.

Others, including Democratic politicians and long-standing critics of the president, went further in connecting Trump to the manifesto and the El Paso shooting. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said the manifesto was so similar to Trump’s rhetoric that it “could have been written by the people that write Trump’s speeches.” O’Rourke described the massacre as “an act of terror inspired by [Trump’s] racism.”

Conventional news media were not permitted to accompany the president and first lady Melania Trump on their visits with shooting victims, families and medical staff in Dayton and El Paso on Aug. 7, but amateur footage emerged later that showed Trump addressing medical professionals at University Medical Center in El Paso.

In the short clip, the president commended the work done by hospital staff in caring for the victims of the shooting, saying “the job you’ve done is incredible,” and “it’s an honor to be with you.” Without any obvious reason or prompt, Trump then shifted to talking about a rally he had held in El Paso in February 2019 (although he mentioned “three months ago,” Trump’s most recent rally in the city was in February, six months earlier):

“I was here three months ago and we made a speech and we had a — what was the name of the arena? — that place was packed … That was some crowd, and we had twice the number outside. And then you had this crazy Beto — Beto had like 400 people in a parking lot, they said, ‘His crowd was wonderful!’ …”

Trump was referring in those remarks to a counter-protest held in response to his Feb. 11 rally at the El Paso County Coliseum. The counter-protest was led by O’Rourke and was estimated to have had between 7,000 and 15,000 attendees — considerably more than the “400 people in a parking lot” claimed by Trump.

During his rally, Trump thanked the El Paso fire department for allowing 10,000 of his supporters to enter the arena, despite the venue’s having a capacity of 6,500. In response, a spokesperson for the fire department corrected the president, insisting that no special permission had been given, and the number of attendees inside the arena was no greater than its capacity. At other times, Trump claimed that as many as 35,000 supporters had come to the rally, taking into account those outside the arena.

For an unknown reason, Trump decided to re-open that six-month-old dispute and grievance over crowd sizes and news coverage, while meeting and praising hospital staff who had treated and cared for the victims of a mass shooting. That struck some observers as grossly inappropriate, and we found no record of former Presidents Obama, Clinton or Bush having engaged in similar behavior while meeting the victims of past shootings or the medical professionals who had treated them.

However, Trump’s “crazy Beto” aside was not the extent of his remarks on the massacres in Dayton and El Paso, and the Occupy Democrats meme misled readers by cherry-picking that unscripted moment and comparing it with remarks made by previous presidents from behind a podium, during prepared speeches.

In a White House address on Aug. 5, Trump offered sentiments of solidarity and comfort to the victims of the Dayton and El Paso shootings and their families:

“The First Lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their families, and the survivors. We will stand by their side forever. We will never forget. These barbaric slaughters are an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation, and a crime against all of humanity. We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil — the cruelty, the hatred, the malice, the bloodshed, the terror. Our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents, children, husbands and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives. America weeps for the fallen.

“We are a loving nation, and our children are entitled to grow up in a just, peaceful and loving society. Together, we lock arms to shoulder the grief. We ask God in heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer, and we vow to act with urgent resolve.”

﻿

The salient difference between Trump and his three most recent predecessors was not that they gave “presidential” speeches after mass shootings, because Trump, too, gave a relatively dignified speech from the White House. The key difference, in the context of the Occupy Democrats meme, was in Trump’s comportment and behavior when he stepped away from the podium. We therefore rate the truth of this meme as “Mixture.”"
More Distress For Corn Vs. Soy As China Stops U.S. Farm Buying,https://www.investing.com,[],,,,https://www.investing.com/analysis/more-distress-for-corn-vs-soy-as-china-stops-us-farm-buying-200454468,"The party seems over for now for U.S. corn bulls, though soybean longs remain hopeful after a friendly government crop report, as farmers across the country wallow in misery from China’s decision not to buy from them.

’ front-month contract, September, fell 2% in Tuesday’s Asian trading, extending its 6% tumble—which marked the limit-down move—on the Chicago Board of Trade on Monday, pressured by higher-than-expected yield and acreage numbers cited by the government.

Before the summer, there couldn’t have been a better upward trending grain for speculators as corn rallied 20% in May alone—its best month in seven years—from a plantings squeeze brought on by inclement weather and flooding.

China is not a top destination for U.S. soybeans. Yet, in March, Chinese importers booked their largest U.S. corn purchase in at least 5-1/2 years, a rare sale of the grain in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war. Data at that time showed that private exporters sold 300,000 tonnes of corn to Chinese destinations for the 2018/19 marketing year, which ends on Aug. 31.

In The Red Since June, Corn Is Now A ‘Strong Sell’

US Corn 300 Minute Chart

But after hitting its highest price since summer 2016, in May, U.S. corn’s front-month contract turned south the past two months—falling 1.6% in June and 4.8% in July. Month-to-date for August, it is down 5.8%.

The immediate future for corn bulls could be more distressing, based on technical outlooks for the grain and China’s suspension of U.S. farm imports.

Investing.com’s Daily Technical Outlook has a “Strong Sell” recommendation on corn, projecting a base case support of $3.7696 per bushel. Based on Monday’s settlement of $3.8525, that’s a drop of another 8.29 cents, or 2.2%.

Michael Seery, who plots technical outlooks at his Seery Futures consultancy in Plainfield, Illinois, said even fundamentally, corn “has absolutely nothing going for it, as demand is extremely weak.”

U.S. farmers lost their fourth largest export market after China officially cancelled all purchases of U.S. agricultural products, a retaliatory move following President Donald Trump’s pledge to slap 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports.

China’s exit piles on to a devastating year for farmers, who’ve struggled through record flooding and droughts that destroyed crop yields, and trade war escalations that have lowered prices and profits this year, CNBC reported.

Bob Kuylen, a farmer of 35 years in North Dakota, told the network:

“It’s really, really getting bad out here. There’s no incentive to keep farming, except that I’ve invested everything I have in it, and it’s hard to walk away.”

Demand Is Down, But Corn Yields Surprisingly Up

Adding to the China-induced pains was the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which surprised corn traders on Monday with a much higher yield than expected at 169.5 bushels per acre. Acreage was also higher than forecast, at 90 million acres.The USDA pegged corn production at 13.9 billion bushels. Coupled with 125 million fewer bushels of demand, coming mostly from a cut in exports, ending stocks stood at 2.181 billion bushels. The conclusion was a crop in excess supply of 171 million bushels since July and and 561 million above total market expectation.Jeff Kaprelian of the Hueber Report in St Charles, Illinois, described the USDA report as “one of those reports we’ll talk about for years to come”.But he also said the outlook for corn could improve over time, though not right away.Said Kaprelian:

“I personally have a hard time believing this market will stay down for very long given the enhanced potential for an early freeze coupled with the lateness of the crop. Ten percent of the crop still hasn’t pollinated, according to the crop progress report.”

Indigo Ag Inc., a Boston-based crop intelligence firm, seemed to agree, saying on Monday:

“Significant uncertainty remains before crops reach maturity. Of particular concern is dry weather, which will be especially harmful to crops with shallow rooting, and the risk of an early freeze for late-planted crops.""

Soybeans A ‘Buy’ Despite China; Outlook Neutral To Friendly

Compared to corn, the crop outlook for soybeans was neutral to friendly, with yield unchanged at 48.5 bushels per acre and acreage unexpectedly cut to 76.7 million acres, versus forecasts for 81 million. Production was 120 million bushels lower than expectations, at 1.07 billion bushels. Final stocks were at 755 million bushels; 66 million less than forecast.

Despite U.S. soybean farmers missing out on China as their No. 1 export destination now, the improved crop outlook has limited the market’s downside.

DHS wants to shift money to immigration enforcement: report,https://thehill.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/latino/457497-dhs-wants-to-shift-money-to-immigration-enforcement-report,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reportedly wants to shift funds to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by moving money from its other accounts, Politico reported Wednesday, citing two House aides and a congressional office.

The aides reportedly said that congressional appropriators are looking at a request to reallocate more funds to ICE. The news outlet reported that it was not clear how much money the department aims to redirect, what it would be used for or whether such a request needs Congress's approval.

The Hill has reached out to DHS and ICE for comment.

"Only bottled water for Newark residents, EPA says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Georeen Tanner'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/epa-tells-newark-provide-bottled-water,"Just over a year ago, Newark officials declared the city's water was ""absolutely safe to drink,"" but last week environmental officials called on the city to advise residents with known or suspected lead service lines that the filters they had been provided were not reliable after elevated lead levels were discovered in two Newark homes.

For three years the New Jersey city has been mired in a crisis caused by high levels of lead in the drinking water. The water filter program meant to answer the call for safer water has failed to solve the problem.

UK BABY LOSES ALL 4 LIMBS FOLLOWING HORRIFIC SEPSIS INFECTION

Now, in a move that echoes Flint, Mich., the city is distributing bottled water.

Last fall, the city distributed water filters to residents to reduce lead levels in drinking water while it implemented new corrosion control methods.

According to the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, lead exposure is devastating. Lead serves no purpose in the human body and there is no safe level of lead in drinking water. Children are especially at risk of its deadly effects. Early exposure can have lifelong consequences, such as intellectual disabilities, the agency says.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) letter, the agency is “unable at this time to assure Newark residents that their health is fully protected when drinking tap water filtered through these devices.”

The EPA places the onus to provide bottled water to Newark residents on the city.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a joint statement with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka that he is prepared to make bottled water available to residents. He further stated that Newark is expanding the testing of filtered drinking water to more Newark homes and that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is “working with the filter manufacturer to determine the scope of the situation.”

The city handed out nearly 40,000 PUR water filters, half of which were donated by the company. In a statement, PUR said it has been “working diligently with the City of Newark to understand the situation, assist with the establishment of testing protocols for additional sampling, and help them determine next steps.” PUR says its faucet filters are “independently tested and certified by NSF International (NSF) to remove 99 percent of lead at levels up to 10 times the applicable federal and state drinking water standard of 15 parts per billion (ppb).”

Erik Olson, senior director of health programs at Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), is “troubled” by these developments. NRDC, an environmental group, sued Newark last year for failing to comply with regulations for the control of lead in drinking water.

MASSACHUSETTS MAN WITH DEADLY MOSQUITO-BORNE VIRUS IN A COMA, DAUGHTER SAYS

“Everyone in Newark deserves safe drinking water,” Olson said, in a statement. “We welcome EPA’s recent letter stating that Newark residents with lead service lines should be provided bottled water, though we do not understand why EPA does not insist on protecting other at-risk people such as those with lead plumbing and whose water tests high for lead. We also continue to be concerned about risks to residents in the eastern part of the City, the Wanaque service area.”

The bottled water distribution targets families served by the Pequannock water system with lead service lines who have received filters. Other Newark residents are served by the Wanaque water system, which was not prioritized for filters.

Newark does not know why the filters are failing, but one resident is not surprised by the turn of events.

“We’ve been telling them this for the last two years, but we were looked at as crazy,” said Debra Salters, a member of advocacy group Newark Water Coalition.

“We told [city officials] to give out bottled water and now they’re talking about they’re only giving out two cases. That’ll be gone by the end of the night,"" she said.

According to Salters, residents must show two forms of identification to collect water. She believes that complicates an already alarming situation.

“You couldn’t listen to the residents who pay your salary. You had to wait until the federal government put their foot on your neck and made you do something,” Salters said. “This is a life crisis.”

A reduction of lead levels is expected by the end of this year as stated in Murphy’s and Baraka’s statement. They are “optimistic” that the new corrosion control treatment will “prevent leaching from lead pipes.”"
DOJ and FBI now investigating Epstein's apparent attempted suicide in July,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-and-fbi-now-investigating-epsteins-apparent-attempted-suicide-in-july,"The warden for the prison where accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was found dead revealed the Justice Department and FBI are investigating Epstein’s alleged July 23 suicide attempt, in addition to his successful one Saturday.

Lamine N’Diaye, who was removed yesterday from his position at NYC’s Metropolitan Correctional Center by Attorney General William Barr after Epstein was found dead in his prison cell, confirmed in court documents released Wednesday that an internal investigation was completed regarding the July 23 incident, and the ongoing investigations by the FBI and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death will also cover the incident from last month.

The Bureau of Prisons said Saturday that Epstein was found “unresponsive in his cell” in the Special Housing Unit that morning following “an apparent suicide.” Many questions remain about why Epstein was reportedly taken off suicide watch despite allegedly being found nearly unconscious on his cell floor with marks on his neck and back.

Although N’Diaye called Epstein’s death an “apparent suicide” on Saturday, he also stressed that “there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death.” New York City's chief medical examiner said the official cause of death is still being investigated.

The revelation from N’Diaye about the broader investigation being conducted came in response to a question posed to him Monday by Judge Richard Berman, pressing the former warden on whether the DOJ or the FBI were looking into Epstein’s unsuccessful attempt at taking his own life a couple weeks ago.

“To my knowledge, it has never been definitively explained what the [Bureau of Prisons] concluded about that incident,” Berman wrote to N’Diaye.

N’Diaye replied Monday that he “cannot divulge any information about the prior investigation at this time.”

Barr said he was “appalled” Monday to learn of Epstein’s apparent suicide and revealed the DOJ was “learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation.” Barr also said there will be accountability for those who did not do their jobs properly. Numerous reports have emerged about guards not being properly trained, doing overtime shifts multiple days in a row, falling asleep on the job, and potentially falsifying records about how often Epstein was being checked on.

The DOJ announced Tuesday that N’Diaye was reassigned to a regional office pending the outcome of the ongoing investigations.

Epstein, already a convicted sex offender following a sweetheart deal in 2008, was alleged to have “sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls” at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations, between 2002 and 2005. Prosecutors claimed Epstein enticed and recruited minor girls to engage in sex acts with him and built a “vast network of underage victims.”"
New policy at Interior's in-house watchdog clamps down on interactions with press,https://thehill.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/457452-new-policy-at-interiors-in-house-watchdog-clamps-down-on,"A new policy rolled out by the Interior Department’s inspector general puts strict limits on the office’s interactions with reporters.

The press office for the agency’s internal watchdog, which is investigating a number of Interior officials, including Secretary David Bernhardt, is now prohibited from providing journalists with information on its work beyond, “Our report speaks for itself,” or “We have no comment.”

The policy, which took effect Aug. 5, is a change from the previous practice of sometimes providing reporters with background or additional information.

When asked this week about a new report released by the IG office, the press office told The Hill it could use one of two statements: “Our report speaks for itself” or “We have no comment.”

The policy change comes under the leadership of acting Inspector General Gail Ennis.

Mark Lee Greenblatt, Trump's nominee to replace Ennis as head of Interior’s IG office, has been confirmed by the Senate but has not yet assumed the role. Greenblatt, a former assistant inspector general for investigations at the Commerce Department, is anticipated to begin his new job in the coming weeks.

Stephen Hardgrove, chief of staff for the inspector general’s office, said in an email to The Hill that the policy change “was put in place for the period of time that we had an Acting Inspector General and while awaiting the arrival of our appointed Inspector General, Mark Greenblatt.”

“Of course each Office of Inspector General determines what, if any, information they choose to elaborate on for closed investigation,” he added.

In late May, President Trump Donald John TrumpGibraltar releases Iranian tanker despite US move to block it Warren leads Democratic field by 5 points in Wisconsin: poll Stephen Colbert on Trump: 'He's trying to invite us into this madness' MORE appointed Ennis, the Social Security Administration (SSA) inspector general, to also oversee the Interior Department watchdog office.

Ennis was sworn in for the SSA role at the beginning of the year, her first time serving as an inspector general (IG). The Senate confirmed her by unanimous consent.

Interior’s IG office is handling a number of investigations, including an ethics probe into six Interior officials, including Bernhardt.

The IG office told House lawmakers that it is also looking into former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeNew policy at Interior's in-house watchdog clamps down on interactions with press Overnight Energy: EPA proposes scrapping limits on coal plant waste | Appointee overseeing federal lands once advocated selling them | EPA lifts Obama-era block on controversial mine Latest appointee overseeing federal public lands once advocated to sell them MORE's alleged use of private email to conduct public business. That investigation is being included in a criminal probe overseen by a joint Justice Department and Interior IG team, Ennis told House lawmakers in a letter released publicly at the end of July.

The letter was the first public acknowledgement that Zinke is being criminally investigated for matters involving his stake in a Montana land deal with the chairman of oil services company Haliburton, as well as Interior’s initial decision to obstruct construction of a tribal casino project in Connecticut following heavy lobbying from rival casino MGM.

Ennis previously worked as a partner at the Washington-based law firm WilmerHale, which lobbies for a number of clients with business before Interior. One of the companies represented by the firm is Twin Metals, a Minnesota-based mineral mining company that is lobbying to build a hotly debated copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In May, the Trump administration moved to renew one of the mine's mineral leases, reversing a decision from the Obama administration.

Unlike most IG officials, who are usually career government employees, Ennis is a political appointee who previously contributed to Trump’s campaign.

VA Partners With DoD to Upgrade Supply Chain at High Risk for Abuse,https://www.military.com,['Richard Sisk'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/08/14/va-partners-dod-upgrade-supply-chain-high-risk-abuse.html,"The Department of Veterans Affairs announced a partnership with the Defense Department this week to upgrade its supply chain system, which is perennially on a government watchdog agency's ""high risk"" list for waste, fraud and abuse.

The partnership with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will give the VA access to the DLA's worldwide procurement system in an effort to streamline the VA's purchase of everything from medical and surgical supplies to cleaning equipment and construction materials, the VA said in a news release Monday.

""This is a huge step forward in our efforts to transform VA into a modern, high-performing organization by simplifying operations and leveraging DoD's supply chain system to support our veterans,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in a statement.

Army Lt. Gen. Darrell Williams, director of the DLA, said the agreement would help the VA reduce costs for supplies.

Related content:

""On behalf of DoD, we are proud to be a value-add to VA on behalf of America's veterans,"" he said in a statement.

The VA release said the DLA will help ""create a centralized ordering system for VA"" aimed at ""reducing risk, waste, fraud and abuse in purchasing medical equipment and supplies,"" problems that have plagued the system for years and repeatedly been cited by the VA's Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office.

In March, the GAO again put the VA on its biennial ""high risk"" list of agencies and departments whose practices are open to abuse; it also added a new area of concern at the VA -- acquisition management.

""VA's procurement policies have historically been outdated, disjointed and difficult for contracting officers to use,"" the GAO report states.

In 2017, the department launched a new program aimed at overhauling its supply chain system to achieve $150 million in cost reductions, the GAO noted.

However, the GAO reported in November 2017 that the new program ""was rushed, lacked key stakeholder involvement and buy-in, and relied on establishing non-competitive blanket purchase agreements for the overwhelming majority of products, resulting in low utilization by medical centers.""

The VA's Office of Inspector General was particularly scathing in a series of 2017 reports on supply chain scandals at the Washington, D.C., VA Medical Center.

IG Michael Missal found the problems at the Washington VA so troubling that he took the unusual step of issuing preliminary findings prior to the final report to alert the Veterans Health Administration to a situation ""sufficient to potentially compromise patient safety.""

The final report concluded that no patients were harmed but found that $150 million in supplies had never been inventoried, storage areas were filthy, and there was no system for ensuring that defective medical instruments and supplies were not used on patients.

Poor oversight of the medical supply system led to shortages in operating rooms at the hospital, according to the report. At one point, the operating room ran out of vascular patches to seal blood vessels and ultrasound probes used to map blood flow.

In addition, the hospital had to borrow bone material for knee replacement surgeries and also ran out of tubes needed for kidney dialysis, forcing staff to go to a private-sector hospital to procure them, the report added.

DHS in a ‘Mad Scramble’ to Catch Up With Domestic Terror,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-homeland-security-is-in-a-mad-scramble-to-catch-up-with-domestic-terror,"It wasn’t that long ago that senior Department of Homeland Security officials shied away from focusing on domestic terrorism, often fearing political backlash.

The White House pushed the sprawling department to focus overwhelmingly on immigration enforcement, at the expense of just about everything else. DHS veterans told reporters that white supremacist terror was the FBI’s issue, not theirs. When a DHS analyst warned of far-right violence in 2009, congressional Republicans bellowed in protest, with a lasting chilling effect. Under the Trump administration, the department disbanded a group of intelligence analysts focused on domestic terrorism. Cybersecurity staffers got shipped to the border. In the days after the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, leading DHS minds focused on the migrant caravan. And, as NBC reported, the administration cut funding for DHS grants designed to prevent radicalization.

But as white supremacists have terrorized communities around the country, senior officials at DHS have tried to step up their work against the threat. They fought to get that counter-radicalization money back, for instance. A consensus within the department slowly began to form: DHS exists to fight terrorism—even when those terrorists are American.

Then came the El Paso shooting, which left 22 people dead in the Texas border city. That’s when, in the words of one senior DHS official, “ the dam broke.”

“There were robust conversations before El Paso,” added that official, who spoke anonymously to discuss internal talks. “Acting DHS Sec. Kevin McAleenan has been very clear that this is a top priority for the Department, as Nielsen had also previously stressed. But the conditions are different now. We will ensure the Department is doing everything possible with existing capabilities and resources, and seek more capabilities and resources as needed. And more will be needed.”

Since the shootings in El Paso and Dayton that left 31 people dead, DHS officials are working overtime to find ways to ramp up domestic terrorism prevention efforts, according to four DHS officials familiar with the situation. But it’s not easy, sources said; over the last two years, the department has maximized resources focused on border security, and it’s already strained.

“These two shootings have caused a mad scramble where they are pulling every publication and book off the shelf in an attempt to figure out what they can do to address this problem,” said one former DHS official.

Senior DHS leadership had a call on Saturday night after the El Paso shooting and then again on Sunday afternoon, after a second shooter killed 10 people in Dayton. The violence was spiraling. So McAleenan directed senior officials to start a working group to assess what DHS was doing about domestic terrorism and what more it could do immediately, according two sources familiar with the situation. The department’s advisory council is supposed to speak with McAleenan about domestic terrorism prevention this week, one of those sources said.

It’s too soon to tell if El Paso will be a turning point for DHS. But just taking a serious look at what the department is doing to fight domestic terrorism and what more it can do—that marks a significant moment, especially when many in the White House remained laser-focused on stopping the flow of immigrants.

“People are scrambling,” said a current DHS official.

And they aren’t alone. The Daily Beast reported last week that the National Counterterrorism Center, another 9/11-era counterterror institution, has also quietly amped up its work fighting domestic terror.

DHS, meanwhile, heightened its efforts last week after President Trump condemned white supremacy and domestic terrorism. For more than two years, according to current and former DHS officials, the White House has directed the department to rev up its efforts to deal with the mass flow of migrants into the country.

Now, department officials are looking to elevate the mission to prevent domestic terrorism by leveraging existing resources and surging capabilities from throughout the department, according to another senior DHS official. It’s not dissimilar to the concept the department uses in responding to a natural disaster, the official added. The number of people involved is smaller, but it draws from people all across the department. They’re also putting together an action plan looking at the growing threat from domestic terrorism, according to multiple DHS sources.

“To ensure our communities are safe, we are focusing efforts on enhancing our prevention and preparedness, and creating response assets in communities so they will be better able to mitigate risk and respond to these kinds of events when they do occur,” McAleenan said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “So far we’ve reached thousands of people in communities around the country, educating them about indicators of radicalization or mobilization to violence. Community awareness can play a major role in preventing an attack.”

But significant turnover among senior DHS leadership has complicated its efforts to help state and local law enforcement partners.

“Trying to find someone in charge at DHS overall—it’s been hard lately!” said one senior state law enforcement official who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “Since DHS has been in existence, it’s always been fairly chaotic. But this is probably the longest it’s been with so many people in acting positions.”

The department’s effort to increase its focus on domestic terrorism has left officials in DHS playing catch up. One official said some of the individuals working overtime do not have domestic terrorism experience, as most have spent their careers on international terrorism.

“That’s a bit of a challenge,” said the official.

The challenge hasn’t gone unnoticed.

“This scramble is a direct result of the fact that notwithstanding concerns raised by some in DHS over the past several years, there have been no serious planning efforts by the department to focus on [domestic terrorism],” said John Cohen, former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “That’s due in large part because of the insistence by the White House that the department first and foremost focus on immigration and border security.”

The Daily Beast reported on DHS’ decision to disband a group of domestic terror analysts just days before McAleenan took office. Soon after, the secretary directed a review of all DHS efforts to combat targeted violence and domestic terrorism, including programs funded by federal grants doled out to the department in 2017, a department spokesperson said.

“Given the proof-of-concept nature of these programs, DHS was not prepared until earlier this year to make an assessment of their efficacy,” a spokesperson for the department said, adding that McAleenan directed the department to request more funds for domestic terrorism prevention for fiscal year 2020."
Interior chief David Bernhardt shakes up ethics program,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/interior-chief-david-bernhardt-shakes-up-ethics-program,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is taking action to improve on a record of ethical “lapses” at the agency over recent years that has led to investigations of top staff.

Bernhardt issued an order Wednesday that consolidates Interior’s ethics programs, which sprawl across 13 various departments and central headquarters.

The order realigns Interior ethics programs so that ethics officials at the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and other departments, some of which lacked sufficient personnel, report to Interior’s Departmental Ethics Office rather than to individual department directors.

“It is making the program across the department a lot more accountable and consistent across all bureaus and offices,” Scott de la Vega, director of Interior’s Departmental Ethics Office, said in an interview. “We had a situation before where some bureaus and offices would give different advice to our employees than others. That does not serve employees very well.”

Critics, however, said Bernhardt is an inappropriate messenger for the ethics program restructuring given he is under investigation himself by the Interior Department’s inspector general’s office.

Interior’s internal watchdog is investigating whether Bernhardt’s prior work at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, where he represented oil and gas companies and water districts, influenced his actions as deputy Interior secretary — a position he held before rising to lead the agency.

Bernhardt has rejected allegations of wrongdoing, telling senators during his confirmation hearing in March that he has implemented “incredibly robust” screening processes to ensure he doesn’t meet with former firms or clients on “particular matters.”

The inspector general’s office is also investigating six other Trump administration Interior appointees, according to the Washington Post, to examine whether they violated federal ethics rules by interacting with former clients on department-related business. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke resigned in December while he was facing ethics investigations that remain ongoing.

“Today’s order will only deepen the ethical crisis at the Interior Department’s top levels,” said Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group, accusing Bernhardt of giving too much power to political appointees.

Weiss criticized Bernhardt for rearranging the Departmental Ethics Office so that it reports directly to Interior’s solicitor general, the agency’s top lawyer.

President Trump’s nominee to be Interior solicitor general, Daniel Jorjani, has not been confirmed by the Senate yet and is serving in the role on an acting basis, as Democrats have accused him of participating in an ethics policy at the department that gave political appointees more power over public records.

De la Vega, the career official who leads Interior’s Departmental Ethics Office, defended Bernhardt’s sincerity in pursuing improvements to the agency’s ethics program.

He noted that Bernhardt has overseen the hiring of 42 career ethics officials in the past 15 months. Since 2017, the department has increased the number of full-time, career ethics employees by 162%, nearly doubling the total hired during the Obama administration, he said.

“I won't speak to any specific investigations that are ongoing,” De la Vega said. “But everything I have seen from the secretary on this is he is very earnest and very dedicated to leaving a legacy of a strong ethics program. He fully recognizes that when an agency does not have a strong ethics program, that it can harm the agency's mission. Ethics is not a partisan issue.”"
Biden Narrowly Ahead of Warren in Weekly Poll,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-08-14/joe-biden-narrowly-ahead-of-elizabeth-warren-in-weekly-poll-maintains-lead-in-south-carolina,"Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden holds a 30-point lead among black voters, with 45% of support in the Post and Courier-Change Research survey.

Former Vice President Joe Biden holds just a 1-point lead over Sen. Elizabeth Warren in a new weekly national tracking poll, but he retains a firm lead in the critical South Carolina primary.

In The Economist/YouGov weekly tracking poll conducted from Aug. 10 to 13, Biden garners 21%, while Warren is close behind with 20%. The Massachusetts senator saw a 5-point jump from last week's tracking poll, while Biden slid two points.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont came in third with 16%, and the rest of the field is farther behind in the single digits. Sen. Kamala Harris of California got 8% and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg both clinched 5%.

Meanwhile, in a South Carolina poll released Wednesday by the Post and Courier-Change Research, Biden secures a massive 19-point lead in the Palmetto State, with 36%. Warren comes in second with 17%, with Sanders close behind with 16 percent and Harris with 12 percent. All other candidates garnered 5% or less.

Biden's lead in South Carolina has only fallen by one point since the last Post Courier-Change Research poll, which was conducted before both the June and July primary debates. The front-running candidate has come under fire from his opponents for his record on civil rights, immigration and criminal justice. But those attacks appear to have barely dented Biden's solid standing in the key primary state, which votes third in the primary calendar on Feb. 29.

Biden has consistently polled well among black voters, who are a critical voter bloc in the South Carolina primary contest. The former vice president holds a 30-point lead among black voters, with 45% of support in the Post and Courier-Change Research survey.

That comes weeks after a Quinnipiac University national poll from late July found Biden securing 53% of support among black Democratic voters, while all other candidates languished with single-digit support.

Biden also leads the Democratic primary field among every age group in the Post and Courier-Change Research poll other than respondents between the ages of 18 and 34, who strongly favored Sanders. And among white primary voters, Warren led the pack with 26%.

The Economist/YouGov poll was conducted between Aug. 10-13 and surveyed 1,500 adults online. The margin of error was 2.6 percentage points."
DOJ reassigns warden after Epstein's apparent suicide,https://thehill.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457281-doj-reassigns-warden-after-epstein-apparent-suicide,"Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrReport: Epstein autopsy finds several broken bones in neck, raising questions House panel investigating decision to resume federal executions Alleged Epstein victim files first suit against estate MORE has ordered the Bureau of Prisons to temporarily reassign the warden at the New York federal prison where accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was found dead over the weekend pending federal investigations into his apparent suicide.

Two staff members assigned to Epstein’s unit at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in lower Manhattan have also been placed on administrative leave, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Tuesday, noting additional actions may be taken if warranted.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) disclosed the developments Tuesday afternoon, one day after Barr expressed outrage over Epstein's death and spoke of “serious irregularities"" at the federal prison in New York.

“I was appalled — indeed, the entire department was — and, frankly, angry to learn of the MCC’s failure to adequately secure this prisoner. We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and that demand a thorough investigation,” Barr said during remarks at a law enforcement conference in New Orleans on Monday morning.

“We will get to the bottom of what happened at the MCC and we will hold people accountable for this failure,” Barr said.

Kupec said Tuesday that the MCC warden, whose name is Lamine N'diaye, would be reassigned to the bureau’s Northeast Regional Office while the FBI and Justice Department inspector general investigate the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death.

James Petrucci has been named acting warden of the MCC, the Justice Department added.

“The Bureau of Prisons also placed on administrative leave two MCC staff assigned to Mr. Epstein’s unit pending the outcome of the investigations. Additional actions may be taken as the circumstances warrant,"" Kupec said.

Epstein, a registered sex offender following an earlier conviction in 2008, was found dead of apparent suicide in his cell early Saturday morning. He had been placed on suicide watch back in late July after reportedly being found with marks on his neck.

The developments over the weekend have triggered questions about the circumstances of his death and massive scrutiny of the conditions at the detention facility.

Various reports have described the federal jail as being short-staffed and some have suggested that corrections officers did not follow protocol by regularly checking on Epstein during his detention.

Epstein, a wealthy financier with ties to multiple powerful people, had been held at the detention facility since July 6 when he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges. His death cuts short a high-profile criminal prosecution, though Barr insisted Monday that prosecutors would continue their investigation into the sex trafficking allegations.

U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Wilkie visits Boise VA,https://www.idahostatesman.com,[],,,,https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/northwest/idaho/article233724477.html,"Secretary Wilkie: Boise VA seems to click U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie visited the Boise VA Medical Center because ""Everything is working here."" Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie visited the Boise VA Medical Center because ""Everything is working here.""

After the U.S. Senate confirmed Robert Wilkie as U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs in July 2018, he said people asked him what his goal would be for his first year.

“It was a military goal,” Wilkie said. “It was to walk the post and calm the institution down because it had been buffeted by legions of bad stories.”

So how are things one year later?

“The place is much calmer. We are a much calmer institution,” he said in an interview in Boise with the Idaho Statesman.

Traditionally, Veterans Affairs has ranked last or near last as a place to work in the federal government’s public-services sector, he explained.

“We are up to No. 6 in one year, and we are going to go higher,” he said. “Our patient satisfaction rates are at an all-time high. The last survey we did, it was 89.7%”

Wilkie also spent much of his first year walking the post — he has traveled to 35 states visiting VA campuses.

“I felt the key to the new VA leadership was to get out of Washington,” he said. “This is a bi-partisan comment. I just think too many people get sucked into the Beltway culture and sit in those big offices overlooking the White House.”

Wilkie visited Boise’s VA campus on Wednesday.

“Boise is a special trip because there really isn’t a place in the country where everything seems to click. It doesn’t matter what it is ... everything is working here,” he said. “This is probably the cleanest and most efficient VA in the country. And I am not just saying that ... The statistics prove it out.”

One of the area’s where the Boise VA is excelling is in telehealth, which connects patients to health care services through computers and cellphones. Idaho is leading the pack in part due to a uniquely western U.S. feature.

“Even today we (on the East Coast) do not understand the scale of the American West,” Wilkie said.

When trying to explain the West’s remoteness and vastness to non-Westerners, Wilkie said he uses two examples.

“One is the loneliest sign in America,” he said. “It is in Houston on Interstate 10. It says ‘El Paso 910 miles.’ The other is it is an eight-and-a-half-hour drive from here to Coeur d’Alene, another population center in this state. We cannot understand that scale.”

To overcome these long distances, Boise VA Medical Center has begun using telehealth to connect doctors and veterans.

“Boise was the place that started this,” Wilkie said. “It allows us to reach into areas that are hard to get to.”

“On the mental health front, it creates a sea change in the way we treat those who have mental health issues because we are not forcing people to come and sit in a large room and expose themselves emotionally,” he explained. “It really is cutting edge for mental health treatment and it also allows our doctors to practice across state lines.”

From Boise, the VA has spread telehealth nodes into Washington, Oregon and Alaska.

“It is imperative that we expand our telehealth footprint,” he said. “That is another reason why I am here. It has worked. And it should be working as a model for the rest of the country.”

Top priority: Veteran suicide prevention

Wilkie said he has made veteran suicide prevention one of his department’s top priorities.

Idaho has struggled with having one of the nation’s highest suicide rates.

“Idaho had 400 suicides last year and 20% of these were veterans,” Wilkie said.

One of the challenges with veterans is most who take their lives are not in the VA system. Wilkie estimates about half of Idaho’s veterans are not in the VA system.

“This is where the federal government can help,” he said.

Under his plan, “We will open the aperture to give (Boise VA Medical Center Director David) Wood more resources to go into the community, not only the state government localities, but also the nongovernmental organizations, the tribal organizations, to help us find those veterans who are out there.”

The community of Boise is already on the right path, Wilkie said.

“There are 48 suicide and mental health programs here that this VA leadership works with in the community,” he said. “Even in our largest cities, we do not have that many.”

Rumor mill: VA not privatizing

Wilkie noted he wants to put to rest a rumor about the VA.

“One of the charges leveled at VA in the last two years is that the President of the United States is on the path to privatize this institution,” he said. “I just gave the Congress the largest budget in the history of the department, $220 billion, calling for 390,000 employees.”

“We will have a higher budget,” Wilkie said, based on his discussions for next year’s budget. “I am the only one in the Cabinet who does not have to present budget cuts,” he said. “So my response to the critics is if we are privatizing, we are going about this in a very strange way.”"
States sue to block EPA's coal power plant emissions rule,https://www.cnn.com,['Gregory Wallace'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/politics/lawsuit-coal-rule-epa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A coalition of states and cities will ask a federal court to block the Trump administration's overhaul of emission regulations for coal-fired power plants.

The administration rolled out its Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, rule earlier this summer, shifting regulatory authority to states while also promoting energy independence and offering hope to the struggling US coal industry.

It replaced one of the Obama administration's hallmark plans to address climate change, the Clean Power Plan. A divided Supreme Court had blocked that rule from taking effect while challenges to its legality played out.

The Trump-led Environmental Protection Agency said the rule would not overstep the legal bounds that Republicans believe Obama's plan crossed. But the EPA itself says the rule could result in 1,400 more premature deaths by 2030 than the Obama-era plan it will replace.

Several states pledged to sue over the Trump administration plan. In the lawsuit , 22 states and seven cities will claim the rule ""disregards requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.""

Gutfeld: Trump's feud with Scaramucci shows he's the 'Al Davis of presidents',https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-scaramucci-feud-gutfeld-al-davis,"President Trump's feud with Anthony Scaramucci is the latest example of the commander-in-chief's commitment to winning at all costs, according to Greg Gutfeld.

""Donald Trump is like the Al Davis of presidents,"" Gutfeld said Monday on ""The Five,"" referring to the iconic longtime principal owner of the Oakland Raiders. ""He had a singular motto, which was 'Just win, baby' -- he didn't care how. He attracted rough, scary and weird people -- that was the entire Oakland Raiders.""

SCARAMUCCI BREAKS WITH TRUMP, SAYS GOP MAY NEED 'CHANGE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET'

Davis served as head coach-general manager of the Raiders in the 1960s and later was GM and principal owner until his death in 2011.

Of the comparison between Davis and Trump, the ""Greg Gutfeld Show"" host said he saw a similarity between the Raiders' choice of players and the individuals hired by the White House.

""You also get these weird third-stringers,"" he added, naming Scaramucci and former White House aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman -- who, post-termination, attacked Trump in a ""tell-all"" book.

""They get in under the guise of loyalty and then when it doesn't work out, they turn on you... He's like Omarosa.""

Earlier Monday, Scaramucci told CNN the president has a ""nihilistic way to his personality.""

""I think you have to consider a change at the top of the ticket when someone is acting like this,"" he told anchor John Berman.

After the televised remarks, Trump fired back on Twitter, claiming Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House director of communications in 2017, was upset at not being rehired.

""Scaramucci, who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory, is only upset that I didn’t want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be),"" Trump wrote.

""Also, I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!"""
Treasury Department Is Wrong. China Didn't Just Devalue Its Currency.,https://www.dailysignal.com,['Riley Walters'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/08/13/the-treasury-department-is-wrong-china-didnt-just-devalue-its-currency/,"The U.S. Treasury Department has incorrectly labeled China a manipulator of its currency.

An important distinction exists between devaluing a currency and currency depreciation.

Devaluing implies the People’s Bank of China actively manipulated the value of the Chinese renminbi to gain unfair advantage for its exports. Depreciation simply means the renminbi has lost purchasing power relative to the U.S. dollar, based on market forces.

There’s no indication that China is actively devaluing its currency.

However, according to the Treasury Department, China met a broad definition of manipulation laid out in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, which says of the Treasury secretary:

The Secretary considers that such manipulation is occurring with respect to countries that (1) have material global current account surpluses; and (2) have significant bilateral trade surpluses with the United States.

The law itself doesn’t make clear what a “significant” level of trade surplus with the U.S. equals.

Like many things Congress does, it leaves the most critical details of the law to the executive branch to determine. It must do so, because the criteria laid down in the law could implicate any number of countries, such as Japan, India, Taiwan, Thailand, and South Korea.

And the U.S. trade deficit with the European Union is more than $100 billion.

Yet, the criteria Treasury used in this case are different from another criterion it uses to monitor and label currency manipulators based on the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015.

Under that law, and by standards set by the Treasury, a country is considered a currency manipulator only if it: 1) has an annual trade surplus with the U.S. of more than $20 billion; 2) has a material current account surplus that’s more than 2% of its gross domestic product; and 3) has shown persistent, one-sided intervention in foreign exchange markets, with net foreign exchange purchases of more than 2% of its gross domestic product.

China meets only one of these three criteria. It has had a trade surplus with the U.S. valued at more than $300 billion a year since 2012. It hasn’t met more than one criteria since 2016.

Even then, a dozen other countries, such as Mexico, Vietnam, and Switzerland, also meet at least one criteria established under the 2015 law.

The Context

The recent announcement comes just days after President Donald Trump announced new taxes on $300 billion worth of imports from China, to begin Sept. 1.

It also comes just after news that the Chinese renminbi depreciated against the U.S. dollar to a symbolic 7 renminbi to $1, down from roughly 6.88 renminbi last month.

Trump claimed this recent depreciation was because of manipulation even before the Treasury Department had a chance to clarify.

Nonetheless, the depreciation of the renminbi beyond 7 renminbi has always been seen as significant.

It signals a further weakening of the Chinese economy. Currencies tend to trend along with the health of their local economies. That means when the U.S. economy is strong, the dollar appreciates. When the Chinese economy is weakening, the renminbi depreciates. Both are happening.

That’s why over the past four years, the renminbi has depreciated against the dollar roughly 13%, while China’s annual growth in gross domestic product has decreased from 7% to 6.2%.

The depreciation beyond 7 renminbi was also seen by the Trump administration as a potential offset to the cost of tariffs it has imposed on imports of goods from China.

The administration already has levied a 25% additional tax on roughly $250 billion worth of goods from China. New tariffs, a 10% additional tax on $300 billion worth of goods from China, could go into force as soon as Sept. 1.

A weaker Chinese currency implies American dollars can buy more Chinese exports, while the Chinese can buy fewer American exports. Despite the change in the dollar/renminbi exchange rate, Americans have been paying billions of dollars a month in import taxes.

Value of China’s Currency

According to international measures, both the Chinese renminbi and U.S. dollar are overvalued by as much as 15% to 20%.

According to the Bank for International Settlements, the real effective exchange rate for China and the U.S. is roughly 123.7 and 115.6, respectively.

That’s well above an index that’s equal to 100, which weighs their relative strength to other global currencies and takes into consideration consumer prices.

The Treasury Department’s semiannual report on the foreign exchange policies of our major trading partners stopped publishing the real effective exchange rate of the Chinese renminbi—potentially because it goes against any argument that China’s currency is undervalued.

China does have a history of currency manipulation. Questions about China’s currency interventions arose in 1992, 1994, 2003, and 2014. Since then, to the extent China has manipulated its currency it has done so only to prop up the value—in order to stem capital flight, not to devalue the currency in an attempt to boost exports, which is mostly what the 1988 law is about.

However, legitimate concerns over China’s currency management haven’t arisen for the past five years, and not since Beijing stopped artificially pegging the renminbi’s value to the dollar.

Now, the People’s Bank of China sets an exchange rate that’s more or less determined by the value of several global currencies and allows the renminbi to depreciate up to 2% a day.

It’s easier for the bank to allow the renminbi to depreciate up to 7 renminbi than to continue to cut into foreign exchange reserves to keep it propped up.

Negotiations on the Horizon

A silver lining beyond the heated rhetoric is that labeling China will have little real effect.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will now have to negotiate with Beijing either bilaterally or through the International Monetary Fund to achieve an effective balance of payments.

Reports from earlier this year said a currency agreement is a part of the looming U.S.-China deal. Very little suggests the U.S. could take even further punitive action against China beyond the use of more tariffs.

But the recent escalation, leading to a potential currency war and prolonging of U.S.-China trade tensions, spooked markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3% on Monday.

And if the Trump administration is somehow successful in persuading Beijing to manipulate its currency in the other direction—appreciate the renminbi against the dollar—it would just mean Americans would have to pay even more for Chinese imports.

Defense inspector general to investigate Pentagon’s $10 billion cloud contract,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Aaron Gregg', 'Reporter Covering The Defense Industry', 'Commercial Aviation', 'Government Contractors.', 'Aaron Gregg Covers The Defense Industry', ""Government Contractors For The Washington Post'S Business Section.""]",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/13/pentagon-inspector-general-investigate-billion-military-cloud-contract/,"

The Defense Department’s inspector general has assembled a team of auditors to evaluate the Pentagon’s handling of its largest cloud computing project, a massive contract that could be worth up to $10 billion over 10 years.

The review presents yet another hurdle for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract, known as JEDI, which has been mired in controversy and costly litigation for more than a year. The matter was referred to the inspector general by members of Congress and through the agency’s complaints hotline, said Dwrena Allen, a spokeswoman for the inspector general.

“We are reviewing the DoD’s handling of the JEDI cloud acquisition, including the development of requirements and the request for proposal process,” Allen said. “In addition, we are investigating whether current or former DoD officials committed misconduct relating to the JEDI acquisition, such as whether any had any conflicts of interest related to their involvement in the acquisition process.”

In the statement, the inspector general did not commit to eventually publicizing its findings. Allen said the work of evaluating the contract had already begun and would be completed “as expeditiously as possible.”

Dana Deasy, the Defense Department chief information officer in charge of the procurement, told reporters last week that his office would consult with the inspector general before awarding the massive contract. He did not say whether the award would be delayed until the inspector general completes its review.

[In a rare media briefing, Pentagon officials seek to depoliticize massive military cloud project]

The JEDI contract is meant to speed up the military’s use of cloud computing systems, which employ networks of remote servers to improve computing processes and ease the transmission of data. Defense Department officials say they need to adopt such technology to compete with Russia and China for military dominance. They want to turn to a single commercially oriented tech company to operate that system, and they have said only Amazon and Microsoft meet the minimum specifications.

The process has been dogged by allegations that it is biased in favor of Amazon Web Services since it was unveiled last year. Oracle and IBM have protested the award, arguing that turning to a single company for such an important responsibility is unwise and that the process is rigged in favor of Amazon.

The inspector general’s announcement comes as a slow boil of controversy surrounding the procurement has suddenly bubbled up into a political firestorm.

President Trump recently instructed new Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper to reexamine the contract over concerns that it will go to Amazon, a move that some observers characterized as an inappropriate incursion into the Pentagon’s business. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

[Meet the man at the center of the high-stakes, winner-take-all $10 billion Pentagon cloud contract called JEDI]

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), whose political action committee has received donations from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, has asked that the contract be delayed and lobbied the president directly on the matter, a member of his staff said. Democratic Sens. Mark R. Warner (Va.) and Jack Reed (R.I.) raised concerns that Trump may have acted inappropriately by intervening in the procurement.

In its most recent lawsuit, Oracle accused Amazon of benefiting from an “organizational conflict of interest” by hiring away Defense Department officials who had worked on JEDI.

Multiple investigations into Oracle’s claims have concluded that the allegations against Amazon should not preclude it from participating in the procurement and that the Defense Department was reasonable in how it structured the contract.

Oracle’s latest legal action before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ― a highly unusual months-long court battle in which lawyers representing Amazon and the Defense Department teamed up to fight Oracle’s claims ― failed to block the award. Among other conclusions, the judge presiding over the case found that Oracle was not materially harmed by any procurement irregularities because it is not part of the competition anyway.

Oracle’s lawsuit did, however, manage to delay the award for several months while the Defense Department reexamined the role of Deap Ubhi, a Defense Department official later hired by Amazon.

[Read federal judge Eric G. Bruggink's rejection of Oracle's JEDI bid protest]

Ubhi had worked for Amazon before joining the Defense Department, where he worked on the JEDI procurement as a member of the Defense Digital Service. He repeatedly praised Amazon and referred to himself as an “Amazonian” while he was a public official, suggesting that he was biased in favor of Amazon.

A Defense Department investigation concluded that Ubhi’s involvement had not skewed the procurement in Amazon’s favor. The contracting officer overseeing JEDI did conclude, however, that Ubhi violated federal conflict-of-interest rules.

The judge presiding over the case concluded that Ubhi had lied to both the Defense Department and Amazon about the circumstances surrounding his departure from government service. The judge also concluded that Ubhi’s claims that he had been “leading the effort” to accelerate the department’s commercial cloud adoption were untrue, calling Ubhi’s statements about his role in the procurement “self-promoting, fabulist and often profanity-laced.”

Ubhi has not responded to repeated requests for comment, and his employer has declined to make him available for an interview. An Amazon spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday on the Defense Department inspector general’s review."
DOJ accuses Dems of trying to 'game the system' in 'so-called' impeachment probe,https://www.politico.com,"['Kyle Cheney', 'Andrew Desiderio']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/13/doj-congress-impeachment-probe-1460638,"Justice Department lawyers said the demand for former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify and the request for Robert Mueller’s grand jury evidence are based on “completely different factual and legal issues.” | Saul Loeb/Getty Images) congress DOJ accuses Dems of trying to 'game the system' in 'so-called' impeachment probe The Justice Department criticizes the Democrats' attempt to link the Don McGahn and Mueller grand jury cases as an attempt to search for a friendly judge.

The Justice Department on Tuesday accused House Democrats of shopping for a friendly federal judge in its effort to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify about potential obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.

In a new court filing, the Justice Department dinged the House Judiciary Committee for “attempting to game the system” by seeking to formally link its McGahn suit to a separate effort to access former special counsel Robert Mueller’s grand jury evidence.

Story Continued Below

Democrats say the cases are related because they are both connected to an ongoing “impeachment investigation” that could result in an effort to recommend Trump’s ouster. And tying the cases together could help expedite them, they argued.

But the Justice Department said House Democrats undercut their own argument for haste by waiting three months to file a lawsuit against McGahn, who refused to testify after the White House claimed he was “absolutely immune” and directed him to refuse to cooperate with Congress.

“For one thing, the committee’s desire for rapid adjudication rings hollow given that the committee waited until August to file suit over former counsel McGahn’s testimony despite being formally advised of the former counsel’s absolute immunity from compelled congressional testimony on May 20, 2019,” the filing states.

“Thus, any delay is the committee’s doing at this point.”

Judiciary Committee officials have emphasized efforts to show federal judges that they are making meaningful accommodations with the Justice Department and with McGahn directly. As recently as the week before the McGahn lawsuit was filed, the committee was deep into negotiations with McGahn that could have potentially averted the litigation.

The White House and the president’s GOP allies have repeatedly stressed the importance of the “accommodation process,” and they have criticized Democrats when they believed those efforts were cut short too quickly.

The Justice Department said the House’s true aim was to put both cases in front of D.C.’s chief federal judge Beryl Howell, who already was considering the grand jury matter, because of the perception that the appointee of former President Barack Obama might rule favorably in their case. It’s an attempt, the department argues, to manipulate longstanding requirements that cases be randomly assigned to judges to prevent judge-shopping.

Underscoring their point, Justice Department lawyers — arguing on McGahn’s behalf — said the demand for McGahn to testify and the request for Mueller’s grand jury evidence are based on “completely different factual and legal issues” and have no basis for being linked.

“[T]he two cases could not be more different,” the attorneys argued.

The Justice Department’s filing came a day after House lawyers argued in a separate filing that two of their court cases should be linked because both “seek key evidence for the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into whether to recommend articles of impeachment … based on the same underlying obstructive acts by President Trump.”

The Justice Department did not directly address the House’s assertions that it is conducting an impeachment investigation, but the filing referred to the effort as a so-called probe.

Last week, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said his panel was engaged in “formal impeachment proceedings,” a rhetorical escalation that matched what House lawyers had told federal judges in recent court filings. Nadler has also said that if the courts move quickly to address the House’s litigation, his committee could recommend articles of impeachment by the end of the year.

Democrats appear to lack the votes to open an impeachment inquiry in the traditional fashion, driven in part by Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s resistance to taking that step. Pelosi is mindful of forcing her most vulnerable caucus members to take a politically difficult vote when impeachment efforts are all but certainly doomed in the Republican-controlled Senate. She has repeatedly argued for continued litigation against and investigation of the president.

Republicans have pointed to her ambivalence as evidence that no formal inquiry has begun.

“Democrats seem to believe, when it comes to holding this president accountable, that the ends justify the means and that they shouldn’t be constrained by House procedure when our democracy is under siege,” Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, wrote in a recent op-ed. “In reality, they may do more to harm our democracy than any president ever could.”

In their own filing, Democrats argued that their authority for claiming to be in the midst of an impeachment probe stems from Jefferson’s Manual — a guide to parliamentary procedure employed by the House and Senate. The manual indicates that impeachment proceedings are launched in a variety of ways, not just through a formal vote of the House. One method is via the referral of articles of impeachment to the Judiciary Committee.

As Nadler and other Democrats note, the House referred articles of impeachment to the committee in January, and they say those articles are now officially under consideration for approval or amendment.

Democrats in recent weeks have pointed to a series of House actions they say bolster their position. In early June, the House voted to allow all committee chairs to enforce subpoenas in court — with the approval of House leaders acting on behalf of the entire chamber.

And last month, the House adopted a resolution declaring all Trump-related subpoenas and demands for information — retroactively and into the future — to have the support of the full House. Impeachment inquiry supporters say this is evidence that the House intended, however indirectly, to back impeachment proceedings without a formal vote.

Similarly, Judiciary Committee officials have noted that previous votes to authorize impeachment proceedings have been intended to empower the committee to issue subpoenas and convene depositions in an era when committees had far less authority than they do in the modern era. Now, the committee already has subpoena and deposition authority, they note.

"Upper Peninsula mine approved despite major concerns from DEQ and EPA staff, records show",https://www.duluthnewstribune.com,"['Keith Matheny', 'Detroit Free Press']",,,,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/energy-and-mining/4612571-Upper-Peninsula-mine-approved-despite-major-concerns-from-DEQ-and-EPA-staff-records-show,"Over and over, Michigan environmental regulators sounded alarms as they reviewed a proposed large, open-pit ore mine in the Upper Peninsula near the Menominee River, prized for walleye fishing and a major tributary to Lake Michigan. The mine would send acidic mining wastes into the river and surrounding waterways, which would then spill into the Great Lake, staff said. More acres of wetlands would be harmed than the mining company was projecting, evaluators found.

Then the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and then-Michigan Department of Environmental Quality approved the mine anyway.

At stake in whether the Back Forty Mine proceeds is the potential endangerment of one of the most important rivers in Michigan, part of a system that drains more than 4,000 square miles of the U.P. and northern Wisconsin, and a river culturally iconic to the Menominee Indians of Wisconsin, whose creation story includes that they come from the river’s mouth. Sacred burial grounds of the tribe are potentially threatened by the mine. The tribe is now among those appealing wetlands and surface water permit approvals for the mine.

The level of DEQ staff concern, and at times frustration, with Canadian company Aquila Resources' plan to mine for gold, zinc and copper within 150 feet of the river — in the western U.P. on the Michigan-Wisconsin border — has only now come to light, through agency documents presented as evidence in the appeal pending before an administrative law judge.

The open-pit sulfide mine would operate on 83 acres and its pit would be 2,000 feet by 2,500 feet, and 750 feet deep, according to the company. The life of the mine is planned at approximately seven years, and Aquila estimates it will produce:

512 million pounds of zinc

468,000 ounces of gold

51 million pounds of copper

24 million pounds of lead

4.5 million ounces of silver.

An on-site processing mill also will crush and refine minerals and ores through flotation, separation and the use of cyanide, according to the company's plans.

The DEQ emails, letters and memos show concern that Aquila Resources and its engineering firm, Green Bay, Wis.-based Foth Infrastructure and Environment, LLC, was understating the project's impact on the river and surrounding wetlands, according to regulators. The methods Aquila was using to measure wetlands impacts were improper, and the mining company wasn't changing them, DEQ staff said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shared similar concerns, documents show.

Eric Chatterson, a geology specialist in DEQ's Water Resources Division, wrote there was a ""high likelihood"" that crushed minerals and ores from the mine ""will be observed in the groundwater that discharges to the Menominee River and Shakey River,"" in an April 5, 2018, email to a department colleague. He added that the problems would continue when the mine ultimately closed, stating, ""Impacted groundwater from the backfilled pit is expected to migrate to local surface water sources.""

That's a particular concern for many, as sulfide ores exposed to air and water undergo chemical reactions that create sulfuric acid that harms water quality and is toxic to fish and smaller aquatic organisms.

Aquila's permit request, according to DEQ staff, was also failing to capture the mine's full impact on surrounding wetlands, which are vital to natural habitat, erosion protection and water quality. An unsigned, undated DEQ memo said of the groundwater model Aquila Resources was using as part of its permit application: ""It provides little to no use in assessing impacts to nearby wetlands.""

DEQ officials found that at some locations around the mine, operations would reduce the groundwater feeding wetlands ""in excess of 6 inches to greater than 5 feet throughout the modeled life of the mine,"" wrote Kristi Wilson of the DEQ's Water Resources Division to Aquila Resources officials on Jan. 19, 2018.

The EPA was similarly concerned. Christopher Korleski, director of the Water Division at EPA's Region 5 that includes Michigan, wrote the DEQ's Coleen O'Keefe on March 8, 2018, stating the agency objected to the issuance of a permit for the mine for, among other reasons, that the company had not yet demonstrated that ""the mine site plan is protective of water quality throughout the life of the mine and post-closure.""

But two months later, on May 3, 2018, following a meeting with Aquila officials and ""supplemental information"" being presented to the EPA, Korleski changed his stance.

""Based on the information EPA has received from Aquila, a number of objections identified in EPA's March 8 letter have been resolved,"" he stated. ""In addition, we believe that there is a ready pathway for the resolution of EPA's remaining objections through MDEQ's inclusion of specific conditions in a final permit issued by June 6, 2018.""

But the information provided by Aquila provided little of new substance, said Janette Brimmer, an attorney with the environmental nonprofit Earthjustice who is representing the Menominee tribe it its permit appeal.

For example, regarding EPA's concern about potential adverse impacts to water quality at the mine's closure, the agency accepted Aquila's statement that the closure plan would not be developed until after the mining pit was excavated, ""allowing the use of the mineralogy data from the pit walls to factor into the plan,"" and that any final closure plan would require review and approval by DEQ. Regarding secondary wetlands impacts, Aquila stated it was ""working with MDEQ to address concerns regarding the assessment of secondary impacts using modeling and water budgets.""

""That's the million-dollar question: What changed?"" Brimmer said. ""Nothing changed. Nothing changed on the ground. The data didn't change. Nothing changed other than, presumably, the politics. I would have liked to have been a fly on the wall in those EPA Region 5 meetings (with Aquila officials).""

EPA says its concerns were addressed

EPA Region 5 responded to Free Press requests for an interview with an emailed statement, stating Aquila's requirement to finalize plans with the state of Michigan and evaluate impacts prior to starting construction in wetlands addressed the agency's concerns.

The EPA reversal put the DEQ on a clock: Approve or reject the mining company's wetlands, lakes and streams permit within a month, by June 6, 2018, or authority on the permit application would transfer from the state agency to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

""I am concerned about the inevitable groundwater discharge that will be created from the mining and backfilling of the pit,"" Chatterson wrote to Wilson in a May 17 email, adding that Aquila's design plans to reduce polluted discharges when they closed and backfilled their mine ""should be approved by the Groundwater Permits Unit prior to construction activities,"" countering the EPA's position that the plan could be developed by the company after its pit was dug.

By that June 1, DEQ had approved Aquila Resources' final necessary permit to proceed with the mine. The wetlands, lakes and streams permit included numerous provisions that the company had to follow before work could proceed, including new groundwater level evaluations using methods approved by the DEQ. The permit allows for the filling of almost 6 acres of wetlands, with an indirect impact to more than 17 acres of wetlands from reductions in groundwater supply.

Scott Dean, a spokesman for the DEQ, which is now known as the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, or EGLE, touted the approved permit's provisions that Aquila Resources must meet, including ""an enhanced groundwater modelling and monitoring plan consistent with industry best practices,"" annual monitoring data to guard nearby wetlands over the years of the mine's operation, and adaptive protections that ramp up ""if adverse water impacts are detected during the life of the project.""

Aquila also will be required to develop ""state-of-the-art controls"" aimed at spill prevention and response to potential pollution releases, including chemicals used and stored on-site, and the storage and disposal of waste rock, Dean added.

More than a year after the state approved the wetlands and surface waters permit, Aquila Resources has not yet provided EGLE with the information required in the conditional permit, Dean said. The agency's Water Resources Division authorized Aquila to install groundwater and surface water monitoring equipment at the site in June.

Aquila must also still submit a design plan ""to ensure that the mine pit may be backfilled with waste material in a manner that is protective of water quality,"" Dean said.

Additionally, Aquila is filing with EGLE for a dam safety permit for its mining tailings and waste rock management facilities; an air pollution control permit, and revisions to an earlier approved permit for nonferrous metallic mineral mining, to meet the changed provisions for their plans as outlined in the wetlands permit, Dean said.

Brimmer said she's never before seen a situation where conditions that are typically confirmed in a permit application instead become conditions to resolve later in an approved permit.

""The DEQ witnesses, each and every one of them, were asked back in June (during testimony on the permit appeal), 'Have you ever before done a permit like this? Have you ever seen anything like this before?' To a person, they said no.""

The with-conditions permit approval turns the way the process should work on its head, Brimmer said.

""In order for the public to participate and comment on this, they have to understand what the risks are to that river. What are you proposing? What have you analyzed?"" she said. ""You can't do that when all of those details are blanks to be filled in later.

""It robs the public of meaningful participation in this process, which is a cornerstone of environmental law and regulation.""

Aquila Resources officials also responded to Free Press interview requests with an emailed statement.

""Aquila Resources, Inc. has obtained all the major permits for the Back Forty Project. Federal and state agencies, including the U.S. EPA and EGLE have completed an exhaustive review of potential impacts. Multiple environmental studies of the project spanning over a decade informed our permits. Aquila believes in the value of public input and participation, and strongly supports processes that encourage engagement with stakeholders. Each of these permitting processes allowed for extensive public comment and participation, which we actively engaged in, listening to and learning from our stakeholders. Our permits contain stringent terms and conditions to ensure the project operates with minimal impact on the Menominee River, groundwater, wetlands, and other natural resources.""

This 'is our homeland'

For the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, concerns about the Back Forty mine project go beyond potential environmental damage.

The tribe, with about 9,500 enrolled members, traces its creation story and history to the Menominee River, tribal chairman Douglas Cox said.

""The story is that the first being associated with our tribe, the Great Bear, came out of the lake at the mouth of the Menominee River and walked onto the land,"" he said.

The area is known to the tribe as Sixty Islands, and further legends tell of an ancient Menominee woman who performed ceremonies in the area and was taken up by the spirits that live in the river, Cox said.

""Our tribal members continue to visit that site, and some say they can hear or see that ancient Menominee woman, who is still there today,"" he said.

The area near the mine ""is our homeland,"" Cox said. ""Our people still go there, they still fish there, they still gather there.""

There are burial mounds with the remains of tribal ancestors ""up and down the Menominee River,"" he said.

""If you tell Americans, 'We're going to go dig up your grandma and grandpa to build a mine, to build industry, to disturb the banks of a historic river that's in your blood,' how does that feel?"" he said.

""It's protection of our cultural resources. There are cultural resources that are at risk from this development. We haven't gotten due attention under the law for our cultural resources.""

The Michigan-based permitting process for the Back Forty mine has left the Wisconsin side of the river mostly on the sidelines, Cox said.

""When the EPA, the Army Corps, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all take actions that are federal, they are obligated to consult with the tribe under laws such as the National Historic Preservation Act, the National American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act,"" he said.

""(Michigan) gets to contend, 'Nope, we're the authority now, so we're not obligated to do anything with you Indian nations — you independent, sovereign nations. We'll send you a letter, let you know what we're doing. But we won't communicate with you directly.' ""

Cox questioned Michigan's ""strange-sounding process"" of leaving so many things unresolved in the approved permit.

""You would think that, rather than try to conditionalize a permit to include all that's required, you would just say, 'We're not going to issue this permit until all of these big things are addressed, like groundwater modeling,'"" he said. ""I guess in Michigan they don't see it that way.""

Across the river, in Michigan's Menominee County, the board of commissioners passed a resolution opposing the Back Forty mine back in 2017.

""It's right on the river, 150 feet from the Menominee River,"" board vice chairman William Cech said. ""There's never really been a successful sulfide mine without leaving a large stain on the landscape that they are digging in.

""If the mine was 5 miles in from the water, it might be a whole different story. But because it's that main waterway that leads right into Lake Michigan, we are afraid.""

More hearings on the appeal ahead

There is no further opportunity for the public to comment on the Back Forty Mine's wetlands and surface waters permit. Hearings on the tribe's permit approval appeal are scheduled through Wednesday in Lansing, but may be extended to a later date, Brimmer said.

The tribe is also challenging the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' failing to act as the primary permitting authority for the Back Forty mine. The tribe is slated to present oral arguments in the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago on Sept. 5, Brimmer said.

""We're going to keep fighting,"" Cox said.

State Department's overly broad travel warnings undermine US mission,https://thehill.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/457170-state-departments-overly-broad-travel-warnings-undermine-us-mission,"BERBERA, SOMALILAND — To depart Mogadishu’s heavily-armed international airport — Somalia’s “green zone” — is an expensive prospect. Decades of lawlessness and instability in Mogadishu make insurance almost impossible. Few foreigners will pass outside the airport’s heavily fortified walls without armored cars and multiple personal security contractors. Most diplomats in Somalia (including America’s and Europe’s) are either sequestered inside the airport or remain in Kenya.

But Berbera is a different story. The main port in the northern region of Somaliland is thriving. New hotels are opening. Locals and foreigners intermingle on the beach, and both men and women gather on doorsteps and in tea houses in the evening to watch football, gossip, or shop. In Somaliland’s capital Hargeisa, money changers leave bundles of cash unattended as crime is so low. While al-Shabaab repeatedly strikes deep into Mogadishu and Kismayo, there has not been a terrorist attack in Hargeisa in more than a decade. While President Bihi’s government in Somaliland controls approximately 50,000 square miles of territory, President Farmajo in Mogadishu has secured only around 50,000 square feet, equivalent to the grounds of Villa Somalia, Somalia’s heavily-fortified White House.

According to the State Department’s travel warning, there is no difference between the two regions. “Do not travel to Somalia due to crime, terrorism, kidnapping and piracy,” it warns. It declares violent crime pernicious across regions, and continues to warn about piracy, even though Puntland’s pirates have not captured a single ship in more than two years, and Somaliland’s coast guard has never permitted piracy off its 450-mile coast.

ADVERTISEMENT

Inaccurate and imprecise State Department warnings are not limited to Somalia. The State Department’s Iraq warning neither acknowledges Iraqi Kurdistan’s decades-long security nor the dramatic drop in Baghdad violence. The United States recently got a taste of its own medicine when Uruguay issued a travel warning citing “growing indiscriminate violence, mostly for hate crimes, including racism and discrimination” as a reason to avoid travel to the United States, even as most towns and cities — let alone rural America — remain safer than ever.

Overly broad travel warnings matter. They undercut diplomacy and diminish soft power when America needs it most. They inflate insurance costs and dissuade investment. In effect, the State Department’s embrace of travel warning inaccuracy risks ceding entire countries to Russian, Chinese, Turkish, or Iranian influence as their businessmen sink roots while their American counterparts are absent.

There are other second order effects. Many universities now forbid students to study or research in areas subject to travel warnings. The irony here is that the countries where there are warnings are arguably the areas in which the United States most needs specialists.

They also breed corruption. I watched food shipments arrive in Berbera supervised by the World Food Programme. Because the UN, like the United States, does not differentiate between Somalia and Somaliland, the UN employees receive thousands of dollars of bonuses monthly due to supposed hazardous conditions which, in reality, do not exist. In short, it’s an expensive scam which costs American taxpayers. U.S. diplomats likewise receive similar danger pay and hardship bonuses, undermining the State Department’s already limited budget.

The reasons for such inaccurate warnings are complicated. Part of the problem is no security officer wants to loosen restrictions fearing that they could become a scapegoat in case of any future terrorism. This is why, more than a quarter century after the end of the Lebanese civil war, U.S. diplomatic security parameters remain largely unchanged. The Benghazi tragedy has also led the State Department to double down. Regional Security Officers feel the best way to protect staff is to hold them in gilded prisons, never mind undercutting any effectiveness.

Sometimes policy interferes. Since 2015, the State Department has refused to treat Somaliland differently than Somalia so as not to reinforce its separatism. That fiction not only undermines the veracity of all State Department warnings, but also cedes Somaliland to Russia or China.

Indeed, it can be a vicious circle as overly broad warnings become reason to dissuade diplomatic visits necessary to reassess the real situation, and they can even stand in the way of Congressional delegations and oversight.

Make no mistake: It’s essential to keep America’s diplomats and Americans safe, but inaccuracy and the State Department’s penchant for playing games with warnings risks undermining the reception of legitimate warnings and undermines the broader U.S. mission.

Wisconsin Corn Farmers Facing More Market Uncertainty After USDA Planting Report,https://www.wpr.org,['Hope Kirwan'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-corn-farmers-facing-more-market-uncertainty-after-usda-planting-report,"Wisconsin grain farmers are facing even more uncertainty this season as the U.S. Department of Agriculture releases more data on the number of corn and soybean acres planted.

In an annual acreage report released Monday, the USDA’s Farm Service Agency announced farmers across the country reported being unable to plant 19.4 million acres by crop insurance deadlines this spring. That’s the highest number reported since records started in 2007.

In Wisconsin, farmers reported 592,808 prevented planting acres. The FSA report shows 77 percent of those acres were planned to be corn.

Paul Mitchell, director of the Renk Agribusiness Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the numbers make up a significant amount of the state’s typical corn and soybean production.

""Twelve percent of the corn acres that we normally would plant are prevented planting,"" Mitchell said. ""For soybeans, it's 7 percent. So those are high (percentages).""

But Mitchell said industry analysts were expecting prevented planting numbers to be even higher, causing corn prices to plummet Monday after steadily improving this spring.

""It's an additional level of anxiety for farmers or uncertainty as we try to sort out what’s going on,"" Mitchell said. ""This is the time that you can make or lose money by marketing decisions and there is nobody to tell you what the right thing to do is because nobody really knows.""

At 44,927 acres, Outagamie County had the highest number of prevented plantings in the state.

Mitchell said farmers in much of the state’s northeastern region struggled to get their crops planted this spring.

""Those soils have a lot of clay in there, it’s just a wetter soil,"" Mitchell said. ""It holds the water better whereas in the Central Sands, the sandy soils, if it rains, you can get out there the next day and still operate.""

Duane Voy is director of the St. Paul Regional Office for the USDA’s Risk Management Agency, which oversees federal crop insurance programs. Voy said the agency is still gathering data from insurance agents on actual prevented planting claims.

He said producers should talk to their crop insurance agents if they’re unsure about the programs.

""Many people in Wisconsin may not be familiar with the prevented planting coverage because it hasn't been utilized that often and for many folks, this is the first time they may have had prevented planting,"" Voy said.

He said other commodities have also had problems with this season’s wet weather and could be eligible for insurance claims later this season.

""Potatoes don't particularly like wet feet,"" Voy said. ""So the ones that are in sandy areas that are irrigated may do well, but we’ve heard some issues on potatoes. You also have quite a few processing beans, and in wet and cooler conditions mold can be a problem. That's also an insured cause of loss."""
Free picnic to celebrate former Dept. of Energy employees who worked in nuclear weapons development,https://www.eastidahonews.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2019/08/free-picnic-to-honor-current-and-former-dept-of-energy-workers/,"ARCO — A free lunch is being provided to help connect and celebrate former atomic workers who served in the United States’ nuclear weapons development industry.

New Jersey Paralegal Allegedly Used DOJ Access to Help Son’s Gang Identify “Snitches”,https://slate.com,['Molly Olmstead'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/new-jersey-gang-paralegal-doj-access-snitches.html,"The state seal of New Jersey. Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Wikipedia.

A paralegal in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office has been accused of using her government access to identify people in her son’s gang who cooperated with investigators, putting them in danger of retaliation from their fellow gang members, according to filings in a federal court in Brooklyn. The woman pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday.

According to prosecutors, Tawanna Hilliard, 44, used her access to Department of Justice computers to search databases to identify cooperating witnesses from the 5-9 Brims, a set of the Bloods street gang, at the direction of members of that gang. According to NJ.com, Hilliard had worked in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney Office’s Civil Division for nine years.

Hilliard also specifically targeted the co-defendant in a robbery case that resulted in her son, Tyquan, being sentenced to 10 years in prison. In May 2018, the man and Tyquan Hilliard robbed an AT&T store in Monticello, New York. The men threatened the store clerk and two shoppers with a gun and bound them with duct tape in a storage room. They fled the scene and led the police on a high-speed chase before crashing their car and being captured.

Texts between the mother and son allegedly show Tawanna Hilliard complaining that the co-defendant’s cooperation with the investigators after the robbery ruined her son’s defense. The man was “giving up murders, victims, shooters and all…SMH,” she wrote in a text, according to court documents. Tawanna Hilliard allegedly responded by posting a video on YouTube of the co-defendant talking to investigators about that robbery, with the title “NYC Brim Gang Member Snitching Pt. 1.” The man and his family then received death threats from other inmates linked to the Bloods, according to prosecutors.

According to NJ.com, the indictment contends that before his arrest, Hilliard told her son in an April 2016 call that she had “looked up” cases for another gang member who wanted to locate people who “snitched.”

Hilliard has been charged with witness tampering, obstruction of justice, and obtaining information from a government computer. She was released on bond with the order not to contact her son or other gang members. Her son is also charged in the indictment."
Newark hands out bottled water amid growing lead crisis following EPA rebuke,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/newark-bottled-water-epa-crisis-lead-flint-vulnerable-communities-1cdc6e5f8436/,"One of New Jersey’s major cities is offering bottled water to its residents after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) raised glaring concerns over dangerous lead content in the area’s drinking supply.

The growing crisis in Newark comes after years of resident concerns over lead in drinking water, leading many people last fall to start using water filters on their taps. That change hasn’t gone far enough, the federal government says, and now the city is facing water issues reminiscent of other areas, like Flint, Michigan.

Both cities are majority black with many residents living below the poverty line — groups that tend to suffer environmental crises disproportionately.

New Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy (D) and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) said Sunday that beginning Monday, bottled water would be available to city residents concerned about water quality.

“Access to safe drinking water is critically important to our administrations and we take health risks associated with lead in drinking water very seriously,” the officials said in a joint statement.

The move comes amid growing controversy over lead in Newark’s drinking water, a problem that stretches back several years. Some of the city’s lead service pipes are around a century old, sparking concern among public health experts. And since at least 2018, inadequate corrosion treatment at the Pequannock water plant has led to high lead levels in some residents’ tap water, breaching 15 parts per billion, the standard set by the EPA.

After downplaying the city’s water issues for over a year, Newark in October 2018 gave away 38,000 water filters to address the problem. But residents say they still have lead in their drinking water. On Friday, the EPA sent a letter to the city and state advising bottled water usage for residents in homes with lead pipes.

“[W]e are unable at this time to assure Newark residents that their heath is fully protected when drinking tap water filtered through these devices,” the EPA wrote, after testing water at two residences in Newark.

Under President Donald Trump, the EPA has repeatedly said that water issues are the country’s top environmental problem, above climate change. But Newark’s crisis reflects ongoing contamination trends across the country. And it’s not just lead that’s leaching into the water.

Toxic “forever chemicals” found in non-stick pans and many other everyday items have appeared in water around the country, including in Michigan. And in states like Iowa, agricultural runoff is polluting well water. In both instances, health and environmental advocates have argued the EPA is not doing enough to address the problem.

But the agency indicated it might assert its authority if Newark’s situation does not improve. The EPA said it “is prepared to take appropriate action” to protect public health in the city.

Contact with lead can result in growth development problems, neurological issues, and occasionally fatalities. Lead in public drinking water can be especially problematic given the universal nature of water consumption.

In Flint, a drinking water crisis that began in 2014 affected around 100,000 people after the city switched its water source. Multiple deaths are associated with lead pollution there and residents have repeatedly accused public officials of lying to them about the extent of the issue. Litigation over responsibility for Flint’s tragedy remains ongoing.

EPA data has repeatedly shown that communities of color and low-income areas disproportionately suffer from environmental problems, like air and water issues. And while Newark, like Flint, is heavily black with a high poverty rate, the city has so far worked to avoid comparing the two situations, even as Newark’s public health crisis grows.

Mayor Baraka has previously called on Trump to help Newark address its water issues. In January, Baraka told the White House the cost would likely be around $70 million. Prior to that, the city had historically argued that its water was safe to drink, despite concerns.

Now, the city is advising residents to run their taps for five minutes before using the water. Bottled water is only being distributed to certain residents who had previously received filters, although pregnant people and young children are advised to drink bottled water. Baraka has insisted that the bottled water is only a “preliminary precaution.”

But advocates argue the city still isn’t doing enough. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Newark Education Workers Caucus (NEW Caucus) sued city and state officials in 2018, arguing that systemic failures had allowed the lead contamination to occur. Both groups greeted the city’s move towards bottled water for impacted residents but expressed continued concern.

“We are deeply troubled by the City’s announcement [confirming the lead issues],” NRDC’s Senior Director of Health and Food Erik Olson said in a statement, going on to express hope that both NRDC and NEW Caucus “can work cooperatively with the City to address this serious public health crisis.”"
"State Department hiring freeze undermined safety and gutted morale, report finds",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/12/politics/state-oig-report-hiring-freeze/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department's 16-month-long hiring freeze had broad and negative impacts on the agency, including its ability to ensure the safety and wellbeing of personnel domestically and abroad, according to a report from the department's watchdog.

According to the Office of Inspector General's report released Friday, 96% of embassies and consulates and 95% of domestic bureaus and offices who responded to OIG's surveys said the hiring freeze ""had a somewhat negative or very negative effect on overall operations."" Some 97% of embassies and consulates and 100% of bureaus and offices told OIG that the freeze negatively impacted employee morale and welfare.

President Donald Trump instituted the hiring freeze upon taking office in January 2017. The Office of Management and Budget lifted the freeze in mid-April of that year, but the State Department continued the freeze for another 13 months under the tenure of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mike Pompeo resumed hiring in May 2018, after becoming secretary of state.

The OIG report, which was ordered by Congress and based on responses from 38 bureaus and offices and 151 overseas posts, found that ""several bureaus charged with protecting security, health, and life safety reported to OIG that the hiring freeze had significant detrimental effects on their operations.""

The Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), for example, reported a number of adverse repercussions as a result of the freeze. Among those were the inability to staff its command center -- which ""operates 24 hours a day to monitor and report information regarding threats against US diplomatic missions, the Secretary, and American citizens abroad"" -- at the recommended levels.

10-year Treasury yield dips back below 1.7% amid global growth worries,https://www.cnbc.com,['Sam Meredith'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/us-bonds-treasury-yields-tick-lower-amid-trade-war-concerns.html,"U.S. government debt yields were sharply lower on Monday, amid trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and concerns of slowing global economic growth.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 1.63%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also lower at around 2.127%.

The spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields narrowed to about only 5 basis points on Monday, near its lowest level since 2007.

""Persistently low inflation in developed economies should constrain nominal yields, and tariffs are more likely to weigh on prices via demand destruction,"" Michael Reynolds, investment strategy officer at Glenmede Trust Company. ""Overall, these factors are holding back aggregate demand for both consumer spending and business investment, culminating in lower bond yields that reflect diminished growth expectations.""

Market focus is largely attuned to simmering trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.

On Friday, President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and called into question the next round of trade talks. It comes after the U.S. president said he would impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports on September 1. China responded by halting its purchases of U.S. agricultural products.

Last week, the U.S. accused China of being a currency manipulator after Beijing allowed the yuan to dip below the 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade.

On Monday, the People's Bank of China set its daily midpoint for yuan trading — which determines the limits for its onshore movement — at 7.0211 per dollar. That was weaker than Friday's session, but stronger than market expectations.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury is set to auction $42 billion in 13-week bills and $42 billion in 26-week bills."
