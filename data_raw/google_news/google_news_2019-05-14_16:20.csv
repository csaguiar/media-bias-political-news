"Trump says deal with China will happen ‘when the time is right, US needs to 'make up' ground first",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-deal-with-china-will-happen-when-the-time-is-right-us-needs-to-make-up-ground-first,"President Trump on Tuesday said that a deal with China will happen “when the time is right,” and only after the U.S. is allowed to “make up” ground he says was lost after the formation of the World Trade Organization.

“When the time is right we will make a deal with China. My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but, as I have told him many times before, this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn’t make any sense,” Trump said as part of a lengthy tweetstorm.

CHINA IS FIGHTING TO 'PROTECT ITS LEGITIMATE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS' IN TRADE WAR WITH US, STATE MEDIA SAYS

The tweets come after the U.S. last week began increasing tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods. China responded by upping tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods.

But both sides have expressed willingness to come together and make a trade deal to cool the escalating trade war between the two superpowers. A Chinese delegation was in Washington last week, and while talks broke off Friday, both sides have indicated that further talks will happen.

However, the Trade Representative's Office listed a further $300 billion of Chinese goods for possible tariffs on Monday, while the Chinese government warned it was prepared to “fight to the finish” in response to U.S. action.

WHY THE US-CHINA TRADE WAR COULD SETTLE THE 2020 ELECTION IN 2019

Trump has repeatedly said that the trade structure between the two countries is imbalanced, and has sought to rectify that. The Trump administration started placing tariffs on Chinese goods last year. He pointed his finger on Tuesday at the WTO, whose formation he said is at least partly responsible for U.S. losses on trade.

“We have to be allowed to make up some of the tremendous ground we have lost to China on Trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the WTO,” he said. “It will all happen, and much faster than people think!”

Responding to fears that a trade war with China could hurt American farmers, Trump said that they would in fact be “the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now.”

“Hopefully China will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product, the best, but if not your Country will be making up the difference based on a very high China buy,” he said. “This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us.”

Trump has touted his relationship with Xi, and said Monday he will meet with the Chinese premier during the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan at the end of June.

"Inside Trump 2020: As Dem field sets, campaign takes aim at ‘socialist organism with 22 heads’",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Kayleigh Mcenany', 'Trump Campaign National Press Secretary', 'Tim Murtaugh', 'Trump Campaign Communications Director', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/inside-trump-2020-as-dem-field-sets-campaign-takes-aim-at-socialist-organism-with-22-heads,"ROSSLYN, Va. – Inside the Trump re-election campaign offices overlooking the Potomac River, a rapidly growing operation is confronting a challenge of historic proportions – how to run against a field of nearly two-dozen candidates, all of whom are hurling rhetorical bombs at the incumbent on a daily basis.

Communications Director Tim Murtaugh, whose job is to help shape that strategy, boils it down. The field, he says, is “one big socialist organism with 22 heads.”

It’s a message voters can expect to hear often as the Democratic primary field settles into place, with just a few more stragglers left to join. The Trump re-election team sees a target-rich environment emerging, especially with the rise in popularity of democratic socialist Bernie Sanders and policies like “Medicare for All” and the “Green New Deal.” While stitching that counter-""socialist"" theme into the fabric of their message, the campaign is now starting to hit back more at the ensemble cast of potential 2020 foes after waiting and watching for months.

“We see them as a homogenous group of socialists,” Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, told Fox News during a recent visit to the Northern Virginia office.

For now, the Trump campaign says they are enjoying the advantage of incumbency: being able to spend the next 13 months raising money, staffing up and pushing their message that the other party has moved too far left while Democrats endure a bruising intra-party fight.

“We like the way the field – the whole landscape -- is shaping up,” Murtaugh said. “We’ve got this huge advantage of time and their whole messy primary process is going to -- at the end -- produce a socialist candidate for president.”

'One of the things that we’re very keen on doing is having every other Democrat answer for the inevitable extreme, completely out of left field statement that is made on a daily basis.' — Kayleigh McEnany, Trump campaign national press secretary

TRUMP, AT FLORIDA RALLY, MOCKS 2020 FIELD

But the campaign, and President Trump himself, have started selectively taking shots at the more prominent members of the field. When Bernie Sanders called for giving the Boston Marathon bomber voting rights, the campaign responded. The president also just assigned the rising Pete Buttigieg a nickname, mocking him as ""Alfred E. Neuman"" in reference to the goofy Mad magazine mascot. (Buttigieg took a swipe at their age gap in response, telling Politico: ""I guess it’s just a generational thing. I didn’t get the reference."")

The Trump campaign hasn’t announced plans yet for how they will approach the upcoming Democratic debates – which kick off in Miami on June 26. But they suggested they may offer some kind of counter-programing, whether a rally or something else. “It’s safe to say we will be engaged,” McEnany said.

Democrats, for their part, have dismissed the efforts to portray the party's candidates as a socialist cabal. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez recently said on ""Fox News Sunday"": “This is one of the oldest tricks in the playbook. You go back 75 years, when Republicans don’t want to discuss the issues that matter to real people, they call it socialism.”

Brandon Gassaway, a spokesman for the DNC, said in a statement that Republicans ""know they can’t compete in a policy debate, so they rely on tropes and misinformation.""

""Whether it is the minimum wage, Social Security, or children's health insurance, Republicans have always cried 'socialism' in response to any proposal designed to expand opportunity for working people,"" he said. ""Democrats will win in 2020 because our candidates are focused on the issues and identifying how to make sure everyone has a fair shot at success.""

Hypothetical head-to-head polls, meanwhile, have shown Trump slightly trailing the two Democratic primary front-runners, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sanders. A Fox News poll in March, before the former vice president entered the race, showed Biden ahead of Trump by 7 points and Sanders ahead by 3 points. Not all Democratic candidates are polling ahead of the president: the same poll showed Trump topping both California Sen. Kamala Harris and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren by 2 points.

But it's still early.

On the recent visit to Trump's suburban Washington campaign office, aides were seen busily typing on laptops and making phone calls. The campaign is still hiring, with plans to increase staff from about 40 to an unspecified but “sizeable” number, the campaign said. The bulk of staff will be out in the field, jointly with the Republican National Committee.

Many of the seats in the soon-to-be activated war room are yet to be filled, as the RNC, at this point, carries the load of candidate monitoring, opposition research and rapid response. But the campaign, busy highlighting controversial comments made by the entire field, will eventually integrate the RNC's war room into their own operation at the offices.

“We certainly keep tabs on all the Democratic contenders,” McEnany said. “One of the things that we’re very keen on doing is having every other Democrat answer for the inevitable extreme, completely out of left field statement that is made on a daily basis.”

“So when Bernie Sanders says, ‘let's let the Boston bomber vote’ we want to hear from every other Democratic candidate how they feel about that,” she said.

The Trump campaign signaled they are determined to push back on the portrayal of Biden, currently leading the field, as more centrist than his primary rivals, pointing to his comments this year that he has the “most progressive record” of anyone in the race.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO VOTE

“Purportedly that means more so than Bernie Sanders, his socialist peer,” McEnany said.

Though some Republicans -- like former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan -- have launched or considered an intra-party challenge to Trump, the campaign says they aren’t focused on primary rivals and are running a general election campaign.

“We are unmistakable in echoing the RNC that there is not a Republican primary going on right now,” McEnany said. “You look at this president, he has 93 approval among his own party.”

A major difference, the campaign notes, between this cycle and last cycle is its fundraising operation. They cite how establishment Republican types, like longtime bundler Jack Oliver, are now helping to raise money.

McEnany said the campaign will continue holding Trump rallies in swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. The campaign just announced one in Pennsylvania next week. But campaign manager Brad Parscale is also eying states won by Democrats in 2016 like Minnesota, New Mexico and Colorado as targets in 2020, she said.

'We’ve got this huge advantage of time and their whole messy primary process is going to -- at the end -- produce a socialist candidate for president.' — Tim Murtaugh, Trump campaign communications director

McEnany said the campaign doubts Democrats will make the same mistake they did in 2016 by not spending enough time in Midwestern states like Wisconsin, but argued even someone who might connect better with voters than Hillary Clinton will have to answer for manufacturing job losses during the Obama-Biden era. “You can put your feet on the ground you can pay lip service to these policies – but you have a record of failure,” she said. “One that is not going to sell to union workers.”

The campaign has room to grow. The operation rents the entire floor of a building in Rosslyn with views of the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, the Capitol and Arlington National Cemetery from staffers’ offices. The campaign says they still consider headquarters to be at Trump Tower in Manhattan, though the vast majority of the campaign operation will be in Rosslyn.

As for the re-election slogan, McEnany said the campaign will continue to use “Make America Great Again,"" even if re-tooled to something like “MAGA ’20.”

They still fundraise off the slogan: Under lock and key in the office of John Pence, a senior campaign staffer and nephew to Vice President Pence, is what the campaign says is the millionth red “MAGA” hat produced by the campaign since 2015. The campaign had Trump sign it, and plans to give it away as part of a contest.

“Everyone knows MAGA,” McEnany said. “Everyone knows the red hat.”"
Judge grills Trump attorney in subpoena case,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney', 'John Bresnahan', 'Brian Faler', 'Aaron Lorenzo', 'Darren Samuelsohn']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/trump-subpoena-congress-legal-1318867,"The ruling from Judge Amit Mehta (left) will represent a flashpoint in the myriad disputes between the White House and Congress. | Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Legal Judge grills Trump attorney in subpoena case Democrats are fighting for access to the president's financial records.

President Donald Trump’s strategy of outright resistance to House subpoenas is facing its first test in federal court on Tuesday, setting up a ruling that could boost Democrats’ efforts to investigate the president’s business dealings.

U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta began hearing arguments on the Democrat-led House Oversight and Reform Committee’s subpoena of accounting firm Mazars USA for eight years of Trump’s financial records. The committee’s demand is part of its investigation into alleged financial crimes committed by Trump, including whether he inaccurately reported his finances.

Story Continued Below

Trump filed suit seeking to invalidate the subpoena three weeks ago — the first of two lawsuits aimed at hobbling House Democrats’ investigations targeting his administration, presidential campaign and business empire.

Mehta’s ruling will represent a flashpoint in the myriad disputes between the White House and Congress — marking the first time the judiciary weighs in on Trump’s blanket strategy of refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas and oversight requests from House Democrats.

In opening comments, Mehta indicated that he would not issue a ruling from the bench but would mull over the arguments, calling the nature of the dispute too significant to decide quickly.

Trump and his Republican allies have argued that the subpoena was politically motivated and amounts to an abuse of Congress’ authority to conduct oversight of the executive branch. Democrats have said Trump’s court challenges are frivolous efforts to delay legitimate probes, part of what they say is a broad “stonewalling” effort by the Trump administration.

Mehta spent the early portion of the hearing grilling Trump's lawyer William Consovoy about why Congress' interest in investigating possible foreign payments to the president — known as emoluments — isn't valid or whether Congress has legitimate investigative interest into a president's potential financial conflicts of interest.

""Say for example if a president had a financial interest in a particular piece of legislation that was being considered … in your view Congress could not investigate whether a president has a conflict of interest?"" Mehta wondered.

""It would lack legitimate legislative purpose,"" replied Consovoy, who argued that any attempt by Congress to determine whether a president was acting outside the law was improper because it's the job of law enforcement, not lawmakers.

Mehta questioned, however, whether the Whitewater investigation of the Clintons or the Watergate investigation of President Richard Nixon would have passed muster under Trump's current legal theory.

Trump's attorney said he was arguing only on the facts of the subpoena case, not previous investigations.

Consovoy urged Mehta to grant Trumps’ legal team “a week or two” to gather documents from the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee — Rep. Jim Jordan — that might support their case. Consovoy said he’s particularly interested in obtaining a memorandum of understanding between the Oversight Committee and the Intelligence and Financial Services Committees, which he said could support the argument that Democrats are pursuing Trump from a law enforcement — not legislative — perspective.

Consovoy acknowledged that he'd have no authority to compel production of that document from committee Democrats, including Chairman Elijah Cummings, but he said Jordan might be willing to provide it voluntarily.

House Counsel Doug Letter, however, said Trump is essentially arguing that Congress is a “nuisance” and that he shouldn’t have to submit to its investigations.

“The problem with that is this is a total and basic and fundamental misunderstanding of the system that was set up by the Constitution,” he said.

Letter said the House’s investigations have been supported by a previous Supreme Court ruling determining that such probes only need to have a conceivable legislative purpose, not necessarily an explicit one.

Mehta asked Letter whether he agreed with the notion that Congress’s legislative role also includes an “informing function” – providing important information to the public. Letter noted that Congress investigated the 9/11 attacks and issues related to the Iraq War, Watergate and Whitewater – primarily to inform the public.

Letter also noted that it’s sometimes impossible to know what legislation might arise from an investigation at the outset. “I’m not a prophet,” he said, “you’re not a prophet.”

Mehta questioned whether there are any conceivable limits on Congress’ demands for private presidential documents. Letter replied that it’s conceivable but that this case isn’t close.

“I want to see the president’s diary from when he was seven years old or she was 12 years old — that would probably stretch my arguments to the breaking point,” he said.

Tuesday's hearing followed a decision by Mehta to consolidate the preliminary proceedings of the lawsuit with the main trial on the merits of Trump's arguments, a move that underscored Trump's uphill legal climb. It suggests the judge didn’t want to drag out the case as Democrats seek to quickly gather evidence of Trump’s alleged financial impropriety.

On Monday, ahead of the hearing, Trump’s attorneys telegraphed those concerns in a new court filing and asked Mehta to cancel the hearing altogether and set a trial date.

“While Plaintiffs understand the Court’s desire to decide this case efficiently, resolving it in this way—and on this schedule—will severely prejudice Plaintiffs,” Consovoy wrote in a Monday filing.

Douglas Letter, general counsel for the House of Representatives, backed Mehta’s plan to rule from the bench, saying in a court filing that Consovoy’s “complaint lacks merit and an expeditious resolution of the subpoena’s validity is necessary for the committee’s investigations to continue.”

Mehta later formally denied Consovoy’s request, writing in a brief order Monday night: “The hearing will proceed tomorrow as scheduled.”

Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) issued the so-called friendly subpoena to Mazars, which asked for the subpoena so that it could comply with the request. He issued it just days after Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney and fixer, provided documents to the Oversight panel purportedly showing that the president artificially inflated and deflated the value of his assets in order to benefit financially.

Cohen in February disclosed several of Trump’s financial statements which were submitted to Deutsche Bank in 2014 as Trump was seeking a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills NFL team. Cohen told lawmakers that the documents showed that Trump inflated the value of certain assets in order to secure the loan.

The committee says it needs Trump’s financial records from Mazars as part of its efforts to corroborate Cohen’s allegations.

Trump’s lawyers argue the subpoena is defective because it relies so heavily on Cohen’s testimony.

“Chairman Cummings requested this information because Michael Cohen—a felon who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress—told the House Oversight Committee that the President had misrepresented his net worth while he was a private citizen,” Trump’s attorneys wrote, calling it “one of the worst examples of the House Democrats’ zeal to attack President Trump.”

Mehta’s ruling could provide a blueprint for other judges deciding on Trump’s attempts to thwart congressional investigations. Trump has also filed suit to block the House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees from subpoenaing Deutsche Bank and Capital One, where many of his business and personal financial records are housed.

Trump’s attorneys have argued that House Democrats’ efforts to obtain Trump’s records are political grenades masked as efforts to conduct legitimate investigations. Democrats just want to damage the president politically ahead of his reelection fight, they argue, and their subpoenas are illegitimate because there’s no underlying effort to support possible legislation that could arise.

“Democrats are using their new control of congressional committees to investigate every aspect of President Trump’s personal finances, businesses, and even his family,” Trump’s lawyers wrote. “Instead of working with the President to pass bipartisan legislation that would actually benefit Americans, House Democrats are singularly obsessed with finding something they can use to damage the President politically.”

If Mehta, an appointee of President Barack Obama, rules in favor of House Democrats, it may be House Republicans’ previous court battles that helped provide the road map. In 2017, House Intelligence Committee Republicans successfully sued Fusion GPS — a research firm hired by Democrats that commissioned the so-called Steele dossier alleging a vast Trump-Russia conspiracy to influence the 2016 election — for the firm’s financial records.

In that case, Judge Richard Leon — a George W. Bush appointee — indicated that Congress had broad authority to define the legitimate “legislative purpose” of its demands for information.

“This court will not — and indeed, may not — engage in a line-by-line review of the committee’s requests,” Leon wrote at the time.

"Iran news: Details of tanker ""sabotage"" murky as Trump warns Iran and U.S. casts first blame",https://www.cbsnews.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-news-sabotage-tankers-fujairah-us-donald-trump-warns-iran-live-updates-2019-05-14/,"A team of U.S. military investigators has made an initial assessment that Iran or groups it supports was behind an alleged sabotage attack on 4 tankers in the Gulf of Oman.

President Trump, asked about the incident on Monday, said ""it's going to be a bad problem for Iran if something happens.""

The White House has ordered a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group and 4 B-52 bombers to the region as tensions with Iran soar.

Images of the ships show little apparent damage, apart from a large hole in one of the tankers, but U.S. officials say each vessel sustained similar damage.

Dubai, United Arab Emirates -- Four oil tankers anchored in the Mideast were damaged by what Saudi and U.S. officials say were ""sabotage"" attacks, though images of the ships have shown clear visible damage to only one of the vessels. Details of the alleged sabotage to two Saudi, one Norwegian and one Emirati oil tanker on Sunday remained unclear, and none of the nations to which the vessels belong had assigned any blame.

However, on Monday American officials told CBS News senior national security correspondent David Martin that the initial assessment of a U.S. team sent to investigate the incidents was that Iran or Iranian-backed proxies had used explosives to blow holes in the four ships.

The incidents demonstrated the raised risks for shippers in a region vital to global energy supplies as tensions soar between the U.S. and Iran in the wake of President Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the nuclear deal agreed by world powers and to impose harsh new sanctions on the Islamic Republic.

Asked at the White House about the incident on Monday, President Trump responded: ""It's going to be a bad problem for Iran if something happens.""

Meanwhile, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who is currently holding talks with his counterpart in India, said that the U.S. ""has been escalating the situation unnecessarily.""

""We do not seek escalation but we have always defended ourselves,"" he said.

The U.S. had warned sailors of the potential for attacks by Iran or groups it backs on commercial sea traffic just days before the alleged sabotage, and regional allies of the United Arab Emirates condemned the incidents as the tankers were off the coast of the UAE port city of Fujairah.

The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which patrols the Mideast and operates from a base in Fujairah, has repeatedly declined to comment.

Saudi Arabia claims ""sabotage attacks"" on oil tankers

The Trump administration has already sent four B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf to counter alleged, still-unspecified threats from Tehran, and the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group is also headed for the Gulf.

Spanish ship backs out

On Tuesday, Spain temporarily pulled one of its frigates that's part of a U.S.-led combat fleet from near the Persian Gulf because of mounting U.S.-Iran tensions. The Ministry of Defense said the Méndez Núñez, with 215 sailors on board, would not cross the Strait of Hormuz into the Gulf together with the USS Abraham Lincoln.

The Ministry declined to elaborate on the reasons for the sudden change.

Spanish media, citing government sources, said Spain was concerned that it could be dragged to an unwanted conflict as a result of the crisis between Washington and Teheran surrounding the unraveling nuclear deal.

The Spanish frigate was the only non-U.S. vessel in the fleet.

Damage to ships unclear

The scale of the alleged sabotage remained unclear. A statement from Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said two of the kingdom's oil tankers, including one due to later carry crude to the U.S., sustained ""significant damage."" However, a report from Sky News Arabia, a satellite channel owned by an Abu Dhabi ruling family member, showed the allegedly targeted Saudi tanker Al Marzoqah afloat without any apparent damage.

The oil tankers were visible in satellite images provided Tuesday to the AP by Colorado-based Maxar Technologies. A boom surrounded the Emirati oil tanker A. Michel, indicating the possibility of an oil leak. The other three showed no visible major damage from above.

The MT Andrea Victory, the fourth allegedly targeted ship, sustained a hole in its hull just above its waterline from ""an unknown object,"" its owner Thome Ship Management said in a statement. Images on Monday of the Norwegian-flagged Andrea Victory, which the company said was ""not in any danger of sinking,"" showed damage similar to what the firm described.

Port officials take a photo of the damaged Andrea Victory tanker at the Port of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates, May 13, 2019. REUTERS

A U.S. official told the Associated Press that each ship sustained a 5- to 10-foot hole, near or just below the water line, suspected to have been caused by explosive charges. Emirati officials had requested the team of U.S. military investigators aid them in their probe.

Splash247.com, a shipping and maritime news website, quoted officials at the port in Fujairah as saying ""limpet mines"" were the suspected weapons used to cause the damage. They are magnetic bombs that can be stuck onto steel-hulled vessels by anyone who can get close enough on a small boat, or by divers in the water.

""Our aim is not war""

Citing heightened tensions in the region, the United Nations called on ""all concerned parties to exercise restraint for the sake of regional peace, including by ensuring maritime security"" and freedom of navigation, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said.

Shortly after the Saudi announcement that two of the country's tankers had been attacked, Iran's Foreign Ministry called for further clarification about what exactly happened with the vessels. The ministry's spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as warning against any ""conspiracy orchestrated by ill-wishers"" and ""adventurism by foreigners"" to undermine the maritime region's stability and security. Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia are staunch opponents of Iran's government.

Tensions have risen since Mr. Trump withdrew America from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Last week, Iran warned it would begin enriching uranium at higher levels in 60 days if world powers failed to negotiate new terms for the deal.

Mulvaney says U.S. ""not going to war in Iran"" amid rising tensions

European Union officials met Monday in Brussels to thrash out ways to keep the Iran nuclear deal afloat. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had traveled there for talks.

""We're not going to miscalculate. Our aim is not war,"" Pompeo told CNBC in an interview. ""Our aim is a change in the behavior of the Iranian leadership.""

Speaking before the Brussels meeting on Monday, Britain's Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt warned of the risks of an ""accident"" sparking a conflict between the United States and Iran.

""We are very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident with an escalation that is unintended,"" Hunt said.

Underlying the regional risk, the general-secretary of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council described the alleged sabotage as a ""serious escalation,"" and said ""such irresponsible acts will increase tension and conflicts in the region and expose its peoples to great danger."""
"Donald Trump Jr.’s No-Shows Led to Subpoena, Republican Senator Says",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Nicholas Fandos', 'Maggie Haberman']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-subpoena.html,"WASHINGTON — Allies of Donald Trump Jr. may have stirred up a firestorm among Republicans over a subpoena to recall the president’s eldest son to the Senate Intelligence Committee, but the panel’s Republican chairman has suggested to colleagues that the standoff is of the younger Mr. Trump’s making.

Twice in recent months Donald Trump Jr. agreed to sit for voluntary interviews with the Intelligence Committee, only to later back out, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the panel’s chairman, told colleagues privately last week, according to two people familiar with his remarks. The chairman said at a senators-only luncheon last Thursday that the evasions had left the committee no choice but to issue a subpoena on April 8 to give senators a chance to directly question the younger Mr. Trump as they seek to tie up loose ends on their investigation of Russian election interference.

Nodding to the media maelstrom that news of the subpoena set off, Mr. Burr told colleagues that he was not happy about the confrontation, but he suggested that the younger Mr. Trump had been given ample opportunity to cooperate quietly and voluntarily, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the private lunch. The committee’s investigation is the last bipartisan inquiry into Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election and the Kremlin’s ties to the Trump campaign."

The Trump administration wanted to target migrant families that had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico in attempt to show that the U.S. wasn't going to back down on its border stance by detaining and deporting illegal immigrant families, The Washington Post first reported, citing several current and former Homeland Security officials.

NEW TRUMP WH POLICY LETS DEPUTIES DETAIN IMMIGRANTS ON BEHALF OF ICE, SUBVERTING 'SANCTUARY' LAWS

The operation included fast-tracking immigration court cases and allowing the U.S. to deport those who failed to show up in their hearings as well as coordinating raids against parents with children in several cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and several other major metropolitan areas, Fox News confirmed.

Nielsen and top immigration official Ronald Vitiello pushed back on the administration’s plan, citing lack of preparation, public outrage and worries that the operation could use border resources. Stephen Miller and ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence were supportive of the plan arguing that such an operation could deter migrants from crossing into the U.S., according to The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s were concerned over the operation and logistics over the plan and not the ethical reasons behind it, according to the newspaper. Nielsen also worried that targeting parents and children might detract from the White House’s goal of going after so-called “criminal aliens.”

“There was concern that it was being hastily put together, would be ineffective and might actually backfire by misdirecting resources away from critical border emergency response operations,” a Homeland Security official told The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s push back was reportedly part of the reason why Trump pushed both officials out of the administration.

Neither Homeland Security nor the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have commented on the report. Miller, through a White House spokesman, declined comment to The Post.

Nielsen left her position after only 16 months on the job. The Associated Press, citing two sources, reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the southwestern border.

Baker, who admitted last week the inspector general makes him ""nervous,"" said the government watchdog will probably find some errors.

""The inspector general is looking at everything we did,"" Baker said on CNN. ""If the IG usually finds mistakes that we made, so I expect him to find mistakes this time.""

Baker said last week at an event in Washington, D.C., that he took a leading role in overseeing the FISA warrant applications to obtain the authority to spy on Page. Baker said on Monday he does not believe there was any intent from the people he worked with to do ""anything wrong or illegal,"" including politically motivated spying.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

Attorney General William Barr has said he expects Horowitz to complete his investigation in late May or June. A particular issue in the investigation is the FBI's reliance on an unverified dossier in the FISA warrant application process."
The Energy 202: EPA finally added West Virginia site plagued by chemical dumping to priority cleanup list,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy', 'May At Am']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/14/the-energy-202-epa-finally-added-west-virginia-site-plagued-by-chemical-dumping-to-priority-cleanup-list/5cd9c09c1ad2e544f001dcfa/,"THE LIGHTBULB

A local company that once helped the West Virginia town of Minden thrive had for for decades dumped untold amounts of industrial chemicals nearby. Years after that coal-equipment manufacturer shuttered and the rest of the local coal economy fell into decline, those toxic chemicals remained.

Now the federal government is saying it will make cleaning up Minden a priority. On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency finally added a site in the tiny town of 250 people to its national priority list for contaminated Superfund sites. The government says it prioritize cleaning up a former manufacturing site for Shaffer Equipment Co. and nearby areas around Arbuckle Creek, where the company used polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, which had been added to oil used by electrical equipment until 1984.

For years, Minden residents said they were being overlooked by federal authorities, even as many of them were diagnosed with an alarming number of cancers and other health issues. Local activists told The Post's Brady Dennis for a profile he wrote of the community they found about a third of Minden residents have died of or been diagnosed with cancer in recent years.

They suspected the cause was PCBs. Yet testing by state and federal officials was not able to definitively establish that link. Still, residents pressed their case with the Trump administration, which proposed last September to add the Minden site to the Superfund list.

West Virginia politicians praised the move on Monday, which open remediation of the site up to an injection of new federal funding through the Superfund program. “This is such an important day because the great people of Minden have been hurting for too long and they’ve been waiting on this level of help for decades,” Gov. Jim Justice (R) said.

So too did local leaders, such as Ayne Amjad, a doctor who helped research the health problems and spent years trying to raise the profile of the town. “So to get so much national support and to see it come to this is such a great feeling,” she said Monday, adding that activists will turn now to relocation efforts for Minden residents living near the toxic site.

In a sign of how intractable some pollutants are, though, the EPA has already undertaken several rounds of cleanups in Minden since 1984, removing dozens of PCB-laced drums buried underground and hauling away nearly 5,000 tons of soil.

The listing is a small part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to revitalize the nearly 40-year-old Superfund program, designed to clean up more than 1,300 hazardous sites across the country. Compelling companies to pay up for cleanup efforts has proved to be one of the few issues on which the EPA has been willing to side with environmental groups during the Trump administration.

LIVE from Howard University in Washington DC the last #Road2GND tour stop.comment ""debate"" on this livestream to get involved via facebook messenger. Posted by Sunrise Movement on Monday, May 13, 2019

— A Green New Deal rally in Washington: Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) headlined a rally Monday at Howard University, continuing to call for a Green New Deal after a recent legislative defeat in the Senate. The event, organized by youth climate activist group Sunrise Movement, was the last stop on the group’s “Road to the Green New Deal tour,” which aimed to tout the proposal, even after it failed in a March vote in the Senate.

Next steps: The Sunrise Movement laid out its plans for the next several months, which include giving 2020 candidates until the end of July to sign a no-fossil-fuel-money pledge and to promise to make the Green New Deal a ""Day 1"" priority in the White House.

No ""middle ground"": Audience members booed several times at mentions of finding a ""middle ground"" on climate change, a reference to a recent Reuters article that describes former vice president Joe Biden's yet-to-be-released position on climate change.

Meanwhile in New Hampshire: Biden tried to hammer home to Democratic voters in the early-primary state that he is serious about climate change. “I said, we have an existential threat, we are in a situation where, if we don’t act quickly, we’re going to basically lose almost everything we have,"" he said, according to The New York Times.

President Trump wrote on Twitter last week that he opposed a House bill that would help a Massachusetts Indian tribe build a casino. (Evan Vucci/AP)

— Why did the president tweet about an obscure House bill? Last week, Trump tweeted to express opposition to House Resolution 312, which would grant a Massachusetts Indian tribe control of 321 acres of land for a casino. He wrote on Twitter it was “unfair and doesn’t treat Native Americans equally!” But the tribe’s site is about 18 miles from Rhode Island, where state politicians ""aren’t keen to have a new competitor go up against their two casinos, both of which are run by Twin River Worldwide Holdings, a public company with strong Trump ties,"" The Post’s Marc Fisher reports.

Flashback to 1993: The president has a long history of criticizing casinos built Native Americans as fraudulent. More than two decades ago, Trump the casino owner urged a House committee to assess whether tribe members operating the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut were really Native Americans. “They don’t look like Indians to me,” Trump said back then.

— The latest on the impasse over disaster funding: The Senate is looking to vote on a much-anticipated but not-yet-finalized disaster-aid package next week, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) hoped to approve a deal ahead of the Memorial Day recess, Politico reports.

McConnell called on lawmakers in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle to “identify our common ground and produce an outcome for the American people” on the measure meant to provide aid for communities recovering from natural disasters. “Next week is the week before a big break,” said Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) “I can’t predict what will happen, but I think something is either going to hit the floor dealing with that, or maybe we’ll all come to an agreement.”

Meanwhile: McConnell is looking to use the sweeping disaster aid bill to add protections for hemp farmers, according to a draft provision reviewed by The Post. “Now, with a $17 billion disaster bill stalled on Capitol Hill amid a series of political skirmishes, McConnell is trying to add language to the legislation to ensure hemp will be eligible for federal crop insurance,” The Post’s Erica Werner reports. “It was not immediately clear what impact McConnell’s hemp language might have on larger negotiations over the bill, which have been hung up for months in a fight between congressional Democrats and President Trump over aid to Puerto Rico.”

— “Watergate this was not”: When he looked to get in touch with the state’s ornithologist regarding a story about birds, the Boston Globe’s David Abel writes he wasn’t granted access to Andrew Vitz, who works for the state’s Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Instead, he was sent a bulleted list of background responses, only one of which answered a question he had asked.

Abel described a back-and-forth between himself and a press secretary at the state Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who he said he doesn't blame for the stone-walling. “It’s the policy from her bosses that’s the problem. They have made it clear that they won’t allow me, or many of my colleagues, to speak directly with the experts in government who can often best answer our questions — even when it’s a story about birds,"" he writes of a problem that has become ""not unusual"" since Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) was elected.

— Here’s what you can do now to save species: Save water, buy fewer products encased in plastic, revamp your front lawn.

These are a few things experts say Americans can do each day as a first step to helping save the plant and animal species facing extinction, according to The Post’s Darryl Fears. For example, grass yards, which use up 9 billion gallons of water per day, are the largest irrigated crop in the country. Collin O’Mara, president and chief executive of the National Wildlife Foundation, called lawns “basically biodiversity wastelands” and recommends making space for “milkweed and flowers can support numerous species of butterflies and moths. A single ginkgo tree will support numerous species of caterpillars,” Fears writes.

— “We don’t know a planet like this”: There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than at any point since the evolution of humans, according to data from the Muana Loa Observatory in Hawaii. The concentration of CO2 levels in the atmosphere has surpassed 415 parts per million, according to a Friday reading. “CO2 levels millions of years ago were higher than 2019 levels, but Earth's temperatures were also much higher,” USA Today reports. “In the 800,000 years before the Industrial Revolution, CO2 levels didn't surpass 300 ppm.”

The reaction from meteorologist Eric Holthaus:

This is the first time in human history our planet's atmosphere has had more than 415ppm CO2.



Not just in recorded history, not just since the invention of agriculture 10,000 years ago. Since before modern humans existed millions of years ago.

Pompeo shares details on 'escalating' Iran threats in Brussels: U.S. State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-pompeo/pompeo-shared-details-on-iran-threats-with-nato-state-department-idUSKCN1SJ1XN,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shared information on “escalating” threats from Iran with European allies and NATO officials during meetings in Brussels on Monday, the U.S. special representative for Iran said.

“Iran is an escalating threat and this seemed like a timely visit on his way to Sochi,” Brian Hook told reporters, referring to Pompeo’s planned visit to Russia on Tuesday for meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Pompeo canceled a visit to Moscow on Monday and stopped in Brussels instead, en route to Sochi.

“The secretary wanted to share some details behind what we have been saying publicly,” Hook said. “We believe that Iran should try talks instead of threats. They have chosen poorly by focusing on threats.”

Hook said Pompeo, while in Brussels, also discussed reported attacks on several oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

Asked if Pompeo was blaming Iran for the attacks, Hook said: “We discussed ... what seemed to be attacks on commercial vessels that were anchored off Fujairah ... we have been requested by the UAE to provide assistance in the investigation, which we are very glad to do.”

Asked if he himself believed there was the possibility of an Iranian role, Hook had no comment.

The UAE said on Sunday that four commercial vessels were sabotaged near Fujairah emirate, one of the world’s largest bunkering hubs lying just outside the Strait of Hormuz. It did not describe the nature of the attack or say who was behind it.

Saudi Arabia said Monday that two of its oil tankers were among those attacked and described it as an attempt to undermine the security of crude supplies amid tensions between the United States and Iran.

The UAE on Monday identified the vessels as very large crude carrier (VLCC) tanker Amjad and crude tanker Al Marzoqah, both owned by Saudi shipping firm Bahri. The other two were UAE-flagged fuel bunker barge A. Michel and Norwegian-registered oil products tanker MT Andrew Victory."
Donald Trump warns Iran over Saudi Arabia tanker attack,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Guy Taylor']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/13/trump-warns-iran-over-saudi-arabia-tanker-attack/,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an unexpected detour Monday to Brussels to try to sway European leaders skeptical of the administration’s growing brinkmanship with Iran — just as reports emerged that U.S. allies in the Middle East had four of their oil tankers sabotaged in attacks likely to be pinned on Tehran.

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates said three commercial vessels under their flags and one from Norway were attacked near the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping and oil export channel off the Iranian coast, although officials were careful not to blame Tehran explicitly while investigations are underway.

President Trump seized the incidents to warn Iranian leaders that “they will suffer greatly” if they engage in such attacks, although other administration officials, including U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook, cautioned against jumping to conclusions.

Monday’s events — and Mr. Pompeo’s planned trip to Russia on Tuesday to confer with President Vladimir Putin — did little to ease mounting fears that Washington and Tehran are heading for a showdown, with both sides bracing for a potential military escalation.

Mr. Trump fanned the flames with a warning that Iran would pay a heavy price if it played a role in tanker sabotage.

“If they do anything, it will be a very bad mistake,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House while meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. “If they do anything, they will suffer greatly.”

Regional analysts said the attacks may have been driven by Iranian desires to disrupt Saudi, Emirati and other oil exports that U.S. officials hope will fill a gap in world supplies as the Trump administration expands its global embargo on Iranian crude. Iranian leaders face growing pressure at home as U.S. sanctions drive down the domestic economy.

With uncertainty over the sabotage, Mr. Pompeo made last-minute travel changes for the second time in as many weeks. He scrapped a planned trip to Moscow to make the case with EU leaders for a harder line against Iran.

The secretary made a similarly unscheduled visit to Iraq after the administration’s sudden deployment of an American aircraft carrier and bomber task force to the Middle East last week, in concert with the one-year anniversary of Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that the EU, Russia and China continue to support.

Tipping point

Mr. Pompeo visited Baghdad as frustration was reaching a tipping point in Tehran, where President Hassan Rouhani threatened that Iran would abandon the 2015 nuclear deal and begin enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels if the economic pressure campaign — including a shut-off of oil imports — is not eased.

A senior commander from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps over the weekend said Tehran now sees the U.S. military presence in the region as not just as a threat, but also as a potential target for Iran or its Middle East allies.

Administration officials said Mr. Pompeo saw a need to gather quickly in Brussels with European leaders. Britain, France, Germany and the European Union — as well as Russia and China, which also were signatories to the deal — have been trying to keep it alive in defiance of U.S. moves.

Mr. Hook, who accompanied Mr. Pompeo to Brussels, put the onus for the tensions on Tehran, not Washington.

“Iran is an escalating threat, and this seemed like a timely visit on his way to Sochi,” said Mr. Hook, noting that Mr. Pompeo still intended to visit the Black Sea resort city for a day of talks with Mr. Putin on Tuesday.

The purpose of the Brussels visit was for the secretary to share intelligence and discuss with the Europeans “the multiple plot vectors emerging from Iran,” Mr. Hook said. “We believe that Iran should try talks instead of threats,” he said.

Mr. Pompeo had “very good discussions” with EU foreign ministers, Mr. Hook said.

There were, however, indications of pushback from some, including EU Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini, who told reporters she had called on Mr. Pompeo to avoid an unnecessary war.

“It’s always better to talk rather than not to, and especially when tensions arise,” Ms. Mogherini said. “Mike Pompeo heard that very clearly today from us.”

She suggested that Mr. Pompeo’s briefing changed few minds on the wisdom of the nuclear deal.

“We still invite Iran to comply with all its nuclear commitments, and we will do our part on our side to continue to fully implement [it],” Ms. Mogherini said.

British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he and others in Europe “are very worried about the risk of a conflict happening by accident, with an escalation that is unintended really on either side but ends with some kind of conflict.”

“What we need is a period of calm,” Mr. Hunt said.

Rising unease

Mr. Hunt’s calls coincided with rising unease, as well as confusion, over the apparent sabotage of the oil tankers. Images of the damaged ships showed one with a steel-piercing rip along its side above and below the water line.

Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow with the Washington-based Middle East Institute, said it was “too early to determine who sabotaged four commercial vessels” but that “suspicion will invariably fall on Iran given the rise in tensions between Tehran and its Arab neighbors.”

U.S. officials said privately that initial investigations pointed to an Iranian role, several news organizations reported, while the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman warned against a “conspiracy orchestrated by ill-wishers” trying to provoke a military conflict in the region.

With the U.S. oil and other sanctions biting harder in recent days, Mr. Vatanka suggested that Iran may have backed an attack on the Saudi, UAE and Norwegian tankers to send a message.

“In an environment of rising regional tensions, limited Iranian operations against the UAE and Saudi Arabia might be designed to dissuade Abu Dhabi and Riyadh and signal that war with Iran will not be limited to Iranian soil,” he said in comments circulated to reporters.

Mr. Hook, meanwhile, said Mr. Pompeo discussed the reported tanker sabotage with European leaders but declined to indicate whether the administration believes Iran was the culprit. “Don’t have any comment,” he said when pressed on the matter.

“Our goal continues to be for Iran to behave like a normal nation and not a revolutionary cause,” Mr. Hook told reporters traveling with Mr. Pompeo. “They have been exporting violent revolution around the Middle East for 40 years. We have put in place an entirely new foreign policy with respect to the Iranian regime. Iran’s era of deniable attacks is over. Tehran will be held accountable for the attacks of its proxies.”

"Trump administration breaks campaign promise, purges 200,000 VA healthcare applications",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/trump-administration-breaks-campaign-promise-purges-200-000-va-healthcare-applications,"""The current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs is absolutely unacceptable,” presidential candidate Donald Trump said when speaking at a rally on Oct. 31, 2015, in front of the retired battleship USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Va.

""Over 300,000 — and this is hard to believe, and it’s actually much more than that now — over 300,000 veterans died waiting for care,"" said Trump.

Trump’s strong condemnation of the Obama administration’s handling of the backlog of hundreds of thousands of veteran benefits claims made him the overwhelming choice for many veteran voters in 2016.

But after two years in the White House, the Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.

In purging this massive backlog of applications, the VA is declaring the applications to be incomplete due to errors by the applicants, despite the OIG findings and in violation of the promise Trump made to fix the system. This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits.

Under the supervision of Dr. Richard Stone, the executive in charge of the Veterans Health Administration, VHA managers last November instructed the agency’s IT staff members to purge over 200,000 pending healthcare applications.

Such a profound decision to deny veterans benefits should have to come from someone higher up — the president or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs — not from a career bureaucrat who has not been elected or confirmed by the Senate.

This purge flies in the face of previous guidance provided by lawmakers. On March 3, 2017, Senate and House Veterans Affairs committee members sent a joint letter to the VA, instructing the agency to delay its plans to purge these records. The committees wanted the VA to send new letters to veterans, informing them of their application status and potential equitable relief or financial reimbursement for service-connected health expenses caused by enrollment system errors, as prescribed by law.

Currently, VA is skirting this provision of the law by blaming veteran applicants for the agency’s own mistakes processing health and disability claims. As a result, to win benefits wrongfully denied due to VA’s administrative errors, veterans are forced to go to court and pay legal fees out of whatever benefits they ultimately win.

The Trump administration’s decision opens the door to the agency purging any future backlog of veteran claims for benefits by falsely declaring the applications incomplete due to veteran error.

This is the second time the VA has been caught using its IT department to adjudicate benefits for veterans. In January 2017, the IT department auto-enrolled over 70,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans whose applications had erroneously been held up until they could meet a “means test” — that is, prove their income level. This mass-approval of applications was done in preparation for then-Under Secretary David Shulkin’s confirmation hearing.

They did this without bothering to fix the systemic error that required proof of income from combat veterans, who aren’t required to provide it. As a result, there are still more than 20,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans being denied healthcare benefits due to an erroneous means-test requirement.

Moreover, the means test error in the enrollment system not only affects veteran access to healthcare benefits, but it also causes billing errors for thousands of veterans each year.

The Veterans Health Administration’s Member Services office, which manages the enrollment system, had to reexamine over 6,000 veteran income verification cases, because veterans were overbilled for medical copays ranging from $200 to $3,000. About 1,000 veterans are believed to receive fraudulent bills from the VA every month due to this known system error.

Despite being aware of these systemic issues for years, VA has not initiated an outreach campaign to educate the veteran community about what to do if their application is in a pending status or if they get a fraudulent bill due to missing means-test information.

Instead, the agency has chosen a policy of sending a single notification letter for pending applications, despite knowing that 25% of the letters mailed to veterans are returned or placed on hold due to bad address information in the enrollment system.

Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans routinely have incorrect address information in the enrollment system because they do not have permanent non-military addresses at the time of enrollment during the demobilization process.

The VA could resolve this problem through its data-sharing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration, to get current addresses for veterans in the pending backlog. But unfortunately for veterans, it is the VA’s practice to use information from the IRS and SSA only for the purposes of billing and verifying veterans’ dates of death.

All of these issues could be easily fixed. This is why President Trump’s reversal on this issue is so disappointing to the veteran community. Many veterans are asking why the enrollment system was not included in the President’s VA information technology modernization plan.

As a result, 200,000 applications have been purged, violating Trump’s promise. Currently, over 300,000 additional veteran healthcare applications remain in a pending status and will most likely be purged in the near future.

In the absence of executive leadership from the White House, veterans will continue to be denied access to their healthcare benefits at a rate of nearly 5,000 new pending healthcare applications per month.

Barr assigns US attorney in Connecticut to look into government surveillance involving Trump campaign: source,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-us-attorney-connecticut-surveillance-trump-campaign,"Attorney General William Barr has appointed a U.S. attorney to examine the origins of the Russia investigation and determine if intelligence collection efforts targeting the Trump campaign were ""lawful and appropriate,"" a person familiar with the situation told Fox News on Monday evening.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, will conduct the inquiry, the source said. The move comes as the Trump administration has pushed for answers on why federal authorities conducted the surveillance -- as well as whether Democrats were the ones who improperly colluded with foreign actors.

Two sources told Fox News earlier today that Barr was “serious” and had assigned DOJ personnel to the probe. Durham is known as a ""hard-charging, bulldog"" prosecutor, Fox News is told.



Sources familiar with matter say the focus of the probe includes the pre-transition period -- prior to Nov. 7, 2016 -- including the use and initiation of informants, as well as potential Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses.

An informant working for U.S. intelligence posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 to try extracting any possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia from George Papadopoulos, then a Trump foreign policy adviser, it emerged earlier this month. Papadopoulos told Fox News the informant tried to ""seduce"" him as part of the ""bizarre"" episode.

Durham previously has investigated law enforcement corruption, the destruction of CIA videotapes and the Boston FBI office's relationship with mobsters. He is set to continue to serve as the chief federal prosecutor in Connecticut.

ROSENSTEIN BLASTS 'ANGRY' COMEY, SAYS HE'S BECOME A DISAPPOINTING PARTISAN HACK

In January, House Republican Reps. Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows wrote to Durham seeking a briefing, saying they had ""discovered"" that Durham's office was ""investigating [former FBI General Counsel James Baker"" for unauthorized disclosures to the media.""

Durham's new review would exist alongside the ongoing probe by DOJ Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, who is continuing to review potential surveillance abuses by the FBI -- an investigation that began last March and that Fox News is told is nearing completion.

Republicans also have been looking for answers from U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber, who was appointed a year ago by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review not only surveillance abuses by the FBI and DOJ, but also authorities' handling of the probe into the Clinton Foundation.

Huber, Republicans have cautioned, apparently has made little progress and has spoken to few key witnesses and whistleblowers. But, in January, then-Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker reportedly indicated at a private meeting that Huber's work was continuing apace.

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INTERNAL FBI TEXTS SHOW DOJ PUSHED BACK ON 'BIAS' IN KEY FBI FISA SOURCE

Durham's appointment comes about a month after Barr told members of Congress he believed ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign in 2016. He later said he didn't mean anything pejorative and was gathering a team to look into the origins of the special counsel's investigation.

Democrats have pummeled Barr in frustration following revelations in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russian actors, despite numerous offers by Russians to assist the campaign. Mueller's final report has led to a bitter D.C. battle over the limited number of redactions in the report, which the DOJ says are legally necessary because they pertain to grand jury matters.

In obtaining a secret FISA warrant to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page, the FBI copy-pasted directly from a disputed Washington Post opinion article to suggest the Trump campaign may have been compromised. The bureau also repeatedly assured the court that it ""did not believe"" British ex-spy Christopher Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion.

But, London court records showed that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS -- the opposition research firm behind the dossier. Fusion GPS was retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), a piece of information not stated in the FISA application.

The FISA application cribbed word-for-word from the Washington Post article that claimed the Trump campaign had ""worked behind the scenes"" to ""gut"" the GOP platform on Russia and Ukraine. The FBI apparently did not conduct its own independent assessment of the piece, which was labeled an ""opinion"" column by the Post, and Mueller's probe ultimately found no wrongdoing by the Trump team.

Additionally, internal FBI text messages exclusively obtained by Fox News earlier this year showed that a senior DOJ official raised concerns about the bias in a key FISA warrant, but that FBI officials pressed on.

""There's a document that's classified that I'm gonna try to get unclassified that takes the dossier -- all the pages of it -- and it has verification to one side,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" this weekend. ""There really is no verification, other than media reports that were generated by reporters that received the dossier.""

Graham specifically cited the report from The Hill's John Solomon that the FBI was expressly told that Steele, the bureau's confidenial informant, had admitted to a contact at the State Department that he was ""keen"" to leak his discredited dossier for purposes of influencing the 2016 election.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec’s written account of her Oct. 11, 2016, meeting with Steele was apparently sent to the FBI, according to records unearthed in a transparency lawsuit by Citizens United.

Senator Marco Rubio sent a letter Monday to Attorney General William Barr asking him to investigate whether former secretary of state John Kerry violated federal law by continuing to meet with Iranian officials after leaving office.

“The Department of Justice should therefore make a determination on whether or not former Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s recent actions related to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran potentially violate the Logan Act or the Foreign Agents Registration Act,” Rubio wrote.

The letter, Rubio’s second urging an investigation into Kerry’s conduct, comes after President Trump suggested that Kerry should be prosecuted under the Logan Act, a 1799 statute that prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments without the permission of U.S. officials.

“What I’d like to see with Iran, I’d like to see them call me,” Trump told reporters last week. “John Kerry speaks to them a lot, and John Kerry tells them not to call. That’s a violation of the Logan Act, and frankly he should be prosecuted on that.”

Kerry’s camp pushed back on Trump’s assertion in a statement provided to CNN.

“Everything President Trump said today is simply wrong, end of story,” a spokesperson for Kerry told CNN. “He’s wrong about the facts, wrong about the law, and sadly he’s been wrong about how to use diplomacy to keep America safe.”

Rubio sent his first letter on the subject to then-attorney general Jeff Sessions in September 2018, after the Boston Globe reported that Kerry was “quietly seeking to salvage the Iran deal he helped craft” by engaging “in some unusual shadow diplomacy” with Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif. Though he would not comment on what was discussed, Kerry did admit to meeting with Zarif “three or four” times since Trump took office. The Globe further reported that Kerry formed a team “of officials who were his top advisers at the State Department” to shape media coverage of Trump’s departure from the Iran deal."

A top U.S. arms control official and prominent Iran hawk has resigned from the State Department after serving just over a year in the position, said U.S. officials and congressional aides familiar with the decision.

The State Department on Monday did not offer a statement explaining the planned departure of Yleem Poblete, the assistant secretary of state for arms control, verification and compliance.

Her departure, which is expected to take effect in the coming weeks, creates a vacancy as the Trump administration faces major new threats and challenges specifically related to arms control.

Iran recently threatened to resume production of nuclear centrifuges in response to President Trump’s decision last year to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimpose economic sanctions. Trump has also ordered his top aides to make a new push for a historic trilateral arms control agreement involving Russia and China, something Beijing has long dismissed.

During her tenure, Poblete clashed with her boss, Undersecretary of State Andrea Thompson, Vice President Pence’s former national security adviser, said the officials and aides familiar with the infighting.

In particular, disagreements surfaced over the State Department’s report on international compliance with arms control accords, the people said.

“The tension over the compliance report has been very real, and [Thompson’s office] is now demanding sign-off much earlier in the clearance process,” said one State Department official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel moves.

In April, Reuters reported that some U.S. officials were concerned that the compliance report politicized and slanted assessments about Iran, which the Trump administration has singled out as the country’s principal foe.

Poblete, whose views on arms control were more aligned with national security adviser John Bolton rather than Thompson’s, previously served as the chief of staff of the House Foreign Affairs Committee among other jobs.

As her confirmation process for the senior arms control job dragged on, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders excoriated Democrats and emphasized the importance of the position.

“It has been almost 150 days since Dr. Poblete was nominated,” Sanders said. “Senator Schumer is holding her up, putting the safety and security of the American people and, frankly, the entire world in danger.”

Poblete was a favorite among hard-line anti-Iran groups such as the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which hosted her for a speech in July 2018 in which Poblete praised the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran deal.

“The JCPOA was flawed at both the technical and political levels, and at the practical level,” she said in the speech, referring to the acronym for the 2015 deal.

Nonproliferation experts who supported the Iran deal viewed her departure with ambivalence.

“While the State Department can hardly afford to lose another senior leader, it is not clear that Assistant Secretary Poblete was contributing to the advancement of arms control in a helpful or substantive way,” said Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and nonproliferation and a former Obama administration official. “The recent debacle involving the sloppy and politically charged summary of the unclassified 2019 Compliance Report is an example of that.”

“The Trump administration should immediately move to appoint a qualified, seasoned expert to the position,” she added.

Liberal watchdog group sues Commerce Department over Census citizenship question,https://www.politico.com,"['Caitlin Oprysko', 'Ted Hesson', 'Anita Kumar']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/13/census-citizenship-question-lawsuit-1318698,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross testifies on the census during a House Oversight Committee hearing on March 14. | Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo Legal Liberal watchdog group sues Commerce Department over Census citizenship question

A liberal watchdog group said Monday it plans to sue the Commerce Department to obtain records relating to Secretary Wilbur Ross’ “lies” about his decision to add a citizenship question to next year’s Census questionnaire.

Restore Public Trust said in a complaint filed Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it has filed several requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act that call into question Ross' justification for adding the citizenship question to the Census, and the group is demanding the release of those documents.

Story Continued Below

The question, which the Trump administration plans to include for the first time since 1950, is at the center of a legal battle that last month reached the Supreme Court. Civil rights groups and several local and state governments have sued the administration to have the question struck from next year’s survey, which is used to apportion congressional seats, Electoral College votes and billions in federal funding.

Restore Public Trust is suing for the release of a tranche of documents that the group says will show Ross was misleading in congressional testimony over how the question came to be added to the Census. Ross has said he added the question “solely” at the request of the Justice Department, which said in a memo that the question would help it better enforce parts of the Voting Rights Act.

But emails turned over as part of the lawsuits have showed that Ross was in contact with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach about the question, and he had asked the Justice Department to request the question. The Commerce Department has defended Ross' testimony, arguing that the new communications only supplement the record.

The Commerce Department declined to comment Monday, citing pending litigation.

Researchers at the Census Bureau have said adding the question could result in depressed response rates among the Hispanic residents, a demographic that already sees lower rates of response to the decennial survey. Critics of the question have argued that the question is aimed at diluting the political power of Democratic-leaning areas home to Hispanic communities. Separately, Commerce has been accused of violating administrative procedure and adding the question without proper vetting of its potential effect on Census responses.

The lawsuit filed Monday cites three FOIA requests submitted by the group last December and on April 12 seeking communications regarding the Census, including emails sent or received by Ross and some of his top current and former aides, as well as Kobach and Census Bureau and DOJ officials, relating to the Census.

According to the group, they have received no communication from the Commerce Department concerning their requests, even though FOIA requires agencies to respond within 20 days or provide notice that their response will be delayed. The document requests are likely to overlap with those the House Oversight Committee voted last month to subpoena from the Commerce Department.

“The American people have a right to know what Secretary Ross and the rest of Trump’s political appointees discussed behind closed doors as they devised a scheme to make the census less representative for all Americans,” said Kyle Herrig, senior adviser to Restore Public Trust. “Even more disturbing than Secretary Ross’s attempts to avoid public scrutiny is his apparent lies to Congress and evasion of Congressional oversight.”

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case last month and appears poised to side with Ross, overturning the ruling of lower courts and letting the citizenship question stand. DOJ has said in court filings that the Census Bureau must finalize printed questionnaires by the end of next month to meet production deadlines.

Amid the legal drama over the citizenship question last month, Ross also caught flak for rejecting two invitations from House and Senate appropriators to testify before their committees about his agency's budget request for the upcoming fiscal year, saying his appearance would be a distraction and offering to send other officials from the department.

"President Trump Meets Viktor Orbán, His Authoritarian Model",http://nymag.com,['Jonathan Chait'],05-13-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/president-trump-meets-viktor-orban-authoritarian-model.html,"Hungarian president Viktor Orbán with Donald Trump in the White House, May 13, 2019. Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images

Imagine if President Bernie Sanders invited the left-wing Nicolás Maduro to the White House after previous administrations had shunned the Venezuelan strongman. Imagine Sanders then praised Maduro, not only as an ally to the United States but as a wise ruler, and compared Maduro to himself. Then you might begin to understand the chilling message delivered by President Trump through his friendly meeting with Hungarian president Viktor Orbán.

The darkest nightmare haunting liberals since Trump’s rise has been the specter of authoritarianism. The most plausible fear is not a sudden, fascistic crackdown but a gradual upward ratchet of the governing party’s hold on the political system — what political scientists call “democratic backsliding.” And when they cast about the globe for a model of democratic backsliding, the one that always seemed most frighteningly plausible was Hungary.

Hungary possessed the most salient traits of a future Trumpian dystopia. It was a well-functioning democracy hijacked by a right-wing party that gained power by seizing on ethnonationalist resentment and slowly strangling its opposition. The tools Orbán has used to build what he half-euphemistically calls “illiberal democracy” bear a certain eerie familiarity: an electoral system that gives Orbán’s rural base disproportionate clout, his intimidation of independent media and construction of a state news propaganda machine, and the relentless sowing of xenophobic fear.

American presidents have frequently made pragmatic alliances with foreign despots. But Trump has actually praised dictators for their brutality, a habit reflected in his comments going back decades and spanning such regimes as communist China, Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, North Korea, and Russia.

Trump’s ambassador to Hungary recently told Franklin Foer, “I can tell you, knowing the president for a good 25 or 30 years, that he would love to have the situation that Viktor Orbán has, but he doesn’t.”

If Trump had not numbed our sensibilities, his comments about Orbán would be shocking. He praised Orbán as a “tough man, but he is a respected man” — toughness being Trump’s way of praising the contempt for democratic niceties. And Trump endorsed not only Orbán’s foreign policy but his autocratic governing style. “Orbán has done a tremendous job in so many different ways, highly respected, respected all over Europe,” said Trump, adding that his counterpart was “probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that’s okay. You’ve done a good job, and you’ve kept your country safe.”

Orbán’s naked sectarianism forms one of the underpinnings of his political style. He has demonized Muslim immigrants, rehabilitated his country’s anti-Semitic ancien régime, and turned George Soros, an obsessive hate figure among white supremacists, into a public fixation. In all these ways he has prefigured Trump’s own style.

Rather than put any distance between himself and Orbán, Trump singled out his sectarianism for special praise. “You have been great with respect to Christian communities,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “You have really put a bloc up, and we respect that very much.” There’s nothing wrong with helping Christians, of course, but Orbán’s political relationship with Christianity is pointedly directed against non-Christians.

The American foreign-policy apparatus has not been fully assimilated into Trump’s authoritarian worldview, and many of its members have either strained against the president’s impulses or deluded themselves about their nature. In the run-up to the meeting, news accounts emphasized that Trump would not necessarily reward Orbán with a fulsome endorsement. “White House advisers are cautioning Trump against a full embrace of Orbán, despite the president’s own affinity for the leader,” reported Politico. “Rather than a reward or an affirmation, the meeting can instead be framed as a carrot — an attempt to persuade Mr. Orbán to buy American weapons and give greater priority to American foreign-policy interests,” said the New York Times.

That Trump instead treated Orbán as an ideological comrade is deeply revealing. It is not a calculated foreign-policy maneuver but an expression of Trump’s worldview and still-forming domestic ambitions.

That Trump admires Orbán’s methods and would like to replicate them is not to say he will succeed. He is, among other things, far less knowledgeable and disciplined than his Hungarian counterpart. But there can hardly be any more question that what Orbán has done to his country, Trump aims to do to ours."
VA Sec. Wilkie: A breakthrough in health care for veterans is coming in June -- Here's what to expect,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Robert Wilkie', 'Robert Wilkie Is The Secretary Of The U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sec-robert-wilkie-bringing-bipartisan-reform-to-veterans,"Imagine if Republicans and Democrats worked together to pass reforms that improve the lives of millions of people.

And imagine if those reforms put America’s veterans at the center of their health care decisions, leading to better customer service for our nation’s heroes.

This isn’t hypothetical. It happened last year when Congress passed the MISSION Act.

TRUMP REPORTEDLY TAKING BROAD LOOK AT VETERANS CONVICTED OF BATTLEFIELD CRIMES

The law gives the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the ability to provide veterans with the best health care possible, whether at VA health care facilities or with community providers.

The legislation sailed through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and the strong backing of veterans service organizations.

President Donald J. Trump’s signature put us on a path to implementing these reforms. On June 6, the MISSION Act will enable VA to consolidate the department’s community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that will empower veterans with the ability to choose the health care providers they trust.

So what can veterans expect on June 6?

Less red tape, more satisfaction and predictability for patients, more efficiency for our clinicians, and better value for taxpayers.

Veterans will be eligible to get community care for a variety of reasons, including when VA can’t provide the treatment they need or when care outside our system is in the best medical interest of the patient.

We listened to veterans and heard they preferred standards based on drive times rather than driving mileage because those standards better reflect veteran experiences, especially in large urban areas with lots of traffic.

To ensure our veterans are spending their time getting care instead of driving to it, patients facing an average drive time of 30-minutes or more for VA primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider closer to home. For specialty care, the drive-time standard will be an average of 60 minutes.

And to get veterans the care they need when they need it, VA patients facing a 20-day or more wait time for primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider who can deliver that care faster. For specialty care, the wait-time standard will be 28 days.

For additional convenience and timely treatment, eligible veterans will also have access to urgent, walk-in care that gives them the choice to receive certain services at participating community clinics in their communities. (To access this new benefit, veterans will select a provider in VA’s community care network and may be charged a copayment.)

Veterans will be encouraged to ask VA about these new options, and well-trained staff will be available to help them quickly understand their choices.

These exciting and important changes speak to my top priority – delivering the best medical customer service and offering veterans more health care choices.

With the MISSION Act, the future of the VA health care system will lie in the hands of veterans – precisely where it should be.

While we still have more work to do, the VA is making progress.

We are seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than ever before and studies show VA now compares favorably to the private sector for access and quality of care – and in many cases exceeds it.

And veterans have noticed.

Patients’ trust in VA care has skyrocketed to 87.7 percent, and in the last fiscal year, VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments – a record high and 623,000 more than the year before.

VA employees are noticing improvements as well. VA ranked sixth out of 17 Federal Government agencies in the Partnership for Public Service’s most recent “Best Places to Work” survey, up from 17th the year prior.

To maintain the trust of our veterans, we must continue to deliver. And we will constantly innovate, upgrade, and pursue ways to better serve our Nation’s heroes.

The MISSION Act is a vital part of this effort, giving VA the ability to implement the best practices we’ve learned in our nearly 75 years of experience offering community care.

The core of the doctor-patient relationship is trust. President Trump promised veterans that this core value would shape the VA.

"Inslee, Ferguson denounce EPA move to ease water-quality standards for Washington state",https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/inslee-ferguson-denounce-epa-move-to-ease-water-standards-for-washington-state/,"The Environmental Protection Agency proposes to ease Washington water-quality standards for chemicals discharged into state waterways, a move embraced by industry groups that sought the change and denounced as “illegal” by Gov. Jay Inslee and state Attorney General Bob Ferguson.

The action, disclosed Friday, reverses a 2016 decision by the EPA under the Obama administration that required the state to toughen the water-quality standard.

Chris Hladick, the EPA’s Seattle-based regional administrator, said his agency had “inherent authority” to reconsider the 2016 decision, according to a letter Hladick sent Friday to Maia Bellon, the director of the state Ecology Department.

Ferguson and Inslee, in a joint statement, said “by taking this unilateral action, the EPA will risk almost certain litigation and cause uncertainty for Washington businesses.”

A major point of contention is the water-quality standard for PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), a group of chemicals considered to be probable carcinogens. PCBs can be found in dyes, paint, building materials, coolants and other products. In trace amounts, they often are present in industry wastewater discharges as well as municipal utility plants that treat stormwater runoff. Once in Puget Sound and freshwater drainage, they accumulate in fish and shellfish, so ingesting this food in large volumes can increase cancer risks.

In Washington, the PCBs water standard has been subject of years of intense scrutiny.

Tribal leaders pressed for tighter pollution limits to protect their members, who may eat far more fish and shellfish than other Washington residents. And, they were dismayed by the Trump administration’s EPA decision, which they said was done without the consultation required by the federal government’s treaties and trust responsibilities to tribes.

“This action is outrageous,” said Lorraine Loomis, chair of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission. “Like all federal agencies, the EPA has a legally binding trust responsibility to the tribes that requires government-to-government consultation and the protection of tribal treaty rights and resources. They are not living up to this responsibility that is rooted in the U.S. Constitution.”

Paper and pulp manufacturers and other industry groups applauded the Trump administration decision.

They had opposed the Obama administration standard, saying that there was no technology available to bring wastewater discharges levels of PCBs to the low levels that were required. In a written statement, Donna Harmon, president of the American Forest & Paper Association, said, “The earlier EPA rule represented costly and ineffective regulatory overreach — plain and simple.”

The clash over PCB standards has unfolded under the umbrella of the federal Clean Water Act, which creates a partnership between the state and federal government to protect and when necessary restore the nation’s waterways.

Under the act, states have authority to develop water-quality standards, and the EPA the power of review.

Advertising

During the Obama administration, the EPA partially disapproved of a state standard — developed by the Washington Department of Ecology while Inslee was governor. The EPA ruled the state standard for PCBs — 170 parts per quadrillion in wastewater discharges — did not go far enough in protecting the health of heavy consumers of Washington fish. Instead, the EPA sent a standard of 7 parts per quadrillion.

In February 2017, after the Trump administration took office, industry and water utility groups filed a petition to the EPA arguing that the action under the Obama administration unjustly overturned the state standard and that it should be pulled back.

Meanwhile, state officials accepted the EPA decision and went to work with stakeholders, including tribes and industry representatives, to find ways to implement new standards.

Colleen Keltz, an Ecology Department spokeswoman, acknowledged that the 7 parts per quadrillion standard may not be obtainable with current technology. But she said that the state is working under a new system that allows permitted discharges to have a variance that allows higher levels of discharges until technology is available to meet the standard.

But the EPA, under the Trump administration, rejected the need to try to reach the lower standard. In a 32-page document released Friday, the EPA said the earlier state PCBs standard of 170 parts per quadrillion should be restored, rejecting the Obama administration’s objection as “based on sound science.”

Hladick’s criticisms of the 2016 EPA PCBs decision were rejected by Dennis McLerran, who served as regional administrator for the EPA under President Barack Obama. McLerran acknowledged that some standards are “aspirational” but said the earlier EPA action was based on the best science available and that the rule allowed for flexibility when dischargers could not meet the standard.

McLerran said it was “very unusual and inappropriate” to pull it back without first consulting with tribes and state officials.

“I think it is a very unfortunate thing. The state had made it clear that it was implementing the standards, and found them to be correct,” McLerran said."

DOJ tries to disqualify ex-Obama official from defending China’s Huawei,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Bebeto Matthews'],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-tries-to-disqualify-ex-obama-official-from-defending-chinas-huawei,"The Justice Department is working to disqualify top Obama department official James Cole from defending the Chinese technology firm Huawei in a high-profile criminal case, according to a new heavily redacted federal court filing on Friday.

The Justice Department unsealed an indictment against Huawei in January 2019 which charged the company with bank fraud, conspiracy to defraud the U.S., conspiracy to commit money laundering, obstruction of justice, illegal actions related to dodging Iran sanctions, and more. Cole, who was deputy attorney general from 2011 to 2015, has been representing Huawei in this matter since 2017, but the Justice Department’s motion is an attempt to convince the court that Cole’s previous experiences investigating Huawei-related matters while at the department should disqualify him.

Cole held the second-highest position in the Obama Justice Department for five years, where he worked with Attorney General Eric Holder, oversaw the day-to-day operations of the department, and represented the department on the National Security Council. He brought those experiences to Sidley, one of the largest law firms in the country, where he is the global co-lead of their White Collar: Government Litigation and Investigations practice and where he has defended Huawei for the past couple years.

Justice Department attorneys told the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York that “Cole should be disqualified from representing Huawei Tech and Huawei USA in this case because of two different conflicts.” The details the department provided on the first conflict were heavily redacted. The agency said that “having represented the government in his role as DAG in the DOJ's [REDACTED] investigation [REDACTED], Cole should not now be allowed to represent the defendants in a [REDACTED] matter brought by the DOJ that is substantially related in multiple respects to that [REDACTED] investigation.” Therefore, the department said that “Cole should be disqualified because he was personally and substantially involved in a [REDACTED] investigation [REDACTED] that exposed him to relevant, privileged factual information [REDACTED] and strategic information about that investigation.”

The Justice Department did not specify those prior investigations.

The agency said the second conflict is that “Cole's representation of the defendants jeopardizes the government's interest in having a fair trial and obtaining a conviction that can sustain appeal and collateral attack.” Their claim was that, due to Cole’s past involvement in Justice Department investigations related to the Huawei case, he would not be able to provide Huawei with a proper defense and that “any representation by Cole would taint the trial process and any ultimate conviction.”

The Justice Department met with Cole related to his alleged conflict of interest multiple times in January and February 2019. Cole declined to recuse himself in March 2019, stating, “We have carefully considered the material you showed us and were unable to determine that I need to be disqualified based on that information.”

For its part, Huawei released a statement saying the Justice Department “has known since 2017 that Mr. Cole represented Huawei in this matter” and that its motion “makes a mockery of the adversarial process.” Huawei says that this is an attempt by the department “to strip Huawei of counsel of its choice … while concealing from Huawei and the public virtually all of the facts on which it bases its motion.”

The Justice Department has been increasing its scrutiny of China’s activities in recent years, launching a ""China Initiative"" in 2018 and charging an increased number of people in China-related espionage cases, cracking down on China-based hacking schemes, prosecuting Chinese efforts to steal trade secrets, and more. The department has turned its sights on Huawei’s alleged criminality: Aside from charging the company and its connected entities, the U.S. government is also seeking the extradition from Canada of Huawei’s Chief Financial Officer Wanzhou Meng, who the U.S. believes was involved in the criminal conspiracy.

The U.S. government widely suspects that the Chinese-based Huawei, a technology firm that is a global leader in telecommunications and in 5G, is working hand in hand with the Chinese government, giving China's surveillance state access to hardware and networks around the world. Discussing the U.S.’s intelligence-sharing relationships with the United Kingdom and other European allies who are considering the use of Huawei’s 5G technology, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently warned, “We don’t believe you can have those technologies in your systems and still have a trusted network. We’re happy to continue to look at technology and see ways we might achieve that, but the United States for its part will only participate in trusted networks. We will only share America’s information with those networks that we are confident aren’t under the control of China or China’s government.”

The Department of Defense’s annual report to Congress on China, released in May, stressed that China is a growing threat not just in terms of hard power military capabilities but also in terms of cyberattacks, espionage, and infiltration. The Defense Department pointed out that China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law “requires Chinese companies, such as Huawei and ZTE, to support, provide assistance, and cooperate in China’s national intelligence work, wherever they operate.”

Cole is not the only former high-ranking Obama official representing China-based Huawei’s interests. Samir Jain, who was the senior director for cybersecurity policy for the National Security Council during the Obama administration, registered as a lobbyist for Huawei earlier this year.

“There may be exposure risks that can’t necessarily wait for an overall plan to address the entire site,” said Jeff Kimble, a Region 5 EPA on-scene coordinator who is supervising Wolverine’s former tannery and dump site investigations in Kent County.

By the end of May, the EPA says Wolverine must begin placing signs and kiosks near river access points which note potential hazards nearby and the proper hygiene for dealing with them.

The EPA wants the site work to happen this summer. Wolverine said it is “reviewing” the letter and “looks forward to continuing its work with the agency to develop next steps.""

The EPA began supervising an investigation into contamination at the tannery and Wolverine’s House Street sludge dump in Belmont last year. The tannery, which was razed in 2009, drew federal scrutiny after the discovery of per-fluorinated compounds called PFAS at the former factory grounds and Wolverine’s nearby waste dumps.

In Belmont, the EPA wants interior fencing around the “entire contaminated portion” of the House Street dump and further testing of wetlands to the west. The 76-acre site where Wolverine dumped 3M Scotchgard waste in the 1960s has spawned a PFAS plume moving southeast through an area where thousands of people rely on groundwater for drinking.

An investigation report for House Street similar to that which sparked cleanup work in Rockford is pending final EPA final approval, Kimble said.

DEQ ignored crucial warning on Wolverine dump plume FOIA emails illuminate early House Street PFAS investigation.

In Rockford, toxic substances like mercury, chromium and lead are confirmed at high levels in the groundwater and in sediment near spots where people regularly launch canoes and kayaks alongside a heavily-used White Pine Trail stretch.

Kimble ordered Wolverine to either dredge or de-water and excavate those areas. He said the company proposed placing gravel and matting over contamination, but “based on the data we have, I think it’s more prudent to remove some of those sediments and then place that mat-and-gravel material.”

Kimble said cleanup work may close parts of the trail this summer. Users will also find more information about potential health risks at canoe launches and river access points.

Existing handwashing stations and signs placed last year are inadequate, Kimble said. The signs face away from the trail and tell people to “wash hands” when exiting the river with no explanation.

A sign tells people to ""wash hands"" upon exiting the river at the White Pine Trail in Rockford on May 6, 2019 near the former Wolverine World Wide tannery site.

“It should be more than just ‘wash your hands,'"" Kimble said. “Kindergarteners are told to wash their hands. They probably need to know why.”

”The signs need to be informative and cautionary, but also not unduly alarm people.""

Thad Beard, Rockford city manager, said that, while enhanced signage isn’t necessarily a great image for the city, it’s an important part of public communication.

“The reality is that we’re dealing with an environmental cleanup here and it’s important that is known to the public,” Beard said.

As in years past, Beard said the city will use part of the tannery site for its Start of Summer festival, June 13-16. Beard said Rockford checked with EPA to ensure the site of a city parking lot under construction on the property’s south end “wasn’t an area of high concentration of anything.”

The EPA-ordered work is happening parallel to Wolverine’s plan to stem the flow of groundwater contaminated with PFAS into the river, where the so-called “forever chemicals” are causing surface water foam to gather at the Rockford dam.

Beard said concern about the river foam has spiked recently following the state health department warning to avoid touching it.

Wolverine installed pump-and-treat wells at the site this winter as part of a plan to filter groundwater through a granular activated carbon (GAC) system to remove PFAS before sending treated effluent to the North Kent Sewer Authority wastewater plant. The sewer board should decide whether it will accept Wolverine’s cleanup water this summer.

U.S. Energy Department says oil markets well supplied after attack on ships off UAE,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-oil-emirates-doe/us-energy-department-says-oil-markets-well-supplied-after-attack-on-ships-off-uae-idUSKCN1SJ1UF,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy Department said on Monday that global oil markets are well supplied despite the attack on Sunday that damaged four vessels off the UAE coast, two of them oil tankers from Saudi Arabia.

“The Department of Energy is aware of efforts to disrupt oil shipping as reported by the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,” said Shaylyn Hynes, DOE press secretary, about the attack near Fujairah emirate, one of the world’s largest bunkering hubs lying just outside the Strait of Hormuz.

The UAE did not describe the nature of the attack or say who was behind it.

“The Department is monitoring the oil markets, and is confident they remain well-supplied,” Hynes said after the attack which did not cause any casualties, or an oil spill, but resulted in significant damage to the ships."
"DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-found-carter-page-fisa-extensions-were-illegally-obtained-joe-digenova-says,"The Justice Department inspector general has determined the three Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained, attorney Joe diGenova said on Thursday.

In an investigation that began last year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into Trump's campaign.

The inspector general inquiry is expected to be completed in either late May or June, and diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Democrats on Capitol Hill are working overtime to investigate and discredit President Trump.

""They are doing that as a diversionary tactic away from the inevitable conclusions of the DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who, by the way, we have learned has concluded that the final three FISA extensions were illegally obtained,"" diGenova said on Fox Business. ""The only question now is whether or not the first FISA was illegally obtained.""

He pointed to memos, obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation, that suggest the FBI might have misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the first warrant application about an unverified dossier.

Horowitz ""apparently, as a result of those disclosures ... which he was unaware of — the bureau hid those memos from Horowitz — as a result of that they're doing additional work on the first FISA. It may be that all four FISAs will have been obtained illegally,"" diGenova said.

The dossier, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

The memos obtained by Citizens United, and shared with the Washington Examiner, show Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11 and admitted he was encouraged by a client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

Senate and House investigators told The Hill they too were unaware of the documents, which were given to and redacted by the FBI, and one member of Congress referred the memos to the Justice Department inspector general. ""They tried to hide a lot of documents from us during our investigation, and it usually turns out there’s a reason for it,"" House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

A memo from the House Intelligence Committee in February 2018 alleged Steele was paid over $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS to ""obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia."" The memo also said the FBI never informed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of the dossier's Democratic benefactors or Steele's anti-Trump bias when it applied to spy on Page, who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller over his interactions with Russians but was never charged.

In a rebuttal to the House Intelligence GOP memo, Democrats argued the Justice Department and FBI ""met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement.""

In recent days top former officials at the FBI have defended their handling of the warrant applications. Former FBI Director James Comey said during a CNN town hall on Thursday that “the most important part” of the dossier was on “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.” Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who acknowledged he ""wanted the burden on me to a significant degree"" in preparing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application paperwork, said it would have been ""gratuitous"" to name the U.S. persons — the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC — in the documents.

Both Comey and Baker said they are confident the bureau did nothing wrong in obtaining the warrants, although Baker admitted the inspector general makes him ""nervous.""

DiGenova appeared on Fox Business with his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing. She accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""hiding"" Comey's ""sins.""

DiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days.

He had been highly critical of Mueller's Russia investigation, claiming that Trump had been ""framed"" by the Justice Department and the FBI."

Updated at 7:56 p.m. ET

House Democrats issued subpoenas on Friday to force Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to release six years of President Trump's tax returns.

Democrats say the returns include information about Trump and his business dealings that is critical to their constitutional oversight duties. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., issued the subpoena after Mnuchin failed to comply with a request from House Democrats that he voluntarily turn over the returns.

""While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material. I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work,"" Neal said in a written statement.

Administration officials, including Mnuchin, insist the request is unreasonable and illegal. Democrats argue that Neal, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is legally allowed to request the tax returns of any private citizen — citing a section of the tax code that states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" that information.

But Mnuchin rejected the request this week, telling Neal that he was relying on Department of Justice advice that the request ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.""

Trump has refused to comply with requests for his taxes since before he was elected, arguing that he is under audit and he does not believe he is legally required to disclose the information. ""There is no law,"" Trump said in April. ""While I'm under audit I won't do it.""

The IRS's Rettig told the House Appropriations Committee in April that there is no rule barring the release of tax returns if an individual is under audit.

Democrats say they are prepared for a lengthy court battle over the returns.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats have the legal authority to request Trump's taxes and must do so as part of their ongoing investigations.

This week, Pelosi cited a recent New York Times report that Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses between 1984 and 1993 as further reason to request his returns.

""It would be useful to see his tax returns,"" Pelosi said at an event sponsored by The Washington Post. ""The law says the administration 'shall' give the — 'shall.' It doesn't say 'may, should, could, under certain circumstances.' It says 'shall' give those tax returns to the Ways and Means chairman."""

One official said the DHS request was for single occupancy units.

The request, which was delivered to the Pentagon Friday night, came as Customs and Border Protection predicted it would surpass half a million migrants crossing the border so far this fiscal year. The number of apprehensions on the US-Mexico border is the highest since 2009

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is considering the request.

""Secretary Shanahan is committed to increasing support to DHS where appropriate to do so,"" his spokesman, Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, said in a statement.

DOJ celebrates judge ruling radio station must register under FARA as Russian agent,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-celebrates-judge-ruling-radio-station-must-register-under-fara-as-russian-agent,"The Justice Department celebrated on Monday a federal judge’s decision which found that a Washington, D.C., radio station, operated by RM Broadcasting, had been acting as an agent of a foreign power, Russia, and must therefore register as such under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

Assistant Attorney General John Demers touted the decision, saying that “the American people have a right to know if a foreign flag waves behind speech broadcast in the United States.”

Since 2017, RM Broadcasting had been using AM radio channel 1390 WZHF to rebroadcast Russia’s Sputnik radio programs in D.C., and so the Justice Department was able to convince a district judge in southern Florida, where RM Broadcasting is based, that the company was acting as a foreign agent on Russia’s behalf. Last week, Judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that RM Broadcasting was working on behalf of the federal state unitary enterprise Rossiya Segodnya, an international information agency, which the Justice Department contends is “a Russian state-owned media enterprise created by Vladimir Putin to advance Russian interests abroad.”

The Justice Department highlighted the decision as an example of its commitment to stepping up Foreign Agents Registration Act enforcement. “Our concern is not the content of the speech but providing transparency about the true identity of the speaker,” Demers said. “This case shows that the Department can and will utilize all of its tools to bring transparency to efforts by foreign entities to influence the American public and our government, and demonstrates our renewed effort to enforce FARA rigorously.”

The Justice Department said its court win over RM Broadcasting “marked the first FARA civil enforcement action since 1991.”

The foreign agents registration law requires anyone who is working on behalf of a foreign government — lobbyists, businesses, newspapers, think tanks, media outlets, and radio stations — to disclose their foreign relationship by registering with the Justice Department.

The Justice Department contended that Russia’s “control” over RM Broadcasting’s activity “was absolute with respect to broadcast content.” The department said that RM Broadcasting was being used by Russia as a U.S.-based middle man to attempt an end run around the law and told the court that “allowing foreign principals to circumvent FARA simply by operating in the U.S. through contractual intermediaries would render FARA ineffectual with respect to its purpose of informing the public of the foreign source of information.” The judge agreed, saying that RM Broadcasting “is an agent of a foreign principal and is required to register pursuant to FARA.”

Originally passed during the World War II era to combat Nazi propaganda efforts, the rarely prosecuted FARA law gained new attention after special counsel Robert Mueller secured convictions under the statute against Trump associates, including Paul Manafort and Rick Gates during his investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 campaign. Brandon Van Grack, who spent a year and a half working for Mueller, was put in charge of the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Act unit earlier this year as the department promised to step up enforcement.

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Adam Hickey told the Washington Examiner that the department now believes that the foreign agents law “is a sufficiently high priority and there are enough cases to warrant having a deputy chief responsible for the malign influence work generally, just like we have a deputy chief for export control and sanctions, cyber, and economic espionage.”

RM Broadcasting joins better-known Russia-backed outlets such as Russia Today and Sputnik in being forced to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act in recent years. The U.S. has also stepped up the pressure on Chinese state media operating in the U.S. The China Global Television Network registered in 2019, but Xinhua News Agency has thus far declined to do so."

Newly obtained documents describe what happened when two now-infamous Russians took their outreach campaign into the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve in 2015.

Alexander Torshin, then a Russian central banker, brought his protégée, Maria Butina, for meetings with senior officials and even sought another with the then-chair of the Fed, the documents confirm.

Agency officials described what happened before and since in internal materials obtained by NPR under the Freedom of Information Act. The fact of the meetings has previously been reported, but their contents have not been fully described until now.

Torshin has since been sanctioned by the Treasury Department and cannot return to the United States.

Butina, meanwhile, has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to serve as a Russian agent and has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.

In an interview with NPR on Thursday, Butina called her meetings with government officials, politicians and the National Rifle Association ""civil diplomacy, this unofficial channel of diplomacy"" and said it was meant to build relationships between the U.S. and Russian governments — and ultimately to promote peace.

The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department declined to comment for this story.

The 'gun fanatic'

Torshin and Butina sought to build bridges between the Russian government and influential Americans via their enthusiasm for gun rights. Both had life memberships in the National Rifle Association.

At the same time, Russia was stepping up its broader campaign of influence against the United States.

So in 2015, after the chill in relations between Washington and Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Torshin sought to take advantage of his connection to Russia's central bank.

Paul Saunders, who was then the executive director of a D.C.-based think tank called the Center for the National Interest, reached out to officials with the Treasury and the Fed to help organize meetings.

""Because we were about a year into U.S. sanctions on Russia following their annexation of Crimea, we thought it would be interesting for Americans to hear from a Russian central bank official about the status of the Russian financial system,"" Saunders told NPR. ""We were certainly not at that time aware of any derogatory information about Torshin.""

Saunders helped broker a meeting for Torshin and Butina with Nathan Sheets, then the undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs.

Treasury aide Erik Woodhouse consulted with a number of officials inside its Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence and the White House's National Security Council, but no red flags were raised about the meeting, which ultimately took place on April 7, 2015.

A few years later, after Butina was arrested, a Treasury Department staffer wrote about what took place.

According to that newly revealed account, the discussion wasn't so much about banking as about denying Russia's involvement in the shoot-down of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner and amplifying Torshin's support for guns.

""The meeting was supposed to be about economics, but the guy just went on and on about how the Russians didn't shoot down MH17 for an hour or so,"" the Treasury Department official wrote, referring to the Malaysia Airlines flight.

""The guy was also a gun fanatic and said he was a 'life member of the NRA.' In fact I think he was even in town for personal business tied to the NRA.""

Saunders also reached out to request a meeting between then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Torshin in March 2015.

Yellen's office passed on the meeting and suggested that Torshin instead meet with Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer. Following the approval of an adviser, Fischer took the meeting on April 8, 2015, without further investigation into Torshin's background.

""They are in the United States to attend the NRA's annual meeting,"" the meeting's official notes read. Both Russians pointed out, as part of their introduction, that they were ""life members"" of the NRA.

This meeting did turn to economic issues, including discussions about Russian credit and inflation.

Butina, now in custody at a detention center in Alexandria, Va., said the meetings were unremarkable.

Of her meeting with Fischer, she said: ""Torshin put it straight: that he is here as an NRA member and he's just interested in meeting similar-minded people. ... I don't remember, even, the details of this conversation, because it wasn't significant at all.""

The sanctions

After months of investigations and headlines about Russia's influence campaign against the United States, Torshin was placed under sanction by the U.S. government in 2018.

In the evidentiary package that designated Torshin as a target for U.S. sanctions — also obtained by NPR — the Treasury Department established that Torshin was a Russian government official who could be targeted under existing sanctions authorities.

But the package also highlighted Torshin's alleged links with Russian organized crime.

Citing public sources such as Crime Russia, a news website focusing on Russian corruption, and El País, a Spanish newspaper, the document noted that Torshin was in ""frequent contact"" with Alexander Romanov, who heads the Taganskaya organized crime group, between August 2012 to May 2013.

""Torshin may have personally given instructions to members of the Taganskaya on money laundering methods using Spanish bank accounts and real estate,"" the evidentiary package reads.

The package cites no classified or governmental sources, but experts say the inclusion of references to Torshin's alleged organized crime links suggests the U.S. government had reason to believe the allegation was truthful.

""There's a whole process that is used for determining what is included in an evidentiary package. By including it, they view it as credible and relevant to designating him with sanctions,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, who formerly served as a senior adviser to the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

""This information is strictly ancillary to the legal authorities needed to sanction Torshin, but they want to put it out there for government officials to be aware of.""

Butina told NPR that she once asked Torshin about these alleged links, but she said she didn't believe they were true.

""I have no knowledge about this, absolutely none. ... One time I asked him about it, and he denied it ... a couple of years ago,"" she said. ""I don't believe he has this type of personality."""
"EPA fails to communicate risks of Franklin contamination, leaves families exposed to toxic chemicals",https://www.indystar.com,"['Sarah Bowman', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2019/05/14/epa-under-review-see-if-left-franklin-families-risk-pollution/1187723001/,"CLOSE Scientists use real time testing in Franklin Ind. to find answers after childhood cancer cluster, 2/27/2019. Michelle Pemberton, michelle.pemberton@indystar.com

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency discovered cancer-causing chemicals in the ground and sewers down the street from Kathy and David Carlson's Franklin house in the 1980s, but the Carlsons weren't informed of the risk for nearly 30 years.

And it wasn’t by the EPA. It was from a nonprofit started by parents.

“We didn’t put all this stuff together and we are still putting it together, but not because of anything the EPA has done — absolutely nothing,” said Kathy Carlson, a professor at Franklin College. The Carlsons have now learned enough that when David was diagnosed with cancer last year, their stomachs twisted into knots.

“We live less than a mile away,” she added, “and we have been utterly in the dark.”

Now the EPA Office of Inspector General is studying whether the agency is doing an adequate job of ""risk communication,"" or informing residents when environmental risks are discovered in their neighborhoods. Its study will examine eight sites, including the one near the Carlsons in Franklin.

And an IndyStar review of EPA communication guidelines suggests several reasons for concern in the agency’s handling of the contamination in Franklin:

The EPA stated publicly that the contamination was “under control” without any scientific testing to back it up.

The EPA didn’t inform residents about upcoming testing, leading to confusion, which may have caused some in the community to decline sampling.

The EPA didn’t involve the community as an active participant in making decisions about the site.

Similar to the Carlsons, numerous Franklin residents credit their knowledge of the city’s pollution problems to the local nonprofit known as If It Was Your Child. Stacie Davidson and Kari Rhinehart co-founded the group in 2014 to raise awareness and share information about contamination in their community — a job they said the EPA should have been doing.

The OIG traveled to Franklin last Wednesday to hear from residents. The government watchdog is visiting four of the eight sites as part of its review of the EPA’s communication efforts and if it shares information in a way that allows families to take steps to protect themselves.

The EPA did not answer IndyStar’s questions, but sent a statement via email saying it welcomed the opportunity to meet with the OIG to help with its audit.

“Properly communicating risk to the public is a fundamental part of EPA’s mission,” the statement read. “[EPA] Administrator [Andrew] Wheeler has placed a renewed emphasis on this aspect of our job and we welcome the OIG review and look forward to working with them and the community on this effort.”

EPA says pollution 'under control'

Davidson and Rhinehart, along with New Jersey-based environmental nonprofit Edison Wetlands Association, sent a letter in January to the Inspector General demanding an investigation into why toxic contamination at the former Amphenol site in Franklin persists.

As part of the OIG’s review, project manager Jill Trynosky said they will examine how closely the EPA has followed its guidelines on risk communication. IndyStar found and examined the EPA’s risk communication workbook for its own analysis.

Two of the key “Do’s and Don’ts” listed are to be honest and open and to not speak in absolutes.

But last year, around the time of the EPA's first community meeting in Franklin, EPA and state officials maintained that everything was “under control” and that the contamination had not moved or spread — despite having not completed updated testing to support that statement.

An IndyStar review of thousands pages of documents had found that the city’s contamination problem went back decades, and that serious data gaps existed as to the extent of the contamination. Questions emerged about whether the treatment system in place was actually removing the toxic metals.

“The city, state and EPA were so quick to try to get out in front of this and discredit it from the get go,” Rhinehart said, “instead of acknowledging it and saying ‘we have to work together to get this fixed.’”

When that testing was in fact completed and shared in November, it showed the toxic chemicals had actually spread and were under residential areas in Franklin, exactly as risk assessment models from the '90s predicted it would.

“That was a very reckless statement and very confusing for people,” Davidson said. “To say it’s not widespread, people want to believe that and they should be able to believe that from the EPA.”

The EPA’s workbook says it is important that the agency “earn trust and establish credibility” and “listen to community fears” to be able to effectively communicate.

And still the agency did not inform residents that it had hired an environmental consultant to do contamination testing inside their homes. Seeing a name they didn’t recognize, most residents declined the testing.

“There were a lot of steps that were not taken and a lot of steps that were taken were missteps,” Davidson told IndyStar, “and I think it put our community back.”

The EPA is also supposed to involve the community. The guidelines suggest setting up mailing lists, telephone conference calls or hotlines, or a workshop, among several other tools.

But the EPA dismissed Franklin residents' request to establish a Community Advisory Group to discuss their concerns and to participate in the EPA’s decisions about site clean-up. Instead it established an email update list — to which zero emails have been sent, Rhinehart said.

The OIG has said it plans to focus on recent communications in its audit, but the If It Was Your Child leaders said that would provide an incomplete picture.

“This goes back decades, when no one knew this site was in their own backyards producing contamination at levels high enough it could have been a Superfund,” Davidson said. “Because no one told us.”

Community can't minimize exposure

Kathy Carlson said that she never heard or saw anything over the years after the contamination was found, including when a treatment system was installed in the '90s or when the nearby wells supplying the city's water were shut down for contamination risks in the 2000s.

""I read the news and stay up on what's going on,"" she said, ""and I would have been on that like a bulldog.""

Actually, it wasn’t until just five years ago that her family finally learned of the cancer-causing chemicals in the city. And it was just last year that her 71-year-old husband was diagnosed with plasmacytoma, a type of blood cancer.

When David received his diagnosis, the doctor told them that they didn’t have to worry about it being passed down to their children — this cancer was from the environment.

He has received radiation and is doing well, but the Carlson family is not alone.

If It Was Your Child has documented at least 58 cases of childhood cancer — often rare forms of blood and brain cancer — in Franklin and surrounding towns since 2008. Both co-founders have had children with cancer — Davidson's stepson Zane, 14, is now in remission after a three-year battle with a rare form of leukemia. Rhinehart lost her 13-year-old daughter, Emma Grace Findley, in 2014 from a rare brain tumor.

The group is just now beginning to track adult cancers such as David Carlson’s.

“We have not even touched the surface of what issues and illnesses may have been caused by this,” said Dr. Mary Beth Hensley, a Franklin physician who is now being mindful of patients' diagnoses and to what they may have been exposed.

The main contaminants are trichloroethylene, or TCE, and tetrachloroethylene, or PCE — both of which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists as known carcinogens, meaning they can cause cancer in humans.

Agency officials and the health department have continued to emphasize that it is unknown what is causing children in Johnson County and Franklin to get cancer, or if any specific environmental cause can be identified.

Rhinehart, who is in the medical field along with Davidson, said she doesn’t accept that.

“We are willing to call something a carcinogen, but then because there is not an overwhelming amount of scientific proof, we can’t connect it to cancer,” Rhinehart said. “But no one is going to hand a kid or adult a glass of TCE to see what happens.”

Still, because these contaminants have that potential — and they have been detected in Franklin's sewers and even in some houses — Hensley said precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause-and-effect relationships aren't fully established scientifically.

It is unacceptable, Hensley added, that she as a doctor had not been contacted by the EPA about the potential effects and to be watching for certain cancer diagnoses. The Carlsons' oncologist also had no idea or been contacted, they said.

She said she has never been contacted by the EPA to share any information about the potential health risks. (Photo: Sarah Bowman)

Kathy Carlson said there are numerous things her family might have done if they had been told sooner: They could have had their basement sealed to minimize vapors coming in, as well as installed water and air filtration systems for the whole house. Many parents said they would not have let their kids play in the creek, or they would have had their house tested years ago, or they might have even moved.

Regardless, Rhinehart said, they would have had information to make their own decisions to minimize their risk and help find solutions.

“Maybe we would have had people paying attention a long time ago,” she said. “And maybe could have saved years before getting to this point and saved some lives.”

Begging for better

The OIG's audit director of land cleanup, Tina Lovingood, and Trynosky said they heard a number of items at Wednesday’s community meeting they could take back to the EPA immediately with some suggestions, particularly around how the community perceives the agency.

Trynosky said that “some comments tonight were concerning,” but she added it is important to hear from EPA officials about why they made the decisions they did.

In its statement, the EPA said it has provided the OIG with data, files and other information about its technical work, community involvement program and communications.

Rhinehart and Davidson both said they are excited that the OIG is looking into the situation in Franklin and feel that someone is finally listening to them.

“They were the game changer in Flint — there are officials being prosecuted from there on a federal level now,” Rhinehart said, referring to the OIG’s investigation of the government’s slow response to Flint, Michigan’s water crisis. “Most people don’t understand the full impact of what this could mean, but I do.”

Both women said they are frustrated that the OIG is looking only into potential failures in communication, and not whether the EPA actually failed in its response and efforts to clean up the contamination.

Lovingood said the OIG does sometimes audit actual clean-up efforts, but “this particular job is not that.”

The OIG hopes to finalize its report by the end of the year.If the watchdog arm finds areas where the EPA has failed to effectively communicate risk, it will make recommendations on how it can improve.

Beyond suggestions for how the EPA could better follow its guidelines, Trynosky said the OIG will look to see if any policies or standards need to be changed or strengthened, as well as review the training on them.

The next EPA community meeting is scheduled for June 5, and Davidson said that will be a real litmus test for how the clean-up will progress going forward.

“To date, if we’re talking about basic guidelines of communication, EPA has fallen short,” she said. “We want it to be stricter so people aren’t waiting years or decades for responses and information.”

“So we hope they come in with a plan for communication with the communities going forward,” Davidson added. “That’s what we’ve been asking for and hoping for and begging for all along.”

"After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/05/10/after-outcry-usda-will-no-longer-require-scientists-label-research-preliminary/,"

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has dropped a requirement that peer-reviewed studies by staff scientists include a disclaimer that findings are “preliminary.” (Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images)

The Agriculture Department has dropped its demand that staff scientists label peer-reviewed research as “preliminary,” after angry protests followed a Washington Post story disclosing the policy.

But the latest guidelines, released on Wednesday, for internally reviewing science within the department raise additional questions about scientific integrity, said non-USDA researchers who inspected the guide.

Since July, the department required peer-reviewed studies to include a disclaimer, The Post reported last month. Some finalized reports came with a caveat — these findings and conclusions are “preliminary” and have “not been formally disseminated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.”

USDA employees, editors of scientific journals and science advocates worried the disclaimer might be used to undercut scientists whose research was at odds with Trump administration policies. They also were concerned the language was confusing and potentially misleading.

The scientific community, generally speaking, does not expect peer-reviewed journals to publish preliminary results. The disclaimer, though enacted only as a temporary policy, appeared in several published articles, including a report on the best practices for capturing wild pigs.

This week, acting USDA chief scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young released a memo that replaced the July policy. It requires the following language when disclaimers are necessary: “The findings and conclusions in this [publication/presentation/blog/report] are those of the author(s) and should not be construed to represent any official USDA or U.S. Government determination or policy.”

Brooks Hanson, vice president of science at the American Geophysical Union, an organization that includes soil and agricultural researchers, said the updated disclaimer is a “welcome” change.

“The previous wording that required scientists to label their research submitted for publication as ‘preliminary’ would downplay the significance and importance of their work and cause confusion among readers,” Hanson said. The new language is closer to other disclaimers required by federal departments. “It is a positive development that USDA seemed to listen to the criticism and feedback.”

Still, he added, even this language may not be needed: “Many journals have this statement on their mastheads. This expectation, that an article represents the views of the authors only, is indeed the standard.”

Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a D.C.-based organization that advocates for scientists, said that “removing ‘preliminary’ from the disclaimer is a step in the right direction, but there still may be unnecessary obstacles preventing agency researchers from publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals.”

Not every study published by a USDA scientist is required to have this disclaimer. Some research agencies at USDA, including the Agricultural Research Service, the Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service and the Forest Service have “agency-specific policies” that determine when a disclaimer is appropriate, said William Trenkle, the USDA scientific integrity officer.

Others, such as the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have been encouraged to follow the new guidelines.

Those outline when disclaimers are needed and also describe the department’s internal review process before scientists can publish results in journals. It lists several “flags” that may trigger additional scrutiny. Some flags, under the umbrella of “prominent issues,” include “significant” scientific advancements, the potential to attract media attention, and results that could influence trade or change USDA policy.

Members of other USDA agencies, including the office of the chief scientist, the communications office and the office of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, can request “corrections” and “changes,” if the scientific publication falls under the category of “prominent issues” or policy implications.

“It is the responsibility of reviewers at all management levels to identify whether the manuscript contains prominent issues,” Trenkle said.

If USDA or other federal “stakeholders” request alterations based on these issues, then study authors should return “the REVISED PUBLICATION” for “ACCEPTANCE of the CHANGES and/or RESPONSE to comments,” the guideline says [capitalization is in the original].

Trenkle said the policy conforms with the USDA’s scientific integrity rules and “helps to ensure that USDA scientists communicate their scientific findings objectively without political interference or inappropriate influence.”

But Susan Offutt, who was the administrator of the Economic Research Service under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the guide twists internal review “into a process by which policy officials get the final say on content.” Because researchers at the Economic Research Service publish statistics to aid policymakers, “just about any output” from that agency could be flagged, she said.

USDA’s “interests apparently concern consistency with prevailing policy,” Offutt said, “not the public’s access to the best, unbiased science and analysis.”

"After reports of record falsification, Department of Justice investigating Connections prison services",https://www.delawareonline.com,"['Christina Jedra', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2019/05/13/doj-investigating-connections-prison-services/1187333001/,"CLOSE A former employee at Connections CSP says she was told to falsify dozens of female patient records at Crest South. 5/10/19 Jerry Habraken and Damian Giletto, Delaware News Journal

The Delaware Department of Justice said on Monday it is investigating Connections Community Support Programs, the private contractor that provides physical and mental health services to all inmates in state correctional facilities.

News of the probe comes after The News Journal published an investigation into reports that the contractor falsified records to conceal inadequate addiction treatment at Crest South, a taxpayer-funded substance abuse program for drug offenders in Georgetown.

Over a dozen inmates at Crest South said they received little or no individual counseling during their stay. Four former Crest counselors said the program supervisor instructed subordinates to falsify and backdate records to indicate clients had received counseling and treatment plans when in fact they did not. The supervisor denies this.

One former counselor, Shannon Lasek, admitted to falsifying at least 30 records.

""DOJ’s Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust is aware of issues regarding Connections’ contract and work with the Department of Correction, and is conducting an investigation,"" said DOJ Communications Director Mat Marshall.

Marshall would not comment further on the substance of the investigation but said that people with information about ""Connections' record-keeping practices"" should contact publictrust@delaware.gov.

Connections CEO Cathy McKay did not make herself available to The News Journal for interviews but issued a statement on Monday.

""We welcome any objective investigation into our programs and are confident any investigation will work to restore a level of trust in the community,"" she said.

The organization investigated its own records after Lasek said in her December resignation letter that she was forced to falsify documents. McKay said officials ""were satisfied that this did not occur.""

The Department of Correction, which paid Connections $15 million for its mental health and substance abuse services last year, said it did ""a quick search"" of electronic records in December that showed no evidence of falsification but it is conducting a deeper investigation now.

According to McKay, Connections' electronic record-keeping system cannot be backdated and ""clearly shows that individuals did receive services they claimed in print did not happen.""

Lasek said it's true that the electronic system automatically timestamps new inputs. She said when she falsified records, she published notes in the computer system that referred to paper charts. The electronic marker would show the current date, according to Lasek, but the paper file would have the older date the treatment plan was due.

Connections Board Chairman Bob Byrd said he had nothing to add to McKay's statement.

READ THE FULL INVESTIGATION: Prison contractor falsified records to conceal inadequate addiction treatment, sources say

A spokesman for Gov. John Carney called the allegations of record falsification a ""clearly troubling"" situation that deserves the attention of prosecutors.

""We will not solve our addiction crisis without addressing addiction in our prisons, where 46 percent of inmates on any given day are facing challenges with substance use,"" said Jonathan Starkey, the governor's communications director.

""We need to make sure that inmates have real access to treatment so they have a chance of success when they leave prison and re-enter their communities. Addiction affects every corner of our state, and this is too important an issue to not get right.""

The DOC said in a statement that it appreciates The News Journal bringing ""more detailed information and in-person accounts"" to its attention.

""Should the allegations be substantiated, the Department of Correction will take appropriate corrective action,"" the agency said. ""The DOC remains committed to providing quality care to the individuals entrusted into its custody.""

MaryBeth Cichocki, a Delaware addiction treatment advocate, has heard complaints about the quality of Connections services for years. In response to reports of falsification, she said she was ""not surprised.""

""Connections needs to be kicked out of Delaware, and we need to start a new program with people who really care about the outcomes of the people they’re treating,"" said Cichocki, who lost her son to an overdose in 2015. ""From what I’ve seen of Connections, all they care about is making money.""

The state, which paid Connections more than $72 million in state contracts last year, needs to reconsider its service delivery, Cichocki said.



""Connections has taken over the state and there is no competition anymore,"" she said. ""I really think the state is at a loss for what to do so they keep funding Connections.""

The Department of Correction recently extended Connections' mental health contract through mid-2020 and said the allegations of fraud will ""absolutely not"" get in the way of that agreement.

""That’s pretty sad if Connections is all we have and these things are happening and they’re continuing to ignore it,"" Cichocki said.

Lasek hopes the Department of Justice investigation is more thorough than the probes done by Connections and the DOC, neither of which interviewed her.

""They need to listen to the counselors and past clients,"" she said. ""We know there is a big problem. Let's all care enough to do something about it. Let's care more about the harm being done to people than their need to look good.""

This isn't the first time a Delaware health care contractor has been accused of falsifying records.

In 1994, St. Louis-based Correctional Medical Services lost its license for faulty record-keeping at a Gander Hill substance abuse program. Documents showed months of treatment plans, program notes and clinical supervision records were missing from client files, the News Journal reported at the time.

One inmate said he was instructed to sign a blank form or be expelled from the program. Another prisoner filed a complaint after he was directed to sign eight months' worth of progress reports in one session, the Journal reported.

In 2005, a former Correctional Medical Services drug and alcohol counselor said she was ordered to falsify documents from 1999 to 2002 so state inspectors wouldn't pull the program's license, the News Journal reported.

""I received a chart that wasn't touched for four months,"" said former counselor Denise Rodriguez. ""I was told to 'catch the chart up' using previous statements from the client.""

About 20 years later, Lasek reported a very similar experience with Connections.

Also in 2005, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice opened a ""formal inquiry"" into medical care and other systemic issues inside Delaware prisons.

The inquiry followed a six-month investigation by The News Journal highlighting AIDS-related inmate deaths and suicides over four years; allegations by inmates of poor medical treatment for cancer, meningitis and hepatitis; and a no-bid $25.9 million contract awarded to Correctional Medical Services to manage health care in the state's prisons.

The U.S. Department of Justice found ""substantial civil rights violations"" inside Delaware's prisons. Federal officials reached a settlement with the DOC despite protests from state officials and even a letter from then-Gov. Ruth Ann Minner to then-U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales attempting to derail the nine-month federal investigation.

Federal regulators identified a host of problems inside the prisons, including inadequate screening and health assessments, inadequate treatment of inmates with infectious diseases, inadequate treatment of inmates with serious mental illness and deficiencies in the state's suicide-prevention measures.

The state signed an 87-point agreement promising to correct the deficiencies and ""meet generally accepted professional standards.""

After six years of working to improve inmate health, the DOC was released from the imposed agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice on the final day of 2012.

"Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker: 'Rumors' Trump is quashing DOJ, FBI investigations",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-rumors-trump-is-quashing-doj-fbi-investigations,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker said on Friday there are ""rumors"" that President Trump is quashing investigations run by the Justice Department and the FBI.

During an interview on MSNBC, Baker told host Rachel Maddow he decided to speak out because of Trump's bullying tactics.

He said ""it could have a significant negative impact in the long run"" because people are worried about their careers and reputations.

""When the president of the United States starts to go at you on Twitter it's ... unnerving,"" he said. ""If you're concerned about your reputation and your long-term career, you're more likely to be hesitant to do things that will attract that type of ire.""

Maddow asked if he is aware of any investigations that have been impeded because of Trump's behavior, and Baker said he has ""heard rumors to that effect"" but none that he could confirm. He did acknowledge that this dynamic was ""currently"" at work.

""Whether it's true or not, it's something to worry about,"" he said. He noted that ""certain types of investigations, especially as they start to touch the political system or political leaders"" are the ones to worry about.

Baker's interview comes after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report, which details 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice. He declined to say either way whether Trump committed a crime, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

The FBI have come under scrutiny for the handling of the Trump-Russia investigation, with allegations of politicization, improper surveillance, spying, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse. Baker, who is under criminal investigation for alleged unauthorized leaks to the media, has been subject to criticism by Trump for his role in allowing the use of an unverified dossier to obtain the authority to spy on a member of his 2016 campaign, Carter Page.

“Former FBI top lawyer James Baker just admitted involvement in FISA Warrant and further admitted there were IRREGULARITIES in the way the Russia probe was handled,” Trump tweeted in January. “They relied heavily on the unverified Trump ‘Dossier’ paid for by the DNC & Clinton Campaign, & funded through a big Crooked Hillary law firm, represented by her lawyer Michael Sussmann (do you believe this?) who worked Baker hard & gave him Oppo Research for ‘a Russia probe.’ This meeting, now exposed, is the subject of Senate inquiries and much more. An Unconstitutional Hoax.”

Baker said Trump's intimidation tactics against the FBI are ""very dangerous,"" but believes that the career officials at the bureau are highly resilient and are going to ""resist"" Trump as much as they can."

Trump told Politico in an interview Friday that he hasn’t talked with Barr about investigating Biden and his family's business dealings but said ""certainly it would be an appropriate thing"" to bring up with the attorney general.

""Certainly it is a very big issue and we’ll see what happens. I have not spoken to him about it. Would I speak to him about it? I haven’t thought of that. I mean, you’re asking me a question I just haven’t thought of,"" he told the outlet.

The president noted that it could be ""a very big situation"" for Biden, who has led the Democratic presidential primary field in polling since he launched his campaign last month.

""Because he’s a Democrat it’s about 1/100 the size of the fact that if he were a Republican, it would be a lot bigger,"" Trump alleged.

Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani last week called for an investigation into Biden for his previous ties to Ukraine after The New York Times reported that while Biden was vice president in 2016, he allegedly threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country removed a top prosecutor. The prosecutor, who had been accused of ignoring corruption in his own office, was later voted out.

Biden’s son Hunter was a board member of an energy company that the prosecutor had been looking into, according to the newspaper.

Giuliani initially planned to travel to Ukraine to encourage Ukraine's president-elect to launch investigations into Biden and the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE's Russia investigation.

However, Giuliani changed course late Friday, announcing that he had canceled his trip. The reversal came after Democrats on Capitol Hill accused him of seeking aid from a foreign government.

Biden, the front-runner among a crowded field of Democrats vying for the White House in 2020, had a 32-point lead over his competitors in a Hill-HarrisX poll released earlier this week.

Biden also surpassed Trump by six points in the first poll published after the former vice president officially announced his candidacy in April."
WV MetroNews Minden declared EPA Superfund site; remedial investigation commences,http://wvmetronews.com,['Pete Davis'],05-13-2019,2019,5,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/05/13/minden-declared-epa-superfund-site-on-site-investigations-commence/,"By Pete Davis in News | May 13, 2019 at 2:31PM

MINDEN, W.Va. — More than three decades after widespread environmental contamination was discovered in the small town of Minden in Fayette County, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday the area has been added to its Superfund National Priorities List.

In addition to mandated on-site environmental testing and removal of contamination, the designation will provide local residents with access to the Superfund, including possible eligibility for specialized medical care and other federal aid.

The EPA proposed adding the site to the National Priorities List in Sept. 2018. The designation was finalized following a review of comments received during the required 60-day public comment period.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler made the announcement at New Apostolic Church in Minden, joined by Gov. Jim Justice, U.S. Sen. Shelly Moore Capito, R-W.Va., U.S. Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., and EPA Region 3 Administrator Cosmo Servidio.

This is such an important day because the people of Minden have been waiting on this level of help for decades. https://t.co/pUj3MBEyr8 pic.twitter.com/injALI65Vo — Governor Jim Justice (@WVGovernor) May 13, 2019

EPA Andrew Wheeler

According to Wheeler, the decision to add Minden to the National Priorities List was based on several existing factors and on a number of documented events, beginning in 1970, when Shaffer Equipment Company began building electrical substations in Minden for the regional coal mining industry, eventually leading to soil and water contamination from oil containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) within materials stored at the company’s work site.

“I would say what really weighed on my mind in making the final call and listing today was the history of the site, and the fits and starts that this site has had since the early 80s, and the fact that we thought this was cleaned up three different times,” he said. “The community here had a lot of, I would say, a distrust on what’s happened in the past, and I felt the community needed this and needed the certainty of it being addressed — finally addressed — by both the state and the federal government.”

Gov. Justice said he shares the frustration of area residents who have lived through decades of what he characterized as unmitigated failure by government to respond appropriately.

“Maybe we can, now, straighten up what others just let go,” said Justice. “Why it took so long, none of us can explain, none of us can explain. That’s all there is to it. All I can do is apologize for it taking so long. It’s ridiculous, it’s absolutely terrible.”

Sen. Capito said she was pleased her office was able to help the agency clear the necessary hurdles to bring Minden under federal protection.

file Shelly Moore Capito, R-W.Va.

“It’s taken some work to get us here. We’ve worked closely with Administrator Wheeler and many others at EPA to make this happen for a while now, and this is an important designation. It’s not only an acknowledgement of the work that needs to be done, but it’s also a commitment from the federal government, a commitment of attention and resources and a commitment to provide more financial and technical assistance to clean up this site,” she said. “That also means delivering a new sense of safety and certainty to all those who call Minden home, and it means providing for the health and well-being of West Virginians.”

Region 3 Administrator Servidio told MetroNews the National Priorities List designation will generate the beginning of an intricate process of gathering information from scientists, investigators, and those impacted, directly and indirectly, as a result of PCB contamination.

EPA Cosmo Servidio

“We are now in the midst of a remedial investigation, a thorough remedial investigation. All the information and data that we extrapolate we’ll share with the community, as we continue to do, and take input from them as well. They are a part of the process,” he said. “We take into (consideration) the whole history of the site, all the actions that we’ve done in coordination with the state, as we move forward.”

According to Servidio, the area that will undergo remedial testing for contamination includes the Shaffer Equipment Company property and sediment from the adjoining Arbuckle Creek, though the specific boundaries of the site chosen for scientific analysis will be defined further during the investigation, which is expected to begin by early summer.

In 2017, the EPA tested soil and sediment from the site and declined to take further action, concluding the site no longer posed an immediate threat to human health.

In April, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., sent a letter to Wheeler, reiterating his support for the proposed addition of Minden to the National Priorities List, noting the significantly higher rate of cancer among local residents, compared to other residents of Fayette County."
US DoJ Charges Group of Individuals Who Stole $2.5 Mln in Crypto Via SIM Swapping,https://cointelegraph.com,['Ana Berman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-doj-charges-group-of-individuals-who-stole-25-mln-in-crypto-via-sim-swapping,"The United States Department of Justice released a fifteen-count indictment on May 9 that charges a hacking group labeled “The Community” with SIM swapping in order to steal cryptocurrencies.

U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider and his colleague from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Angie Salazar announced the charges in the Eastern District of Michigan. Per Salazar, the investigation was led by Homeland Security Investigations on two continents.

According to the indictment, five Americans and an Irishman are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Another three, who reportedly are the former employees of mobile phone providers, are charged in a criminal complaint with the wire fraud related to “The Community.”

As described in the document, the hacking group used SIM swapping — a type of identity theft attack that generally targets a weakness in two-factor authentication. The perpetrator usually gains control of a target's mobile phone by convincing or bribing the employee of the mobile provider to swap the phone number to a SIM card controlled by the hackers.

After successfully swapping the numbers of their victims, “The Community” managed to gain access to their various online accounts, including cryptocurrency exchange accounts and wallets. As a result of fraud, approximately $2.5 million worth of cryptocurrency was sent to wallets controlled by the hacking group. Attorney Schneider clarified that in this case, three mobile phone service provider employees purportedly helped swappers to steal money.

The charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison each. Meanwhile, a conviction of aggravated identity theft could add up to two years in prison for the defendants .

According to Irish news website The Journal, a 20-year-old man from Dublin was arrested in Ireland upon the request of the U.S. authorities and is currently awaiting extradition.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, in November 2018, a law enforcement group dedicated to fighting cybercrime released a report on SIM swapping, stating that it had become increasingly popular in California.

Meanwhile, in January, a 21-year old American was accused of stealing almost $24 million in crypto via SIM swapping. And in February, a New York resident was indicted in what constituted the jurisdiction’s first SIM-swapping prosecution."
U.S. says Huawei lawyer's prior work at Justice Department poses conflicts,https://www.reuters.com,"['Karen Freifeld', 'Min Read']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-huawei-tech/u-s-says-huawei-lawyers-prior-work-at-justice-department-poses-conflicts-idUSKCN1SG2GU,"(Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd lawyer James Cole’s prior work at the U.S. Department of Justice created conflicts of interest that should disqualify him from defending the Chinese company in a case of alleged bank fraud and sanctions violations, U.S. prosecutors said in a filing on Friday.

Last week, the prosecutors filed a motion to disqualify Cole, who served as deputy attorney general, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, between 2011 and 2015. But the motion was sealed and classified, and prosecutors did not make public the reasons behind the move.

“There is a ‘substantial risk’ that Cole could use ‘confidential factual information’ obtained while serving as DAG to ‘materially advance’ Huawei’s current defense strategy,” the prosecutors said, according to a redacted copy of the U.S. motion filed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.

Cole was not immediately available for comment. But in a statement Huawei said the U.S. wants to strip the company of counsel of its choice while concealing the facts on why.

“The Justice Department’s motion to disqualify Jim Cole makes a mockery of the adversarial process,” the statement said.

“The government has known since 2017 that Mr. Cole represented Huawei in this matter. Now, two years later, not only does the Justice Department seek to strip Huawei of counsel of its choice, but it does so while concealing from Huawei and the public virtually all of the facts on which it bases its motion.”

The case against Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has ratcheted up tensions between Beijing and Washington as the world’s top two economic powers try to negotiate a trade deal.

The company’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested in Canada in December at the behest of U.S. authorities for her role in the alleged fraud. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.

In Friday’s filing, U.S. prosecutors said Cole’s representation of Huawei poses “irresolvable conflicts of interest.”

As deputy attorney general, Cole “personally supervised and participated in aspects of” an investigation that caused the conflicts, the prosecutors said in the filing.

Details of that probe were redacted, but the filing said the Huawei prosecution is “substantially related” to the matter.

The prosecutors said Cole possessed information from his government work related to his Huawei representation that he could not reveal, and this created the risk he would rely on the information in breach his duties to the Justice Department.

Secondly, because the nature of the conflict is classified, the prosecutors said, Huawei cannot obtain enough information for them to waive any conflict.

The case against Huawei and Meng accuses them of conspiring to defraud HSBC Holdings Plc and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei’s relationship with Skycom Tech Co Ltd, a company that operated in Iran, putting the banks at risk of penalties for processing transactions that violated U.S. sanctions laws.

Huawei has said Skycom was a local business partner. The United States maintains it was an unofficial subsidiary used to conceal Huawei’s Iran business.

U.S. authorities claim Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system.

Last month, prosecutors said they planned to use information about Huawei in the case that was obtained through secret surveillance.

Cole entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Huawei and its U.S. subsidiary in Brooklyn on March 14."

(Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)

The Trump administration will calculate the climate effects of its oil, gas and coal leasing decisions, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview Wednesday, but will not make those impacts the key factor in its final decisions.

Bernhardt, who took office a month ago, said he was committed to carrying out President Trump’s plans to expand fossil-

fuel production on public lands. In March, a federal judge ruled that the federal government illegally approved two gas drilling plans in western Colorado; on Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that Interior’s Bureau of Land Management failed to account for the effect of fracking in as many as 4,000 oil and gas wells in New Mexico’s Greater Chaco region.

Bernhardt, who noted that the leases in both decisions had been issued under the Obama administration, said he was confident the department could address these concerns.

“So, that says to me that we have to do a better job in articulating certain things to the courts,” he said during a wide-ranging conversation in his office. “What I hope is, as an organization, we learn from any error we make.”

Congressional Democrats have been pressing Bernhardt, who appeared before a House spending panel Tuesday and will testify before the House Natural Resources Committee this week, to factor climate change into the department’s decisions about energy development on public lands and in federal waters.

But he emphasized that Interior was not legally obligated to curb the nation’s carbon output, even if it had to assess the environmental effects of its leasing programs.

“The law requires us to analyze those things,” he said, referring to the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from a leasing decision. “It doesn’t say if there is an additional contribution, you should not go forward at all.”

The Trump administration has placed a hold on one of its most ambitious leasing proposals, a five-year plan for offshore drilling, after a federal judge ruled in March that the president’s order revoking a sweeping ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans was illegal. Bernhardt said that the White House would make the ultimate decision on whether to appeal, and that he could not predict when the offshore leasing plan would be finalized.

Bernhardt is prepared to forge ahead on other deregulation efforts. He said he expected to get a briefing on last week’s U.N. scientific report that an eighth of the world’s plants and animals are at risk of extinction but added that the Interior and Commerce departments still planned to finalize an overhaul of endangered species regulations this year.

“We didn’t start doing them to not do them,” he said.

As he pursues the administration’s agenda, Bernhardt is likely to encounter resistance on Capitol Hill. In a phone interview Wednesday, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on interior, environment and related agencies, said that any spending bill passing the House this year would impose certain requirements on the Interior Department.

“We will not be funding irreparable harm to the environment,” McCollum said. “Any bill we pass will include requirements for the Department of Interior to use real science, to use best practices, to protect the environment and to not to go to industry and ask them what they want, and what’s the bare minimum.”

In contrast to his predecessor, Ryan Zinke, who insulted one of the top Democrats overseeing Interior on Twitter, Bernhardt has made an effort to contact key lawmakers in recent weeks. He met privately Tuesday with House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and said he plans to meet with members of both parties in the months to come.

“You know, my own view is that everyone who is engaged in public service is trying to serve the public interest in the best way that they can,” he said.

Bernhardt, who started running the department in January but did not move into the secretary’s office until he was sworn in April 11, has made several changes to its decor. A stuffed polar bear stands as a sentry outside, and the skull of a moose Bernhardt shot in Alaska’s Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve sits atop the fireplace.

“I’m not somebody who would put somebody else’s stuff up,” Bernhardt said, noting that he and a friend had to carry the moose’s entire body themselves to ship it out on a small plane. “His neck meat alone was 135 pounds.”"
US Treasury Ironically Accusing Vietnam of Currency Manipulation,https://beincrypto.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://beincrypto.com/us-treasury-ironically-accusing-vietnam-currency-manipulation/,"Recent months have seen increasing tightening by the Federal Reserve (Fed) via increases in interest rates. These have come in response to a robust US economy, a high-flying stock market, and a strong US dollar.

The current economic miracle is closely related to the massive rate decreases that the Fed used to pull up from the crisis of 2008. When the threat of a currency decline became apparent, the Fed rushed to prop up the dollar and with it, the US economy.

Pot and Kettle

In an ironic turn, however, the US Treasury has now threatened to turn up the heat on foreign governments for manipulating currencies. The scrutiny includes the twelve largest trading partners with the US, plus a host of other nations with trading surpluses.

While the vast majority of these nations have passed the so-called test, Vietnam stands to be the first nation accused. The country is apparently using external means to hold down the dong — the national currency of Vietnam. Obviously, the name has led to a host of snide comments regarding the country’s actions.

Passive Aggressive

The twist comes with a perusal of other US trading partners. Nearly every country on the list is using some means of currency manipulation.

For example, the Japanese government has been buying up massive amounts of ETFs in the country in order to keep the yen down, and Switzerland has been hoarding Apple stock to devalue the franc. China, too, recently buoyed its stock market by pumping money into oil and finance companies to stabilize values.

The difference, according to the Treasury, is the passive nature of these manipulations compared to Vietnam’s active suppression. Apparently, the active vs. passive nature creates a distinction that the Treasury is unwilling to countenance.

Decentralized Answer

Though the news of US scrutiny is not surprising, the relative hypocrisy could be. With nearly every national bank in the world manipulating its currency through some means, Vietnam’s tiny economy is an odd choice to single out.

The entire issue draws attention to the need for greater levels of economic decentralization. While such market manipulations can, and have, produced some level of stability in various places, they also produce economies that are wholly political.

On the contrary, Bitcoin (BTC) and other decentralized cryptocurrencies provide payment methodologies that free the consumer from the constraints of centralized government. By connecting peer-to-peer in a ‘trustless’ environment, Bitcoin allows markets to move independently, without such manipulations.

Do you think Bitcoin is the currency of the future because it promotes financial independence, or is currency manipulation part and parcel with a stable economy? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

DOJ charges Chinese man over 'one of the worst data breaches in history' which took 79 million people’s personal data from Anthem health insurers,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Bill Bostock'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-hacker-stole-data-78-million-anthem-doj-say-2019-5,"A Chinese national has been charged with orchestrating the biggest data hack in US healthcare history, in which 79 million people had their personal information stolen.

Wang Fujie, 32, was charged with hacking US health insurance giant Anthem, and three other unnamed US businesses, between February 2014 and January 2015, a Department of Justice press (DOJ) release said Thursday.

In the four-count indictment cited by the DOJ, Wang, who also goes by Dennis Wang, is said to have ""used sophisticated techniques to hack into the computer networks of the victim businesses without authorization.""

He was charged alongside another man, referred to in the indictment as John Doe.

The men are then accused of installing malware and seeking out the personal information of 79 million Anthem customers, as well as their ""confidential business information.""

They were detected in January 2015, the indictment said.

The stolen data included names, health identification numbers, dates of birth, social security numbers, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, employment information, and income data, the indictment said.

Anthem paid the US government $16 million as a result of the privacy violation in October 2018.

One of the techniques Wang is said to have used was a ""spearfishing"" email, a targeted message designed to trick the recipient into treating it as legitimate.

Emails with hyperlinks were sent to employees of the four companies, the DOJ said. If they clicked on the link it installed malware which opened a back door to the company's computer server, the indictment said.

Wang and the other man were both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer.

In a statement, DOJ assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski said: ""The allegations in the indictment unsealed today outline the activities of a brazen China-based computer hacking group that committed one of the worst data breaches in history.""

""These defendants allegedly attacked US businesses operating in four distinct industry sectors, and violated the privacy of over 78 million people by stealing their PII (personally identifiable information).""

In February 2015, Bloomberg reported that the FBI believes the hack was sponsored by the Chinese government.

An Anthem spokeswoman told Business Insider in an emailed statement:

""We are grateful for the support and partnership of the FBI and extended law enforcement team in investigating the sophisticated cyber-attack that Anthem was a victim of in February 2015, and are pleased with the action taken today.""

""There is no evidence that information obtained through the 2015 cyber-attack targeting Anthem has resulted in fraud."""
Interior secretary mum on whether Utah will be new home to BLM headquarters,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900070016/interior-secretary-mum-on-whether-utah-will-be-new-home-to-blm-headquarters.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — A decision on where in the West — possibly Utah — to relocate the Bureau of Land Management headquarters will be made this summer, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said Friday.

""I'm pretty confident it’s moving. I can’t tell you where it’s going, but it’s moving,"" the newly appointed secretary told the Deseret News.

The Interior Department is finishing up an analysis on relocating the BLM from Washington, D.C., to the West and has included money for the move in its budget proposal, Bernhardt said.

Accompanied by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, Bernhardt is in the state to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the driving of the golden spike that marked the completion of the transcontinental railroad at Promontory Summit.

Bernhardt, who replaced former Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior secretary last month, and Bishop sat down for an interview on a variety of public lands issues before taking a helicopter to Golden Spike National Historical Park for the festivities.

Last summer, Susan Combs, Interior's assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, sized up Ogden as a possible site for the BLM. Cedar City and St. George also are in the mix.

Bishop said it makes economic sense to have the office in the West instead of flying people back and forth from Washington. Almost all of the land BLM manages is west of Denver.

""I think our employees will have a wonderful quality of life. Their salaries go so much farther out here. I think they’ll be very excited,"" Bernhardt said.

Republican Utah lawmakers have long sought state control of some 31 million acres of federal land. But Bernhardt doesn't see that happening.

""That’s an area where the president has drawn a pretty clear line,"" he said. ""I'm sure we're not in the position of thinking that large-scale transfers at this time are the right thing to do.""

Federal land managers are trying to be ""wonderful"" neighbors,"" Bernhardt said.

""We can work on managing land together. We can work to be good neighbors. We can work on effectively managing on our land in a way that’s consistent and harmonious with the state lands,"" he said.

As deputy Interior secretary, Bernhardt came to Utah with President Donald Trump in December 2017 when the president significantly reduced the sizes of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Several environmental groups and Native American tribes sued Trump over the decision.

Critics say it will open areas packed with ancient cultural relics and delicate landscapes the monuments once encompassed to mining and oil and gas exploration.

""If somebody says you’re only doing it to get oil and gas, they clearly don’t know what the hell they're talking about. There is no oil and gas in either of those,"" Bishop said.

""That’s why we were willing to ban any kind of mining in the Bears Ears area because it ain’t there in the first place,"" he said. ""There’s coal at Grand Staircase but oil and gas, it doesn’t exist.""

Bernhardt, a former oil industry lobbyist, said even though the monument designation went away, wilderness and wilderness study areas remain as do other underlying laws. Much of BLM land, he said, has a conservation priority imposed on it.

""We’re going through a big planning process right now on the monuments and our planning process will decide what we can do within the boundaries of our discretion,"" Bernhardt said.

Bernhardt and Bishop say there's room on vast public lands for recreation, conservation and economic activity.

""If you don’t have the access for both recreational opportunities and economic opportunities on that land, on that public land, you know what you don’t have? You don’t have a community,"" Bernhardt said.

Utah GOP leaders have long decried President Bill Clinton's creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante in 1996 and more recently President Barack Obama's designation of Bear Ears in 2016 as an abuse of the Antiquities Act. In both instances, they have sought ways to roll back the presidents' actions.

Bishop introduced a bill in March to limit a president's power to designate and reshape national monuments under the act. Utah's two GOP senators proposed legislation to prohibit presidents from creating or expanding national monuments in Utah without the consent of Congress and the state Legislature.

Bernhardt didn't state a position on the legislation when asked about it Friday.

""I think the president I worked with has used it really, really well,"" he said. ""I think the Congress has to worry about future presidents.""

The Interior Department's approach is to ensure local input, community support and congressional support before moving ahead with any designation, Bernhardt said.

He also addressed park maintenance.

The National Park Service current has a nearly $13 billion maintenance backlog that impacts popular Zion and Arches national parks.

Bernhardt said the Interior Department has a budget proposal that would address the problem in a ""significant"" way. He said he's also about to issue an order that would allow a broader range of parks to use fee revenue to hire staff to make sure parks are safe, clean and well-managed.

""We’re trying to make that visitor experience exceptional,"" he said.

Bernhardt said the order would include parks in Utah, but he wasn't sure which ones."
"Trump declares 'invasion' at border after DHS says 1 percent of Honduras, Guatemala entered US",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-invasion-border-dhs-one-percent-honduras-guatemala,"A day after the acting Homeland Security secretary estimated that more than 1 percent of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras had entered the U.S. since September, President Trump declared an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, his administration expects record numbers of migrants to arrive from Central America in the coming months.

""When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion,” Trump said at his Wednesday evening “Make American Great Again” rally in Panama City, Fla., defending his declaration of a national emergency at the border earlier this year. “No nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws. And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

“Guatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,” McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

“One department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents — close to 3 percent of the population — migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,” McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

“In March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants — 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,” McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt’s Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

“That’s over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,” McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include “an aggressive and holistic strategy” to work together with Central America officials in order to identify “pushes” that drive migrants out of Central America.

“We want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS’s Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region’s customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.”
