"Google wants Trump to lose in 2020, former engineer for tech giant says: 'That's their agenda'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Victor Garcia', 'Kevin Cernekee', 'Former Google Employee']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fired-google-engineer-fears-company-will-try-and-influence-2020-election-they-really-want-trump-to-lose,"A former Google engineer who claims he has been blacklisted by the tech giant says he believes the company will try to influence the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.

""They really want Trump to lose in 2020. That’s their agenda,"" Kevin Cernekee said Friday on Fox News' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight.""

""They have very biased people running every level of the company,"" Cernekee continued. ""They have quite a bit of control over the political process. That’s something we should really worry about.""

""They really want Trump to lose in 2020. That’s their agenda. They have very biased people running every level of the company."" — Kevin Cernekee, former Google employee

GOOGLE EMPLOYEES DONATE HEAVILY TO WARREN, SANDERS DESPITE CALLS FOR TECH GIANT'S BREAKUP

Cenekee was fired in June 2018 after Google told him he was terminated for misuse of the company’s equipment, including its software system for remote access. However, Cernekee, who describes himself as a whistleblower, maintains he was terminated for his outspoken conservative views.

""They have quite a bit of control over the political process. That’s something we should really worry about."" — Kevin Cernekee, former Google employee

The former Googler told the Wall Street Journal that, after his posts to the tech giant’s internal message boards in early 2015 annoyed some of his colleagues, he received an official warning from Google’s human resources department. His conduct had reportedly been deemed “disrespectful and insubordinate.”

The Journal reports that around that time a senior manager at the company wrote on the message boards that he had added the engineer to a “written blacklist” of Google employees with whom he refused to work.

Cernekee spent the next three years fighting the Mountain View, Calif.-based firm over the alleged violations and arguing that conservative employees were being treated unfairly, according to the report, which cites interviews, documents and copies of posts on the company’s internal message boards.

Carlson asked Cernekee if he thought Google would try to ""influence"" the 2020 election and attempt to ""prevent"" Trump from being reelected.

""I do believe so. I think that’s a major threat. They have openly stated that they think 2016 was a mistake. They thought Trump should have lost in 2016,"" Cernekee responded.

Cernekee called the Google operation ""highly ideological"" and ""plagued with bias.""

The engineer also claimed employees dragged their feet to correct a Google search bug that involved President Trump.

""If you do a Google search for 'Crippled America,' which is Donald Trump’s book, you would get results that would show 'Mein Kampf' instead,"" Cernekee said, referring to the book by Adolf Hitler. ""I reported that, I filed a bug, I escalated it, I tried to run it up the chain. They took nine months to fix that bug.""

John Ratcliffe’s Ties to Whistleblower Case Surfaced as Officials Warned Against Him for DNI,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin Banco', 'Asawin Suebsaeng', 'National Security Reporter', 'White House Reporter']",08-03-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-nominee-john-ratcliffes-ties-to-whistleblower-case-surfaced-as-officials-warned-against-him-for-dni,"An email disclosing Rep. John Ratcliffe’s (R-TX) alleged involvement in a controversial whistleblowing case reached the White House prior to the announcement Friday that he was withdrawing his name from consideration for Director of National Intelligence, according to two sources with knowledge of the correspondence.

The email, originally sent to the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, laid out how Ratcliffe promoted a company accused of being instrumental in the reprisal against a whistleblower and their cybersecurity efforts, according to one of those sources. The Government Accountability Project, an organization that protects whistleblowers, is helping represent the unnamed government employee. Details about the case are being closely held in part because of security reasons.

The organization sent information on its client’s disclosure to the committee Wednesday morning. The email then circulated among Republicans in Washington, including some White House officials, who did not think Ratcliffe was up to the job of DNI, according to two sources with direct knowledge.

White House spokespeople did not provide comment for this story. Ratcliffe did not respond to a request for comment.

Ratcliffe’s third-largest campaign donor in the 2019-2020 cycle, according to Open Secrets, a non-profit that tracks the intersection of money in politics, is a company that forced the shutdown of a critical government cybersecurity office. That’s according to an individual familiar with the whistleblower’s disclosure. Ratcliffe hosted the company in front of the House Homeland Security’s Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, the source said.

“While I am concerned that there was never a complete review of the facts of this case as it related to Mr. Ratcliffe … I’m thankful the committee took this matter seriously,” said Irvin McCullough, a national security analyst at the Government Accountability Project. “This engagement exemplifies the need for policymakers to continue championing their work with courageous whistleblowers willing to speak truth to power.”

News of the email comes as President Donald Trump considers multiple individuals for the position of DNI. Since Trump announced the nomination of Ratcliffe last week, U.S. media organizations have published multiple reports of holes in the congressman’s biography and his exaggeration of the work he did as a former U.S. Attorney in Texas. Three sources with knowledge of the government’s vetting process said Trump administration officials raised concerns about Ratcliffe’s past over the last week. It’s unclear whether the whistleblower disclosure email impacted Ratcliffe’s nomination, or if the president himself was aware of the email.

Trump announced Ratcliffe’s decision Friday afternoon.

“Our great Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe is being treated very unfairly by the LameStream Media. Rather than going through months of slander and libel, I explained to John how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people,” Trump said in a tweet. “John has therefore decided to stay in Congress where he has done such an outstanding job representing the people of Texas, and our Country. I will be announcing my nomination for DNI shortly.”

As of Friday night, Trump had not announced his nomination and his team was still actively considering multiple different individuals for the DNI posting. One of those individuals is U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Pete Hoekstra, according to two individuals with knowledge of the Trump administration's search. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report on Hoekstra’s consideration on Friday.

News of the president considering someone new for the DNI position came Friday morning when The Daily Beast reported the White House had asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) for a list of all its employees at the federal government’s top pay scale who have worked there for 90 days or more. The White House asked for people in ODNI who maintained at least the GS-15 level (the pay grade for most top government employees, including supervisors).

The request underscored the president’s attempt to find a suitable replacement for the ODNI’s top posting and raised questions about whether he attempted to oust Sue Gordon, the principal deputy director of national intelligence. Under federal law the individual serving in that position is supposed to step up if the DNI departs. Last week DNI Dan Coates announced that he would leave his post August 15.

The New York Times reported Friday that the president was in the throes of trying to circumvent Gordon and replace her with his own pick. But later Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the president was, in fact, considering Gordon for the job.

It’s still unclear who the White House is considering for the post. But as of Friday night, one thing was clear: Ratcliffe was out.

“I do not wish for a national security and intelligence debate surrounding my confirmation, however untrue, to become a purely political and partisan issue. The country we all love deserves that it be treated as an American issue,” Ratcliffe said in a tweet Friday. “I have asked the President to nominate someone other than me for this position.”

(Charles Rex Arbogast/AP)

A Republican senator held up the confirmation of a White House budget official this week in an attempt to obtain sensitive information about border wall contracts he has been trying to steer to a major donor, according to emails obtained by The Washington Post.

The emails show Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) blasting the “arrogance” of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after senior military officials told him the contracts contained sensitive, proprietary information provided by the companies that could not be shared.

In recent months, Cramer has touted his preferred construction firm, North Dakota-based Fisher Industries, and campaign finance records show the senator has received thousands of dollars in contributions from company chief executive Tommy Fisher and his family members.

Cramer put a temporary hold this week on the confirmation of Michael Wooten, a nominee for a senior post at the White House Office of Management and Budget. After Wooten was confirmed Thursday, Cramer lashed out at the Army Corps in private emails when he was told the contracting bids contain sensitive information.

“This is a woefully inadequate response and not what I was promised by the White House as a condition for releasing my hold on the confirmation of the nominee for the Federal Procurement Officer,” Cramer wrote, copying others at OMB, the White House and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

“The fact that you all claim secrecy without [citing] statute makes me very suspicious,” he wrote. “I have decided to stay in DC another day and would like to see General Semonite in my office tomorrow.”

Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the top official at the Army Corps, went to Cramer’s office Friday to provide the senator with a private briefing. Cramer’s office released a statement afterward, vowing to hold the military engineers “accountable.”

“We received an update on wall construction and the bidding process, as well as a number of documents and the answers to questions we requested from the Army Corps,” the statement said. “I believe we have their attention and are in a position to succeed.”

Trump has redirected $3.5 billion in Defense Department funds to the border project and promised to build 500 miles of barrier before the 2020 election. Cramer said the president has bestowed him with special responsibilities to oversee progress.

“President Trump deputized Senator Cramer to work with the Army Corps to ensure their process is fair, transparent, and delivers the best possible deal for the American people,” Cramer’s statement read.

[Trump tries to steer border wall contracts to North Dakota firm]

In an interview Friday with The Washington Post conducted via email, Cramer said he’d placed the hold on Wooten “to get the nominee to agree to reforming [the Army Corps] procurement process,” which the senator criticized for prioritizing technical specifications over cost. “If that doesn’t concern watchdogs nothing should,” Cramer wrote.

Tommy Fisher, president of Fisher Industries, has made repeated appearances in conservative media touting his multibillion-dollar plan, insisting he can build the wall faster and for less than his competitors. (The Washington Post)

He dismissed claims the contracts contained private information unavailable to someone with the stature of a U.S. senator.

“I can know where every submarine in the oceans are,” Cramer said in a separate email. “A simple non disclosure is sufficient for a member of Congress. The fact they won’t share it is concerning.”

“I don’t know what they are hiding,” he wrote.

An Army Corps spokesperson confirmed that Semonite met with Cramer on Friday but referred questions about the meeting to the senator’s office.

White House officials said they were aware Cramer had intervened to hold up Wooten’s nomination but they said they weren’t told about his connections to a specific company that has bid on border wall contracts.

Tommy Fisher and his wife gave at least $10,000 — the maximum allowable contribution — to Cramer in 2018 when he ran for Senate, records show. Fisher was Cramer’s guest at Trump’s State of the Union speech in February last year. The company chief executive said he shook Trump’s hand afterward. Fisher has also been a repeat guest on Fox News in recent months, where he has praised the border wall effort and promoted his firm.

Senior White House officials said they have been aware for several months that Cramer had expressed a personal interest in how these bids were being awarded. Cramer told a North Dakota radio station in May that he had personally raised concerns about the bidding process with Trump and that Trump had said, perhaps jokingly, “I deputize you” to deal with it.

The North Dakota senator has repeatedly promoted Fisher, and Trump too has joined the effort, pitching the company in meetings at the White House and aboard Air Force One that have troubled miliary commanders and Department of Homeland Security officials.

They say it is highly unusual for a president to intervene on behalf of a private company seeking billions in federal contracts, and one of the reasons the Army Corps has long managed the procurement process is the military’s reputation for integrity and rectitude.

Fisher Industries was hired by activist group We Build the Wall to install a span of steel bollard fencing this spring on private land west of El Paso. Former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon, Blackwater USA founder Erik Prince and immigration hard-liner Kris Kobach are among the board members of the group, which says it has raised $25 million through private donations.

For Fisher, the project has been a showcase for what it says are innovative techniques that install the steel fencing faster and cheaper than its competitors. Despite Cramer’s efforts to influence and the president’s endorsement, Fisher was not picked by the Army Corps in recent rounds of bidding.

Fisher sued the government in April, alleging improprieties with the Army Corps procurement process.

During previous bids, the Army Corps said the company’s design did not meet its requirements and lacked regulatory approvals. DHS officials also told the Army Corps in March that Fisher’s work on a barrier project in San Diego came in late and over budget.

Orioles fans escorted out of stadium after unveiling Trump reelection banner,https://www.foxnews.com,['Louis Casiano'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/oriole-fans-escorted-out-of-stadium-after-unveiling-trump-reelection-banner,"Several fans at a Baltimore Orioles game were escorted out of Camden Yards during Thursday's game against the Toronto Blue Jays after unveiling a large banner supporting President Trump's reelection.

The red, white and blue banner read ""Keep America Great!"" and ""Trump 2020."" It was rolled out in the eighth inning and was in full view for roughly 10 minutes before security came and had the fans take it down.

Fans chanted, ""Take it down,"" shouting at the men behind the banner, The Baltimore Sun reported.

Camden Yards has a policy on banners, according to the Orioles website. Banners may only be displayed before and after games and between innings.

“Banners are subject to confiscation if the content is commercial, political, and/or in bad taste according to the Orioles' discretion,"" the policy further states.

The banner issue arose with Trump still grappling with the backlash over comments he made about the city and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., whose district covers part of Baltimore. In a multiday tirade, Trump said the city was a “rodent infested mess” and a place where “no human being would want to live.”

Some critics saw the remarks as evidence of racism. Trump, in turn, has denied being a racist"" while standing by his criticisms.

Orioles team owner Peter Angelos is a prominent trial attorney and Democratic donor. In 2016, he gave more than $270,000 to a Super PAC to encourage former Vice President Joe Biden to make a White House bid, according to Business Insider.

Top State Department adviser fired over 'abusive' management style,https://www.politico.com,"['Nahal Toosi', 'Eliana Johnson']",08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/02/top-state-department-adviser-fired-1444894,"Kiron Skinner, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was fired this week over what some described as her ""abusive"" management style. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images foreign policy Top State Department adviser fired over 'abusive' management style Kiron Skinner, the director of the Policy Planning Staff, was told on Thursday that she was being dismissed.

A senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was fired this week over what officials described as her “abusive” management style, including making homophobic remarks and accusing people of having affairs, according to two people.

Kiron Skinner, the director of Policy Planning, was told Thursday that she was being dismissed, a Trump administration official said. A senior State Department official also confirmed the firing, saying that several members of Skinner’s staff had threatened to quit if she wasn’t removed.

Story Continued Below

Two other State Department officials said Skinner acted unprofessionally in multiple ways, including yelling in public spaces and using homophobic language. She retaliated against employees by kicking them out of their offices and even alleged that some people were having affairs, the two officials said.

“It was an abuse of authority,” one of them said.

Skinner did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday, but high-profile diplomats and academics issued statements of support on her behalf.

Former Secretary of State George Shultz described her as a “first-class scholar” who “adheres steadfastly to the principles of honesty and integrity.”

The historian Niall Ferguson said he was disappointed to hear of her departure and has “never known her to be anything but cool, calm and collected.”

One of the few prominent African American members of the Trump administration before leaving this week, Skinner is close to a number of conservative luminaries, such as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

She hails from an academic background, and was brought in to help the State Department think in long-term, strategic ways about foreign policy. But she’s also long had a reputation for having sharp elbows — many of her past associates, especially in academia, flat out refuse to talk about her.

Pompeo hired Skinner to head the Policy Planning Staff almost a year ago, describing her as “a national security powerhouse” and “a one-woman, strategic thinking tour de force” in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. “I’m confident that she will enhance our influence overseas, protect the American people, and promote our prosperity,” he said.

She succeeded Brian Hook, who now serves as the special envoy for Iran issues.

Under Hook and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Policy Planning was unusually active, participating in day-to-day policymaking and almost functioning as a mini-State Department. The set-up infuriated other bureaus in the department, who felt their ideas were ignored.

When Pompeo took as secretary of State, he decided that Policy Planning — also known as S/P in department lingo — should revert to its more traditional role of acting as an in-house think tank with long-term ideas and strategies.

Skinner appeared on board with that, and her staffers — some of whom she recruited from academia — spent much of their time churning out white papers and other documents on major geopolitical issues.

She kept a tight rein on the S/P crew, warning them in particular to avoid the media.

But, according to State Department officials, she also was such a poor manager that almost a third of the 20-plus member staff quit or moved to other positions during her time at the helm. Another five people recently threatened to leave if she wasn’t ousted, the officials said.

It’s unclear how much influence Skinner has on Pompeo, who is traveling in Asia this week.

The secretary of State has surrounded himself with several advisers, including well-respected career diplomats, who vie for his attention. There’s also Hook, several other special envoys who deal with specific hot-button issues, and Mary Kissel, a former Wall Street Journal opinion writer who advises Pompeo on policy and messaging.

Skinner was recently tasked with coordinating the work of a special panel Pompeo established to re-examine the basics of human rights policy. The panel, called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, has drawn fierce criticism from human rights activists who fear its aims are to undercut gains made by women and LGBTQ people.

A second Trump administration official who knows Skinner told POLITICO earlier this year that Skinner “believes very strongly in what [President Donald Trump] is trying to do on foreign policy — a resource-constrained, realist approach to the world.”

Skinner is particularly interested in China. Earlier this year, she drew public criticism after describing China as a civilizational threat to the United States, and claiming — erroneously — that it was the first non-Caucasian challenger.

Critics decried her framing of the Chinese challenge as unhelpful, while noting that Japan was once a major competitor to the West. Supporters insist she merely had a rare stumble in her speaking, pointing out that she’s known for being especially erudite, including in the classroom.

“She engages incredibly well. She cares about her students,” said Ken Weinstein, president of the Hudson Institute, who met Skinner while in graduate school at Harvard University.

Weinstein, in an interview several weeks ago, said Skinner stood out at Harvard for more than just her ethnic background and political views.

“She’s also been someone who’s always argued that our elites are too self-referential, too small — she’s always made the case for diversity,” Weinstein said.

According to her bio page at Carnegie Mellon University, where she's long held a post, Skinner earned graduate degrees from Harvard and undergraduate degrees from Spelman College and Sacramento City College.

She gained celebrity status in conservative circles early on in her academic career for her books on Ronald Reagan. One in particular, “Reagan: In His Own Hand,” was based on handwritten notes of the former president that Skinner found during archival research.

The book gave voice to those who have long argued that Reagan had a far more active, intellectual mind — one that grappled with a range of domestic and foreign policies — than he’s given credit for.

One of Skinner’s supporters has been Kay Coles James, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. The two became close friends years ago after James saw Skinner interviewed on C-SPAN and reached out to her.

James said in an interview earlier this year that Skinner is a “workaholic” and that “nothing excites her more than research, writing and speaking.” James waved off Skinner’s reputation as headstrong and sharp-elbowed.

“As a fellow African American female conservative Republican that’s sort of an occupational hazard,” James said at the time. “When a male does exactly the same thing it’s viewed as someone who stands his ground. We are viewed as witches with capital Bs.”

On Friday, after learning of Skinner's firing, James said in a statement that her friend ""has a bright future ahead of her.""

""Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time I’ve seen what happened to Dr. Skinner play out in Washington. I’ve only known her to be of the highest character,"" James said in the statement. ""Our country is better off because of her tireless work on behalf of America."""
Homeland Security's Civil Rights Unit Lacks Power To Protect Migrant Kids,https://www.npr.org,"['Alison Kodjak', 'Susan Ferriss', 'Joshua Phillips']",08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/08/02/746982152/homeland-securitys-civil-rights-unit-lacks-power-to-protect-migrant-kids,"Homeland Security's Civil Rights Unit Lacks Power To Protect Migrant Kids

The children's lawyer was incensed. Her two tiny clients — one of them blind — had been in a shelter for three months, separated from their mother.

The family had traveled from Mexico to the United States, reaching Nogales, Arizona, on March 1, 2018. Officials at the border found that the mother, Nadia Pulido, had ""credible"" reasons for seeking asylum from an ex-partner who, she says, beat her and stalked her after their relationship ended.

But U.S. Customs and Border Protection still sent Pulido into an adult detention center run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She had an hour to say goodbye and try to assure her blind daughter, 6, and sobbing 3-year-old son that she'd see them in a couple of hours.

""A couple of hours turned into months. Painful months,"" Pulido recalled in an interview.

To help the children, pro bono attorney Maite Garcia turned to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. She filed a complaint with the office on June 7 of last year, explaining that Pulido's daughter was ""completely blind and requires assistance for daily living"" and would be better off with her stepfather, a U.S. citizen.

Nearly two weeks went by before the civil rights office replied.

""The issues you raise are very important to us,"" CRCL finally said in its emailed response. Then came a disclaimer: ""Please be advised that our complaint process does not provide individuals with legal rights or remedies. ... Instead, we use complaints like yours to find and address problems in DHS policy and its implementation.""

That was the last Garcia heard from the nearly 100-person office in Washington, D.C.

The tepid response from the department's civil rights office bolsters objections — not least from former staff — that the DHS watchdog is failing to stop rights abuses as they're happening inside a detention system that's expanding rapidly under the Trump administration.

The ineffectual handling of individual complaints adds to criticism that DHS leaders no longer heed recommendations from the agency's own civil rights experts.

""Put yourself in the shoes of the person who's sitting in the cell or who's separated from their parent or who's wondering where their child is,"" former CRCL staff attorney and adviser Ellen Gallagher said.

A recent whistleblower, Gallagher has accused the civil rights office of failing to investigate multiple individual complaints alleging unjustified solitary confinement of detainees in ICE custody. Gallagher is now with DHS' Office of Inspector General, a separate internal watchdog specializing in issuing reports after lengthy investigations.

""It seems to mislead the public, to invite complaints involving specific information about the individual or the family and the alleged violation, if Civil Rights and Civil Liberties had no intention of specifically investigating or resolving those individual complaints,"" Gallagher said.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has insisted that DHS has ""layers of oversight"" to correct abuses. ""We have good supervisory oversight, and we hold people accountable,"" he said during a July 9 interview on CNN in response to questions about filthy conditions in CBP holding facilities.

Gallagher's impression, however, is that the civil rights office ""was actually fairly intimidated by ICE and CBP and did not want to engage in activity that might offend either. That is an odd and even disturbing posture for an oversight authority.""

Internal CRCL log: a flood of complaints

Some CRCL staff members say that individual employees contact CBP or ICE to try to informally resolve civil rights complaints. But they can only advise agencies, they say, because their office isn't set up to halt abuses as they happen.

Cameron Quinn, chief of the civil rights office and an appointee of President Trump, declined a request for an interview. Another CRCL official responded in writing to questions, asking not to be quoted by name.

""CRCL does not have authority to remedy individual complaints but instead focuses on systemic issues"" at DHS, the official wrote. The office does have authority, however, to seek ""remedies"" for people facing disability discrimination, the official said, declining to elaborate.

""With regard to family separations,"" the official said, ""CRCL investigated the issue from a policy and process standpoint."" The civil rights office then sent its recommendations to ICE and Customs and Border Protection in a memo. CRCL declined to release the memo, calling it a ""deliberative"" document.

CRCL, the official added, still has ""open investigations"" into the separations of children under age 5, the separations of children with disabilities and standards for separating families based on parental criminal history.

The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties was created along with the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. The office's mission is to advise the powerful federal department and prevent civil rights violations such as the post-Sept. 11 roundups of Muslims without due process. But some insiders say CRCL has always lacked teeth.

Last year, the civil rights office proved especially weak as complaints about due process concerns and family separations began pouring in — nearly 850 in the first half of 2018 alone, logged into a CRCL database. An independent journalist obtained a copy through a Freedom of Information Act request and then shared it with the Center for Public Integrity and NPR.

The complaints referenced more than 380 separated children 10 years old or younger, of which more than 120 children were age 5 or younger.

More than 140 complaints arrived before the Trump administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy on April 6, 2018. More than 160 cases of separation referenced in the log were carried out before that date. The zero-tolerance policy required separating families so that CBP could hold all adults for prosecution, even for a first-time misdemeanor illegal entry.

Former and current staff in the civil rights office say their colleagues were so upset by allegations in the complaints that they openly wept at desks as they reviewed the cases.

By May of last year, senior staff in the office had urged Quinn, in an internal memo, to challenge the separations. ""CRCL should express great concern over our exclusion from these critical decisions,"" which CRCL has the authority to review, the memo said. ""Deliberately harming children to deter parental behavior would require an exceedingly strong justification to pass muster as a reasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, among other concerns.""

Lawyer and former CRCL senior adviser Scott Shuchart, who resigned from the office last year, said his and other advisers' concerns were ""blown off"" by CBP and other DHS leadership in meetings.

One complaint to CRCL in January 2018 reported that CBP separated a 4-month-old infant from a Mexican father who had prior immigration violations but feared being sent back to Mexico.

Another reported that an 8-year-old said CBP officers ""kicked him and/or hit him with a shoe"" to wake him. Dozens of other complaints described children upset about their parents' uncertain whereabouts and abrupt disappearance — including a 14-year-old in CBP custody who said he was separated after a meal break and was then ""told by officers that his father would be deported.""

About 95% of all complaints logged came from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, a unit within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that's responsible for migrant-children shelters.

Former senior staff in this federal resettlement office say the volume of complaints is unprecedented. Robert Carey, ORR director during the final two years of Barack Obama's presidency, said he thinks ORR employees were trying to stop separations by filing complaints.

""You probably have a deeply traumatized, possibly hysterical child that you're trying to care for,"" Carey said. ""I'm guessing some of those cases would require ... the intervention of a therapist, particularly if you're talking about, in some instances, young children.""

HHS officials declined to make leaders in its Office of Refugee Resettlement available for an interview.

Most other complaints came from nonprofit legal aid groups — including 18 filed by the Phoenix-based Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, where Maite Garcia works.

The complaint about Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son appears on page 276 of CRCL's 366-page document.

Another Florence complaint filed on June 14 of last year appears on page 321. It raises objections to CBP's separation of a Guatemalan mother from her 17-year-old son — who is unable to hear or speak — without regard for his disability. The boy could have qualified to be ""paroled"" into the U.S., a conditional form of humanitarian release. But that never happened — and the case shows how a formal complaint can wither in the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Deaf boy's mom taken away

The story of the mother and her deaf son ""exhibits the cruelty, the chaos"" of how migrants are treated, said Elizabeth Jordan, an attorney with Denver's Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center. She represented the mother while the woman was in ICE lockup in Colorado.

On April 25 of last year, the mother and her 17-year-old deaf son approached CBP officers after crossing the Arizona border and asked to apply for asylum.

The boy and his mother now live in Florida, where they are in the process of applying for asylum. In an interview, the mother, who asked that her name not be disclosed, said she'd worked previously in the state, sending money to Guatemala to rent a room for her son and pay his tuition at a school for the deaf there. She eventually returned to Guatemala to care for her son and her own frail mother.

Three months after she got there, her mother died, and her deaf son lost his primary caregiver. He'd long been bullied in Guatemala, and thieves had robbed him at gunpoint. Mother and son both set out for the United States some months later.

""I don't do this for me. I do it for him,"" she said, ""because I'm not going to be alive for all of his life.""

After Customs and Border Protection took her and her son into custody near San Luis, Ariz., the mother said, officers ignored her pleas to keep them together rather than place them in cages segregated by age and gender. Her son, she told the officers, needed her to interpret. When she protested further that her son was mute, she said an officer answered, ""He won't need to do much talking where he's going.""

At some point, while her son was asleep, guards took her out of her cage, the mother said, and transported her to an ICE detention center pending prosecution. She said she was told ""you have to pay for what you did"" because she'd been turned away at the border the year before. She was sentenced to 30 days in an Arizona jail for reentry and then transferred to an ICE detention center in Colorado, pending deportation.

Meanwhile, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had sent her son on a long bus ride to an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter in Arizona, where his only means of communication was drawing pictures.

For more than a month, the mother pleaded in vain with detention guards, first in Arizona and then in Colorado, to arrange a video call so she could at least see and sign with her son. Medical records from the boy's time in the shelter indicate he was distraught: He struck his head against walls and cut himself with a paper clip. In an interview in Florida, interpreted by his mother, he said that to prevent him from getting out of bed one night, he was physically restrained.

""She was profoundly distressed and so worried about him,"" lawyer Jordan said of the mother. ""This is a person who has devoted her life to keeping him safe and getting the best she can for him. And then, for her to be totally unable to check in on him for weeks ...""

A round of emails between the boy's attorneys and DHS' civil rights office ultimately went nowhere.

Initially, a CRCL adviser seemed to be working on the Florence project's June 2018 complaint, arguing that the deaf boy merited humanitarian parole and that for two months the shelter hadn't ""provided him with the appropriate accommodations"" for his disability. The adviser wrote that the civil rights office was ""reviewing your concerns""; he asked for proof the boy was deaf.

In July 2018, one of the boy's lawyers emailed CRCL to write that when CBP held the boy in custody, he ""was able to understand that the agents were mocking him"" because they didn't believe he was deaf.

The lawyer further argued that CBP, ICE and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency in charge of shelters, were all in violation of disability rights because they had failed to arrange a video call between the boy and his mother.

The official from the civil rights office then replied that he was ""unable to look into [the boy's] ongoing concerns"" because the teenager had been transferred by CPB, which is within DHS' jurisdiction, to ORR, which is not.

Instead, he suggested, the civil rights office could investigate the mother's concerns because she was in ICE custody, which, like CBP and CRCL, falls under DHS. The boy's attorneys gave the civil rights official contact information for Jordan, the mother's Colorado lawyer.

By that time, Jordan had already been emailing local ICE officials repeated pleas to set up a video call. The call finally happened — nearly three months after U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers had separated the mother and her son. But it wasn't because of action by DHS' civil rights office, Jordan said. It was because DHS was by then under court order to put separated migrant family members in touch with one another by phone and then reunite them.

""In my interactions with individual CRCL officers,"" Jordan said, ""I don't get the sense that they're out to lunch or bad people. I think that they just ultimately can't get much done. I think it comes from being really hamstrung by the fact that they have to work with ICE and get ICE to concur in their recommendations and actually make changes.""

In the children's interest

Although Trump ended his zero-tolerance policy in June 2018 after a public outcry, U.S. border agents have continued to separate families due to parents' criminal records, even for minor offenses, or because of prior deportations.

Immigrant rights groups have long pressed DHS to consider the children's interests, and they've noted that family separation ""causes great harm, disrupting emotional and psychological well-being.""

For failed asylum-seeker Nadia Pulido, the groups' pressure came too late.

Pulido was born in Mexico but is a fluent English-speaker who arrived in California as an undocumented child and was raised by relatives. She could have qualified for a special visa for abandoned children, but no one sought such a visa on her behalf. When she was ""literally just young, stupid and hanging around the wrong crowd,"" she said, she was convicted of robbery and deported.

Because of that history, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and ICE chose to send her children to a shelter and keep her in detention last year while her asylum case went forward.

ICE could have released her on humanitarian parole. Instead, she was held in detention for eight months, until she lost her asylum bid. She could have appealed, but that would have meant more detention — and more time apart from her young children. In the end, Pulido agreed to be deported to Mexico.

After four months in a shelter, Pulido's blind daughter and toddler son were finally released to her husband, a U.S. citizen. Attorneys for the children and Pulido believe a federal lawsuit that led to a court order unifying migrant families was likely a factor. And they doubt their complaint to DHS' civil rights office did anything to hasten the children's release.

In Mexico, where the kids have now joined her, Pulido said she's still scared. To support her need for refuge, she presented Mexican police reports about incidents involving her ex-partner; and in her asylum application, she wrote that he assaulted her while she was pregnant and held a gun to her head.

""We were leaving Mexico to seek help in the United States,"" she said, ""to stay free of danger.""

Jonathan Ernst | Reuters

The nearly two-year special counsel investigation of Russian election interference led by Robert Mueller cost nearly $32 million in total, a new filing shows. The expenditures report, shared with CNBC by the Department of Justice on Friday, covers the final eight months of the probe, in which the special counsel spent about $6.56 million. About $4.12 million of that was spent through the special counsel's office directly, and $2.44 million came from DOJ components that supported Mueller's office. The first 16 months of the probe cost $25.2 million in total.

The special counsel's fourth and final spending report took significantly longer to disclose than prior filings, and arrived weeks after Justice Department officials expected it to be made public. But even in its absence, political leaders including President Donald Trump and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., have made the cost of the investigation a focal point of their arguments for or against it. Trump, without providing evidence, has asserted since at least November of last year that the investigation cost more than $40 million. But Democrats have countered that the millions of dollars estimated to be forfeited from individuals found guilty through the probe — such as Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort — effectively zeroed out the costs. ""You secured the convictions of President Trump's campaign chairman, his deputy campaign manager, his national security advisor, and his personal lawyer, among others,"" Nadler said at the start of Mueller's historic testimony before the House Judiciary Committee last week. ""In the Paul Manafort case alone, you recovered as much as $42 million, so that the cost of your investigation to the taxpayers approaches zero."""
A History of Racism Is Woven into the US Presidency,https://www.snopes.com,['Associated Press'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/08/02/a-history-of-racism-is-woven-into-the-us-presidency/,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — When President Donald Trump drew widespread condemnation for describing a majority-black congressional district as a “rat and rodent infested mess” and for tweets targeting four Democratic congresswomen of color, it was not the first time a U.S. president attracted such attention.

Throughout American history, presidents have uttered comments, issued decisions and made public and private moves that critics said were racist, either at the time or in later generations. The presidents did so both before taking office and during their time in the White House.

Many of the early presidents, George Washington to Zachary Taylor, owned black slaves and held power when African Americans, Native Americans and Latinos did not have the right to vote or serve on juries and could be refused service in public accommodations. They often repeated racist views that were commonly held in their times, even when challenged by scholars or civil rights leaders.

Before he became the nation’s third president, Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence that “all men are created equal.” But in his only book, “Notes on the State of Virginia,” published in 1785, the future president expressed a series of beliefs about African Americans that would be seen today as racist.

He wrote that blacks were cursed with “a very strong and disagreeable odor” and were incapable of producing art and poetry. And though he said he believed slavery was immoral, he owned slaves and, historians say, carried on a sexual relationship with at least one of them, Sally Hemings. If every black slave were ever freed, he wrote, they should be deported since he believed blacks and whites could not live together peacefully.

Andrew Jackson, the nation’s seventh president, was also a slaveholder from the South. Before he became president, he offered in an 1804 advertisement $50 for the return of a runaway slave and $10 extra “for every hundred lashes any person will give him, to the amount of 300.” In Jon Meacham’s 2008 book “American Lion: Andrew Jackson and the White House,” Meacham wrote that Jackson owned around 150 slaves and freed none of them in his will.

As president, Jackson allowed his postmaster general to let Southerners seize anti-slavery publications, in direct violation of the First Amendment. He called the abolitionist pamphlets urging black equality “unconstitutional and wicked.”

Jackson is widely vilified today among Native Americans for his role in forcibly removing indigenous people from their land, especially for the Trail of Tears. The removal of the Cherokee people from Georgia led to thousands of deaths.

“The philanthropist will rejoice that the remnant of that ill-fated race has been at length placed beyond the reach of injury or oppression,” Jackson said in his farewell address.

The Virginia-born Woodrow Wilson worked to keep blacks out of Princeton University while serving as that school’s president. When he became president of the U.S., the Democrat refused to reverse the segregation of civil service, though he had won the White House with the support of some African American men.

In 1915, Wilson sparked outrage by screening the racist film “The Birth of a Nation” at the White House. The silent movie was the retelling of Reconstruction through the eyes of the Ku Klux Klan. The movie portrayed the KKK as heroes and African Americans as uncivilized.

“No explanation or apology followed” after the screening, Patty O’Toole wrote in “The Moralist: Woodrow Wilson and the World He Made.”

Wilson appeared oblivious during the “Red Summer” of 1919 — a time when communities across the country saw white mobs attack African Americans, resulting in hundreds of deaths. He spoke out against lynching but did not use the federal government’s resources to stop the violence.

Democrat Lyndon Johnson assumed the presidency in 1963 after the assassination of John F. Kennedy and sought to push a civil rights bill amid demonstrations by African Americans. Johnson famously convinced skeptical lawmakers to support the measure and gave a passionate speech about his days as a teacher in Mexican American schools to urge Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act.

But according to tapes of his private conversations, Johnson routinely used racist epithets to describe African Americans and some blacks he appointed to key positions.

His successor, Republican Richard Nixon, also regularly used racist epithets while in office in private conversations.

“We’re going to (place) more of these little Negro bastards on the welfare rolls at $2,400 a family,” Nixon once said about what he saw as lax work requirements. Nixon also made derogatory remarks about Jews, Mexican Americans, Italian Americans and Irish Americans.

As with Johnson, many of Nixon’s remarks were unknown to the general public until tapes of White House conversations were released decades later.

Recently the Nixon Presidential Library released an October 1971 phone conversation between Nixon and then California Gov. Ronald Reagan, another future president, The Atlantic reported Tuesday. Reagan in venting his frustration with United Nations delegates who voted against the U.S. dropped some racist language.

“Last night, I tell you, to watch that thing on television as I did,” Reagan said. “To see those, those monkeys from those African countries — damn them, they’re still uncomfortable wearing shoes.”

Nixon began laughing hard.

Reagan would launch his 1980 general election presidential campaign in Mississippi’s Neshoba County — a place where three civil rights activists were murdered in 1964.

Reagan ignored the criticism of his visit and told a cheering crowd of white supporters, “I believe in states’ rights.”"
Rick Gates will finally be sentenced -- but not before he testifies about Trump campaign in 2016,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/02/politics/rick-gates-testimony-mueller-investigation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Rick Gates, one of the most significant cooperators of the Mueller investigation, is poised to testify publicly against two of his former associates and potentially speak about the Trump campaign's interest in WikiLeaks and the Russian hack of the Democrats in 2016 before he is sentenced in the coming months.

Prosecutors and Gates' defense team filed a notice with the federal court in Washington Thursday night that Gates will be ready for sentencing about two years after his indictment.

The notice is the surest sign yet that federal authorities have wrapped major investigatory matters related to the 2016 Trump campaign.

But first, the former Trump deputy campaign chairman may have revealing details to share during the trial of Trump adviser Roger Stone in November.

Gates is also expected to be a witness in the upcoming trials of former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig and New York State's case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

The delay of Gates' sentencing since his October 2017 indictment had long been an indication that investigations into the Trump political operation and Russian-Ukrainian influence in American politics continued. The end of his cooperation is a milestone of sorts -- that the last remaining defendant who was helping former special counsel Robert Mueller and related prosecutions has wrapped.

(Former national security adviser Michael Flynn also has not yet been sentenced, but prosecutors are no longer using him as a cooperator.)

On the stand

Gates could reveal at Stone's upcoming trial some of the most tantalizing still-secret information Mueller found about the President.

According to the Mueller Report, Gates told the special counsel what Trump himself had said during the 2016 campaign related to WikiLeaks and Russian hacking.

""Gates recalled Trump being generally frustrated that the Clinton emails had not been found,"" Mueller wrote in a heavily redacted section of the report about the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks' dissemination of Democratic emails that had been hacked by the Russians.

Gates' efforts appeared to include Trump directly.

""According to Gates, by the late summer of 2016, the Trump campaign was planning a press strategy, a communications campaign, and messaging based on the possible release of Clinton emails by WikiLeaks,"" the Mueller report says.

The Justice Department then redacted two lines of the Mueller report, except for the words ""while Trump and Gates were driving to LaGuardia Airport.""

There's another redaction of half a line of text, before Mueller writes: ""Shortly after the call candidate Trump told Gates that more releases of damaging information would be coming.""

Stone has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying, obstruction and witness tampering related his efforts to reach WikiLeaks during 2016.

A star witness

Gates was a top official on both the Trump campaign and during the inauguration, and became perhaps Mueller's most important cooperator as the special counsel's office looked into Russian influence in Trump's operation. He'll likely be a star witness at all trials where he will testify.

Gates already was a key witness in Manafort's federal criminal trial for financial crimes last summer, telling the story of how his former boss orchestrated a payments system to hide their Ukrainian lobbying income from US authorities for years.

""I'm here to tell the truth. ... Mr. Manafort had the same path. I'm here,"" Gates told the jury last July.

Manafort and Gates had been indicted at the same time before Gates flipped. Manafort was convicted at the trial and later pleaded guilty. Manafort was sentenced to a total of about seven years in prison in March. He still faces the New York state fraud case and has pleaded not guilty there.

Gates is also lined up to take the stand later this month at the federal trial of Craig, the former Obama White House counsel. Craig's case, about his alleged unregistered lobbying work for Ukraine alongside Manafort, was spun off from the Mueller investigation. Craig, who became a lawyer at a large law firm following his work in the Obama administration, has pleaded not guilty and the trial is set to start August 12.

End of cooperation

The prosecutors and defense team's joint filing Thursday on Gates asked for the court to commission a report from the probation office that all criminal defendants receive before sentencing. That report is due November 15, Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Friday. This type of report is kept private and is used by judges as a sentencing guide.

The deadline makes it possible for him to be sentenced in the weeks after that. No sentencing date has been set yet.

""Because the defendant has been cooperating for an extended period of time, and because of the defendant's personal matters ... the defendant wishes to be sentenced as soon as possible after the completion of his cooperation with the United States,"" the filing said.

The filing did not describe the ""personal matters"" publicly, though the judge is aware of them through sealed information given to the court, the filing said.

Though initially charged with dozens of financial crimes alongside Manafort in October 2017, Gates pleaded guilty to two counts in Mueller's investigation, conspiracy and making a false statement to investigators.

At first following his indictment Gates was under house arrest, grew a beard and made appeals to the public for financial help with his legal defense. But following his plea, Gates' whereabouts went under the radar, as he stood by his pledge to help investigators and gained more ability to travel while awaiting sentencing.

A judge placed a gag order on him and his lawyers early in their proceedings, so Gates' public statements about what he was doing for Mueller and other investigators have been scarce.

Gates' stunning reversal to help Mueller in February 2018 led to intense speculation about his usefulness in building a bigger case in the Russian conspiracy investigation or against other parts of the Trump operation.

In a previous update to the court, Gates' team said his visits with federal investigators for cooperation interviews were ""numerous."""

Urgent care services are now offered to veterans through Veteran Affairs urgent care clinics.

The program, which started June 6, offers services to those suffering from the flu, minor burns or skin infections at locations like MedExpress, UPMC Urgent Care and MinuteClinic, located inside CVS stores.

Retail locations include a walk-in health clinic within a retail business. These locations can help treat uncomplicated illnesses like a sore throat or earache. At urgent locations, officials can diagnose or treat illnesses or injury for people seeking immediate medical attention for non life-threatening illnesses or injuries.

“The new urgent care benefit is not a substitute for emergency care for life-threatening conditions,” Dr. Ali Sonel, VA Pittsburgh chief of staff, said in a news release. “Veterans experiencing a medical emergency should call 911 or visit their nearest emergency department.”

In order to receive the benefits, veterans must have received health care services from the VA in the last 24 months. Veterans may be required to pay a $30 copay. Those wanting to stay with VA providers can call 412-822-2222 for in-person or video appointments.

DOJ will not prosecute Comey for leaking memos after IG referral: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-will-not-prosecute-comey-for-leaking-memos-after-ig-referral-source,"The Justice Department has decided against prosecuting former FBI Director James Comey for leaking classified information following a referral from the department’s inspector general, sources familiar with the deliberations told Fox News.

“Everyone at the DOJ involved in the decision said it wasn’t a close call,” one official said. “They all thought this could not be prosecuted.”

COMEY HEARING: EX-FBI DIRECTOR SAYS HE LEAKED MEMO TO SPUR SPECIAL COUNSEL APPOINTMENT

Comey penned memos memorializing his interactions with President Trump in the days leading up to his firing. He then passed those documents to a friend, Columbia University Law Professor Daniel Richman, who gave them to The New York Times. Comey admitted to that arrangement during congressional testimony.

After the fact, the FBI classified two of those memos as “confidential.”

DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz had referred Comey for potential prosecution as part of an internal review.

But one of the key factors leading to the DOJ declining to prosecute apparently was the fact that the two memos were labeled “confidential” after he set in motion the chain of events that led to them ending up with the press.

Richman, now serving as an attorney to Comey, told Fox News he had ""no comment"" on the prosecutorial decision on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Fox News has learned that the release of Horowitz’s report is “imminent,” according to another source familiar with the investigation.

The report related to Comey’s leaks is separate from Horowitz’s review of alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses. That report’s release is delayed, according to sources, due to the potential components of Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham’s investigation into alleged improper government surveillance.

Horowitz publicly confirmed last year that his office was investigating Comey for his handling of classified information as part of memos he shared documenting his discussions with the president.

In June 2018, during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Horowitz said he “received a referral on that from the FBI,” and was “handling that referral.”

IG CONFIRMS COMEY UNDER INVESTIGATION OVER MEMO HANDLING

“We will issue a report when the matter is complete and consistent with the law and rules,” Horowitz said at the time.

Comey last year also confirmed to Fox News that the inspector general’s office had interviewed him with regard to memos, but downplayed the questions over classified information as “frivolous”—saying the real issue was whether he complied with internal policies.

Fox News learned last year that Horowitz was looking at whether classified information was given to unauthorized sources as part of a broader review of Comey’s communications outside the bureau—including media contact.

Comey, whom Trump fired in May 2017, denied that sharing the memos with his legal team constituted a leak of classified information. Instead, he compared the process to keeping “a diary.”

“I didn’t consider it part of an FBI file,” Comey told Fox News' Bret Baier last year. “It was my personal aide-memoire…I always thought of it as mine.”

In his testimony in June 2017 before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey said he made the decision to document the interactions with the president in a way that would not trigger security classification.

COMEY SAYS DOJ WATCHDOG INTERVIEWED HIM OVER HANDLING OF MEMOS

But in seven Comey memos handed over to Congress in April 2018, eight of the 15 pages had redactions under classified exceptions.

Comey, during his June 2017 testimony, said he deliberately leaked a memo from a key meeting with Trump to a friend after he was fired in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel.

“I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter—I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel,” Comey testified.

“I was worried that the media was camping at the end of my driveway, my wife and I were going away,” Comey said. “I was worried it would be like feeding seagulls at the beach if it was I who gave it to the media, so I asked my friend to.”

The New York Times published the report with Comey’s memos on May 16, 2017, revealing the contents of the memo which said the president asked him to shut down the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn in an Oval Office meeting.

Homeland Security makes the right moves to bolster our cybersecurity,https://thehill.com,[],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/455961-homeland-security-makes-the-right-moves-to-bolster-our-cybersecurity,"If there is one thing that was learned from the 2016 presidential election, it is that protecting our election infrastructure cannot be only a passive decision. There is a need to be proactively assessing our environment to ensure that we are implementing the cybersecurity features that fortify our systems and, ultimately, our American democracy. This is where the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency comes into full play.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was inaugurated in 2018 as a component within the Department of Homeland Security. Its primary objectives are to lead cybersecurity efforts across the federal government and to work with the critical infrastructure community to help protect their networks. But it was not conceptualized solely on the basis of Russian interference. The evolving concerns that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency plans to prioritize as it is now entering its second year include supply chain, 5G networks, and election security.

Standing up the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency last fall, an effort that was started by the Obama administration but realized by President Trump Donald John TrumpKentucky miners' struggle is that of many working Americans Cummings releases statement on attempted break-in after Trump attacks PhRMA top lobbyist to leave post MORE, has signaled cybersecurity as a priority deserving of greater resources. Top Department of Homeland Security officials had been championing the decision, advocating that the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was necessary for streamlining its goals. It is able to act more independently, like how the Federal Emergency Management Agency operates, so barriers to decision making are eliminated, and responses are more efficient and successful.

Under the leadership of Chris Krebs, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has initiated a solid roadmap outlining how it will fully mature its capabilities over the next two years. While it may appear to be acting similarly to an intelligence agency through its information sharing efforts, there is a major distinction in that it will operate transparently. This is a huge win for all its civilian, private sector, and government partners navigating the complex cybersecurity landscape.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency understands that a majority of our cybersecurity infrastructure resides in the private sector and is committed to taking actions to counter threats that extend beyond government systems. This means it will work closely with cybersecurity infrastructure entities to understand what they themselves perceive to be the greatest risks to their systems. This not only improves the efficacy of solutions, but it helps achieve buy in, which greatly strengthens efforts.

Still, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency exhibits both form and function. There are new emerging cyberthreats that are rapidly changing and advancing, including the durability of the supply chain. Cybercriminals and foreign adversaries have demonstrated the ability to exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain, gaining access to sensitive data. These perpetrators are acting strategically to disrupt our systems, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is expected to exercise collective defense to manage these risks and share actionable intelligence with important network defenders positioned to act on it.

One resource that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency now relies on is its Information and Communication Technologies Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force that is comprised of federal partners and dozens of the largest companies in the information technology and communications sectors. Its participants are crafting strong proposals to manage several weaknesses in the international technology supply chain.

It comes as no surprise that another focal point is 5G. However, with the advantages of 5G come the downsides, as there are greater opportunities for our adversaries such as China to gain access to our networks and for insecure technology to gain outsized market share. To defend against all these new threats, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency coordinates with the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, the Federal Communications Commission, and the White House. This is necessary to determine risk mitigation strategies, such as mandating all 5G technology be interoperable, or banning some providers like Huawei.

But what about election security? Was that not the driving force in establishing the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency? It is indeed working to expand upon the relationships with state and local election officials and voting machine vendors that emerged from the 2018 midterm elections. The Department of Homeland Security now finally recognizes elections as part of our cybersecurity infrastructure, and so engagements with these partners has been paramount to understanding how they operate. Collaboration between state and local election officials and the federal government is a major factor in incentivizing the patching of election systems and helping the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency achieve its goal of 100 percent auditability by 2020.

The Department of Homeland Security is a proven government leader by launching the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to focus on emerging cyberthreats. With this leadership comes the responsibility to integrate and coordinate with the private sector to ensure secure and sustainable partnerships. Connecting these entities will inform decision making and provide pathways for innovation and intelligence sharing.

Defense secretary to review $10 billion cloud computing deal,https://www.cnn.com,"['Michael Warren', 'Alex Rogers']",08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/politics/esper-pentagon-cloud-contract/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Pentagon said on Thursday that a highly sought-after cloud computing contract will not be awarded until Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has completed his examination of it.

The $10 billion, 10-year contract, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), has come under recent scrutiny from President Donald Trump, who has expressed concerns over the fairness of what has been a contentious bidding process among a handful of large tech companies.

Amazon has been widely seen as the front-runner to win the contract. Microsoft is the other finalist. The contract could be awarded as early as August 23.

The announcement from the Pentagon comes less than a week after CNN exclusively reported that Trump had seen and been briefed on a document alleging a large conspiracy to award Amazon the contract. The one-page document was produced by an executive at Oracle, which had also competed for the contract. It's unclear how the document made it to the White House.

The document contains a flow chart titled ""A Conspiracy to Create a Ten Year DoD Cloud Monopoly,"" and provides a visual representation of a narrative that Oracle has been pushing for months -- that a web of individuals inside and outside the Defense Department were greasing the wheels for Amazon to win the contract.

The JEDI contract has been the subject of an intense lobbying effort by Oracle, which has been trying to scuttle Amazon's bid for months. Oracle's own bid did not make it to the final stage . The company also launched a failed legal challenge of Amazon's bid.

While it's unclear how Oracle's document made it to the White House, it seems to have played into the President's well-known animosity toward the online retail giant and its founder, Jeff Bezos.

Thursday's announcement raises questions about whether there is now political influence on a bidding process that up until now the Pentagon has insisted has followed all proper protocols.

Many of the implied and explicit allegations involving Amazon have been addressed by an internal Pentagon investigation or in Oracle's lawsuit in federal court. Neither have determined them to be problematic.

In recent weeks, the President has indicated he has concerns over the JEDI contract, and that the administration will be reviewing the matter. The decision to revisit the contract, however, ultimately lies with Esper, the newly-confirmed secretary of defense.

When asked by a reporter about the contract during a July 18 appearance in the Oval Office with the prime minister of the Netherlands, Trump said, he'd been getting ""tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon,"" including from Microsoft, Oracle and IBM.

""Great companies are complaining about it,"" Trump said . ""So we're going to take a look at it. We'll take a very strong look at it.""

On July 22, Trump retweeted a Fox News segment criticizing the JEDI contract as ""The Bezos Bailout."" It's not clear if the President had already seen the Oracle document by then.

Days after Trump's public statements, Esper also mentioned reexamining the contract. ""I've heard from everybody about JEDI Cloud, that's one of the things I'm going to take a hard look at,"" Esper told reporters at the Pentagon on July 24.

Recently, some Republicans on Capitol Hill have also been lobbying the Pentagon and the White House to revisit the contract, pushing forward similar questions raised by Oracle about the contract's fairness.

Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Marco Rubio of Florida have written separate letters to the Pentagon raising concerns about moving ahead with the contract. Trump even discussed JEDI with Johnson on an Air Force One flight to Wisconsin in July, according to the senator's office.

Trump also called Rubio last month to share his concerns about the contract, according to a Rubio spokesperson. Trump gave the indication that he may get involved in preventing the awarding of the contract if necessary.

In a statement Thursday, Rubio said he was ""pleased"" that Esper is reviewing the contract. A Rubio spokesperson tells CNN the Florida senator's staff worked with the defense secretary's office on the issue before the announcement.

On July 23, a dozen Republican House lawmakers sent Trump a letter urging him to delay awarding the JEDI contract. The letter states that awarding the contract would be ""premature"" because the Pentagon's Office of Inspector General ""is still investigating potential conflicts of interest by DoD employees in awarding the JEDI contract.""

Womack told CNN last week he had questions about whether there were conflicts of interest involving Amazon and the Pentagon.

""Given the many shortcomings of the JEDI procurement process, I fully support Secretary Esper's decision to review the program,"" Womack said in a statement Thursday.

But other Republican members have urged the administration to award the contract soon. A July 18 letter to Trump signed by four GOP members of the House Armed Services committee, including ranking member Rep. Mac Thornberry, stated that ""further delays will only damage our security and increase the costs of the contract."""
Richard Neal: Why the House needs Trump’s tax returns,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Richard Neal'],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-my-committee-needs-the-presidents-tax-returns/2019/07/31/05d4505a-b3c8-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html,"Richard E. Neal, a Democrat, represents Massachusetts’s 1st Congressional District in the House and is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.

For three decades, the House of Representatives and its Ways and Means Committee have been the site of my life’s work. I never aspired to be a senator or governor or president.

Instead, I learned arcane House rules and sought a position on the Ways and Means Committee because of its tremendous potential to help my district. I have listened to my constituents on matters such as taxes, health care, international trade and Social Security, which are within the committee’s purview. Untold hours have gone into developing legislation and trying to improve, pass or defeat countless bills. That’s the job.

I’d rather hold a roundtable in Pittsfield, Mass., or cross-examine Medicare administrators than pick fights on cable news. Those arguments tend to drive people into their corners, shrinking opportunities to accomplish real results.

I’m an institutionalist. I respect Congress, for all its imperfections. As chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, I am responsible for congressional oversight of the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service’s administration of the federal tax code. The tax code gives the committee chairman the power to request taxpayer information from the IRS. The committee has exercised this power at various times in the past and has never been denied by the IRS or the Treasury Department.

In early April, I requested the president’s tax returns to fulfill a legitimate congressional oversight responsibility: Our voluntary tax-compliance system hinges on the public’s faith that our tax laws are administered fairly and without favor to those in power. The president is unique: No other American has the power to sign bills into law and direct an entire branch of government. That power, and the extent to which the IRS can audit and enforce federal tax laws against a current or future president, merits closer legislative scrutiny.

The IRS has a policy of performing mandatory audits on all sitting presidents and vice presidents. But neither Congress nor the public knows anything about the scope of those audits and whether the president can exert undue influence on the IRS to affect his or her tax treatment. If, for example, the president is already under audit at the time he or she takes office, what happens to that audit? We don’t know.

My committee will consider legislation regarding the mandatory audit program to ensure these audits are conducted fairly and without undue influence from the commander in chief. And, as part of our deliberations, we must review his tax information to better understand the audit program and propose any needed changes.

The law on this is very clear: The IRS “shall furnish ” the Ways and Means Committee with the requested tax returns. Both Democrats and Republicans have made requests for taxpayer information under 6103(f)(1) of the U.S. tax code in the past. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that Congress is entitled to a presumption that its investigatory activities are legitimate, and, in this case, the legitimacy is self-evident. And yet, the administration has stonewalled Congress, ordering the IRS commissioner not to comply with the plain language of the law and setting up a pending legal clash.

I did not pick this fight, but I will not shirk it because it’s about something much bigger than tax forms. This is not an exercise in political retribution: I am not willing to trade the reputation of the Ways and Means Committee for cheap political gains.

The committee is a venerable part of U.S. history, having given the nation Social Security, Medicare, the entire tax code, all of our trade agreements, and numerous programs serving children and families. This committee financed America’s role in both world wars, and its antecedent paid for the Lewis and Clark expedition. I have no intention of squandering my chairmanship of this distinguished panel on petty or malevolent efforts to embarrass the current president.

But in this country, we take seriously the Magna Carta’s precept of the rule of law, not the law of rulers. I will fight with everything I have to reassert Congress’s constitutional mandate to serve as an equal branch of government. This country has thrived through the centuries because we have durable political institutions with a robust system of checks and balances.

Our political institutions won’t continue to function unless we guard them vigilantly, and my colleagues and I in the House majority are committed to doing so. It is the root of our oath to uphold the law."
F.B.I.

No one was arrested during the raid, in which evidence collection teams visited the housing authority’s headquarters on Alonzo Watson Drive about 1 p.m. with a police officer and United States government trucks.

The agency, which runs nine low-income housing facilities in South Bend and is financed by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been beleaguered by complaints of financial mismanagement for much of the decade.

Such concerns prompted Mr. Buttigieg to replace all six commissioners on the housing authority’s board in 2015."
"U.S. Department of Labor cites Lebanon, Mo. barrel maker for hazardous conditions",https://www.ky3.com,[],,,,https://www.ky3.com/content/news/US-Department-of-Labor-cites-Lebanon-Mo-barrel-maker-for-hazardous-conditions-514189301.html,"The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has cited Missouri Cooperage Company LLC ‒ a subsidiary of Independent Stave Company‒ for exposing employees to amputation, noise, and other safety and health hazards at the spirits and wine barrel-making facility in Lebanon, Mo.

The company faces $413,370 in federal penalties.

OSHA initiated an inspection in February 2019 after Missouri Cooperage Company LLC reported that an employee suffered a finger amputation when her hand was caught between the belt and pulley system. This was the fifth amputation injury the company reported in a 14-month period. Inspectors cited the company for operating an unguarded chain and sprocket – the same violation for which OSHA cited the company in February 2018.

OSHA also cited the company for exposing employees to electrical and occupational noise hazards, failing to guard machines and implement adequate lockout/tagout procedures, and creating a potential fire hazard by allowing dust to accumulate on floors and surfaces.

“Employers must follow the legal requirements put in place to protect workers from injuries. Anything less than that is unacceptable,” said OSHA Regional Administrator Kimberly Stille in Kansas City, Missouri. “Employers must continually evaluate their facilities for hazards, and train employees and managers to use proper safety controls and equipment to keep their worksites safe and healthful.”

OSHA offers compliance assistance resources on occupational noise exposure, machine guarding, control of hazardous energy, respiratory protection, exposure to combustible dust and electrical safety work practices.

The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA’s area director, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA’s role is to help ensure these conditions for America’s working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education, and assistance.

DoD reports higher costs for National Security Space Launch program,https://spacenews.com,['Sandra Erwin'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://spacenews.com/dod-reports-higher-costs-for-national-security-space-launch-program/,"NSSL costs over the entire life of the program increased 7.2% — from $57.2 billion to $61.3 billion.

WASHINGTON — In a new update to its annual report on major acquisition program spending, the Defense Department estimates the total cost of the National Security Space Launch program is up by $4.1 billion since December 2018.

In the so-called Selected Acquisition Reports, DoD estimates the total cost of a program by including what it has already spent and what it projects to spend in the future. In a summary of the SARs for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 released on Thursday, NSSL costs over the entire life of the program increased 7.2% — from $57.2 billion to $61.3 billion. The report says the cost growth is due primarily to increased investment in new launch systems providers to support national security space missions, and an increase of 19 launch services, from 160 to 179, based on satellite launch requirements.

The NSSL program was formerly known as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program. Congress renamed it in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act in recognition that there are now reusable, in addition to expendable, launch vehicles.

The EELV program dates back to 1994 when President Clinton signed a National Space Transportation Policy assigning responsibility for expendable launch vehicles to DoD. The NSSL program is transitioning to new launch vehicles and is seeking to leverage the commercial space industry.

The update to the Selected Acquisition Reports includes details on major defense acquisition program cost, schedule, and performance changes since December 2018. The new figures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 include projected spending in the president’s fiscal year 2020 budget submitted to Congress on March 11.

“SARs summarize the latest estimates of cost, schedule, and performance status,” DoD said in a news release. “These reports are prepared annually in conjunction with submission of the president’s budget.”

Quarterly exception reports are required only for those programs experiencing unit cost increases of at least 15 percent or schedule delays of at least six months. The total program acquisition cost estimates provided in the SARs include research and development, procurement, military construction, and acquisition-related operations and maintenance. These totals reflect actual costs to date as well as future anticipated costs. All estimates are shown in fully inflated then-year dollars.

The cost of the Pentagon’s entire weapons portfolio was $2 trillion in 2018, up from $1.9 trillion in 2017. Quantity changes account for the majority of the increase.

The NSSL program is one of four Air Force major acquisition programs that have reported cost increases greater than $1 billion or 10% since December 2018. The other three are the B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization ($285.3 million, or 10.3%); the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile ($5.2 billion); and the Joint Direct Attack Munition ($1.1 billion)."
10-year Treasury yield dives to lowest level since 2016 after Trump announces new China tariffs,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/us-treasury-yields-higher-after-fed-dampens-hopes-of-more-rate-cuts.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since 2016 on Thursday after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese goods.

The president said on Twitter that 10% duties will be imposed on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, effective Sept. 1. Trump's tweets came after a U.S. delegation met with Chinese trade officials earlier this week.

At around 2:30 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had fallen approximately 15 basis points to 1.878%, its lowest level since November 2016. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which clinched its lowest level since October 2016 on Thursday, last traded at 2.428%. It hit a low of 2.422% earlier in the session.

""The tweet is bringing back the 'trade war' risk that markets have dealt with at various times over the past year. My guess is it is a negotiating tactic, but markets are concerned as the stakes are high and there is a chance it backfires,""said Arthur Bass, managing director of fixed income financing, futures, and rates at Wedbush Securities.

""Fed fund futures are now fully pricing two additional 25bp moves this year, although that could easily reverse if the risk-off move abates,"" Bass added. ""With today's move, fixed income investors will no doubt be positioned a bit long going into tomorrow's employment release,"" when the government will announce July's jobs data.

Yields were also under pressure Thursday after the Federal Reserve in the prior session cut interest rates for the first time since 2008.

In approving the cut, the FOMC pointed to ""implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures."" It also characterized economic growth as ""moderate"" and the labor market ""strong,"" but eased policy regardless.

The 2-year Treasury note yield, more representative of changes to Fed policy, fell 16 basis points to 1.72%, off an earlier low of 1.694%, its lowest since November 2017.

The policymaking committee made explicit reference to inflation, a threat to bonds as rising prices chip away at the real value of their fixed payments."
Interior secretary will be allowed to meet with former fossil fuel clients starting this weekend,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/interior-secretarys-ethics-pledge-is-set-to-expire-this-weekend-729e7e959374/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s ethics recusal will expire on Saturday. The ethics pledge banned Bernhardt from decisions involving his former firm’s clients for two years.

Bernhardt was also not able to meet with these companies, unless five or more other stakeholders were present and nothing relating specifically to the companies was discussed.

But all of this is set to change on August 3.

Prior to joining the Interior Department in 2017, Bernhardt worked as a lobbyist for the oil and gas industry via the Colorado law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

Among the firm’s 22 clients that Bernhardt was prohibited from engaging with for two years under his ethics recusal were energy companies Halliburton, Eni, and Statoil (now known as Equinor). Other clients included industry groups such as the U.S. Oil and Gas Association and the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).

The end of Bernhardt’s recusal was marked on Friday by a ribbon-cutting ceremony hosted by the Clean Water Fund at a park across from the D.C. Interior headquarters.

During his time in the Trump administration, Bernhardt’s ethical issues have taken center stage. He has so many potential conflicts of interest to avoid that he carries around a card listing all of them so he doesn’t forget. A recent analysis by the Center for American Progress found that Bernhardt has more conflicts of interest than any other Trump Cabinet nominee. (ThinkProgress is an editorially independent news site housed at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.)

In April, Politico revealed that Bernhardt reportedly worked closely on matters he had pledged to recuse himself from. Just weeks after Bernhardt joined the administration, he was working on policies related key water infrastructure policy which he had worked on as a lobbyist. The ethics agreement had barred him from involving himself in “particular matters” with Westlands Water District for just one year, until August 2018.

The California water district is known for having tried to weaken the Endangered Species Act.

And in September 2018, an appearance by Bernhardt at a water industry forum in Colorado was canceled after department ethics officials concluded it could raise conflicts-of-interest concerns.

Public records released by the Western Values Project in February 2018 also that found Bernhardt’s former client, the IPAA, frequently communicated with Interior officials conducting a review of the department’s sage grouse policy. In March 2017, for instance, the IPAA thanked Bernhardt for his action as deputy secretary that benefited the oil and gas industry.

It’s not just Bernhardt though who has faced questions over conflicts of interest.

Just two weeks after Bernhardt was officially confirmed as head of the agency — following the departure of scandal-ridden former Secretary Ryan Zinke — the department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) confirmed an investigation into six other senior DOI officials who may have also potentially violated their ethics pledges due to interactions with former employers and clients.

At the same time, this week, a slew of controversial new appointments were welcomed at Interior.

William Perry Pendley, a former senior official from the Reagan administration, was appointed acting director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Pendley, former president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, has long fought to undo the federal government’s control over public lands.

In a 2016 National Review article, Pendley wrote: “The Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold… Westerners know that only getting title to much of the land in the West will bring real change.”

Pendley has in the past sued the Interior Department on behalf of the fossil fuel industry and has tried to undermine endangered species protections along with working to reduce the size of federal lands in favor of development.

Also this week, a climate denier tied to the coal industry was appointed as a senior adviser in the department. Christian Palich previously worked as the president of the pro-Trump Ohio Coal Association until 2017. Palich comes to the Interior this week from lobbying firm Siekman, Siekman & Associates, whose clients include Halliburton and pipeline firm Sunoco Logistics. He was also previously deputy associate administrator for congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Environmental Protection Agency.

Palich has made numerous Fox News appearances praising President Donald Trump’s environmental rollbacks and he has frequently doubted established climate science on Twitter, calling it “junk science.”

After Trump’s election, for example, he tweeted: “Time to push fight [sic] back on all the radical enviro regs that have been illegally been [sic] brought on America over last 8 yrs.”

And finally, after 10 years, the department now has a Senate-confirmed inspector general. Mark Greenblatt — an attorney who previously worked at the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General — will be responsible for investigating allegations of ethics violations by Bernhardt and others at the department.

When pressed by lawmakers earlier this year on his appointment, Greenblatt asserted he had “zero intent” of shutting down any ongoing investigations into the department’s operations."

The Federal Reserve took steps toward easing monetary policy on Wednesday, but the Treasury Department, no longer constrained by the debt ceiling, is poised to perhaps tighten financial conditions through its upcoming funding actions.

On Monday, the Treasury Department announced an aggressive plan to build up its cash balances. The Treasury is slated to borrow an additional $433 billion during the quarter that runs from July to September, with a stated ending balance of $350 billion.

In comparison, the Treasury borrowed just $40 billion from April to June.

The large increase in debt issuance has the potential to partially offset the monetary easing just announced by the Fed. As the Treasury floods the market with new debt to rebuild its cash reserves, the new supply could have the effect of driving down prices and driving up yields of Treasurys and other market-determined interest rates."
"Unrestricted by Nuclear Treaty, Pentagon Chief Threatens Russia With New Weapons",https://www.usnews.com,[],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2019-08-02/defense-secretary-mark-esper-threatens-russia-with-new-missile-system,"Secretary of Defense Mark Esper delivers a speech at the Pentagon on July 25. Esper said the department would pursue ""ground-launched conventional missiles"" in response to Russia's recent actions. Mark Wilson/Getty Images)

Defense Secretary Mark Esper issued a stern warning to Moscow hours after the Trump administration withdrew from a key nuclear weapons treaty, saying Friday that the Pentagon plans to develop new missile systems in response to Russian hostility.

The warning followed President Donald Trump's decision to follow through on a threat six months ago that if Moscow did not return to compliance, the U.S. would withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, one of two main agreements along with New START governing Russia and America's development of nuclear weapons. The Trump administration has signaled it wishes to dismantle that agreement, too.

In a statement Friday, the newly confirmed Esper said the Pentagon in 2017 began missile research and development within the parameters of the INF treaty in response to what he called ""Russia's non-compliance."" The activities centered on developing mobile, ground-based systems capable of launching cruise missiles and ballistic missiles.

The military will step up that work now that it is unrestricted by the treaty, Esper said.

""The Department of Defense will fully pursue the development of these ground-launched conventional missiles as a prudent response to Russia's actions,"" Esper said, ""and as part of the Joint Force's broader portfolio of conventional strike options.""

The U.S. has for years asserted that Russia has violated the terms of the INF treaty. However, many experts and analysts fear America's full withdrawal from the agreement – effectively killing it – would only clear the way for a new arms race between the two military powers.

Though Esper specifically mentioned the technology under development is for conventional missiles, nuclear weapons analysts say the launchers could be used for other purposes.

""It could emplace nuclear warheads on intermediate-range missiles, if it wanted to,"" says Alexandra Bell, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

Bell added, however, that the U.S. would be unlikely to find a partner country willing to host new nuclear-armed systems.

""We have to remember, a missile is just a vessel to carry some sort of munition to a target,"" says Harry Kazianis, the Center for the National Interest's senior director of Korean studies. ""Many missiles that the U.S., China, Russia and even North Korea have in their arsenals can be tipped with either nuclear or conventional warheads.""

A Pentagon spokesperson says in an email to U.S. News that the department ""has begun research and development on ground-launched conventional missiles – not nuclear, conventional missiles, to help us deal with any threat.""

Jon Wolfsthal, who served as an adviser for nuclear proliferation issues in President Barack Obama's National Security Council, says the technology Esper referenced is for Tomahawk cruise missiles, and he confirmed ""they can be modified to carry nuclear weapons.""

Russia has repeatedly denied accusations that it has been non-compliant with the treaty, pushing blame instead on the United States. Officials in Moscow have drawn particular attention to the American military's development and deployment of unmanned drones, which they say also violated the treaty. Some American experts agree with those observations.

Moscow on Friday criticized the Pentagon's latest move, calling it unfortunate.

""We are urging the U.S. to abandon [plans] to deploy the missiles of these ranges it is creating,"" Russia's Foreign Ministry wrote in a statement. It added the U.S. should ""follow Russia's example, taking all the necessary steps to ensure global stability and predictability."""

Now, Ginnie is taking yet another step to squash abuses, announcing Thursday that it is moving forward with a proposal to remove VA-backed cash-out refinances with high loan-to-value ratios from its flagship securities.

First announced in May, the proposal revises the pooling eligibility requirements for VA refinances, creating new criteria for cash-out refis with loan-to-value ratios that exceed 90%.

After a three-month period to collect industry feedback on the proposed rule, the agency has announced that 90% LTV cash-outs will officially be ineligible for Ginnie Mae I Single Issuer Pools and Ginnie Mae II Multiple Issuer Pools starting November 1, 2019. Instead, these high LTV loans can be placed into a custom Ginnie Mae pool.

Permanent construction financing loans will be the only exception, Ginnie noted.

According to a release issued by the agency, the revised pooling requirement “provides global investors with increased certainty in the performance of the Ginnie Mae security, which ultimately lowers mortgage rates for all borrowers served by the program.”

Ginnie’s move coincides with steps taken by the Federal Housing Administration to limit cash-out refinances on FHA-backed loans.

In a release announcing both changes, the FHA said the prevalence of VA cash-outs was an increasing concern for investors.

“Cash-out refinance programs are particularly susceptible to accelerated prepayment speeds, which is why Ginnie Mae is restricting the inclusion of such loans to custom MBS securities,” the statement read. “This allows for greater market transparency for investors pricing Ginnie Mae securities.”

Ginnie Mae Acting President Maren Kasper also weighed in.

“Today’s announcement underscores Ginnie Mae’s commitment to ensuring the agency’s policies enable homeowners to borrow prudently, utilizing the government-guaranteed mortgage market,” Kasper said. “Additionally, this policy provides global investors with increased certainty in the performance of the Ginnie Mae security, which ultimately lowers mortgage rates for all borrowers served by our program.”"
EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process,https://thehill.com,[],08-01-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455854-epa-proposes-easing-air-pollution-permitting-process,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moved to finalize a rule Thursday that would ease the air pollution permitting process for certain power plants and manufacturers.

Since the early days of the Trump administration, the EPA has argued the process for obtaining permits under the Clean Air Act, known as New Source Review (NSR), is too burdensome.

The agency's proposal seeks to make a regulation out of a 2018 memo from former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process Pair of GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule MORE that has already been challenged in court by environmental groups.

The Sierra Club said the proposed rule would allow “some of the wealthiest industries in our country to avoid cleaning up their air emissions instead of installing modern pollution controls on their dirty facilities.”

EPA argues it will help ease the process for facilities looking to install new equipment.

The NSR process at the crux of the proposed regulation kicks in both for new facilities and when power plants install new equipment or make changes that would significantly increase air pollution.

The debate between the EPA and environmentalists largely centers on how much pollution must be factored in when weighing changes at a power plant. Whether or not a plant has to install pollution controls hinges on that calculation.

Environmentalists say the law requires looking at the plant as a whole, including all the ways a facility decreases and increases pollution through its operations.

John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the EPA proposal weighs the increased pollution from one change against all the other decreases in the plant — something that ignores that net pollution may go up.

“You can’t cherry-pick the decreases because it’s allowing even greater increases to escape control,” he said, thus leading to more pollution. “And that’s really the point of this regulation, to allow greater increases to escape control.”

He gave the example of installing a new boiler at a plant. The new technology might be more energy efficient, but if the boiler is run more often than the old one, it will still produce more pollution.

The EPA pushed back against Walke’s assertion.

“Today’s proposal is an important step towards President Trump Donald John TrumpKentucky miners' struggle is that of many working Americans Cummings releases statement on attempted break-in after Trump attacks PhRMA top lobbyist to leave post MORE’s goal of reforming the elements of NSR that regularly discouraged facilities from upgrading and deploying the latest energy efficient technologies,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules it says are too lax MORE said in a release. “By simplifying the permitting process and implementing a common-sense interpretation of our NSR rules, we will remove a major obstacle to the construction of cleaner and more efficient facilities.”

But Walke said calling the changes “upgrades” ignores that they cause pollution.

“The EPA and industry like to call them upgrades and efficiency improvements cause that sounds nice and sounds like things we should be doing, but what that masks is that they are all activities that increase air pollution significantly.”"

The report, published online by the State Department's inspector general Tuesday, rapped the department for rushing through a plan in 2014 to reconstruct the government's Camp Eggars in Kabul, Afghanistan, using a defense contracting company that had never taken on such a construction project. The department had hired a consultant to review the project but then dismissed the consultant’s early warnings about issues it foresaw early on.

""As a result, there were a series of cascading problems,"" the report says. “This led to the expenditures of $103.2 million without any discernible benefit to the Department or to the people it intended to protect.”

OIG

The inspector general concedes that the State Department was trying to work as quickly as possible with few options in the midst of a deteriorating security situation, but says the department was in such a rush that it failed to keep the project on track and failed to hold the primary contractor, Aegis Defense Services, accountable. The inspector general undertook the review of the project after the State Department's deputy secretary requested it do so last year. A spokesperson for GardaWorld Federal Services, which does some U.S. government business as Aegis since its parent company bought Aegis in 2015, did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

The original plan, hatched in the summer of 2014, was to rebuild Camp Eggars in order to house security personnel much closer to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Kabul had become more dangerous after the U.S. drawdown in 2014, and officials feared the security personnel, then based two miles away, lived too far from the people they were meant to protect.

But the State Department office that usually handles large construction projects was unable to take on the job, so the department instead modified a government contract meant primarily for security services to include the reconstruction. So Aegis, which previously focused on providing protection for American personnel, attempted to take on the reconstruction itself with the help of construction-focused subcontractors.

That meant that a State Department office unfamiliar with the demands of large construction projects was working with a company with little experience of its own in that area, the report says.

Problems began “almost immediately,” and, coupled with changes the State Department wanted to make as the project progressed, eventually the estimated overall price tag grew to more than $300 million, the report says. In an example of the waste, the report said millions were spent on construction materials, but delays in the project meant they had to be stored elsewhere for long periods of time at additional cost – more than $22 million in all.

The State Department finally gave up in December 2016, with an estimated 10 percent of the construction actually completed.

The inspector general made three recommendations to the State Department to improve its policies related to such warzone construction projects, but the State Department disagreed with two of them, maintaining that the Camp Eggars project presented “very unique circumstances.” The department said it would review the Camp Eggars project, however, to determine “whether the decision to expend the amount cited was necessary or reasonable.”"
FBI '302' notes on Bruce Ohr interviews set for release,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-03-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fbi-302-notes-on-bruce-ohr-interviews-set-for-release,"The Justice Department will soon release the notes from a dozen FBI interviews with Bruce Ohr, the DOJ official who met with dossier author British ex-spy Christopher Steele numerous times, including after the FBI had cut him off as a source due to improper leaks to the media.

Judicial Watch, the Washington, D.C.-based conservative watchdog group, filed a federal lawsuit in September 2018 against the Justice Department for access to the FBI's notes, known as “302s,"" of its 2016 and 2017 interviews in order to “compel compliance with the Freedom of Information Act” after the DOJ declined to voluntarily hand over the requested materials following the group’s August 2018 request.

Ohr, who had worked with Steele years prior and who acted as an unofficial conduit between Steele and the bureau, had a dozen such interviews with the FBI: one in November 2016, three in December 2016, three in January 2017, two in February 2017, and three in May 2017. At least some of the details from those conversations will be released by Monday. He was the fourth-ranking official at the DOJ until he was demoted after it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work.

In court filings last week, DOJ attorneys said the department had “initially determined that the requested records in this case were to be withheld in full” but apparently had a change of heart “after further review” and said “DOJ has decided to release the requested records in part to plaintiff.” It is not known how complete this disclosure will be and whether significant portions of Ohr’s interviews will be withheld or redacted.

Ohr’s wife Nellie worked for the opposition research firm Fusion GPS during the 2016 presidential campaign. Fusion GPS had been hired by Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and the opposition research firm then hired Steele, who allegedly reached out to sources in Russia to put together his salacious and unverified dossier. That dossier was used extensively in four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications and renewals targeting Trump associate Carter Page.

Bruce Ohr told congressional investigators that Steele was desperate for Trump to lose in 2016.

Neither Steele's Democratic benefactors, nor his animus against Trump were disclosed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which has drawn the ire of Republicans.

Simpson met extensively with Bruce Ohr as well as numerous journalists to whom he provided Fusion GPS’s anti-Trump research in 2016. When Nellie Ohr was hired by Fusion GPS, Simpson knew her husband was working at the DOJ.

Both Bruce Ohr and Nellie Ohr met with Steele in the summer of 2016, including at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., on July 30, 2016. Bruce Ohr reportedly provided information stemming from that meeting to the FBI a few days later. The FBI’s Trump-Russia counterintelligence investigation, dubbed “Crossfire Hurricane”, was launched on July 31, 2016. It is believed that controversial FBI special agent Peter Strzok signed the order that launched the inquiry.

Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton appeared optimistic about what might be learned next week, tweeting out that the news was “huge” and that “key Bruce Ohr 302 FBI reports on his coup cabal contacts with Christopher Steele are to be released to Judicial Watch imminently.”

Other than sharing his information with Bruce Ohr, Steele also provided details from his dossier to many members of the media as well as other members of the U.S. government, including then-Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former State Department official Kathleen Kavalec. Steele was cut off by the FBI as a confidential human source before the election due to his improper disclosures to the media, but the FBI continued to use his dossier in FISA filings.

In September 2018, Trump directed the DOJ to declassify a series of investigative documents including “all FBI reports of interviews with Bruce G. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation.” But a few days later he seemed to walk back that order in a follow-up tweet. It now looks like Judicial Watch’s lawsuit might result in that info coming out, even if Trump backed down.

Earlier this year, Trump gave Attorney General William Barr ""full and complete authority to declassify information"" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and Barr selected U.S. Attorney John Durham as his right-hand man in this endeavor. The White House instructed agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Department, the State Department, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to cooperate with Barr and Durham in their efforts.

DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz launched an inquiry in March 2018 into alleged abuse of the FISA Court process, including the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier. Horowitz’s investigation has reportedly concluded, and his report is expected after Labor Day."
Multiple agencies coordinate with EPA for Mass City mercury spill cleanup,https://www.uppermichiganssource.com,[],,,,https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/content/news/Multiple-agencies-coordinate-with-EPA-for-Mass-City-mercury-spill-cleanup-513941201.html,"Representatives from Ontonagon County Emergency Management and the Western Upper Peninsula Health Department are working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency following an accidental mercury spill at an abandoned garage and vacant lot in Mass City.

The spill was small, has been contained and is not a threat to the surrounding neighborhood.

The incident was first reported via law enforcement on July 28 and quickly worked its way through the emergency response system resulting in the arrival of the Health Department, EPA and hazardous materials cleanup crews shortly thereafter.

Following mitigation efforts, the effects of the spill have been minimized and both physical contamination of the property, a nearby home and adjacent vacant lot as well as air quality are being monitored by specialized equipment.

“This is a perfect example of how different agencies support each other during an incident,” said Mike Kocher, Emergency Services Director for Ontonagon County. “Everything starts and ends locally but when the call goes out, we coordinate, communicate and cooperate with a variety of response organizations to bring things to a successful conclusion, with the ultimate goal always being the safety of our residents.”

According to reports, the initial incident occurred when children entered the abandoned repair facility garage and discovered mercury in a small bottle. Their home is also being monitored for mercury levels.

Mercury is an element that has been used in thermometers, electric switches, lights, batteries and even in paper processing. Both the EPA and Western U.P. Health Department have published guidelines concerning what to do if involved in a larger spill. These include never using a vacuum cleaner or broom to clean up, never pouring it down a drain and never walking through it which can contaminate shoes and track it elsewhere.

""Mercury has interesting properties making it attractive to kids"" said Pete Baril, Emergency Preparedness Coordinator for the Western UP Health Department. ""As interesting and harmless as it may appear, mercury gives off toxic vapors that can be damaging to one’s health, especially children. We cannot stress enough the importance of getting rid of mercury sources in your home. If you have mercury in your home secure it and call your local health department for advice. We would much prefer to work with you on safely getting it out of your home than on a spill situation that can become very complicated very quickly.""

The US military spent $33 million on tech known to be vulnerable to Chinese cyberespionage,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1679475/dod-spent-30m-on-china-hackable-tech-from-lenovo-gopro-others/,"The US Department of Defense (DoD) purchased and used millions of dollars worth of electronics last year containing “known cybersecurity vulnerabilities” that make them particularly susceptible to Chinese government espionage. The findings are included in a recent audit (pdf) by the Pentagon’s Inspector General (IG) for DoD cyberspace operations, which warns that “missions critical to national security could be compromised” if the military does not take swift action.

Some models or brands of so-called COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) technology can allow adversaries access to communications infrastructure, command and control systems, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance networks, says the partially redacted IG report.

To that end, at least $32.8 million in COTS purchases made by the US Army and Air Force during the 2018 fiscal year were singled out for concern. The products include software, cameras, and networking equipment red-flagged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate, as well as computers that have been banned for use by State Department employees since 2006.

Repelling cyberattacks has become an increasingly worrisome problem for the military since the DoD was hit with its first significant cyberattack from China in 2003. Last year, the Chinese government hacked into a US Navy contractor’s computer network, gaining access to highly sensitive secrets about a classified undersea missile program. Also last year, a breach of DoD travel records exposed the personal information and credit card data of tens of thousands of servicemembers and civilians, although that has not been explicitly linked to Beijing, which reportedly maintains a cyberespionage force with nearly 200,000 members (pdf) spanning both the military and private sectors. What’s more, a report issued last October by the Government Accountability Office found “mission-critical cyber vulnerabilities in nearly all weapon systems” developed by the US military between 2012 and 2017.

“The Chinese have already broken into my stuff,” Army acquisitions official Lt. Gen. Paul Ostrowski told attendees at an event earlier this month. “The personnel system has been broken into. This is something that has risen to the top of the concern list. Not only within the Army, but within [the Office of the Secretary of Defense].”

Unheeded warnings

As much as 80% of the DoD’s systems are off-the-shelf items, or contain components that are commercially available, says the new IG report. Yet, there is no “approved products list to prevent unsecure items from being purchased.”

In one example highlighted by the IG, the Pentagon continued to buy and use video surveillance systems manufactured by two Chinese companies, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology and Dahua Technology, for at least 16 months after the state department warned against it due to cyberespionage concerns. The DoD didn’t stop until August 2018, when Congress officially banned the federal government from doing business with the two firms.

The current items singled out as problematic by the IG include such household names as Lenovo computers, Lexmark printers, and GoPro cameras.

Lenovo

In 2006, the report notes, the State Department banned Lenovo products from its classified networks after reports that the company’s computers were being manufactured with hidden spyware and backdoors. In 2015, the DHS issued a warning about cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Lenovo devices, and in 2016 the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intelligence Directorate warned that Lenovo hardware posed a cyberespionage risk to both classified and unclassified networks and had the potential to compromise the entire DoD supply chain.

Still, the Army purchased 195 Lenovo products last year, for around $268,000, while the Air Force acquired 1,378 Lenovo products for $1.9 million.

Plenty of warnings about Lenovo products.

Lexmark

Last year, the Army and Air Force bought more than 8,000 Lexmark printers for about $30 million. The company is owned by a consortium of Chinese firms, and has links to the country’s military, nuclear, and cyberespionage programs, points out the IG report. A US government vulnerabilities database lists 20 known cybersecurity concerns pertaining to Lexmark, such as “storing and transmitting sensitive network access credentials in plain text and allowing the execution of malicious code on the printer,” which the IG says “could allow remote attackers to use a connected Lexmark printer to conduct cyberespionage or launch a denial of service attack on a DoD network.”

GoPro

The Army and Air Force also purchased 117 GoPro cameras last year, costing $98,000. The built-in wireless and Bluetooth capabilities, which let users share video in real-time, “have vulnerabilities that could allow a remote attacker access to the stored network credentials and live video streams,” says the report. “By exploiting these vulnerabilities, a malicious actor could view the video stream, start recording, or take pictures without the user’s knowledge.”

The DoD’s response to the IG report is almost entirely redacted.

A heavily redacted response.

Next steps?

The DoD must start to identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks posed by off-the-shelf technology before it is put into use, cautions the IG. However, the report points out that current DoD policy only mitigates cybersecurity risks “after purchase.”

“Despite DoD policies and the numerous organizations performing cybersecurity testing and analysis,” says the audit, “there appears to be no organization assessing the risks for COTS items DoD-wide, identifying high-risk items for further testing, or actively recommending prohibition of these high-risk items when necessary.”

It’s a serious enough problem that the IG believes a legislative fix might be the only answer.

In the meantime, says the report, “We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct an organization or group to develop a risk-based approach to prioritize COTS items for further evaluation, a process to test high-risk COTS items, and a process to prohibit the purchase and use of high-risk COTS items, when necessary, until mitigation strategies can limit the risk to an acceptable level.”"
California trucking school owner pleads guilty to $4.2 million scam to defraud Veterans Affairs Department,http://www.freightwaves.com,"['Clarissa Hawes', 'Clarissa Has Covered All Aspects Of The Trucking Industry For Years.

Court documents allege that Emmit Marshall, 52, owner of the Alliance School of Trucking (AST), along with his co-defendant Robert Waggoner, 56, who served as the school’s director, recruited eligible veterans under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.



Marshall and Waggoner convinced veterans to enroll in their school by telling them “they could collect housing and other fees from the VA without attending the programs,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California.



Marshall told FreightWaves on July 31 that his trucking school is still open for business, but is no longer accepting veterans as students.



Knowing that the vast majority of veterans enrolled at AST did not intend to attend any portion of the programs the trucking school offered, which included a 160-hour Tractor Trailer and Safety class and a 600-hour Select Driver Development program, Marshall and Waggoner “created and submitted fraudulent enrollment certifications,” according to Marshall’s plea agreement.



Marshall and Waggoner also created student files that contained “bogus documents,” prosecutors allege.



Once AST became aware of the investigation, Marshall, Waggoner and others at the trucking school “removed fraudulent documents from student files, and Marshall later ordered that these files be destroyed,” Marshall’s plea agreement states.



Over a four-year period, court documents claim the VA paid AST approximately $2.3 million in tuition and fee payments for veterans who didn’t attend classes. The VA also paid around $1.9 million in educational benefits directly to veterans who did not attend classes at AST.



Marshall is scheduled to be sentenced on November 18. He faces a statutory maximum sentence of 100 years in federal prison. Waggoner, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to go to trial on February 25, 2020.

EPA proposal scraps limits on coal plant waste,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455386-epa-proposal-scraps-limits-on-coal-plant-waste,"The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed scrapping restrictions on arsenic-laden waste from coal-fired power plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed lifting some regulations on coal ash, the residue left after burning coal, which is filled with hazardous substances that can leach into the water supply and cause health problems.

“I can say without hesitation that this is an extremely dangerous proposal that will do lasting harm to communities near coal ash reuse sites and coal ash waste piles,” said Lisa Evans, senior counsel with Earthjustice.

Coal ash is used in a variety of ways, largely as a replacement for soil. It can be used to create level ground for construction projects or sprinkled over landfills as a protective cover.

But coal ash has been deemed responsible for contaminating water with arsenic, which is linked with some types of cancer.

The latest proposal from the EPA would eliminate restrictions from 2015 that limited coal ash use to 12,400 tons per site.

The Trump administration proposal would allow projects to use as much coal ash as they want but would have to file a demonstration that shows the project won’t cause harm if it’s close to certain features like groundwater or wetlands.

But Evans said that’s not a realistic safeguard.

“That demonstration doesn’t have to be defended to any regulatory agency or be posted for public notice or be written by any engineer or environmental professional,” Evans said. “You’ve got a fairly meaningless demo having to be created.”

The EPA said the regulations would help spur “beneficial use” — the term for new uses for what would otherwise be industry waste.

“Today the Agency is proposing sensible changes that will improve the coal ash regulations and continue to encourage appropriate beneficial use,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump EPA looks to change air pollution permit process | GOP senators propose easing Obama water rule | Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules EPA proposes easing air pollution permitting process Green group sues EPA over lead dust rules it says are too lax MORE said in a statement. “These proposed changes will further responsible management of coal ash while protecting human health and the environment.”

The proposal includes some features that would make reporting requirements more accessible to the public, but environmentalists ultimately see the move as a bow to industry.

“Despite compelling and damning scientific evidence highlighting the harm to groundwater from coal ash, and court victories by community groups requiring the EPA to strengthen the 2015 rule, Wheeler is giving this gift to his former employers at the cost of public health,” Earthjustice and the Sierra Club said in a statement. “It is a disgrace to everything the EPA stands for, and we will do everything in our power to stop it.”"

(CNN) In another time, the President of the United States might have called an urgent press conference on Monday morning -- making sure he could command the world's attention -- and issued a stern warning that violent repression of peaceful protesters is intolerable.

After all, what we saw this weekend in Moscow and Hong Kong were alarming signs that a wave of more brutal repression is looming. The regimes in Moscow and Beijing have sent notice that they are about to crush peaceful, popular movements. This should alarm the US president and produce an urgent response.

Instead, President Donald Trump woke up Monday morning prepared to stoke racist sentiment across the United States, tweeting a new barrage of inflammatory messages against prominent African American figures in what has become a familiar pattern : racist tweets from the President, widespread condemnation by the public, doubling down by the President. Trump is making racism his trademark, spending his time energizing racists while decisively removing America from the moral high ground.

Perhaps not coincidentally, this is happening at the time when democracy activists most desperately need a show of support. They could use a strong statement from Washington telling the leaders in Russia and China that the world is watching. That their actions could have consequences. That, at the very least, their position on the global stage is teetering. That the American people stand on the side of those demanding justice.

Consider what happened in Russia, where pro-democracy activists have been protesting for the right to vote after authorities brazenly disqualified opposition candidates for an upcoming municipal election. President Vladimir Putin's approval has been sliding, discontent growing, and the largest protests in years have taken place, even though Russian law now makes it nearly impossible to obtain a protest permit.

This weekend, police sent rows of menacing riot police to break down a peaceful protest, arresting more than a thousand people in Moscow.

Most alarming is what happened to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose very life may well depend on whether the rest of the world makes it clear to the Kremlin that, if he is killed, there will be consequences.

Navalny was arrested earlier in the week after calling for a demonstration. Then, suddenly, on Sunday, he was rushed to a hospital with what the hospital called an ""acute allergic reaction."" He does not suffer from allergies. The news immediately brought to mind the fate of other Kremlin critics who have faced, shall we call it, biochemical issues.

Recall the horrific disfigurement of former Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian politician who dared to challenge Putin's preferred candidate in 2004. He narrowly escaped death after being poisoned with dioxin. He believes the Kremlin was behind the assassination attempt.

The Kremlin stands accused of poisoning other Putin critics, even exiled ones, including Alexander Litvinenko, who died from radioactive polonium poisoning blamed on Putin by a UK inquest, and Sergei Skripal and his daughter, poisoned in Salisbury, England. British authorities have accused two Russian men of carrying out the hit, saying they belong to Russian military intelligence. The men say they were simply tourists visiting Salisbury.

Other Kremlin critics have died mysterious deaths. The popular politician and Putin critic Boris Nemtsov, shot in front of the Kremlin, former ally Boris Berezovsky, who supposedly killed himself, and many, many courageous journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists counts 28 Russian journalists killed since 2000, the year Putin rose to power.

Navalny's personal doctor says he has been taken back out of the hospital into prison against her advice. She thinks he has been poisoned. Perhaps it was a warning, perhaps an attempt on his life. Navalny, back in prison on Monday, suggested he may have been poisoned while in police custody.

A well-articulated warning from Washington might just save him and others.

A warning to Beijing is just as urgent. For weeks the people of Hong Kong have waged peaceful protests against a government that is supposed to be independent of China under the ""one country, two systems"" model agreed when the territory reverted to China from the UK.

Protests started against a bill that would have allowed extradition to China, where the legal system is beholden to the Communist Party-controlled regime. The protests have been massive, bringing out as many as two million people in a territory of just seven million, underscoring how widespread and intense the distrust of China is.

Beijing has been growing impatient, and the signs are nothing short of ominous.

Last week, the spokesman for the Chinese military, Wu Qian, issued a chilling reminder that China's military forces could be quickly deployed inside Hong Kong if the territory's authorities request it. Then he described the protests in a way that made very clear Beijing is running out of patience. The protesters' behavior, Wu declared, ""is intolerable.""

That was Wednesday. On Sunday, Hong Kong police clad in riot gear launched a harsh crackdown against demonstrators. CNN's Anna Coren, in the midst of the mayhem , was visibly horrified. The protesters were completely peaceful, she said.

On Monday, China issued its sternest warning yet, accusing pro-democracy protesters of committing "" evil and criminal acts .""

One shudders to think what might come next at the hands of the regime that massacred protesters at Tiananmen Square 30 years ago.

When the tanks rolled in Tiananmen, then-President George H.W. Bush wasted no time publicly condemning the regime, as have other American presidents who spoke firmly and decisively against repression.

Sure, America has failed many times, and its own history is far from immaculate, but the words of a credible American president can help draw the moral lines. It may or may not stay the hand of a tyrant, it may or may not prevent a massacre. But at the very least it helps clarify what is and is not legitimate conduct in our time. Even if it fails to stop a catastrophe in progress, it may give second thoughts to another tinpot tyrant watching from a distance.

How tragic for America and for the world that Washington today is dominated by a President who thinks nothing matters more than his personal fate and believes inciting racist hatreds at home tops the national agenda."
State Sen. Tom Cullerton Indicted On 41 Counts: DOJ,https://patch.com,[],08-02-2019,2019,8,https://patch.com/illinois/glenellyn/state-sen-tom-cullerton-indicted-41-counts-doj,"CHICAGO, IL — Illinois State Senator Tom Cullerton has been indicted by a federal grand jury on 41 counts that include embezzling from a local labor union. Cullerton, 49, of Villa Park, is accused of ""fraudulently receiving salary and benefits from a Teamsters union for which he did little or no work,"" according to a news release from the U.S. Department of Justice.

The indictment alleges that Cullerton, who was formerly a member of Teamsters Local Union 734, was hired to be a union organizer by the president of Teamsters Joint Council 25 in March 2013, after he was elected to the state senate. During his time as an organizer, which lasted until 2016, Cullerton is accused of having ""fraudulently obtained from Joint Council 25 and its members approximately $188,320 in salary, bonuses, and cellphone and vehicle allowances, as well as approximately $64,068 in health and pension contributions.""

These funds, which Cullerton is accused of using to pay for ""personal expenses, such as his mortgage, utilities and groceries,"" were collected in exchange for Cullerton having done ""little to no work as an organizer,"" the DOJ's news release outlines.

Cullerton is further accused of collecting reimbursed medical claims from the union's Health and Welfare Fund under the pretense that he worked as a ""route salesman.""

Cullerton, a Democrat who was elected to represent the 23rd District in 2013, represents parts of Addison, Bloomingdale, Bartlett, Carol Stream, Glendale Heights, Hanover Park, Itasca, Roselle, Villa Park, and West Chicago."

Computing—“Seeing” in real time

Oak Ridge National Laboratory is training next-generation cameras called dynamic vision sensors, or DVS, to interpret live information—a capability that has applications in robotics and could improve autonomous vehicle sensing. Unlike a traditional digital camera that records large amounts of information in frames, a DVS transmits per-pixel changes in light intensity. Individual pixel locations are recorded and time stamped to the microsecond, creating data “events” that are processed by a neuromorphic network—a type of intelligent, energy-efficient computing architecture. “Because the DVS records only changes in what it sees, there is no redundant data,” said ORNL SULI intern Kemal Fidan, who spent his summer learning about dynamic vision sensors under ORNL’s Robert Patton. This capability makes the sensors fast, power efficient and effective in wide ranges of light intensity. Fidan’s project taught a DVS to recognize human gestures such as waving, clapping and two-finger peace signs in real time. —Abby Bower [Contact: Sara Shoemaker, (865) 576-9219; shoemakerms@ornl.gov]

Fusion—Tungsten rising

Using additive manufacturing, scientists experimenting with tungsten at Oak Ridge National Laboratory hope to unlock new potential of the high-performance heat-transferring material used to protect components from the plasma inside a fusion reactor. Fusion requires hydrogen isotopes to reach millions of degrees. Tungsten, the metal with the highest melting point, holds promise to withstand extreme temperatures at the edge of this reaction, yet it is brittle and difficult to machine. The ORNL team is using an additive manufacturing technique called electron beam melting to build innovative tungsten fusion components with complex, unique geometries that can’t be made through traditional manufacturing. “The electron beam allows us to better control the heat distribution as tungsten is printed layer by layer,” said ORNL’s Betsy Ellis who led the initial experiments. “After more testing, this method may result in a better quality, full-density structure that’s less prone to cracking.” [Contact: Sara Shoemaker, (865) 576-9219; shoemakerms@ornl.gov]

Climate—Energy demand shuffle

A detailed study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory estimated how much more—or less—energy United States residents might consume by 2050 relative to predicted shifts in seasonal weather patterns across the country. ORNL’s Deeksha Rastogi and colleagues used a series of sophisticated climate models run on supercomputing resources at ORNL to estimate changes in household energy demand over a 40-year period. They found that prolonged periods of increased temperatures are expected to drive a rise in electricity needs while shorter, milder cold seasons could reduce natural gas demand. The team’s paper also posits that climate shifts could impact a projected decrease in residential energy demand in some rural areas. “Our results provide a highly comprehensive look at residential energy consumption that we hope will influence future analysis to understand residents’ choices and behavior relative to climate and socioeconomic conditions,” Rastogi said.

Supercomputing—Galactic winds demystified

Using the Titan supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a team of astrophysicists created a set of galactic wind simulations of the highest resolution ever performed. The simulations will allow researchers to gather and interpret more accurate, detailed data that elucidates how galactic winds affect the formation and evolution of galaxies. Brant Robertson of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Evan Schneider of Princeton University developed the simulation suite to better understand galactic winds—outflows of gas released by supernova explosions—which could help explain variations in their density and temperature distributions. The improved set of galactic wind simulations will be incorporated into larger cosmological simulations. “We now have a much clearer idea of how the high speed, high temperature gas produced by clusters of supernovae is ejected after mixing with the cooler, denser gas in the disk of the galaxy,” Schneider said. —Elizabeth Rosenthal [Contact: Katie Bethea, (865) 576-8039; betheakl@ornl.gov]

Clean water—Sunny desalination

A new method developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory improves the energy efficiency of a desalination process known as solar-thermal evaporation. Scientists fashioned tubular devices using nanoengineered graphite foam coated with carbon nanoparticles and a superhydrophobic material that increased the absorption of light energy directly from the sun. The thermal energy was used to heat seawater, producing freshwater vapor that was fed into a condenser to make potable water. The system removed more than 99.5% of salt in simulated seawater and reached 64% solar-thermal conversion efficiency. “Using this improved solar-absorbing material for interfacial water evaporation represents a more efficient use of solar energy,” said ORNL’s Gyoung Jang. The experiment is detailed in the journal Global Challenges. The method can be scaled up into modular systems to provide clean water at remote locations or to serve communities affected by hurricanes or floods.

Housing Authority Initiates Nearly $500 Million in Affordable Housing Developments,https://therivardreport.com,"['Iris Dimmick', 'More Iris']",,,,https://therivardreport.com/housing-authority-initiates-nearly-500-million-in-affordable-housing-developments/,"The San Antonio Housing Authority’s board approved on Thursday future transactions, tax credits, and bond applications that will be part of $486 million in affordable housing projects.

The nearly unanimous approval marks one of the largest amounts of financing authorized in a single day, said SAHA President and CEO David Nisivoccia. The funding will assist 14 different projects (nearly 3,500 housing units) across Bexar County that will have a portion reserved for residents who earn less than the area median income (AMI), ranging from 30 to 80 percent of AMI. These projects could come open in two to five years.

“This is not a normal Thursday,” Nisivoccia told the Rivard Report. “It’s a seminal day for the agency. I think staff here at San Antonio Housing Authority heard an action call; we heard that from the [Mayor’s Housing Policy] Task Force, the mayor, my board, and more importantly the residents of San Antonio saying, ‘Hey, we need more affordable housing.'”

City Council approved a policy framework last year, produced by the task force, that calls for increased spending and better procedures surrounding the affordable housing market.

Several of the items approved on Thursday have been years in the making, Nisivoccia said. “It’s not like it happened overnight. A lot of people might ask [what did SAHA do] for the last two years. Well, this is what we’ve been doing.”

Gone are the days of large, so-called “housing projects” that place low-income families in apartment buildings en masse, he said. The current model is to work with an affordable housing developer on public-private partnerships that have a mix of market-rate and subsidized units, and “I think you’re going to see more of it. … The market is good.”

Most of the projects will still need to come before the board again for final approval, including the tax credits and tax-exempt bond applications.

These are in preliminary stages, said Timothy Alcott, SAHA real estate and legal services officer, but the deadline to apply for those through the State is Aug. 15. These “volume caps” are first-come, first-serve.

These projects are just coming to fruition at the same time, Alcott said, hence the meeting’s large price tag. “We’re getting more players in and [that] gives us the ability to do more affordable units.”

SAHA is seeking volume caps for Alazán Courts (adjacent to the Alazán Lofts project in the West Side), 1604 Flats, Old Pearsall Flats, Traders Flats, Kitty Hawk Flats, and Mira Vista Apartments. SAHA has yet to identify partners for some of those projects, such as Alazán Courts.

The board also gave the go-ahead to pursue proposals from four companies to build seven different projects:

The Lynd Co. wants to construct Culebra Crossing, a $47 million 325-unit apartment complex near Loop 1604;

ARDC Ruiz proposes a $21 million, 102-unit that will rent almost exclusively to families earning 60 percent of AMI;

Real estate developer JMJ wants a one of two 24-story towers near La Villita on South St. Mary’s Street to include affordable units;

Weal Development proposes a $65 million, eight-story, 252-unit apartment complex at South St. Mary’s Street and East Nueva Street. Half of the units in the St. John Square project will be for families earning 50 percent of AMI;

Vesta Corp. is seeking to acquire three existing low-income housing projects in the South and Southwest sides;

SAHA also is pursuing $20 million in bonds to develop Charity at Springview Apartments. Charity, a working title, is a 250-unit project on the East Side.

Alcott and Nisivoccia said they were confident that almost all – if not all – projects initiated Thursday would come to fruition.

SAHA Commissioner Sofia Lopez cast the lone vote against the deals related to St. Mary’s Towers and Culebra Commons.

In the case of Culebra, Lopez said 80 percent of AMI isn’t affordable enough for many San Antonians. In both cases, Lopez said she wanted more details about the cost-benefit analysis and how such projects fit into the broader picture of housing stock in San Antonio.

She wants to make sure “we really are getting the best bang for our buck,” Lopez said.

Board Chair Jessica Weaver agreed that the board needs a kind of “retreat” in which staff provides an overview of SAHA’s strategies.

“Staff stands ready to have that retreat at any time,” Nisivoccia said.

Several residents spoke out about Alazán Lofts, a SAHA-NRP Group project that recently received a competitive 9 percent tax credit from the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs. Forty-eight of the 88 units will be public housing, eight will be market-rate apartments, and the rest will be allocated for renters making 60 percent of AMI.

To build the four-story complex, however, requires a change in zoning. The area community plan calls for two-story homes there. City Council is slated to consider the zoning change Aug. 22. The Zoning Commission recommended approval this month.

“It’s not OK to dismiss community members,” Yaneth Flores, a West Side community organizer with the Esperanza Peace and Justice Center, said during the public comment period of the meeting.

Stephanie Marquez / Rivard Report

Alazán Lofts is a separate project from Alazán Courts. The latter is a proposal to demolish the oldest public housing project in the United States and build a more modern facility with 328 units.

“Demolition of this development would be disastrous for this community,” Flores said, because it would separate residents from their support network.

Those residents would have first dibs on temporary units elsewhere while construction proceeds at Alazán Courts, Nisivoccia said after the meeting, and have the option of moving back once completed.

The proposal would allow SAHA to update the facility and provide more of the “deep-dive” subsidies for those making less than half of AMI, he said. “That’s how I want to honor the past, is to provide people presently the opportunity to see a good life for themselves and most importantly their children.”

Trump Pick to Oversee Federal Lands Doesn’t Want the Government to Have Any,http://nymag.com,['Matt Stieb'],07-31-2019,2019,7,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/trump-pick-to-oversee-federal-lands-doesnt-want-any.html,"A ridge in Bears Ears National Monument, which the Trump administration reduced by 201,876 acres. Photo: George Frey/Getty Images

With around 640 million acres in the bank, the federal government controls about 28 percent of the land in these United States, with the bulk of that lying in the West: Over half the ground in Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Alaska, and Oregon is under federal oversight. But the president’s new appointee for Bureau of Land Management, the office that oversees most of that property, isn’t too keen on the government’s role in managing land.

Earlier this week, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt made Wyoming native, attorney, and Reagan administration alum William Perry Pendley the acting director of the BLM. Since serving in the Gipper’s Energy and Interior departments, Pendley has sued Interior on behalf of an oil prospector, tried to slash protections for endangered species — including cutting laws protecting grizzly bears in national parks — and attempted to make it easier to build on federal land.

In addition to his political view on public lands — in 2016, he wrote in the National Review that “[t]he Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold” — Pendley has some personal relationships that add concerns to his nomination. The Washington Post explains:

Pendley’s legal ties, as well as his policy positions, have attracted scrutiny. Environmental groups are pressing Interior to formally recuse Pendley from any involvement in a court case in which he is still the counsel of record representing an aging businessman, Sidney Longwell and his small company Solenex.

Solenex purchased a 6,247-acre lease in northwest Montana in 1982 during the Reagan administration for about $1 an acre. Longwell wants permission to build a six-mile service road and bridge over the Two Medicine River on lands considered sacred by the Blackfeet Tribe. Interior wants to cancel the lease. He would use the road to bring in drilling rigs and other oil exploration equipment.

“The Department’s career ethics professionals are working closely with Mr. Pendley and will advise him as necessary,” an Interior official said.

Pendley has also blasted former Interior secretary Ryan Zinke for not doing enough to open up public lands to private development. In another article for the National Review published in 2017, Pendley criticized Zinke for not reducing national monuments at the rate he deemed necessary: “Instead of doing as asked [by the Trump administration], Secretary Zinke recommended decreasing the size of only four of the most blatantly illegal national monuments while leaving the boundaries of all the others standing with mollycoddle language, which will soon get stricken by environmentalists.” That Zinke reduced only two national monuments wasn’t enough: Pendley rejected that Zinke proposed to make the Badger-Two Medicine preserve in Montana a national monument, an area Solenex wanted to explore for drilling.

Earlier this week, President Trump nominated John Ratcliffe to become the new director of National Intelligence, despite Ratcliffe’s consistent doubt in the efficacy of the intelligence community’s findings on Russia. That the administration has proposed another nominee to deregulate and dismantle the department he runs should now be expected as the norm."

DHS issues hacking security alert for small planes,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kris Van Cleave'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-issues-hacking-security-alert-small-planes-today-2019-07-30/,"Washington — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a rare security alert Tuesday for small planes. The alert warns if a hacker gained physical access to certain small planes, they could attach a common device to its wiring. This could provide false flight data including altitude and airspeed, as well as possible access to the autopilot system, potentially leaving a pilot unable to tell whether the reading was accurate and potentially lose control of the aircraft.

""We could do basically anything the plane can do, pretty much anything the pilot could do by himself,"" said Tod Beardsley, director of research at cyber security firm Rapid7.

In a laboratory setting, researchers at Rapid7 were able to hack what's essentially a plane's electronic central nervous system, allowing them to send the erroneous commands. ""I do think it is something of a wake up call. This is something that needs to be taken seriously now rather than later, like after the disaster,"" Beardsley said.

Last year, Homeland Security researchers, who successfully hacked a 757 while it was parked, warned it's only ""a matter of time before a cybersecurity breach on an airline occurs."" DHS is now urging small plane makers to study the cyber security protections car makers added after hackers were able to exploit similar technology on the roads.

The Federal Aviation Administration tells CBS News a ""scenario that involves unrestricted physical access is unlikely"" but these findings are ""an important reminder to remain vigilant."" Rapid7 said it notified the company that built those two systems, but their findings prompted DHS to urge pilots to secure their aircraft and for manufacturers to take a look at options to better secure these systems."
Trump EPA yanks Obama-era proposal to restrict mine development in salmon-rich Bristol Bay region,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/trump-administration-scuttles-epa-proposal-to-restrict-alaska-mine-development-in-bristol-bay-region/,"The Environmental Protection Agency scuttled proposed development restrictions Tuesday on an open-pit mine in the headwaters of Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, which sustains the largest sockeye salmon runs in the world.

The move by Chris Hladick, the EPA’s Seattle-based regional administrator, is part of a broader Trump administration push to proceed with a permitting review for the Pebble Mine, a world-class deposit of gold, molybdenum and copper that — due to its sensitive location — is among the most contested mineral-development projects in Alaska history.

The proposed restrictions date to the Obama administration, and would have sharply limited the amount of wetlands and salmon streams that could have been damaged by disposal of mine wastes. The developer’s CEO — Tom Collier of Pebble Partnership — hailed the EPA action Tuesday as removing a “cloud of uncertainty” by reversing “outrageous federal government overreach.”

“The restrictions would have precluded any meaningful mineral development in the region — period,” said Collier, who credited Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy with encouraging the EPA to abandon the proposal.

The Army Corps of Engineers is now undertaking a permitting review scheduled to be completed next year. State permitting would take another few years, which could enable the mine to begin producing ore by 2026, according to Collier.

The EPA action brought a bitter response from a wide-ranging coalition of passionate opponents that includes commercial fishermen from Washington and elsewhere that join in the summer sockeye harvests, sport anglers, seafood processors, recreation companies, Native groups and environmentalists.

“This comes as we are wrapping up the second largest-recorded salmon harvest in Bristol Bay of 42 million salmon and counting, to feed not only our people but the world. Our people will continue to do whatever it takes to stop this mine,” said Alannah Hurley, executive director of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay.

Pebble was first proposed more than a decade ago, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, a longtime critic of the mine, on Tuesday accused the EPA of a “reckless action” that would threaten the Bristol Bay watershed and the fisheries and maritime economy it supports.

During the Obama administration, the EPA undertook a major review of the mine’s environmental impacts in response to a 2011 request from six Bristol Bay tribes. In 2014, the Seattle regional office used the authority vested by the Clean Water Act to propose tight restrictions that included a cap of 1,100 acres of wetlands, lakes and ponds that could be lost to development and the loss of no more than 5 miles of streams used by salmon or other seagoing fish.

“In simple terms, the infrastructure necessary to mine the Pebble deposit jeopardizes the long-term health and sustainability of the Bristol Bay ecosystem,” said the 2014 document released by the EPA’s Seattle regional office.

Northern Dynasty, the Canadian company that owns Pebble Partnership, contested the EPA’s 2014 finding in a lawsuit settled during the first year of the Trump administration, and allowed the project to proceed with federal permitting. The EPA action Tuesday rescinds the 2014 findings, which Dennis McLerran, who served as the agency’s Seattle-based regional administrator during the Obama administration, said were based on the best available science.

“What is happening now is the decision-making process is being politicized and removed from the science,” McLerran said in a Tuesday interview.

The permits likely will face legal challenges.

“I think litigation is inevitable,” said Taryn Kiekow Heimer, a senior advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposes the Pebble Mine."
Democratic senator vows to fight Trump Interior nominee after requesting perjury investigation,https://thehill.com,[],07-31-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/455519-dem-senator-vows-to-fight-trump-interior-nominee-after-requesting,"A Democratic senator is working to block a Trump nominee from serving as the top lawyer for the Department of the Interior and calling for an investigation after the nominee appeared to lie to lawmakers during his confirmation hearing about the department's public records policy.

Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenOn The Money: Trump to hit China with new tariffs next month | Stocks plummet on latest trade threat | Senate sends budget deal to Trump | Judge orders NY not to share Trump's tax returns for now Top Democrat: 'Disqualifying' if Trump intel pick padded his résumé Dems push for review of Russian-backed project in Kentucky MORE (D-Ore.) is requesting a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into Daniel Jorjani, currently the top lawyer at Interior who was nominated to officially take over as solicitor for the department.

“Attempts by political appointees at the Interior Department to delay, stonewall and otherwise inhibit public and Congressional oversight are totally unacceptable,” Wyden said in a statement. “I cannot allow Mr. Jorjani’s nomination to proceed. I will object to any unanimous consent agreement to consider his nomination.”

Jorjani’s confirmation hearing was already a notable one, given that he was already connected to numerous issues being internally investigated by the Interior’s Office of the Inspector General.

The man nominated to lead that office, Mark Greenblatt, testified alongside Jorjani that day.

But during the hearing, senators became annoyed by Jorjani’s responses to their questions, particularly those that inquired about a new policy at Interior that allows political appointees to review public records requested through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Jorjani told lawmakers, “I myself don’t review FOIAs or make determinations.”

That comment has already spurred a request for an investigation from one environmental group, but Wyden’s letters asked both the Interior’s watchdog and the DOJ to investigate. They argue that cannot be true given Jorjani’s role overseeing FOIAs for the department.

Wyden, who pressed Jorjani for details on how the review process for political appointees works, say documents from the department show political appointees were given power “well beyond the written policy Mr. Jorjani cited.”

Interior said they believed Jorjani would still be confirmed.

""Dan Jorjani has a solid record of honorably serving the American people,"" spokeswoman Molly Block said in a statement to The Hill. ""The U.S. Department of the Interior is the only Department who has never had a Senate confirmed lawyer under the Trump Administration. Given this fact, we’re confident the Senate will prioritize the confirmation of this highly qualified individual who has been leading transparency efforts at the Department when they return in September.""

Jorjani is not just in hot water for his comments at the hearing but also for written responses he sent afterward, which repeatedly directed Wyden to get in touch with Interior’s congressional liaison for more information.

“I cannot a recall a nominee ever coming through this committee and responding to my requests for information by telling me to go ask somebody else,” Wyden said the day Jorjani was voted out of the Senate Natural Resources Committee.

All Democrats on the committee voted against Jorjani’s nomination.

“The solicitor must uphold the law above all else about, above party politics and ideology. That was not the sense I got,” about Jorjani, ranking member Joe Manchin Joseph (Joe) ManchinDemocrats express alarm over debate's negative tone The 23 Republicans who opposed Trump-backed budget deal Senate Democrats see Warren, Sanders proposals as unfeasible MORE (D-W.Va.) told the committee. He also said Wyden’s questions “lacked the response it deserved” from Jorjani.

It was reported this week that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz had referred Comey for potential criminal charges over his handling of work-related documents, some of which held confidential information. But sources at the DOJ told Fox News that the case ""could not be prosecuted"" and that it ""wasn't a close call.""

DOJ WILL NOT PROSECUTE COMEY FOR LEAKING MEMOS AFTER IG REFERRAL: SOURCES

Appearing on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" Nunes suggested that Comey isn't out of the woods just yet, though.

""Just because the DOJ is not going to act under that recommendation does not mean that he's not going to be further looked at,"" Nunes said. ""Remember, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut [John Durham] now is taking all of this information in, so he's taking our criminal referrals, for example... If I was James Comey, I wouldn't be walking in the cornfields of Iowa yet running for president.""
