Why Anthony Scaramucci's rebellion bothers Donald Trump so much,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/anthony-scaramucci-donald-trump/index.html,"(CNN) Donald Trump is doing a very poor job of not caring that his former friend Anthony Scaramucci has turned on him.

""Just another disgruntled former employee who got fired for gross incompetence,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning of his former White House communications director.

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

That Trump tweet came less than 12 hours afte r this one , again on the Mooch: ""Nobody ever heard of this dope until he met me. He only lasted 11 days!""

And earlier on Monday, Trump sent this tweet : ""Anthony Scaramucci is a highly unstable 'nut job' who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked, & then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign. I barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself, bad on TV.

Does that seem like someone who is totally unbothered by Scaramucci's public rejection of him in a variety of interviews and tweets this month?

Remember, always, that Trump's Twitter feed is a direct line to his mental and emotional state. Trump's allies -- in the White House and outside of it -- can say whatever they want, but what really matters is what Trump tweets. If he tweets about it, he cares about it. Bigly.

Which begs the question: Why does Trump care so much about Scaramucci's rebellion?

The answer is, as always with Trump, tied directly to how he views the world: There are only two kinds of people -- the pro-Trump ones and the anti-Trump ones. People who have been pro-Trump for a long time, or at least before he was elected president, he keeps closer and values more. Those are his OG people, the ones who have been with him from the jump.

It's not a big group -- and it's mostly family. But there are a few non-family members in there -- and Scaramucci was one. When those pro-Trumpers turn on him, Trump goes bananas.

We saw just that scenario play out with Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime attorney and personal fixer. In the immediate aftermath of Cohen's arrest on charges of tax evasion and other financial crimes, Trump stood up for him. Trump praised Cohen in April 2018 as ""a fine person with a wonderful family"" and someone who he had ""always liked & respected.""

Then, Cohen flipped -- entering into a plea agreement to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller and the Southern District of New York on several investigations into Trumpworld. Trump didn't take that decision well.

""If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen!"" Trump tweeted in August 2018. Added Trump this past February : ""Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crooked's lawyer!"" And this one from March : ""Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!""

In short: Hell hath no fury like Donald Trump scorned."
Trump rips Dems' emotional press conference on Israel: ‘I don’t buy Rep. Tlaib’s tears’,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rips-squad-members-emotional-press-conference-on-israel-i-dont-buy-rep-tlaibs-tears,"President Trump tore into Rep. Rashida Tlaib on Tuesday for her emotional press conference alongside Rep. Ilhan Omar in which they condemned Israel for blocking a planned trip, calling the Michigan congresswoman an anti-Semite and saying he doesn't ""buy Rep. Tlaib’s tears.""

Tlaib and Omar, D-Minn., a day earlier had called for retaliatory measures, urging Congress to “conduct oversight” regarding U.S. aid to Israel as Tlaib decried the conditions her Palestinian relatives live under.

TLAIB GETS EMOTIONAL AS OMAR CALLS FOR CONGRESS TO ACT OVER ISRAEL TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS

Referencing recent conversations with her Palestinian grandmother, whom she had planned to visit before deciding she did not want to abide by Israel's restrictions, Tlaib choked up: “She said I’m her dream manifested. I’m her free bird so why would I come back and be caged and bow down?”

Trump, who has feuded with Tlaib ever since she issued a profanity-laced call for his impeachment upon joining Congress, suggested Tuesday the moment wasn't genuine.

“Sorry, I don’t buy Rep. Tlaib’s tears. I have watched her violence, craziness and, most importantly, WORDS, for far too long,” the president tweeted. “Now tears? She hates Israel and all Jewish people. She is an anti-Semite. She and her 3 friends are the new face of the Democrat Party. Live with it!”

Israel created a firestorm last week when it decided not to let Tlaib and Omar visit the Jewish state due to their support for boycotting Israel. Pro-Israel lobby AIPAC and even Democrats known to be pro-Israel -- like New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer -- criticized that decision.

MIFTAH GROUP THAT PLANNED TLAIB-OMAR ISRAEL TRIP ONCE REFERRED TO SUICIDE BOMBING AS SACRIFICE 'FOR THE CAUSE'

But Tlaib subsequently drew criticism when, after getting Israel's permission to see her grandmother in the West Bank, she abruptly called off the trip -- apparently unwilling to abide by restrictions on promoting Israel boycotts.

During Monday’s press conference, Tlaib stood by her decision as she also discussed her experiences visiting Jerusalem as a child.

“As a young girl visiting Palestine to see my grandparents and extended family, I watched as my mother had to go through dehumanizing checkpoints – even though she was a United States citizen and a proud American,” she said.

Meanwhile, Omar said lawmakers “have a responsibility to conduct oversight over our government’s foreign policy and what happens with the millions of dollars we send in aid.”

When Israel first announced the decision not to let Tlaib and Omar visit the country, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited their itinerary, which he said revealed that the trip’s “sole objective is to strengthen the boycott against us and deny Israel's legitimacy.”

Netanyahu also noted that the trip was organized by the Palestinian organization Miftah, which has a history of supporting the movement to boycott Israel and has even referred to suicide bombers as “sacrificing their lives for the cause.”

Republicans start to sour on gun control laws after Trump's reversal,https://www.politico.com,['Burgess Everett'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/20/trump-gun-control-reversal-1469282,"“I don’t anticipate we’re going to pass a federal red flag law,” said Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson. | Cliff Owen/AP Photo congress Republicans start to sour on gun control laws after Trump's reversal

Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson is casting major doubt on the prospects of significant gun regulations passing this fall, the latest sign that the effort to pass new firearm laws is starting to falter.

The Wisconsin Republican said that a background checks measure based on the bill written by Sens. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and a national ""red flag"" bill are both unlikely to pass. He was open to GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham’s bill that would establish a red flag grant program, but said the Senate would need to “attach to those grants very strict guidelines in terms of due process.”

Story Continued Below

“I really don’t see the dynamic having really changed there much,” Johnson said of an effort to strengthen background checks during gun sales, which generally polls at around 90 percent. “I don’t anticipate we’re going to pass a federal red flag law.

“There are a lot of downsides to passing more legislation that doesn’t do anything positive,” Johnson added.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly emphasized there are already strong background checks on the books, an apparent reversal from his drive to push his party on tightening background checks. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi assailed Trump for the turnabout, with Schumer calling it “heartbreaking.” They are pushing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to take up the House-passed universal background checks bill, which lacks GOP support in the Senate.

But Trump's leadership of the GOP is what's most important in the Republican Senate. And he is splashing the latest gun safety push with cold water as the Senate prepares to come back into session in early September.

On Tuesday the president reiterated that the existing background check system is muscular, telling reporters that ""we have very, very strong background checks right now."" Asked if he supports the House-passed legislation, he replied: “I’m not going to get into that.”

The president said he's having ""meaningful"" talks with Democrats and wasn't ruling anything out but made clear that his conservative political base is skeptical of new regulations — so he is too.

""A lot of the people that put me where I am, are strong believers in the Second Amendment, and I am also. And we have to be very careful about that. You know, they call it the slippery slope. All of a sudden everything gets taken away,"" Trump told reporters. ""We're not going to let that happen.""

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) spoke to Trump last week and said the president made a commitment to work in a bipartisan way on a background checks bill that can pass the Senate. Murphy said until he hears from Trump himself, he's 'not willing to concede that history repeated itself and that he has walked away from the commitment he made.""

But Johnson said Trump’s most recent comments are just reflecting the reality of GOP voters and the current political dynamics.

“If he’s talking to the same people I’d be talking to, he’d probably be a little bit more careful in terms of saying: ‘This is for sure what’s going to happen,’” Johnson said of background checks.

Still, the president hasn’t ruled out action and a number of Republicans are holding out hope that multiple mass shootings in a short span of time has changed the political dynamic.

“We need to do something to show that we’re doing something rather than just kicking it down the road,” said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), who has spoken to Toomey and believes McConnell is open to putting something on the floor if it can become law.

While a number of Republicans like Braun have expressed some openness to new gun regulations, enhanced background checks will struggle to attract 60 votes in the Senate, where it will need at least 13 GOP supporters. Red flag legislation also divides Republicans, with some already saying they have yet to see anything they would support.

""I'm going to look at everything we looked at — everything,"" Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) told reporters last week. ""I'm a Second Amendment supporter. I'm a member of the NRA. So I'm not ... taking away people's guns.”

Trump could change that dynamic, of course, with a weakened National Rifle Association and his iron grip over the party. But historically, he’s shown little appetite to ultimately go against conservatives on guns.

That’s why some Republicans are starting to bet on minimal action, if that.

“All I can really tell you is what I hear in Wisconsin: The debate really hasn’t changed at all,” Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. “I realize the clamor and I realize the polling, but I don’t think that really assesses peoples’ knowledge of what we’re really talking about here.”

Trump Expected to Nominate Pompeo Deputy to Be Ambassador to Russia,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Michael Crowley']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/politics/john-sullivan-trump-russia-ambassador.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to name John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, to be the next ambassador to Russia, replacing Jon Huntsman Jr. as his liaison to Moscow, a senior administration official said. The post of ambassador to Moscow is a prestigious diplomatic position that is always challenging, but even more so after a two-year federal investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible ties to the Kremlin.

Mr. Sullivan has been confirmed once by the Senate. Should Mr. Trump move ahead with his appointment, he will face a new hearing.

Officials at the White House and State Department declined to comment.

The role is particularly delicate given the frenzy over questions about Mr. Trump’s links with Russia, dating to the 2016 campaign and his years as a businessman, and the president’s continued efforts to build a working relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin despite Russia’s aggressive actions around the world, including attempts to interfere with elections in the United States.

Mr. Sullivan, who has served as a senior lawyer in other government departments, would come to the post with limited diplomatic experience dealing with Moscow, which practices a notoriously canny brand of diplomacy."
"President Trump decision to end DACA was lawful, Justice Department says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-decision-to-end-daca-was-lawful-justice-department-supreme-court,"The Justice Department submitted a legal brief to the Supreme Court Monday that stated President Trump acted lawfully when he decided to end the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA in September of 2017, according to a new report.

The Department of Homeland Security, “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court late Monday.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN END DACA PROGRAM

The Supreme Court will begin to hear arguments in November. A ruling is expected in the presidential election year, putting the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues of debates. A decision in favor of Trump would allow for the president to deport more than one million young adults residing in the U.S. under DACA protection, the New York Times reported.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was created under an executive order in 2012. The program gives some illegal immigrants -- known as ""Dreamers"" -- who were brought to the United States as children-- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year reprieve from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program, but federal courts have ruled that the phase-out could not apply retroactively and that the program should be restarted.

The White House fought back on those decisions, saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy. Federal appeals courts around the country have rejected efforts by the federal government to move ahead with phasing out the Obama-era program.

DACA proponents have also argued that Trump’s planned termination of the program violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed, as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees.

A decision from the Supreme Court to end DACA could galvanize young Americans to ensure Trump does not see another four years in the White House, the Times report stated. On the other hand, if the Court chooses to continue the Obama-era program, conservatives could argue Trump needs another four years to fulfill his campaign promises on immigration.

"The Justice Department is working with states on tech investigation, antitrust chief says",https://www.theverge.com,['Aug'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20814033/justice-department-makan-delrahim-tech-facebook-google-antitrust-law-states,"The Justice Department is working alongside state attorneys general to investigate whether tech platforms like Facebook and Google are stifling competition in the industry, the department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, said.

The statement came only a day after The Wall Street Journal reported that a group of states would be moving forward with an antitrust investigation into the tech sector that could be formally announced later this month. That new state-led probe would put more pressure on tech companies, some of which are already under investigation for potentially anti-competitive behavior by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

The FTC’s own antitrust investigation into Facebook could finish up as soon as next year, FTC chair Joe Simons said on Monday. “Any significant case that I’m trying to emphasize,” Simons said. “I would want to be out before the election.”

“I think we just have to have proper, timely and aggressive enforcement of the antitrust laws.”

Delrahim’s comments came during an interview at a Tech Policy Institute conference in Colorado on Tuesday. When asked if Congress should update its current antitrust law to more sufficiently govern the tech industry, Delrahim told reporters, “I don’t think so at this time. I think the laws we have are quite flexible. I think we just have to have proper, timely and aggressive enforcement of the antitrust laws.”

His comments counter some of what Democrats in the House of Representatives have said in recent months. Earlier this year, the House Judiciary Committee’s panel on antitrust opened an investigation into major tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon in hopes of identifying how current law could be updated to better control the tech sector.

“After four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases,” the House Judiciary antitrust chairman David Cicilline (D-RI) said in a statement at the time, “it is critical that Congress step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or whether we need new legislation to respond to this challenge.”

The Justice Department opened up its “broad” review of the tech sector in July, but little has bubbled to the surface regarding what exactly the officials are investigating. Delrahim suggested that the department is still requesting and documents and that it “might be issuing compulsory process on some third parties who may or may not need it.”

Delrahim also touched on whether antitrust law could be used to address concerns Republicans have voiced over the past few months regarding alleged “conservative bias” on platforms. “It depends if it’s a competition question,” Delrahim told reporters. “If you have more competition, consumers may have different outlets to go to when a particular quality of a company may not be to their liking.”"
Justice Dept. again sides with Trump over House in personal financial records fight,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/politics/justice-trump-financial-records/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration's Justice Department has again taken President Donald Trump's side in a fight between him -- as a private citizen -- and the US House of Representatives over subpoenas for his personal financial records.

The Justice Department argues the two banks shouldn't have to hand over the subpoenaed information and accuses lawmakers of not taking the correct steps to seek the documents.

This is the first time the Justice Department has spoken up in this subpoena fight. Its foray into the case comes as House Democrats' attempts heat up to get Trump's financial records and to consider formal impeachment proceedings of the President.

On Friday, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to consider whether two banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, will have to turn over Trump's information to House committees. Judge Jon Newman, a Jimmy Carter appointee, and Judges Debra Ann Livingston and Peter Hall, both appointed by President George W. Bush, will hear the arguments.

In its legal brief Monday, the Justice Department broadly criticizes how the House authorized the subpoenas before taking a full House vote. They also allege that House Democrats are unfairly targeting the President.

Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan expected to be selected for US ambassador to Russia,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jim Acosta', 'Caroline Kelly', 'Kylie Atwood']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/john-sullivan-us-ambassador-to-russia/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump is expected to select Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan to replace Jon Huntsman as US Ambassador to Russia , according to a White House official.

CNN reported earlier this month that Huntsman has submitted his resignation letter to Trump and plans to move back home to Utah, according to a source familiar with his thinking.

Sullivan was a partner at Mayer Brown in Washington and co-chaired the law firm's national security practice before being nominated as former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's deputy in April 2017. He previously served as chairman of the United States-Iraq Business Dialogue, a government advisory committee that dealt with US-Iraq economic relations.

Sullivan also held senior positions at the Justice, Defense and Commerce departments, including as deputy secretary and general counsel at Commerce, deputy general counsel at Defense and counselor to Assistant Attorney General J. Michael Luttig.

Trump told reporters on Tuesday that Sullivan ""very well could be"" the next US ambassador to Russia.

""He's somebody that's being put up and respected. To Russia? Yeah. Very respected,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked if Sullivan is his pick to replace Huntsman.

""Well I know that (Secretary of State) Mike Pompeo likes him very much and he's very respected. He could very well be, yeah,"" Trump continued.

However, two sources tell CNN that Sullivan is well-liked at the State Department but is not inside Pompeo's inner circle.

Sullivan has often felt out of the loop and wanted a new post. Despite having little experience when it comes to Russia, Sullivan lobbied to get this job and Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton ended up supporting him.

The sources said Pompeo and Bolton recognize that the US ambassador to Russia is a challenging role, but not one that holds a lot of significance in this administration.

Sullivan has defended the President's strategy in Russia, telling CNN's Christiane Amanpour last year before Trump's visit with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Trump wanted ""to engage with"" the Russian president.

""But our purpose is not to engage for purposes of surrendering our principles,"" Sullivan said. ""The President's purpose is to engage with President Putin, so that we can discuss these important issues, whether it's Eastern Ukraine, Crimea, arms control, Syria. There are so many issues on which we need to engage with the Russians and have been.""

Sullivan has very little experience when it comes to Russia. He led the US delegation that met with Russian officials last month in Geneva on arms control. He impressed State Department officials on that trip who called him a quick learn when it came to the highly technical nature of arms control.

During his first year as deputy, Sullivan also pushed back against ""twisted"" reports of deep unhappiness with Tillerson in the face of a redesign and looming cuts that could slash the country's oldest Cabinet agency by as much as 30%.

Huntsman's resignation is effective October 3 and there is some speculation that he is planning to run for governor of Utah, a role he previous served in from 2005 to 2009. However, a source close to Huntsman told CNN that decision is still up in the air, saying, ""We shall see, it's been a long two years.""

Special Representative to North Korea Steve Biegun, who was also on the short list for the Russia ambassador job, stayed on the DPRK portfolio given the escalating tension between the US and North Korea."
"Trump Has Right to End DACA, Justice Dept. Tells Supreme Court",https://www.nytimes.com,['Michael D. Shear'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/us/politics/daca-trump.html,"WASHINGTON — Justice Department lawyers told the Supreme Court on Monday that President Trump acted lawfully in September 2017 when he decided to end an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation.

In a legal brief submitted to the court, the lawyers asserted that the president was fully within his rights to eliminate the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and said the lower courts were mistaken when they said Mr. Trump’s action almost two years ago was arbitrary.

The Department of Homeland Security “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” the lawyers argued, disputing the conclusions by the lower court judges about the three reasons the administration gave for ending the program. “None of those three grounds is remotely arbitrary or capricious, let alone all three.”

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments about the fate of the program in November. The justices could decide the case next spring or summer, just as the presidential election campaign is in full swing."
State AGs prepare antitrust investigation into tech firms,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-ags-prepare-antitrust-investigation-into-tech-firms,"The top law enforcement officers in several states are gearing up to launch an antitrust investigation of Silicon Valley’s biggest firms, according to multiple reports, adding to the scrutiny tech companies are already facing from federal regulators.

The investigation is expected to get off the ground as soon as next month and would follow a meeting representatives from states had with antitrust officials from the Justice Department last month.

A group of state attorneys general plan to soon issue civil investigative demands to the tech companies, and the investigation will examine whether Silicon Valley’s most powerful firms suppressed competition in the tech industry.

It’s unclear how many states are expected to participate and whether it will be a bipartisan group, but the Wall Street Journal reported as many as 20 attorneys general could join the effort.

After last month’s meeting at the Justice Department, the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said a group of eight state attorneys general met with Attorney General William Barr to discuss “the real concerns consumers across the country have with big tech companies stifling competition on the internet.”

Paxton’s office said the states are “considering a range of possible antitrust actions against such companies.”

An investigation into big tech companies spearheaded by the states would run alongside investigations launched by the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission into anticompetitive behavior by leading internet companies.

The Justice Department said last month it had opened a sweeping antitrust review into “market-leading online platforms,” which is likely to include Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The Federal Trade Commission launched a technology task force in February designed to monitor competition in the tech sector and investigate any possible anticompetitive conduct.

The commission also opened an antitrust investigation into Facebook, the social media company acknowledged in financial filings last month.

The inquiries from the federal government come alongside continued efforts in Congress to examine the practices of some of the country’s biggest technology companies.

To address the growing dominance of Silicon Valley firms and whether they have shut smaller competitors out of the marketplace, 2020 Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up the Facebook, Amazon, and Google, while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed antitrust action against big tech companies."
Former US attorney expects 'blockbuster' FISA abuse report from DOJ inspector general,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-us-attorney-expects-blockbuster-fisa-abuse-report-from-doj-inspector-general,"Former U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis predicted the Justice Department inspector general's report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses will be ""hard-hitting,"" with multiple recommendations for prosecution.

During an interview Monday on Fox News, Lewis said he used to work with Inspector General Michael Horowitz at the Justice Department and called him as ""tough as a nail."" Lewis added, ""He’s tough, he is smart, and I think the report will be a blockbuster."" He expects Horowitz's findings to make special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election ""look like a sixth grade book report.""

Asked to explain why, Lewis said, ""It’s going to come out. It’s going to be hard-hitting. [Horowitz] spent almost two years interviewing various people — witnesses. Looking at what he describes [as] almost a million documents. And I think he’s going to make recommendations regarding prosecution and turn this whole FISA — this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — the submissions, I think he will turn them on their head.""

British ex-spy Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

[Analysis: Who and what the Horowitz report is likely to cover]

Although some Trump allies have expressed high expectations for Horowitz's report and Attorney General William Barr's review of the origins of the Russia investigation, others are preaching caution. ""Republicans usually set the bar so high that when we don't meet it, the media narrative then becomes Republicans don't even own their promises. Just promise a fair investigation that goes wherever the facts take us,"" former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy said on Fox News last month.

Lewis, who served with Barr at the Justice Department under President George H.W. Bush, was reacting to an interview Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham did over the weekend in which he said he believes the IG report would be “ugly and damning” for the DOJ and its handling of the Russia investigation.

Graham said he wants ""as much as possible"" declassified from Horowitz's report as possible, but former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu warned former FBI Director Christopher Wray might fight to keep its contents classified because he has been ""co-opted by the FBI bureaucracy.""

Lewis said he does not agree with Sununu's assessment, calling Wray a ""good, honest broker,"" but advised the FBI chief to ""err on the side of transparency"" because he suspects the FISA Court may have been used by the FBI to target President Trump's 2016 campaign.

Asked where the investigation is headed, Lewis said former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Andrew McCabe ought to be ""worried"" about submissions that were made to the FISA Court. Both Strzok and McCabe filed separate lawsuits against the DOJ and FBI claiming they were subject to politically motivated firings last year.

He also said former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and former national security adviser Michael Flynn should be be ""sort of happy"" because Horowitz's report might be used to help them overturn their convictions, stemming from Mueller's investigation, for lying to FBI investigators."
Justice Dept. tells Supreme Court decision to end DACA was lawful,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Cnn Supreme Court Reporter']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/justice-department-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-supreme-court/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department told the Supreme Court late Monday night that the Trump administration acted lawfully when it decided in 2017 to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which protects undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children from deportation.

""At best, DACA is legally questionable,"" Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued in legal briefs. ""At worst, it is illegal.""

Francisco stressed that the executive branch was within its authority to phase out the Obama-era program and that the lower courts ""erred"" in ""second-guessing"" the Department of Homeland Security's ""entirely rational judgment to stop facilitating ongoing violations of federal law on a massive scale.""

As things stand, two nationwide preliminary injunctions issued by lower courts have forced DHS to continue to allow renewals in the program for nearly two years.

The legal brief comes as the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case on November 12. The program has become a focal point in the debate over Trump's proposed US-Mexico border wall and efforts to crack down on immigration. A decision siding with the administration could strip protections for nearly 700,000 so-called Dreamers in a case that will come down in the heat of the next election.

Back in 2017, the Trump administration announced it was going to phase out DACA, which it said had been created ""without proper statutory authority.""

The move was immediately challenged in court by the University of California, a handful of states and DACA recipients who argued that the phase-out violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs how agencies can establish regulations.

Courts agreed and issued nationwide injunctions that allowed renewals in the program to continue.

""We conclude,"" wrote a panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, that the rescission of DACA ""is arbitrary, capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law.""

The Trump administration appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and last June, the justices agreed to hear the appeal for the upcoming term.

At issue before the Supreme Court is not the legality of the program but how the administration decided to wind it down.

In the new briefs, Francisco argues that the decision to terminate the program was reasonable because the Department of Homeland Security had ""serious doubts"" about its legality.

USDA cuts payments promised to researchers as agency uproots to Kansas City,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458129-usda-cuts-payments-promised-to-researchers-as-agency-uproots-to,"A union for employees at the research wings of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) says the agency has reneged on payments promised to employees, rolling back assistance to those who will be forced out of the agency if they do not agree to move to the Kansas City area.

“Due to the volume of applications and in an effort to afford all employees who applied the opportunity to receive the incentive payment, the amount approved for all applicants has changed from $25,000 to $10,000,” the USDA wrote on a form for employees applying for the assistance.

USDA announced in June that it would be moving its two research agencies to Kansas City.

Employees at both the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) unionized in the wake of the agency's relocation plans, and the USDA has been heavily criticized by lawmakers for the short timeline and chaos surrounding the decision.

Two-thirds of staff at the two agencies said they would face termination from the agency rather than uproot.

Those departing employees were expecting buyouts of $25,000, only to learn from the USDA that they’d be reducing the payout in light of the number of employees fleeing the agency.

“Employees now have less than a week to decide whether to accept the reduced buyout, which also bars them for working at another federal agency for five years. Many of these employees have spent their careers devoted to agricultural research and furthering their agencies’ missions, and they deserve to be treated better than this,” American Federation of Government Employees President J. David Cox Sr. said in a statement. “It’s hard to imagine USDA management finding more ways to demoralize the workers at these two agencies, yet they continue to top themselves at every turn.”

USDA said the change in the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments (VSIP) was part of an effort to make sure all employees would be able to get a payout.

“In keeping consistent with the Secretary’s commitment to “Do Right” by our employees, the Department’s priority was to offer a standard VSIP to every eligible employee who applied, instead of on a first come first serve basis,” an agency spokesperson said in an email to The Hill.

The agency has previously said the move is designed to move employees closer to stakeholders — an argument ERS and NIFA employees say makes no sense as they work primarily with lawmakers and universities across the country.

The agency has been heavily criticized for poor planning tied to the move.

Numerous lawmakers have spoken out against USDA’s plans, viewing it as a brain drain that would harm the agencies' missions.

Byron Allen Rips Comcast & Donald Trump’s DOJ For “Institutionalized Racism” As SCOTUS Showdown Looms,https://deadline.com,"['Dominic Patten Mike Fleming Jr', 'Dominic Patten', 'Mike Fleming Jr']",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://deadline.com/2019/08/byron-allen-comcast-civil-rights-lawsuit-supreme-court-filing-reaction-doj-donald-trump-1202671369/,"With the nation's highest court aiming to look at the ongoing lawsuit between the NBCU owner & Entertainment Studios, the DOJ has now waded in

EXCLUSIVE: Heading towards a $20 billion showdown with Comcast at the U.S. Supreme Court this fall in his long running racial discrimination lawsuit against the media giant, Byron Allen today tore into the Brian Roberts-run behemoth and an 11th hour intervention by the Department of Justice

“This is historic,” the Entertainment Studios boss said of the August 15 brief filed by the feds seeking to tighten the definitions of a Reconstruction Era statute in Comcast’s favor. “Donald Trump’s DOJ and Comcast are working together to destroy a civil rights statute in the U.S. Supreme Court.”

“You have one of the biggest media companies in the world, which has been beating up Donald Trump for racism, and now they are saying, we will work together to maintain institutionalized racism in America, in this Amicus Brief they delivered last Thursday,” Allen asserted in the starkest of terms of the now William Barr-run DOJ and its move to tip the scales for Comcast as the parties await a November 13 hearing before the nine Justices.

The newly declared emphasis by the DOJ now puts a more than 150-year law in a distinctly different light from how Allen’s lawyers have been reading it, as the Department’s filing openly says.

“Although the statute does not expressly describe the necessary causal link between a plaintiff ’s race and a defendant’s refusal to contract, the text is most naturally read to require but-for causation, and background common-law principles confirm that a but-for rule applies,” the incensory submission last week from Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Assistant AG Joseph Hunt argues (read it here).

“The court of appeals erred in concluding otherwise,” the DOJ brass state of lower court ruling in February in the huge money suit that Allen first filed in early 2015, along with a $10 billion suit against Charter Communications several months later. Comcast and Charter sought to have the matter dismissed. When they failed in that effort to end a case that they framed as a form of corporate expression, the MSNBC-owner took the battle to Chief Justice John Roberts and the Associate Justices.

The government detailed its POV by saying last week that “because ‘making’ a contract means entering a contract, a person does not enjoy ‘the same right’ guaranteed by Section 1981 if race prevents her from entering a contract that a similarly situated white person would have entered. And the inverse is also true.”

The feds’ brief leaning into the law to require that Entertainment Studios has to prove that race was not merely a motivating factor, as 9th Circuit interpreted the statute earlier this summer. Now, under the DOJ’s take of the stature, Allen’s lawyers could be required to prove that race was absolutely only reason that Comcast didn’t place the company’s channels on its distribution services and platforms.

For Allen, the result is a near impossible standard for Entertainment Studios or any other person or entity availing themselves of the statute as it presently stands.

“They said, we need to go to the Supreme Court and change the definition of the statute so African Americans cannot use it and we can compromise everyone’s civil rights,” Allen told Deadline of the sudden paperwork by the DOJ, offering the Comcast and their well-funded lobbyists in D.C. an advantage at the Supreme Court.

“Comcast, in the name of profits, is compromising everyone’s civil rights,” the CEO and Joe Biden-donor proclaimed. “If you think you have a good case, take me to court. Deal with me. Don’t jeopardize everybody’s civil rights.”

Contacted by Deadline, Comcast had no comment on the DOJ brief or Allen’s remarks about the filing. Entertainment Studios themselves have until next month to respond to the feds’ filing and Comcast’s own docket entry citing the Appeal Court reading of the post-Civil War statute as too broad.

Following a surprising reversal of fortune this winter where the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal essentially brought the case back to life, SCOTUS agreed in June that they would review the matter after a request by Philadelphia-based and very well politically connected Comcast.

With the initial filing of his cases in 2015 and 2016, Allen’s contention has been that both Comcast and Charter violated the Civil Rights Act after he attempted for years to get the cable giants to carry his networks, which were available to millions of television viewers through rival distributors including Verizon, the now AT&T-owned DirecTV and DISH. The African-American executive said he has been repeatedly rebuffed and jerked around and states clearly that he believes race played a factor because Entertainment Studios is a fully minority owned entity.

Both Comcast and Charter in their respective suits have said race was not a factor in the carriage deals or lack there of.

Allen and Entertainment Studios are represented in the case by a team from Miller Bardondess LLP and University of California Berkley School of Law’s Erwin Chemerinsky. Attorneys from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP are working for Comcast in the matter."

US Commerce Department adds 46 Huawei affiliates to entity list – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/us-commerce-department-adds-46-huawei-affiliates-to-entity-list/,"Update: Huawei has responded to the DoC’s move,

We oppose the US Commerce Department’s decision to add another 46 Huawei affiliates to the Entity List. It’s clear that this decision, made at this particular time, is politically motivated and has nothing to do with national security. These actions violate the basic principles of free market competition. They are in no one’s interests, including US companies. Attempts to suppress Huawei’s business won’t help the United States achieve technological leadership. We call on the US government to put an end to this unjust treatment and remove Huawei from the Entity List.

The United States Department of Commerce announced this morning the addition of 46 Huawei affiliates to its Entity List. Effective today, the companies join more than 100 entries added to the list over connections to the embattled Chinese consumer electronics giant.

The DoC also used this morning’s news to announce an extension of its Temporary General License (TGL), which affords people and companies a limited time use of goods from Huawei and affiliate companies in order to essentially wean them off of Huawei networking equipment. The license, which offers “narrow exceptions” is set to expire 90 days from today.

In a statement provided to the press, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross stated, “As we continue to urge consumers to transition away from Huawei’s products, we recognize that more time is necessary to prevent any disruption. Simultaneously, we are constantly working at the Department to ensure that any exports to Huawei and its affiliates do not violate the terms of the Entity Listing or Temporary General License.”

Huawei has, of course, long denied any ties to security or spying accusations from the U.S. government. Recently, stories, including alleged ties to African government spying, have continued to shine a light on concerns about the company’s ties to the Chinese government. Those concerns have led to Huawei’s addition to the entities list, along with U.S. government bans on buying equipment.

Per the DoC:

Huawei was added to the Entity List after the Department concluded that the company is engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, including alleged violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), conspiracy to violate IEEPA by providing prohibited financial services to Iran, and obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation of those alleged violations of U.S. sanctions, among other illicit activities.

Losing access to American software and hardware could, in turn, have a devastating impact on the company. Notably, Huawei recently unveiled HarmonyOS. The new mobile operating system is not yet an Android replacement, but is believed by many to be part of a long-term strategy to wean itself off of dependence on Google.

We have reached out to Huawei for comment."

The issue, coupled with whether the law also protects claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation, is of critical importance to LGBT rights supporters who are seeking broadened protections.

The case will be heard on October 8, and the decision will come down in the heat of the presidential campaign. A major fact as well will be that Justice Anthony Kennedy, who often voted in favor of the LGBT community, is no longer on the court, and has been replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Lindsey Graham says Horowitz FISA report will be 'ugly and damning' for DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-18-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-says-horowitz-fisa-report-will-be-ugly-and-damning-for-doj,"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina predicted Sunday that the upcoming report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act would be “ugly and damning” for the DOJ.

The Republican Senate Judiciary chairman spoke with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures, saying the much-anticipated Horowitz report was “coming out in weeks, not days, not months.” In explaining to Bartiromo why the release of the report had been repeatedly delayed — Attorney General William Barr predicted early this year it would come out in May or June — Graham said “every time you turn around you find something new.”

Graham predicted Horowitz would have a lot to say about ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" at the FBI and DOJ, and would likely have recommendations about what should be done to fix it.





Graham also said once Horowitz finishes his report, it will be sent to the Justice Department for a review for any classified information. The senator said he was meeting with Barr next week to ensure as much of the report as possible is made public.

“I want to declassify as much as possible,” Graham said. “I want the American public to hear the story. I want all of this information to come out. I don’t want people to believe what I say about it — I want them to read for themselves how bad it was.”

""I believe the Horowitz report is going to be ugly and damning regarding the Department of Justice handling of the Russia probe,"" Graham added.

The FBI and DOJ obtained four FISA warrants and renewals against Trump campaign associate Carter Page beginning in October 2016 through June 2017. The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the DOJ and FBI made extensive use of the dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Clinton campaign hired the firm through Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm, and the campaign was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race. Steele’s funding from Democrats was never revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

And newly released FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, even after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from ""Russian conspiracy theories."" Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI too.

Graham explained today that Horowitz “is doing a very in-depth dive about the FISA warrant application” and is looking into “the behavior regarding the counterintelligence operation.” Graham said he believed the evidence would show the FBI’s FISA filings were “a fraud on the court.”

The senator specifically pointed to the FBI being “on notice” that Steele “hated Trump, that he was an unreliable informant,” as well as Steele’s information — “unverified to this day” — allegedly coming from Russian sources and allegedly exonerating nonpublic transcripts of interviews of Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos with an FBI informant, likely Cambridge professor Stefan Halper.

The interactions that Papadopoulos had with the mysterious Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud allegedly led to the FBI opening an inquiry into Trump in July 2016. Mifsud allegedly told Papadopoulos in the spring of 2016 about the Russians having “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. Papadopoulos then allegedly mentioned this to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who later passed the information along to the FBI, triggering what the FBI dubbed “Crossfire Hurricane.” Republicans now say exonerating information about Papadopoulos was concealed from the FISA Court.

“I want it all out,” Graham emphasized. “I want people to see how off the rails this investigation got, and I want people to be held accountable. And I am patient, I’m not in a hurry to do it, I want to do it right.”"
USDA: National THC test for hemp ‘as challenging as you think it is’,https://hempindustrydaily.com,['Et On'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://hempindustrydaily.com/usda-national-thc-test-for-hemp-as-challenging-as-you-think-it-is/,"Federal agriculture authorities are struggling to craft a nationwide THC testing standard so that state and local regulators can tell hemp from marijuana, complicating the release of standardized production rules, according to an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

William Richmond, head of the Specialty Crops Program in the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, told a group of dietary-supplement and CBD business owners last week the agency hoped to have hemp rules prepared by now.

But he said the agency is grappling with the Farm Bill‘s requirement for a national THC testing protocol “using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods.”

“We need to have testing procedures in place,” he said. Coming up with reliable testing methods, he added, is “as complicated as you think it is.”

Richmond gave no timeline for the USDA finishing its work, but he said after his speech the USDA still plans to have rules done in time for the 2020 growing season,

The USDA has been “bombarded with questions” about hemp, he added, and is “working hard to issue the hemp regulations.”

He reminded the CBD companies that the USDA’s hemp regulations won’t be final until the industry has had an opportunity to see them and share feedback.

“Tell us what we got right – and, more important, tell us what we got wrong, because we have the opportunity to fix it,” Richmond said.

Which THC?

THC testing has proved a major challenge in moving the hemp industry to a standardized commodity.

Law enforcement authorities from Texas to Florida have said they don’t have tests that can differentiate between legal hemp and illegal marijuana, and the patchwork of testing standards is complicating the Farm Bill’s goal of allowing nationwide commerce for the new crop.

“What we grow in Oregon needs to be able to go to Colorado, to Kentucky, to whatever state and not run into issues with law enforcement,” said Sunny Summers, who coordinates hemp policy for the Oregon Department of Agriculture.

She also said during her talk at a CBD conference in Denver sponsored by the American Herbal Products Association that THC testing is “a big, big situation that as an industry we need to deal with.”

The Farm Bill’s direction, she said, doesn’t tell states how to prepare tests “using post-decarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods.”

“This is the No. 1 issue that I have – what the heck does that mean?” Summers said. “What is THC? Which version?”

Industry fears

THC testing protocols coming from the USDA could dramatically shake up the growing hemp industry, growers say.

That’s because most U.S. hemp farmers are producing cultivars rich in cannabinoids other than THC – the same types of hemp most likely to violate THC limits depending how and when they are tested.

If post-decarboxylized tests are used, “most of the cultivars and most of the varieties that we’re currently using in the U.S. would no longer be defined as hemp,” said Matt Cyrus, who raises hemp along with hay and cattle in Sisters, Oregon.

Cyrus told Hemp Industry Daily that the USDA’s looming hemp rules could throw many entrepreneurs back to the black market, depending on the testing standard.

“In theory, everybody who has hemp biomass on hand anywhere in the U.S. … would suddenly be outside the law,” said Cyrus, who is also president of the Deschutes County (Oregon) Farm Bureau.

USDA wants to make it easy

Richmond of the USDA told dietary supplement manufacturers that the agency understands how complex it is to set a national THC testing standard, but he promised that federal authorities are scrambling to give farmers and state and local regulators a solution that simplifies interstate hemp commerce.

“Our goal is to provide a consistent, easy-to-follow regulatory framework around hemp production,” he said.

“I can’t speak to whether that means a hard, prescriptive set of requirements for everybody at this stage. But our goal is to provide consistent standards that make sense for growers and for the industry.”"
Former VA physician charged with the deaths of three veterans,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'August At Pm']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-va-physician-charged-with-the-deaths-of-three-veterans/2019/08/20/0119ea16-c345-11e9-9986-1fb3e4397be4_story.html,"Federal prosecutors on Tuesday charged a former Veterans Affairs pathologist with the deaths of three veterans and a scheme to cover up years of drug and alcohol use on the job that caused him to misread thousands of fluid and tissue samples of ill patients.

Robert Morris Levy was indicted on three counts of involuntary manslaughter and 28 counts of mail fraud, wire fraud and false statements to law enforcement officials. The Department of Veterans Affairs has told members of Congress and investigators that Levy was responsible for at least 15 deaths and the inappropriate treatment of many other patients.

During 12 years as chief pathologist here and in leadership roles on multiple oversight boards and medical committees, Levy, 53, read almost 34,000 pa­thol­ogy slides of aging veterans. He had their lives in his hands, prosectors said in unsealing their indictment. But his addiction and attempts to cover it up even after VA paid for a lengthy inpatient treatment program led to multiple deaths and other life-threatening trauma for veterans, they said.

“Diagnoses rendered by Levy and the information he entered in patients’ medical records largely influenced decisions about the course of medical treatment” for patients at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks, the indictment said.

“Doctors and other medical providers at [the medical center] relied upon the accuracy of the diagnoses,” prosecutors charged. The indictment was unsealed at a news conference by Duane Kees, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. Levy is an Air Force veteran who was fired from VA last year.

The charges unsealed Tuesday mark a rare criminal case against a physician, in or out of government, in a profession where mistakes or incidents of negligence are most often addressed in civil court through malpractice claims, authorities said.

The case already is prompting a reckoning and questions of oversight for the country’s largest medical system — a sprawling, decentralized network of 1,200 hospitals and smaller clinics that serve 9 million veterans a year.

From 2005 to 2017, Levy read slides and assisted radiologists, surgeons and other physicians during procedures called “needle biopsies,” rendering clinical diagnoses for about 24,000 veterans.

They were patients from rural and often low-income communities of northwest Arkansas, southwest Missouri and eastern Oklahoma. He did not treat veterans in person but from his pa­thol­ogy lab on the third floor of Specialty Building 21 in the back of the medical center’s campus. He was tasked with a crucial medical role — diagnosing cancer and other diseases in aging veterans who fought in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War or in Iraq and Afghanistan, and those who served but did not see combat.

Many of these veterans rely solely on VA for their medical care, lacking private insurance.

An 18-month review of Levy’s cases found that almost 10 percent of his diagnoses involved clinical errors, more than 10 times the normal misdiagnosis rate of 0.07 percent for pathologists.

Hundreds of the misdiagnoses were not serious, VA officials said. But the mistakes led to at least 15 deaths, authorities said, and other serious illnesses for veterans whose cancers or other illnesses were not diagnosed or were diagnosed when they should not have been, leading to unnecessary treatment.

Levy, appearing at his arraignment Tuesday in a federal courtroom here in a gray striped prison jumpsuit, pleaded not guilty. He awaited his turn on a crowded docket, slouched over and solemn, his hands shaking from time to time as if with tremors. Occasionally he glanced to the bank of prosecutors and investigators seated in the room.

Levy stood out: The other defendants, most facing drug charges, told the judge they had completed high school. When asked for his level of education, the pathologist, trained at the University of California and Emory University with a sub-specialty in hematopathology, responded, “MD”

Levy told Judge Erin Wiedemann he had secured an attorney only Monday. She set a trial date for Oct. 7, and Levy was returned by a U.S. marshal to the county jail in Fayetteville, where he has been since his arrest late last week.

VA fired Levy last year after an arrest for driving under the influence. But his termination followed a tumultuous tenure, particularly in recent years, during which his colleagues in the pa­thol­ogy lab complained that they witnessed erratic behavior from him while on the job. Their complaints went unheeded, the indictment alleges.

Following an incident of erratic behavior, Levy entered a VA program for impaired physicians in Mississippi in 2016 and returned to work. But a year later he appeared at a meeting of fellow pathologists and oncologists that he was chairing unable to stand and slurring his words, according to documents and interviews.

His medical privileges were suspended, but he continued to perform administrative work until the DUI arrest and was fired in April 2018.

At the heart of the case, say investigators, former employees and VA patients in northwest Arkansas interviewed by The Washington Post, is how 13 years of missed diagnoses, many of them of fatal diseases, went undetected and why distress calls from employees went unheeded.

VA has long struggled with issues of access to patient care and whether its physicians are vetted carefully enough for misconduct and mistakes that could endanger patients, when they are hired or on the job. Some said Levy’s impaired behavior on the job was well known for years but little was done to stop him.

Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), who with his colleagues in Arkansas’s delegation to Congress has aggressively monitored VA’s outreach to veterans affected by the case, said he is furious at what he described as a “lack of oversight.”

“Of all the medical professionals, the person you really don’t want messing up is a pathologist,” Westerman said in an interview. “If you have cancer, you want to know about it. If you don’t have it, you don’t want to be treated for it.

“There were poor procedures in place, or they weren’t followed like they should have been. Levy had a record of being impaired on the job and continued to evaluate cases.”

In a statement before Levy was charged, Kelvin Parks, director of the Fayetteville medical center, offered his “sincerest apology to the Veterans and family members negatively impacted by this now-fired former employee.”

“In instances where his conduct did not meet the high standards Veterans and taxpayers expect from us, we are holding ourselves accountable, letting Veterans and families know their options and keeping the community informed,” the statement said.

Parks said there was a “vulnerability” in the internal case review process that sometimes allowed supervisors to review their own cases. In the future, he said the hospital will have someone from the quality-control department manage and oversee all case reviews."

In July the EPA said it would allow sulfoxaflor to be used in ways barred during the Obama administration as well as on new crops where the pesticide had not been used before.

“Even for Trump’s EPA, which seems to measure success by pesticide-company profits, it’s stupefying to OK spraying a bee-killing poison across millions of acres of crops frequented by bees,” Lori Ann Burd, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s environmental health program, said in a statement. “While leading scientists and countries across the globe are calling for eliminating harmful bee-killing pesticides like sulfoxaflor, Team Trump is cheerfully promoting its use like a corporate PR firm. It’s nauseating.”

Burd said the pesticide will harm not just bees and butterflies but also plants that rely on them for pollination.

The EPA would not comment on the lawsuit but said the pesticide ""provides benefits to growers and is supported by strong science that shows minimal risks for pollinators.""

In previous documents, the EPA described sulfoxaflor as “very highly toxic” to bees, and a study published in Nature last year found sulfoxaflor inhibited bumblebee reproduction.

In a July call with reporters to announce the decision, a top EPA official emphasized the agency’s research on the pesticide's effects on bees and said the rule was designed with pollinators in mind.

“To reduce exposure to bees, the product label will have crop-specific restrictions and important pollinator protection language,” including limits on how close to bloom sulfoxaflor can be sprayed, the official said.

But it may be difficult to monitor whether the regulations spare bees as intended. Just before EPA’s decision on sulfoxaflor, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it was suspending one of the few remaining government data sets that monitor bee populations and loss.

The center’s suit, filed in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, argues the EPA failed to compile “substantial evidence” as required under law before approving sweeping new uses of sulfoxaflor. They say the EPA also failed to consult with other agencies to ensure the new regulation wouldn’t harm endangered species.

The suit is not the first on the pesticide.

It was temporarily barred after a lawsuit from beekeepers in 2015, pushing the EPA in 2016 to change its instructions for how to use the pesticide in a way designed to reduce the harm to bees.

EPA said it was spurred to reconsider uses of sulfoxaflor following numerous emergency requests from states — many of which the agency granted — to allow the use of the pesticide on certain crops. It contends sulfoxaflor is safer than the alternatives.

The regulation allows farmers to once again use sulfoxaflor on citrus, cotton and types of squash, and the pesticide can now be used on alfalfa, corn, cocoa, grains and pineapple, among others, for the first time.

In some cases, farmers will not be able to spray sulfoxaflor within three days of bloom, but bee activists say the pesticide can remain in the soil and harm bees.

Bees are key in the production of almost a third of U.S. crops, spurring a commercial bee industry that brings colonies from field to field to pollinate farmers’ fields.

The EPA said the economic plight of farmers was a factor in its decision. The agency said growers could see net revenue losses of up to 50 percent if they aren't able to use the pesticide.

But Burd said pesticides like sulfoxaflor are dangerous to bees because they attack the nervous system, causing bees to get confused and diminishing their appetite.

“They don’t respond as well to predators ... cognitive loss is causing them to die as they get lost in the field,” she told The Hill previously.

Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Permit Employment Discrimination Against Transgender Workers,https://time.com,['Tara Law'],,,,https://time.com/5654844/title-vii-trump-transgender-department-of-justice-supreme-court/,"The Trump administration’s Department of Justice is asking the Supreme Court to set a legal precedent that would enable employers to fire employees because they are transgender.

The Department of Justice has submitted a brief to the Court Friday asking the Justices to rule that Title VII, a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, religion or national origin, does not protect transgender people. The department argued that they should throw out a lower court ruling that found that a funeral home that fired a transgender woman had discriminated against her.

The brief concerns R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, one of three cases that the Supreme Court agreed to hear earlier this year that concern whether Title VII can be applied to LGBTQ workers.

In the case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit found that the owner of the funeral home, Thomas Rost, had violated the law when he fired Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman who worked for the company from 2007 to 2013. According to court documents, Stephens sent the company a letter in 2013 that said she struggled with a “gender identity disorder” and planned to begin to live as a woman, including by wearing the company’s female uniform – a jacket and skirt – instead of a suit and tie.

The company argued that Stephens was fired because she refused to wear the company’s dress code and argued that “[m]aintaining a professional dress code that is not distracting to grieving families is an essential industry requirement that furthers their healing process.”

In its brief, the Department of Justice has argued in favor of the funeral home, arguing that Title VII only protects what it defines as “biological sex.”

“In 1964 [when Title VII was enacted], the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex. It did not encompass transgender status,” the DOJ writes, clarifying, “In the particular context of Title VII—legislation originally designed to eliminate employment discrimination against racial and other minorities—it was especially clear that the prohibition on discrimination because of “sex” referred to unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace.”

Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Stephens, told HuffPo that the case could weaken Title VII protections both for transgender people and other groups.

“People don’t realize that the stakes are extending not just the trans and LGB communities, but every person who departs from sex stereotypes: Women who want to wear pants in the workplace, men who want more childbearing responsibilities,” Strangio said.

What we need to know from the Horowitz report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/what-we-need-to-know-from-the-horowitz-report,"There will be much to learn in Inspector General Michael Horowitz's upcoming report on the Trump-Russia investigation, but most of it will likely boil down to just two questions. One, how much did the Obama Justice Department spy on the Trump campaign? And two, was it justified?

Many Democrats would immediately protest the word ""spying."" But the public already knows the FBI secured a warrant to wiretap low-level Trump adviser Carter Page a few months after Page left the campaign. The public also knows the FBI used informant Stefan Halper to gather information on other Trump campaign figures. And the public knows the FBI sent an undercover agent who went by the alias ""Azra Turk"" to London to tease information out of another low-level Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos.

Was that all? Were there more? Horowitz should give definitive answers.

And what did the spying involve? In such intelligence work, wiretaps are recorded; transcripts are made. The same can be true for person-to-person conversations between FBI informants and Trump campaign figures. In May, Trey Gowdy, the former Republican congressman who read deeply into Trump-Russia materials when he was in the House, strongly implied that the FBI had transcripts of informant communications.

""If the bureau is going to send an informant in, the informant is going to be wired,"" Gowdy told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo. ""And if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there's going to be a transcript of that.""

""Where are the transcripts, if any exist,"" Gowdy continued, ""between the informants and the telephone calls to George Papadopoulos?""

The ""if any exist"" was Gowdy's way of casting his statements as a hypothetical, but there was no doubt he was speaking from the knowledge he gained as a congressional investigator.

And then the biggest questions: If there was evidence gained from the wiretapping and informing, what was it? Was it valuable? What did it tell the FBI about Russia and the Trump campaign? And did it prove that the Justice Department was right all along to spy on the campaign — that the spying was, in the words of Attorney General William Barr, ""adequately predicated""?

Here is why Republicans are skeptical. Special counsel Robert Mueller had access to the results of the FBI's spying, and Mueller could not establish that there was any conspiracy or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. After a two-year investigation with full law enforcement powers, Mueller never alleged that any American took part in any such conspiracy or coordination.

So, Republicans know the end result of the investigation, but they don't know how it began. Yes, they know the official story of the start of what the FBI called Crossfire Hurricane — that it began with a foreign intelligence service (Australia) telling U.S. officials that Papadopoulos appeared to have foreknowledge of a Russian plan to release damaging information about Hillary Clinton. But they don't think it's the whole story.

That's where Horowitz comes in.

There's one big potential problem that people on Capitol Hill are talking about, and that is the issue of classified information. Everyone expects a significant amount of Horowitz's report to be classified. How much, no one is quite sure. But the fact is, the report was done to tell the American people what the nation's intelligence and law enforcement agencies did during the 2016 election. Issuing a report with page after page blacked out would not be a good way to do that. But no one will know the extent of the classification issue until Horowitz is ready to go public.

And even if were entirely declassified, Horowitz will not tell the whole story of spying and the 2016 election. Horowitz is the inspector general of the Justice Department and does not have the authority to investigate outside the department. For example, he cannot probe the actions of the Central Intelligence Agency and its then-director John Brennan during the period in question.

That will be the role of another investigator, John Durham, the U.S. attorney appointed by Barr to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe. Durham is working with the support of top Republicans on Capitol Hill, like Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, who recently said, ""I really am very curious about the role that the CIA played here.""

But first, the Horowitz report. It will be an important step in answering the questions of how much spying took place and whether it was justified. It's long past time Americans learned what happened.

"Commerce Department will extend Huawei reprieve, Ross says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team""]",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/commerce-department-will-extend-huawei-reprieve-ross-says/2019/08/19/82a11436-c275-11e9-9986-1fb3e4397be4_story.html,"The next deadline, he added, is roughly Nov. 19.

On Sunday, President Trump suggested that his administration was not likely to grant another reprieve to Huawei, citing national security concerns. “At this moment, it looks much more like we’re not going to do business,” Trump said, pushing back against reports of the expected reprieve.

Trump directed the Commerce Department in May to place Huawei on its “Entity List,” known to some as the “death penalty.” The move makes it difficult for Huawei to do business with any U.S. company. Days later, the Commerce Department announced a 90-day reprieve that allowed some sales to Huawei to continue temporarily, effective May 20.

Ross said Monday that the Commerce Department had also decided to add 46 more Huawei subsidiaries to the Entity List.

“We now have more than 100 subsidiaries on the Entity List,” he said, explaining that “adding more entities makes it more difficult for Huawei to get around the sanctions.”

The ban is one of three by the U.S. government targeting Huawei. Last year, Trump signed a defense-spending bill that barred the federal government and its contractors from doing business with Huawei and several other Chinese companies on national security grounds. A separate ban prohibits companies that do business with Huawei from providing services to the U.S. government.

Some U.S. tech companies have applied for licenses that would allow them to continue to sell to Huawei, arguing that the Commerce Department ban could harm their bottom lines and their ability to innovate."
Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/457997-recessions-happen-when-presidents-overlook-key-problems,"Well, President Trump Donald John TrumpFacebook releases audit on conservative bias claims Harry Reid: 'Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list' Recessions happen when presidents overlook key problems MORE is at it again—lashing out at commentators who suggest a recession could be coming. He believes that such talk is merely alarmist criticism meant to scuttle his reelection. But the president and his staff have access to the best economic data. And there are clear signs in the data that a slowdown may be on the way.

No doubt, uncertainty about the ongoing trade conflict with China isn’t helping things. Trump has applied tariffs en masse against Chinese imports. While tariffs can assist specific industries when utilized in a targeted, strategic manner, his broad duties on most products from China have backfired. The tariffs are beginning to hurt U.S. consumers, as well as farmers and other exporters.

Even with the tariffs, the U.S. manufacturing sector is slowing. The July manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management came in at its lowest level since August 2016.

ADVERTISEMENT

But there’s more. Despite the Trump tariffs, the U.S. trade deficit is still climbing, particularly with China. The U.S. goods trade deficit reached $875 billion in 2018, an increase of 10 percent in the past year alone.

Realistically, much of the recent growth in the U.S. economy was fueled by a large cash injection from the December 2017 tax cut along with increased federal spending. The administration’s subsequent, large-scale borrowing has also thrown more loose money into the economy. But these short-term, stimulatory effects are now starting to wash out.

Here’s the real problem, though—and why a recession could be drawing closer. The U.S. dollar has become substantially overvalued, in part due to a slowdown in global credit. This stronger dollar is cutting into U.S. manufacturing competitiveness while also lowering farm prices. It’s a serious burden on America’s productive economy. There are signs that the U.S. economy is cooling, and it’s time to consider concrete steps to prevent a downturn.

As the U.S. dollar keeps climbing, imports become cheaper. And U.S. exports grow more expensive. What’s causing this overvaluation is a continuing inflow of foreign capital into America’s financial markets. This flood of private overseas investment is driving up demand for the dollar. And the resulting appreciation is making it harder for domestic manufacturers to sell their goods abroad or to compete against imports that keep growing cheaper here in the U.S.

The situation has actually gotten worse, though, because Trump’s economic policies have actually helped fuel the dollar’s rise. Increased federal borrowing has attracted even more foreign capital, which further strengthens the dollar. The Federal Reserve reports that the dollar has climbed 25 percent in the past five years. And China has also played its ace in the hole, allowing its currency to fall recently, resulting in an overall 11.4 percent decline since March of 2018, when tariffs were first imposed.

ADVERTISEMENT

The president’s policies are now backfiring because the dollar’s rise is offsetting the impact of his tariffs. And in the face of this, the Congressional Budget Office foresees a perfect storm: Rising imports will drive America’s current account deficit up from $449 billion in 2017 to more than $700 billion in 2021. Concurrently, the U.S. goods trade deficit is accelerating, and may exceed $1 trillion within the next two years. And that could tip the nation into a new recession.

Trump has made varying comments about the strength of the dollar. But he’s avoided taking action. And that leaves us with a status quo of rising trade deficits, collapsing farm prices, and the fading effects of a 2017 cash injection.

To avert a possible recession, Washington needs to act. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) have introduced bipartisan legislation that would empower the Federal Reserve to tax foreign purchases of U.S. stocks, bonds, and other assets. That could address the influx of foreign capital investment currently driving the dollar to new heights. And it would gradually lower the U.S. dollar to a competitive, trade-balancing level.

The current trajectory for the U.S. economy is troubling. One way to achieve meaningful action would be to prioritize federal efforts that can restore the competitiveness of America’s productive industries. Lowering the dollar’s value through the recently introduced Senate currency bill offers a promising start.

Onshore wind farms in Europe could potentially power the world until 2050.

US Department of Energy: Chill out with that AC use.

US DOE awards green energy money to farmers, rural businesses.

Norwegian cruise line Hurtigruten converts three of its ships to hybrid.

EGEB: A daily technical, financial, and political review/analysis of important green energy news.

A new study from the University of Sussex and Aarhus University found that onshore wind farms in Europe can supply enough energy for the entire world through 2050, according to earth.com. They “have the capacity to produce 100 times the energy that is currently generated.”

The investigation was focused on advanced data from Geographical Information System (GIS)-based wind atlases… The researchers estimated that more than 11 million additional wind turbines could be installed over almost 5 million square kilometers of terrain.

Professor Mark Jacobson said:

One of the most important findings of this study, aside from the fact that it concludes that the European onshore wind potential is larger than previously estimated, is that it facilitates the ability of countries to plan their onshore wind resource development more efficiently, thereby easing the way for commitments by these countries to move entirely to clean, renewable energy for all purposes.

The research is published in the Energy Policy journal.

Keep it (not as) cool

The US Department of Energy recently published a report that recommends thermostat settings in your home for energy efficiency. Your thermostat should be set no cooler than 78 Fahrenheit (26 Celsius) in the summer when you’re home and 85 F (29 C) when you’re away.

Their reasons for making temperature recommendations?

Air conditioners use about 6% of all the electricity produced in the United States, at an annual cost of about $29 billion to homeowners. As a result, roughly 117 million metric tons of carbon dioxide are released into the air each year.

According to Newsweek, the Twittersphere isn’t happy with these recommendations, particularly in what has been a record-breaking hot summer. Some tweet replies are pretty funny, but the DOE makes a good point.

Money for US rural farmers, businesses for green energy

The US Department of Agriculture is distributing $9.3 million in loan and grant funding through the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in the US. It will announce further funding in coming weeks.

According to the USDA:

Recipients can use REAP funding for a variety of needs, such as conducting energy audits and installing renewable energy systems such as biomass, geothermal, hydropower, and solar. Funds also can be used to make energy efficiency improvements to heating, ventilation and cooling systems; insulation; and lighting and refrigeration.

Nextgov says that many of this week’s recipients will use the money to install solar array systems. They explain:

The funds and investments are for small businesses outside of cities or towns with more than 50,000 inhabitants and ranchers and producers with at least 50% of their gross income coming from agricultural operations.

Norwegian cruise line goes hybrid

Norwegian cruise operator Hurtigruten is “transforming three of its existing vessels to hybrid-powered expedition cruise ships,” according to Cruise Trade News.

Hurtigruten is headed toward having one of the greenest fleets in the cruising world. Cruises aren’t known for being eco-friendly. (Here’s Friends of the Earth’s 2019 Cruise Ship report card. Spoiler: There are a lot of Fs.)

Hurtigruten’s converted ships “will be equipped with battery packs, shore power, and other green technology designed to dramatically cut emissions. They will sail year-round expedition cruises along the Norwegian coast from 2021.” Further, the cruise line hopes to use dead fish and organic waste to power some of its ships.

Mindy Brashears, the USDA's Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety, joined FOX 5 Tuesday and said the major cross-contamination concerns are focused around the sink where the chicken is washed. Brashears said it is important to both clean and sanitize areas of the kitchen that any part of the chicken came in contact with.

The USDA is recommending three easy options to help prevent illness when preparing poultry, or meat, in your home.

1. Significantly decrease your risk by preparing foods that will not be cooked, such as vegetables and salads, BEFORE handling and preparing raw meat and poultry.

2. Thoroughly clean and sanitize ANY surface that has potentially touched or been contaminated from raw meat and poultry, or their juices.

DOJ arrests Chicago man who allegedly threatened attack on women's reproductive clinic,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-arrests-chicago-man-allegedly-threatened-attack-womens/story?id=65063192,"The Department of Justice has announced federal charges against a Chicago man who prosecutors say threatened an attack against a women's reproductive clinic, the latest in a string of potential mass attacks thwarted by law enforcement.

Farhan Sheikh, 19, was arrested last Friday evening after posting on the social media platform iFunny that he would attack a local clinic and ""proceed to slaughter and murder any doctor, patient, or visitor I see in the area and I will not back down,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court of Chicago,

""Consider this a warning for anyone visiting,"" Sheikh allegedly wrote.

The indictment does not list the clinic where Sheikh was allegedly threatening to carry out his attack, but said it is approximately 4 miles from his residence in Chicago.

In a post to the platform last week, Sheikh wrote he was ""done"" with Illinois' ""abortion laws and allowing innocrnt (sic) kids to be slaughtered for the so called 'womans right' [expletive].""

According to the complaint, when investigators confronted Sheikh at his residence about the posts he admitted they were his but sought to downplay the seriousness of his threats, despite accompanying posts that warned his threats weren't ""satirical.""

Sheikh was charged with transmitting a threat in interstate commerce, which is punishable by up to five years in prison.

The arrest follows at least three possible mass attacks thwarted by law enforcement over the weekend, with suspects arrested in Connecticut, Florida and Ohio.

The FBI directly assisted in two of the cases. In Connecticut, a 22-year-old man was charged with illegal possession of high-capacity ammunition magazines after authorities discovered a Facebook post where he expressed interest in carrying out a mass shooting.

In Ohio, police arrested a 20-year-old man who was a self-proclaimed white nationalist that had allegedly posted on Instagram what investigators believed was a threat to carry out an attack on a local Jewish center. He has pleaded not guilty to telecommunications harassment and aggravated menacing.

And in Florida, a 25-year-old man was arrested after allegedly sending text messages where he expressed interest in carrying out the ""longest confirmed kill ever"" and was strategizing about locations where to carry out his attack, officials said.

Last week, Attorney General William Barr said the DOJ was crafting a bill that would seek to expedite death penalty proceedings for mass shooters, following a directive from President Trump in the wake of the El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio shootings."
"As Dicamba Injury Complaints Rise, States' Communication With EPA Declines",https://www.dtnpf.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/crops/article/2019/08/20/dicamba-injury-complaints-rise-epa,"Dicamba injury allegations are reaching new heights in some states this year, but -- unlike last year -- EPA is not regularly polling states on their dicamba investigations and experiences this summer. (DTN photo graphic)

ROCKVILLE, Md. (DTN) -- Once again, most major soybean states are dealing with a deluge of dicamba injury allegations this summer, with at least one already reporting a record level of complaints.

But, unlike last year, the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is not getting routine updates from state regulators on these injury reports. Last year, representatives from the federal agency participated in weekly conference calls with state pesticide regulators on dicamba injury complaints and investigative findings throughout the summer and fall. EPA officials also visited multiple states to tour dicamba injury and hold public forums on the topic.

This year, this regular communication and canvassing has dried up.

""We haven't been asked to provide any information to U.S. EPA headquarters,"" said Doug Owens, chief of the Bureau of Environmental Programs at the Illinois Department of Agriculture, which has fielded more than 450 alleged dicamba injury reports, up nearly 40% from last year and a record for the state. ""I know last year, we reported to them every week with weekly conference calls. We're not participating in that this year, and no information has been requested.""

This experience was echoed by other states, including Indiana, Iowa, Missouri and Minnesota. (State regulators from Nebraska did not respond to DTN's inquiries.) While most states are making informal reports on their experience with dicamba to the representatives in their regional office of the EPA, the national Office of Pesticide Programs, which oversees the dicamba registrations, has had little to no direct communications with most state regulators on this issue. Only the Arkansas Department of Agriculture reported sending 2019 injury statistics to EPA headquarters recently.

In an emailed statement to DTN on July 31, an EPA spokesperson said the agency was still working with states to ""determine the extent and frequency"" of communications on dicamba injury in 2019. But, with the spray season mostly behind them, state regulators told a different story.

Leo Reed, president-elect of the Association of American Pesticide Control Officials (AAPCO) and pesticide licensing manager for the Office of Indiana State Chemist, said the last time EPA communicated with the Indiana agency on dicamba injury was the previous crop season. ""They've not reached out to the state chemist office specifically on that topic since 2018,"" he said.

At a state regulator meeting in June, members of the State FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation Group (SFIREG) said EPA had drafted a one-time dicamba survey for states to submit at the end of the 2019 season, in lieu of the weekly calls conducted in 2018. However, state regulators demanded more information on the purpose of the survey, noting that their efforts to communicate dicamba injury to EPA in 2018 had resulted in few substantial changes to the dicamba registrations. Since those concerns were voiced, EPA has been silent on the topic of a survey or any dicamba information-gathering. ""We were trying to determine what the results would be -- how will the information we collect be used?"" explained Reed. ""And no one at EPA responded. And that's the last we heard of that."""
"Some jail staffers not cooperating with DOJ investigation into Epstein suicide, source says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Vandana Rambaran', 'Vandana Rambaran Is A Reporter Covering News', 'Politics At Foxnews.Com. She Can Be Found On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/prison-personnel-refuse-to-cooperate-with-doj-investigators-digging-into-epstein-suicide,"Personnel at the New York City prison where accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide last week have not been initially cooperative with investigators from the Department of Justice, a federal source told Fox News Friday.

Attorney General William Barr sent two senior DOJ officials to personally visit the Metropolitan Correctional Center and speak with staff from the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in order to gather information on Epstein's death after Barr said officials uncovered ""serious irregularities"" at the jail, a senior DOJ official told Fox News. The officials have been on site since Thursday and the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general are investigating conditions at the MCC.

NEW YORK MEDICAL EXAMINER: JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S DEATH WAS A SUICIDE BY HANGING

BOP officials from various regional offices have also been sent to the Manhattan facility to lend their expertise and insight. In addition, a separate BOP ""After Action Team"" went to MCC earlier this week in an effort to examine what happened the night Epstein died. The use of the ""After Action Team"" is part of BOP protocol whenever a ""significant event takes place at a prison.

Epstein was found dead in his cell on Aug. 10. Earlier Friday, New York City's medical examiner officially ruled the 66-year-old's death a suicide by hanging.

Fox News has also learned that 20 of 21 prison staff posts were filled between the hours of 4 p.m. and 12 a.m. on Friday, Aug. 9, the day before Epstein was found. Of those prison workers, six of them were working voluntary overtime. Between 12 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 10, 18 of 19 staff posts were filled. Of those 18 staffers, 10 were working overtime and all but one of those were doing so voluntarily.

Conspiracy theories swirled following Epstein's death, as many wondered how the wealthy financier could have been able to kill himself in a high-security facility just over two weeks after being placed on suicide watch, though officials later confirmed Epstein had been taken off suicide watch shortly before his death.

Correctional officers did not check in with Epstein for ""several hours"" before his death, despite being required to visit him every 30 minutes, a person familiar with the situation told Fox News earlier this week.

Jail guards on duty the night of Epstein's death are also suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were checking on inmates every half-hour as required, The Associated Press reported, citing several people familiar with the matter.

Two staffers have been placed on administrative leave and the MCC's warden has been reassigned pending an investigation.

Late Friday, Epstein's attorneys issued a statement decrying what they described as ""the harsh, even medieval conditions at the MCC.""

""It is indisputable that the authorities violated their own protocols,"" Martin Weinberg, Reid Weingarten and Michael Miller said. ""The defense team fully intends to conduct its own independent and complete investigation into the circumstances and cause of Mr. Epstein’s death including if necessary legal action to view the pivotal videos - if they exist as they should - of the area proximate to Mr. Epstein's cell during the time period leading to his death.

""We are not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical examiner,"" the statement concluded. "" We will have a more complete response in the coming days

Hatewatch alleged that Matthew Gebert “oversaw the Washington, DC-area chapter of a white nationalist organization, hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online.” According to the report, he used a pseudonym — Coach Finstock — to express “a desire to build a country for whites only.”

Michael Gebert identified his older brother as the man in a photo Hatewatch posted of white nationalists gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia, months before the Unite the Right rally that resulted in the killing of a counter-protestor, 32-year-old Heather Heyer.

Michael Gebert also said it was his brother’s voice speaking as “Coach Finstock” on a white nationalist podcast and confirmed Hatewatch’s reporting that he had contacted the FBI about his brother last month through an electronic tip form on the bureau’s website.

“He’s had all this hate growing and accelerating under his skin,” the younger Gebert told CNN in a phone interview after Hatewatch released a report about his outreach to the FBI. “Everything else is keeping up good appearances.”

He told CNN he made the decision to contact the FBI out of concern for his brother’s children.

“It didn’t take courage to submit a tip to the FBI,” he said. “I was just so angry.”

Michael Gebert says he and his brother have long disagreed over politics.

‘So much evil’

Matters reached a head about a year ago at a family gathering in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, he said. After drinking some alcoholic beverages, he said his brother Matthew began using language about Jews, immigrants and minorities that concerned and frightened him.

Michael Gebert explained “it took everything in me” to not react in a violent manner. He said he told his brother, “Matt, I wanna smash your face in.”

He told Hatewatch of that evening: “I saw so much evil in my brother, I could not f**king deal with it.” Even so, Michael Gebert told CNN he still has some sympathy for his brother.

The State Department did not respond to CNN’s request for comment about Michael Gebert’s efforts to warn authorities about his brother’s activities.

The FBI said it does not comment on tips. The agency said it can’t investigate people for holding an ideology or belonging to certain US-based hate groups.

Attempts by CNN to reach Matthew Gebert have been unsuccessful. Hatewatch said in its report that the group’s investigators had been unable to speak to him.

Gebert joined the State Department in 2013, during President Barack Obama’s administration, as a “presidential management fellow,” according to an alumni magazine from his alma mater George Washington University. According to the program’s website, it “attracts and selects the best candidates possible, but is really designed with a more narrow focus – developing a cadre of potential government leaders.”"
It shouldn't be partisan or divisive to want a moral role model in the White House,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Robert Schmuhl', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et Aug.']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/08/20/presidents-should-be-moral-role-models-is-trump-new-normal-column/2054079001/,"FDR called the presidency 'a place of moral leadership.' That's what I've taught students for decades. Will we get that back after Donald Trump?

I received an overture the other day to compose a journalistic effusion on the consequences of presidents — well, to be specific, one president — trafficking in conspiracy theories and using the news media to amplify unverified, if not completely false, allegations. You can probably guess that an aging president-watcher would harbor a view or two on that subject. But, in a rare spasm of wordsmith reluctance, I declined.

In this political environment, to sound off about a commander in chief promoting baseless balderdash would undoubtedly lead to labeling by the officeholder’s base supporters as an “enemy” of those people or worse. We know where he stands, I could hear some readers say while rejecting the argument.

When this happens, the give-and-take of democratic conversation goes by the wayside amid a hyperpartisan atmosphere that pervades the media writ large and the public in general. Instead of the open-minded discussion of public problems a self-governing people deserves, it seems as though more and more citizens are wearing blinkers to focus their attention on party-identified differences they deem worthy of approbation or condemnation. With those blinkers firmly in place, they lose sight of the middle ground between extremes.

'Decent respect' should be the norm

At the same time polarizing partisanship has become so brass-knuckled and fierce, historic norms, conventions and traditions of the White House have of late either come under assault or been abandoned altogether. Having (in the phrase of the Declaration of Independence) “a decent respect” for the office of president and those who’ve occupied it should be natural. The genuine friendships between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter as well as between George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, rivals in the campaigns of 1976 and 1992, respectively, attest to that.

However, the recent suggestion sent via Twitter to over 63 million followers that one former president might be involved in murder gives new meaning to the word “unconventional” for anyone attempting to describe a successor to George Washington.

When Franklin Roosevelt was campaigning for his first of four White House victories in 1932, he called the presidency “preeminently a place of moral leadership.” For nearly a half-century, through Democratic and Republican administrations, I’ve taught and written with Roosevelt’s insight as a lodestar or guiding principle of nonpartisan — and one always prays — fair analysis in assessing presidents, what they say and their actions.

How to define moral leadership

Though a precise definition of moral leadership is elusive for politically minded souls, some essential characteristics stand out, I’d emphasize for students or readers. From a foundation of integrity and honesty, the public figure needs to add inspiration, empathy and courage. Over time that amalgamation of attributes can develop into a full-fledged vision for governing that’s based on credibility and trust.

Individual political judgments about the merits of such leadership will differ, of course, but the reasons for pursuing one or another course are clear and usually revolve around fundamental questions. What’s the right course for the people and country? How can women and men across the nation come together to address problems? Who share these standards for governance and might be willing to help?

Unfortunately, when theory and practice collide like speeding trains, dispassionate evaluation goes off the tracks, throwing the neutral observer into a ditch of perilous surroundings. In this circumstance, even a tepid, wishy-washy explanation invariably gets interpreted as taking one side or another in whatever newsworthy matter might be playing out at the moment.

It's not partisan to want a role model

Looking beyond a particular moment looms the larger concern about the future. Put more starkly: Is what’s happening now an anomaly or an augury? Can we expect at some point to see a return to norms established by previous presidents, or will the spirit of “anything goes” continue for winners of the White House?

In sketching out traits of moral leadership on the blackboard for students, I would always include one other requirement in the inventory: emulation. Is the president (or the candidate who’s running for our highest office) someone possessing the character and temperament that other people can recognize and respect, no matter the person’s political affiliation?

Call me hopelessly old-fashioned, even deplorably die-hard, but wanting a role model in the Oval Office shouldn’t be too outlandish a dream for Americans, young, middle-age or elderly. That heartfelt wish chooses no partisan side — just the common, and national, good.

"USDA finds religious exempt chicken, small operators have pathogen problems",https://www.foodsafetynews.com,"['Coral Beach', 'Guest Contributor', 'Dan Flynn', 'Bill Marler', 'August', 'Powered By']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/08/usda-finds-religious-exempt-chicken-small-operators-have-pathogen-problems/,"Tests showed a higher than average prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter in chicken that is produced under religious exemptions and at low-volume facilities, but the government is not going to propose rules for them.

In a process that began in June 2017, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) collected and tested more than 3,600 samples, according to an update this week. The sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that it will no longer sample or test the specific products for Salmonella and Campylobacter.

“FSIS found that generally religious exempt poultry products and a subset of the low volume products sampled have a higher than national average rate of Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination,” the government reported.

But, saying those products make up a small portion of the country’s food supply, the USDA does not plan to take action toward regulation. A campaign to raise awareness is planned instead.

“The agency does not intend to propose performance standards for these products at this time,” according to the update.

“FSIS will use these results to conduct outreach with the industry and consumers to encourage the safe production and handling of these raw poultry products.”

The FSIS testing project specifically involved religious exempt chicken carcasses and low-volume poultry products. The agency “will no longer sample or test the products for Salmonella and Campylobacter.”

Neither religious exempt carcasses nor chicken products produced in low-volume operations are not subject to the government’s Salmonella contamination standards that apply to other chicken. Chicken carcasses that are religiously exempt from certain federal laws already do not receive the USDA inspection mark, which is printed inside the agency’s seal on non-exempt chicken.

Low-volume products are defined by federal code as being produced with an average daily volume of 1,000 pounds or less. The FSIS tested more than 3,600 samples of low-production chicken.

Beginning in June 2017, FSIS collected more than 150 samples from religious exempt chicken carcasses and tested them for Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination.

Both Salmonella and Campylobacter can cause serious illnesses and sometimes death in humans."
"Colorado area missed air quality deadline, plans to improve",https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/colorado-area-missed-air-quality-deadline-plans-to-improve,"FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency has announced a Colorado region missed its air quality standards deadline.

The Coloradoan reports that the EPA is expected to mark the nine-county North Front Range region that includes Denver county in serious noncompliance with a federal standard.

Experts say this region has high concentrations of ground-level ozone and smog that could lead to respiratory health issues and heart disease.

Officials say the Air Quality Control Commission passed a zero-emission vehicle standard on Friday in the region to reduce the effects.

Experts say air quality improved on average over the last decade despite the announcement, and the region has plans to adopt more regulations for emission-producing industries.

Officials say the region withdrew an extension request to meet the deadline to better prioritize improvement plans.

Jefferson City Housing Authority to vote on banning medical marijuana in public units,https://www.abc17news.com,['Joe Mclean'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.abc17news.com/news/jefferson-city-housing-authority-talks-medical-marijuana/1111439644,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. - A large portion of Tuesday morning's Jefferson City Housing Authority meeting centered around the state's implementation of a legal medical marijuana industry.

Because the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development provides the majority of the housing authority's funding, and the federal government considers marijuana a controlled substance, JCHA leaders suggested bringing their policy in line with that of the HUD department.

The recommendation from the JCHA will be to add marijuana to the non-smoking policy that is already in place in the public housing facilities, and to ban the use of marijuana by prospective and current tenants.

The JCHA's tax credit is handled by the Missouri Housing Development Commission, which requires public housing authorities to ""comply with both federal and state law,"" according to JCHA executive director Cynthia Quetsch.

""I think it's a difficult issue,"" said Quetsch ""I think there are going to be people who followed the procedure and got a medical marijuana permit, and it will just be a question of whether we want to allow them to use it in our facilities. I don't think we can jeopardize our financing from HUD because if we lose that, then we'll be shut down.""

Quetsch and other JCHA leaders said the ban on marijuana will be difficult to enforce, particularly on those who consume the drug through means other than smoking it.

A written policy that will reflect the JCHA's recommendation to ban the use of medical marijuana in public housing units will be presented to the authority at its next meeting on Sept. 24.

The JCHA also discussed changes to the schedules for part-time personnel, an update on the urban renewal plan for the East Capitol Avenue area and proposals from structural engineers."
Sean Hannity: Sources say 'most explosive' part of DOJ review is about 'outsourcing of illegal intelligence-gathering',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-sources-say-most-explosive-part-of-doj-review-about-outsourcing-of-illegal-intelligence-gathering,"Fox News host Sean Hannity said his sources are telling him the most ""explosive"" finding in the Justice Department review on the origins of the Russia investigation has to do with illegal intelligence-gathering on American citizens.

Hannity first mentioned this during his show Thursday evening while speaking to the Hill's John Solomon, who said DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's soon-to-be-released report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses will find ""a lot more wrong than right"" and will be ""difficult"" for former top FBI officials such as James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok.

Hannity said there is some discrepancy between what he and Solomon expect in the watchdog report and the Justice Department inquiry being run by Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham, who are examining the behavior of the FBI and Justice Department for possible wrongdoing.

""I want to know who's going to be held responsible. Because If I lie to a court, and I premeditated a fraud on the court, I have a funny feeling there’s not a lawyer in the country that is going to save my sorry ass from being sent to jail. I’m just guessing, but maybe — I’m Irish, I'm pessimistic,"" he said.

""Let me ask you this. So, we both agree on those. You think there might be an IG report alone on leaking?"" Hannity added, to which Solomon agreed.

""And I’m expecting, from what my sources are telling me, Durham, Barr, and everybody else, to get to the origins of what is a counterintelligence investigation, which Andy McCarthy rightly points out in his new book, would mean Obama knew because the president has to sign off on it but that origins of this counterintelligence investigation, what did Obama know, when did he know it?"" Hannity said.

He was referring to former U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy, who is promoting his new book, Ball of Collusion, and Thursday on Fox & Friends accused Obama of improperly using counterintelligence powers and law enforcement to assist Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.

""But more importantly,"" Hannity continued, ""What will Barr, Durham, come out with in terms of — let's say the Barr-Durham report? ... Or whatever that ends up being. Because I hear that is where the single most explosive bit of information, outsourcing of illegal intelligence-gathering for the sake of circumventing American laws, took place, and a lot of people would be found in violation of spying on Americans against the law.""

Solomon warned that he did not want to get ahead of the Justice Department's findings, but did say that the Barr and Durham review will provide ""a much broader view"" of alleged spy tactics than what the IG report will show because they are not limited to what went on in the Justice Department.

Hannity later noted how there is ""a lot of activity"" in Europe tied to these investigative efforts, including the 16-hour interview conducted with British ex-spy Christopher Steele earlier this summer. He also suggested the United Kingdom, Italy, and Australia were roped into the inquiry.

Steele's anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause."
Huawei gets another 90-day reprieve from the U.S. Commerce Department [Updated],https://www.androidcentral.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-may-get-another-90-day-reprieve-us-commerce-department,"Update: The Commerce Department has now officially confirmed that the temporary reprieve has indeed been extended by 90 days. According to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the decision was taken to ""minimize disruption"" in rural America that relies on Huawei's telecommunication equipment. At the same time, the Commerce Department has added 46 Huawei subsidiaries to its ""Entity List"", banning U.S. companies from doing business with them.

Original story follows:

The U.S. Commerce Department may soon renew the ""temporary general license"" granted to Huawei by 90 days, according to a new report from Reuters.

Shortly after Huawei was put on the Entity List by the Trump administration in May, the Commerce Department had issued a 90-day reprieve to the company that allowed it to continue purchasing components from American companies. Since the current agreement is set to end today, we expect an official statement from the Commerce Department confirming another 90-day extension to arrive later in the day.

U.S. President Donald Trump, however, is still not keen on allowing U.S. companies to do business with Huawei. Speaking to the media before departing from Morristown, New Jersey, Trump said:"

Two Iowa Congresswomen calling for investigation on EPA exemptions,https://kwwl.com,"['Taylor Vessel', 'Multimedia Reporter']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://kwwl.com/news/2019/08/20/two-iowa-congresswomen-calling-for-investigation-on-epa-exemptions/,"(KWWL) – According to her office, Representative Abby Finkenauer has signed a letter to the Government Accountability Office asking for an investigation into small refinery exemptions handed down by the Environmental Protection Agency.

The letter is signed by a number of members of the House Biofuels Caucus including Democrat Iowa Representative Cindy Axne and Illinois Republican Representative Mike Bost.

An excerpt from the letter details an increase in waivers in the last few years:

“Between 2013 and 2015, the EPA granted no more than 8 waivers for any given year. The current Administration retroactively approved 19 waivers for 2016, then proceeded to grant 35 waivers in 2017, and now 31 waivers for 2018—exempting a total of nearly 4 billion gallons of fuel from the RFS. The number of waivers approved has grown exponentially with major corporations like ExxonMobil and Chevron among those that received these economic hardship exemptions. This raises real questions about the review process and what other factors that the EPA is considering in approving the waivers.”

An article posted to the EPA’s website this month says small oil refineries can receive an exemption from annual Renewable Volume Obligations if they can prove that complying with those obligations would cause them financial hardship.

RVOs are defined by the group Growth Energy as follows:

Each summer, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issues a proposal governing how much renewable energy should be available to consumers in the year ahead. These targets are called Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) and they determine how many gallons of biofuel refiners will add to the motor fuel mix. After a proposal is issued, the agency then accepts comments from the public before issuing a final rule making under the RFS.

The letter from Finkenauer goes to say that an investigation “will bring much-needed transparency to the waiver approval process.”

Rep. Finkenauer also released this statement after the EPA announced 31 new refinery exemptions:

“President Trump came to Iowa, looked my friends and neighbors in the eye and promised them he would protect the Renewable Fuel Standard. He gave them his word, and that should have meant something. Tonight, that promise is officially broken. His administration just allowed ANOTHER 31 refineries to ignore the law and exempted them from having to blend Iowa’s ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply. This protects big oil’s profits while devastating Iowa’s growers, who are already being hurt by the president’s never-ending trade war that he started, without a clear plan, on Twitter.” “I’m calling for the Government Accountability Office to step in and investigate this attack on the Renewable Fuel Standard which is hurting our farmers’ livelihoods & our environment.”

The Iowa Corn Growers Association also weighed in.

“Granting of the additional 31 refinery exemptions are ridiculous and a slap in the face to farmers,” said Curt Mether, President of the Iowa Corn Growers Association and a farmer from Logan, Iowa. “The RFS could be one of the most effective energy policies in our country’s history, but the waivers gut the policy and destroy corn demand for farmers that are faced not only with challenges from mother nature but market destruction. It is time for President Trump to step in and uphold his promise to farmers and to the RFS.”
