Jeffrey Epstein is Donald Trump's idea of the perfect man,https://www.salon.com,[],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.salon.com/2019/07/13/jeffrey-epstein-is-donald-trumps-idea-of-the-perfect-man/,"He owned a palatial home in Palm Beach and a luxurious residence in Manhattan.

He owned a commercial airliner converted into a luxurious private plane.

He gave parties attended by young women seeking careers in the modeling business.

He was connected to numerous wealthy, powerful men who shared his taste in women and money.

He bragged to others about his sexual conquests with women.

He paid women for sex.

He was charged in lawsuits with numerous sexual assaults on women.

Jeffrey Epstein? No, Donald Trump.

I really wonder what everyone is doing getting their dander up about this disgusting sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, when we’ve got one in the White House. We’ve known about Trump not for years, but for decades. We’ve known about his sexcapades around New York with women who were not his wife. Hell, he used to call the New York Post’s “Page Six” and brag about himself!

And by what magic of moral vacuity has the infamous Access Hollywood tape disappeared down the memory hole? Its words ought to be carved in granite and mounted on a pedestal on the Mall in Washington in full view of the current occupant of the White House. Just listen to this low-life disgusting piece of shit. He was bragging to Access Hollywood’s Billy Bush about a ham-handed pass he had made at his co-host on the program, Nancy O’Dell:

“I moved on her, and I failed. I'll admit it. I did try and fuck her. She was married. And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, ‘I'll show you where they have some nice furniture.’ I took her out furniture — I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn't get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything. She's totally changed her look.”

There’s more, but let’s stop right there. “I moved on her very heavily.” “I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn’t get there.” Who the hell talks like that?

“I did try and fuck her.” What the hell is wrong with this man that he would talk like that to anyone, much less to a television host just before an interview? They were on a bus, getting ready for the interview, and there were seven other people present: a two person camera crew, a production assistant, the show’s producer, Trump’s security guard and his publicist, and the bus driver. Who talks that way about anyone, much less a woman who was the interviewer’s co-host on his television program? Who even talks in that manner about himself?

Trump. He did. And he wasn’t finished. He was on the bus, getting ready to meet a television actress, Arianne Zucker, with whom he would be filming a segment for Access Hollywood. This is what Trump said, referring to Ms. Zucker:

“I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.”

There it is, the infamous “grab ‘em by the pussy” comment that would give newspaper editors fits. Are we really going to print “pussy” in our newspaper?

Looking back, you can hardly believe there was the kerfluffle about printing “pussy,” that the whole thing happened. But it did. It happened on October 7, 2016, in the closing days of what has turned out to be the most consequential presidential election in the history of this country. That was the day the Access Hollywood tape was released.

What happened next should shame all of us, the print press, the television shows that bleeped out “pussy,” even those that didn’t, but most of all the voters, the citizens of this country who beginning on that day, October 7, started sending this incident down the memory hole.

The Access Hollywood tape was released by the Washington Post around 4 p.m. on that day, a Friday. Thirty minutes later, WikiLeaks started tweeting links to emails stolen by the Russians from the personal email account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman. Some of the emails on Podesta’s account were embarrassing. They had the transcripts of speeches Clinton had given to Wall Street banks, for which she was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars. They had private comments made by Clinton campaign staffers about ethnic voters.

And all of this was happening exactly one hour after the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, jointly released a statement blaming Russia for the hacks into the Democratic Party’s emails.

You know what happened next. Trump’s confessions of his own sexual assaults and his disgusting behavior with a woman who was not his wife got lost in the frenzy around the WikiLeaks release of Podesta emails. Trump’s campaign should have been stopped in its tracks. He had already been accused of sexual assault and harassment by two dozen women (Their names, and descriptions of Trump’s sexual misconduct are here). Instead, Trump used the Democratic Party emails stolen by the Russians to stomp all over Hillary Clinton in the closing weeks of the campaign. With the help of the Russians and the cynicism and indifference of the American voter, he squeezed out a narrow victory, and we’ve been paying for it ever since.

But here’s the thing that’s jaw-dropping about Donald Trump. We’ve known who this bastard is for decades. We’ve known that he had affairs with porn stars and nude models and paid them money to buy their silence. We’ve known that he grabbed the private parts of a woman sitting next to him on an airplane, that he grabbed another woman sitting next to him in a restaurant. Hell, he as much as admitted it on the Access Hollywood tape! We’ve known that Trump was accused of raping a 13 year old girl in 1994 – in Jeffrey Epstein’s apartment! A lawsuit was filed on behalf of the victim, “Joan Doe,” making the allegation in 2016 and subsequently dropped.

Only three weeks ago, yet another woman came forward and accused Trump of rape: Columnist E. Jean Carroll accused Trump of raping her in a dressing room in Bergdorf’s in 1995 or 1996, a charge that was subsequently backed up, on the record, by two women who Carroll told about the rape at the time. We’ll hear from more victims of Trump’s sexual perversion before this is over.

So forget about this sexual predator, Jeffrey Epstein. He’s in jail in downtown Manhattan awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, and already, new witnesses are showing up, accusing him of new crimes.

We’ve got a sexual predator in the White House. The American people put Donald Trump there with their votes. It’s up to us to get him out and put him where he belongs, behind bars alongside his pal Epstein."
How Mexico Beefs Up Immigration Enforcement To Meet Trump's Terms,https://www.npr.org,['James Fredrick'],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/13/740009105/how-mexico-beefs-up-immigration-enforcement-to-meet-trumps-terms,"How Mexico Beefs Up Immigration Enforcement To Meet Trump's Terms

Under pressure from President Trump's tariffs threat, Mexico reached a deal with the United States on June 7 to step up immigration enforcement and to take in more migrants waiting for their U.S. asylum hearings.

The agreement reads: ""Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution.""

The deal came at a critical time: Families continue to flee Central America by the thousands for a better life in the north. Getting Mexico to take strong action was President Trump's latest move to reverse this trend.

Here is a look at how it's going.

What is Mexico doing to ramp up immigration enforcement?

The Mexican government's main promise was to deploy its National Guard, even if it had not officially been created yet. NPR has seen many members of the new force still wearing army or marine uniforms but with National Guard armbands. About 6,500 guard members are deployed near Mexico's southern border with Guatemala and another 15,000 are patrolling the northern part of Mexico, on its side of the U.S. border, according to Mexican officials. The National Guard is working, often alongside immigration enforcement agents, to prevent migrants from entering Mexico from Guatemala in the south, and to stop them from leaving to the U.S. in the north.

Mexico's immigration agency added more checkpoints on highways in the south, where they search buses and cars for undocumented migrants. Officials have stepped up raids of a freight train people call La Bestia, or The Beast — long known as a quick and free, but risky, way for migrants to travel north. Several bus companies in the country now require immigration documents to purchase a ticket.

The Mexican government is hiring new immigration agents as well as transferring federal police to the institution. But 500 immigration agents were fired in June as part of an anti-corruption effort, according to the agency's new director, Francisco Garduño Yáñez. He said many had been involved in human trafficking and extorting migrants.

Mexico also said it would dismantle people-smuggling networks. While a few large trucks have been caught secretly carrying dozens or hundreds of migrants north, these busts were fairly common before the surge and Mexico has yet to detail advances on breaking up smuggling networks. Some reporting suggests smugglers continue to thrive.

What about asylum-seekers?

It can take months or even years to wait for asylum in the United States. Mexico agreed with the U.S. to expand the Migrant Protection Protocols, a program commonly known as ""Remain in Mexico."" Under MPP, some of the migrants crossing the border to request asylum in the U.S. are sent back to Mexico to wait for their day in U.S. immigration court.

But there are problems with the program. Asylum-seekers are sent to cities including Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez and Nuevo Laredo, some of the most violent in Mexico. Migrants in the program have reported being kidnapped, extorted and raped after returning to Mexico. Government and nonprofit shelters are overwhelmed and migrants say they receive little or no support from the Mexican government. The conditions are so bad that many asylum-seekers have voluntarily been bused back to their home countries by Mexican and United Nations authorities.

The legal process for people under MPP is confusing, constantly changing and erodes due process, according to lawyers representing the asylum-seekers. Human rights advocates say migrants detained in Mexico are often denied the opportunity to request asylum before being deported.

Mexican authorities have registered a record number of people seeking asylum in Mexico this year. The national refugee agency says 31,355 people requested asylum in Mexico in the first half of 2019, the largest portion of whom were from Honduras. That is already more than last year's overall total. With an annual budget of just $1.2 million, the agency's director says, it needs more funds and resources to process the applications and resettle those granted protection. The country granted asylum in 53% of completed cases in 2018, led by a 98% approval rate for Venezuelans. Roughly a third of Guatemalan, Honduran and Salvadoran applicants were granted asylum here in 2018.

Since 2014, Washington has provided more than $100 million to help Mexico with immigration control, including equipment and training, according to a Congressional Research Service report published last month. The U.S. has allocated millions more in asylum and refugee assistance for Mexico. But the June deal did not include additional support.

Is this the first time Mexico has cracked down on migrants?

No. Mexico's last major immigration enforcement effort started in 2014, after thousands of unaccompanied minors from Central America arrived at the U.S. border. Mexico launched the Southern Border Plan with support of the armed forces to catch migrants at a geographical bottleneck in southern Mexico called the Tehuantepec Isthmus. Subsequently, the U.S. began providing financial support and training to Mexican immigration authorities through the Mérida Initiative. In 2015, In the first full year of this plan, Mexico increased migrant apprehensions by 50% to 180,000 and deportations by 68% to 177,000, but those numbers have ebbed and flowed since. Some experts see the current efforts as a ramp-up of the Southern Border Plan.

What have been the results this time?

In June 2019, in the weeks following the deal the Trump administration reached with Mexico's government, the U.S. saw a 28% drop in the number of people detained after crossing the Southwest border, the first decrease in a year. A number of factors including, summer heat, were probably at work, but the decline was likely driven in part by Mexican enforcement.

Mexico detained more than 29,000 migrants that month, up 200% compared with June 2018. Deportations totaled nearly 22,000 in June 2019, up 180% from June 2018. Both are Mexico's highest monthly totals in more than a decade.

These trends could waver as the number of people traveling toward the U.S. usually drops in hotter summer months.

The Remain in Mexico plan has also expanded in recent weeks since the U.S.-Mexico deal. From Jan. 26 when the program began until April 8 (when the program was briefly suspended), the U.S. returned 1,323 people to Mexico. From April 16 until June 7, another 9,060 were returned to Mexico. Since the U.S.-Mexico deal was signed June 7, another 8,110 have been sent back to Mexico, nearly doubling the total of the previous four months combined. As of July 7, a total of 18,503 people had been sent back to Mexico, according to the country's National Migration Institute.

Who is getting caught in the dragnet and why are they leaving their countries?

Most migrants Mexico has detained in 2019 come from Central America. Hondurans represent 46%, Guatemalans 26%, and Salvadorans 10% of the total migrants apprehended by Mexico this year.

Much of the region called the Northern Triangle — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — continues to suffer from violent crime, poverty, climate change and other factors that have driven families to flee in droves.

Smaller groups include Haitians (3%) and Cubans (5%). Some Haitians are fleeing economic and political instability, while others previously escaped after the 2011 earthquake and have spent years traveling from country to country in the Americas.

The reason Cubans travel through Mexico largely goes back to President Barack Obama ending a Cold War-era policy that allowed Cubans fleeing the country to be eligible for U.S. residency a year after setting foot on U.S. soil. So instead of Cubans trying to reach the U.S. by sea, which could lead to quick arrest and deportation, they now fly to other nearby countries like Nicaragua and Guyana and make their way over land to the U.S.-Mexico border to request asylum.

Many Nicaraguans, who make up 2% of those detained, are fleeing their country's prolonged political crisis marked by repression and political persecution from President Daniel Ortega.

Other migrants traveling through Mexico come from as far as Africa and Asia. More than 1,000 Cameroonians have been detained in Mexico so far this year, as a violent conflict in the central African nation between its majority French-speaking and minority English-speaking populations continues. More than 1,000 Congolese have also been caught passing through Mexico, as years of brutal conflict continue to force people out. Hundreds of migrants from Angola, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have also been detained in Mexico this year.

Why they all choose the U.S. as their destination varies, largely combining reasons related to safety, economic opportunity and family ties in the country.

What is the end goal?

The Trump administration says it wants to reduce the number of Central American immigrants and asylum-seekers crossing the Southwestern border. The U.S.-Mexico agreement says: ""Both parties also agree that, in the event the measures adopted do not have the expected results, they will take further actions. Therefore, the United States and Mexico will continue their discussions on the terms of additional understandings to address irregular migrant flows and asylum issues, to be completed and announced within 90 days, if necessary.""

But it never says what ""expected results"" means. The countries agreed to reconvene after 45 days from the start of the deal, roughly in late July, to assess progress. But there is no protocol for what happens then.

After long criticizing Mexico's handling of immigration, President Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on July 1 that he was pleased with Mexico's recent efforts.

The lack of clear goals leaves Mexico in a weak bargaining position. It also leaves the country vulnerable to factors outside its control, like a worsening crisis in any of the migrants' home countries.

Additionally, Mexico may not gain anything from the agreement as it stands, beyond improving its immigration control. But it can hold off U.S. tariffs, a pressure tactic President Trump has used on other countries. If Mexico fails to satisfy Trump's demands, the next step could for Mexico to enter into a ""safe third country"" agreement with the U.S. That would mean that asylum-seekers who travel through Mexico would have to apply for protection in that country, and would be ineligible to do so in U.S.

Mexico may be stopping more migrants from getting to the U.S. and taking in more asylum-seekers for now, but there's no evidence yet of progress toward ""resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation,"" as the agreement says."
These Republicans signed the ‘never Trump’ letters in 2016. Now some are having second thoughts.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['David Nakamura', 'Reporter Covering The White House', 'July At Am']",,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/these-republicans-signed-the-never-trump-letters-in-2016-now-some-are-having-second-thoughts/2019/07/12/a7e7a49a-a3ed-11e9-bd56-eac6bb02d01d_story.html,"President Trump arrives in the White House Rose Garden to speak about the 2020 Census on July 11, 2019, in Washington. (Alex Brandon/AP)

Two and a half years into President Trump’s tenure, the Republican national security heavyweights blacklisted from his administration for signing a pair of “never Trump” letters in 2016 face a crossroads — remain opposed or support him in 2020.

While some have become prominent figures of the anti-Trump resistance — denouncing him in op-eds and on cable news — others have offered policy advice from outside perches, and a select few have quietly, though mostly unsuccessfully, angled for administration jobs, hopeful that a mea culpa could end their days in purgatory.

This weekend, a few dozen once-prominent GOP foreign policy figures, including some original “never Trumpers,” will gather at a private Reagan Institute retreat in Beaver Creek, Colo., to promote and preserve the 40th president’s “conservative internationalist” approach to foreign affairs. Yet the White House has shown little willingness to tap into this wellspring of expertise, even as Trump cycles through national security aides and faces a dwindling pool of experienced staffers in a potential second term.

The ostracism of the group has led some to reconsider their roles in a prominent public movement to stop Trump three years ago.

“I’m not comfortable with letters anymore,” said Patrick Cronin, head of the Asia-Pacific security program at the Hudson Institute, who signed the first letter, which called Trump “fundamentally dishonest” and “utterly unfitted to the office.” In March 2017, Cronin was forced to withdraw from a new position overseeing a Pentagon think tank after Trump allies blasted his appointment by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

“I don’t regret the letter in 2016; I thought it was the right thing to do,” said Cronin, who has been publicly supportive of some elements of Trump’s policies on China and North Korea. “But I’m not writing or signing any letters in 2020. I’m not predicting the outcome of the election. I will be supporting the U.S. government.”

Of the 149 experts who signed at least one of the two letters warning that Trump was unfit for office — the first published on the War on the Rocks website during the 2016 GOP primaries and the second on the New York Times’s site during the general election campaign — just one has been hired by the Trump administration. James Jeffrey, a Middle East expert who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was named the State Department’s special representative for Syria last summer, before adding the role of special envoy to counter the Islamic State in January.

Neither of Jeffrey’s roles required Senate confirmation, which would have risked Democratic lawmakers reading from the never Trump letters at a public hearing.

The retreat in Beaver Creek was organized by Roger Zakheim, the Reagan Institute’s Washington director, who worked at the Pentagon in the Bush administration. He and his father, Dov, a senior Pentagon official in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, signed both never Trump letters.

But organizers emphasized that the event includes participants who have supported the president, among them former Trump administration officials. The dialogue is not aimed at countering Trump, said one person familiar with the planning, but rather is intended to build consensus around Reagan’s approach to U.S. global leadership in a time of uncertainty.

This person pointed to a new think tank founded by mega-philanthropists George Soros, a liberal, and Charles Koch, a conservative, that offers, in his words, a more “isolationist and protectionist” view of foreign policy.

Trump’s “America First” agenda has rattled traditional conservatives, as he has looked skeptically at multilateral alliances, free trade and democracy promotion. He has withdrawn the United States from some international treaties, criticized the United Nations and shown little interest in global human rights issues.

The question of how far Trump has strayed from Reagan’s principles has divided the never Trump group. Some praised Trump’s choice of conservative Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, who helped dissuade him from acting on threats to pull the United States out of NATO and close military bases in East Asia.

Some of the letter organizers, including Eliot A. Cohen, a former State Department counselor in the Bush administration, and Max Boot, a Washington Post columnist who advised the 2008 presidential campaign of the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), have remained prominent critics of Trump’s policies and personal conduct.

But others have expressed admiration for his willingness to take a harder line on China’s trade practices, even if they remain uneasy about the tariff war between Washington and Beijing. And they asserted that Trump’s un­or­tho­dox personal diplomacy with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has opened an unexpected avenue to try at least contain to Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program.

Trump’s foreign policy “might not be as bad as feared and not as good as hoped,” said Peter Feaver, a Duke University political science professor who served on the National Security Council under George W. Bush and signed both letters.

Feaver, who stands by the letters and said Trump has validated much of what the experts warned of, said he is not seeking an administration position and thinks those who are will remain disappointed.

“Certainly, with the president, I don’t sense he’s anywhere closer to that kumbaya moment,” Feaver said. “It would probably take movement on both sides, but I don’t see much evidence the White House wants to move.”

Among those at the Reagan Institute retreat is Daniel Blumenthal, an American Enterprise Institute scholar who served at the Pentagon in the Bush administration. Last summer, Blumenthal was among the candidates whom Pompeo was considering to oversee East Asia affairs at the State Department. But his candidacy was derailed, at least in part, by the White House’s learning of his signature on the War on the Rocks letter, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the subject.

Another foreign policy analyst who signed that letter said in an interview this week that he regrets his participation. This person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly to discuss the issue, accused the letter organizers of turning their opposition to Trump into a “never-ending anti-Trump crusade” that continued after he took office and has vaulted some of them to media stardom while leaving others with limited professional options.

“I didn’t sign up for that,” this analyst said. “I learned my lesson. I’ve sworn off ever signing another letter I didn’t write.”

Some of the never Trumpers expressed hope that the blacklist will erode around the edges; even if the White House refuses to hire them, they said, perhaps a determined Cabinet secretary can bring them on. Along with Jeffrey, they pointed to Elliott Abrams, a veteran of the Reagan and Bush administrations who did not sign the letters but wrote an op-ed in 2016 saying Trump should not be president and would lose the election.

Trump foiled then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s attempt to name Abrams as his deputy in spring 2017. But Pompeo succeeded in January of this year in appointing Abrams as special envoy for Venezuela.

Mary Kissel and Brian Hook, two other senior State Department officials, also were vocal critics of Trump during the campaign, though neither signed the letters. Like Jeffrey, Abrams, Kissel and Hook were named to positions that do not require Senate confirmation.

Of those who have accepted their purgatory, some said they have had some modest policy conversations with moderate Democratic presidential candidates even though they recognize it is unlikely they will play a prominent role in any of their campaigns.

Someone like former vice president Joe Biden “is going to be surrounded by all the establishment Democrats,” said Michael Green, a former Bush administration official who signed the New York Times letter and works at a Washington think tank. “What’s the value added of an old Bush hand?”

"Trump attacks Mueller, accuses him of 'Illegal Deletion'",https://www.aol.com,['Aol Staff'],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/13/trump-attacks-mueller-accuses-him-of-illegal-deletion/23768998/,"President Trump on Saturday accused former special counsel Robert Mueller of illegally deleting texts in the course of his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.

The president reacted to a tweet alleging that Mueller’s office may have participated in a cover-up by deleting texts between former FBI officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.

“This is one of the most horrible abuses of all,” Trump tweeted. “Those texts between gaga lovers would have told the whole story. Illegal deletion by Mueller. They gave us ‘the insurance policy.’”

Trump had made similar claims about the texts that were critical of him in a Fox Business interview last month.

“Robert Mueller terminated their text messages together,” Trump said. “He terminated them. They’re gone. And that’s illegal. That’s a crime.”

However, CNBC pointed out at the time that Trump did not provide any evidence to back his claim.

Mueller is scheduled to testify before Congress on July 24.

"Devin Nunes: Without jail time for Russia probe 'dirty cops', no Republican will trust DOJ for ‘generations'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/devin-nunes-jail-dirty-cops-republicans-doj,"House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said there will be massive political consequences if Justice Department officials don't face jail time for their conduct during the Russia investigation.

According to Nunes, the Russia investigation was an ""obstruction of justice trap,"" that started without evidence of collusion and ended in an ""awful situation"" that could only be fixed by jailing the people who ""perpetuated this hoax.""

""These are all a bunch of dirty cops and I'll tell you,"" he told Fox News' Bill Hemmer on the latest ""Hemmer Time"" podcast. ""We're going to go down in a spiral in this country because you will not have a Republican that will trust the FBI or the Department of Justice for generations to come.""

Nunes specifically mentioned Andrew Weissman, one of the Mueller team's top prosecutors who briefed AP reporters in 2017, before Mueller's team was assembled, on ""something to do with the Trump-Russia investigation.""

Authorities, Nunes said, hid that fact from his committee -- something he said was inappropriate given that Weissman was briefed on the Steele dossier in the summer of 2016.

At Mueller's hearing, Nunes plans to ask him whether he knew that Weissmann had been briefed on the dossier. Weissmann's early involvement with the chain of custody, according to legal advice Nunes received, effectively disqualified him from serving on Mueller's team.

Nunes' comments came before former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was scheduled to testify on July 17 before the House Judiciary Committee -- a hearing Nunes suspected Democrats hoped would include ""nasty"" comments making President Trump ""look bad.""

That date, according to sources, could have been pushed back to July 24, although committee Democrats have maintained the hearing would take place on July 17.

While the committee's chair, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., joined other Democrats in continuing to pursue the Mueller report's findings, Republicans have attempted to refocus the debate on accountability for what Nunes described as ""dirty cops.""

REP. NUNES ON CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S GRILLING BY DOJ INVESTIGATORS: A LOT OF THE DOSSIER 'WAS JUST MADE UP'

Barr already started the investigation and Nunes, in April, sent a criminal referral notification telling the Justice Department in April that he had identified ""potential violations"" of the law. Those criminal referrals stemmed from the Intelligence Committee's investigation when Nunes was chair and Republicans held the House.

Nunes told Fox News host Bill Hemmer that he thought it was possible that the Russia investigation was a way for the House to develop an impeachment strategy. He accused DOJ officials of trying to drag out the investigation in order to find legal violations.

""They were trying to hold out this investigation as long as possible, bust people here and there for nickel and dime stuff -- like obstructing an investigation, lying to Congress -- and eventually they would get Trump,"" he said.

Justice Dept. asks Supreme Court to lift border wall ruling,https://www.politico.com,['Josh Gerstein'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/12/supreme-court-trump-border-wall-1415651,"Construction of a portion of the border wall between Mexico and New Mexico in April 2018. | Herika Martinez/AFP/Getty Images) legal Justice Dept. asks Supreme Court to lift border wall ruling

The Justice Department is asking the Supreme Court to step in to lift court orders blocking President Donald Trump from proceeding with his plan to spend billions of dollars on border wall construction despite Congress’ efforts to limit that spending.

Administration lawyers filed a stay application Friday afternoon seeking to lift an Oakland-based federal judge’s order blocking border wall projects in California, Arizona and New Mexico.

Story Continued Below

Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the high court that the injunction is impairing federal officials’ ability to cut drug trafficking across the border with Mexico.

“The harm to the government and the public from enjoining DOD’s use of the transferred funds during litigation is significant. The injunction frustrates the government’s ability to stop the flow of drugs across the border in known drug-smuggling corridors,” Francisco wrote.

Justice Elena Kagan gave the environmental and border groups that obtained the injunction until next Friday to respond to the request.

The current injunction puts on hold about $2.5 billion Trump’s plan sought to spend through a provision allowing available Defense Department construction funds to be spent on unforeseen needs.

However, the language Congress passed adding that flexibility says that authority can’t be used for budget items previously denied by lawmakers. Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for border wall work in the current budget, and nothing for the specific projects covered by the injunction, but Trump aides devised a plan to spend more than $8 billion on the broad effort.

Trump’s move in May, which included efforts to open up funding by declaring a state of emergency, immediately drew a series of lawsuits from environmentalists, border residents, states and the House of Representatives. The suits argue Trump is acting illegally by spending funds without the approval of Congress, which must approve all appropriations under the Constitution.

Last week, a federal appeals court panel voted, 2-1, to deny the Justice Department’s stay request.

“The Constitution assigns to Congress the power of the purse. Under the Appropriations Clause, it is Congress that is to make decisions regarding how to spend taxpayer dollars,” 9th Circuit Judges Richard Clifton and Michelle Friedland wrote. “Congress did not appropriate money to build the border barriers Defendants seek to build here. Congress presumably decided such construction at this time was not in the public interest. It is not for us to reach a different conclusion.”

The appeals judges were unsparing about some of the Trump administration’s arguments. Clifton and Friedland deemed “not credible” the Justice Department’s contention that Congress had not denied the administration the funds it was seeking to spend.

The groups that obtained the injunction, the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition, said they’ll urge the justices not to lift the order.

“The courts have twice ruled against Trump’s requests to stay this important court order stopping construction of his ruinous wall. Now he is asking the Supreme Court to step in and save his wall, but we will continue to vehemently fight these tactics,” Sierra Club attorney Gloria Smith said.

The Justice Department filing with the high court asks the justices to rule on the application by July 26 to allow the funding process to be completed by September 30. Previous filings from the administration said that process needed to begin by early July to be carried out while the funds are still available.

However, administration lawyers also told the Supreme Court on Friday they’ve discovered a mechanism that might allow that process to be compressed, permitting officials to formally obligate funds for the border projects closer to the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30."
E.P.A. Plans to Curtail the Ability of Communities to Oppose Pollution Permits,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/climate/epa-community-pollution-appeal.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to weaken rules that for the past quarter-century have given communities a voice in deciding how much pollution may legally be released by nearby power plants and factories.

The changes would eliminate the ability of individuals or community advocates to appeal against E.P.A.-issued pollution permits before a panel of agency judges. However, the industrial permit-holders could still appeal to the panel, known as the Environmental Appeals Board, to allow them to increase their pollution.

The draft plan was described by three people familiar with the document, who requested anonymity because the proposal is not yet public. The document has been largely completed, they said, and the next step would be to announce the proposed rule change and seek public comment.

“This is outrageous,” said Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard. “Individuals in communities will lose a way to seek relief from pollution that has historically been very effective. But industry will still be able to seek relief to pollute more.”"
9th Circuit rules in DOJ's favor in sanctuary cities case,https://www.cnn.com,['Caroline Kelly'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/politics/ninth-circuit-doj-los-angeles-grants-sanctuary-city/index.html,"(CNN) The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ruled in favor of the Trump administration, saying the Department of Justice could give preference in awarding grants to cities that would use the money to focus on illegal immigration, as the federal government prepares to seek out undocumented immigrants in raids this weekend.

The City of Los Angeles sued the Department of Justice because it did not receive any funding from the Community Oriented Policing Services grant program , which is aimed at initiatives to build trust between communities and law enforcement agencies. Los Angeles chose ""building trust and respect"" as its focus area and did not mention illegal immigration in its application because of its policy as a sanctuary city.

The panel of judges ruled that ""because DOJ's scoring factors encouraged, but did not coerce, an applicant to cooperate on immigration matters, the panel also rejected Los Angeles's claims that DOJ's use of the factors infringed on state autonomy in a manner that raised Tenth Amendment concerns.""

""DOJ did not exceed its statutory authority in awarding bonus points to applicants that selected the illegal immigration focus area,"" the judges wrote, arguing that ""DOJ's determination that the techniques of community policing may be used to address this public safety issue (illegal immigration) was entirely reasonable.""

Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan under federal investigation for alleged leaks,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Pablo Martinez Monsivais'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/acting-dhs-secretary-mcaleenan-under-federal-investigation-for-alleged-leaks-officials,"Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan is at the center of a federal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to call off a nationwide operation, three senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

Following the publishing of sensitive leaked law enforcement information on June 21, then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team followed department protocol and reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate. JIC is an agency office that handles internal investigations of personnel misconduct, sexual abuse, staff neglect, or violations of responsibilities that may have contributed to such incidents.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It's not clear if JIC has referred the matter to the DHS Office of the Inspector General.

“Any investigation into the malicious, unauthorized disclosure of the operations is completely justified. Any causal observer would logically deduce that McAleenan’s dodgy response and coy behavior warrant additional scrutiny,” a second senior official said late Thursday.

A third official said the department’s decision to pursue the investigation of the acting secretary in itself was “very troubling.”

“It’s worrisome that it took days for the acting secretary to acknowledge and then deny the allegations, and it’s telling that he didn’t call for the investigation in the first place. More than anything, it’s unfortunate that people are even having this discussion at all,” the official wrote in a text.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak, charging he wanted to sabotage ICE’s monthslong plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

“That’s our belief,” one official told the Washington Examiner in late June, when asked if McAleenan was behind the leak. “The secretary was not supportive from day one.”

The acting secretary, who was in El Paso Thursday to show mayors from southern border cities conditions of Border Patrol facilities, has not mentioned the investigation in the weeks since the leak.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week, but on Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which border patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE is now planning to carry out raids nationwide this weekend, though it is not clear if the same people targeted in the canceled ones from June will be the focus of these new ones. The raids were reported Friday as having started earlier than expected."

In a 2-1 decision that overturns a nationwide injunction, the DOJ is now allowed to give preferential treatment for community policing grants to cities that don't defy federal immigration enforcement.

""The department is pleased that the court recognized the lawful authority of the administration to provide favorable treatment when awarding discretionary law enforcement grants to jurisdictions that assist in enforcing federal immigration laws,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

DHS LEADING INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO RAID LEAKS

While the Trump administration has faced numerous obstacles in cutting funding to sanctuary cities, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appears to make an exception for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program, which is meant to help cities hire more police officers.

Other factors in the program's ""points"" system include the hiring of veterans, and the occurrence of school shootings within a jurisdiction. In 2017, the DOJ under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented points that benefit non-sanctuary cities.

Judges Sandra Ikuta and Jay Bybee, who ruled in the DOJ's favor, were appointees of President George W. Bush.

""Cooperation relating to enforcement of federal immigration law is in pursuit of the general welfare, and meets the low bar of being germane to the federal interest in providing the funding to 'address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise ... enhance public safety,'"" Ikuta stated."

In a letter to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Mnuchin wrote that the US might default on its obligations as soon as early September, before Congress returns from its summer recess

""Based on updated projections, there is a scenario in which we run of out cash in early September, before Congress reconvenes,"" Mnuchin wrote in a letter.

The federal government has not been able to borrow money since March, when congressionally-mandated borrowing limits went back into force. The US Treasury, which is facing a growing deficit thanks in part to President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, had said it had enough cash to last until the fall.

Pelosi and Mnuchin have spoken three times this week in an effort to jumpstart stalled budget and debt ceiling negotiations, and multiple sources say the new default projections have provided an accelerant for those efforts.

President Trump and the citizenship question: Editorial Board Roundtable,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Editorial Board', 'Cleveland.Com', 'The Plain Dealer']",07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2019/07/president-trump-and-the-citizenship-question-editorial-board-roundtable.html,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi charged this week that President Donald Trump just wants to “make America white again,” as Trump backed off his attempts to get a citizenship question added to the 2020 U.S. Census. The president instead issued an executive order directing federal agencies to share their citizenship-related data with the Commerce Department.

The July 11 order also set up an interagency task force “with a goal of making available to the [Commerce] Department administrative records showing citizenship data for 100 percent of the population;” ordered Commerce to consider ways to ""expand the collection of citizenship data in the future” and directed it to “strengthen its efforts, consistent with law, to obtain State administrative records concerning citizenship.”

The moves follow the federal courts’ refusal to accept the administration’s attempts to replace its legal team on the citizenship question. The prior team had accepted the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision that the Trump administration could not add the question to the 2020 Census.

The high court’s June 27 ruling had followed revelations of internal memos from a Republican operative that suggested the real rationale for adding the citizenship question was to puncture the political clout of Democratic states and areas.

However, on July 3, President Trump issued a surprise tweet saying the administration was “absolutely moving forward” despite the Supreme Court ruling to add the question to the 2020 census, and, in an unguarded moment, told reporters the rationale was “districting.”

The News Reports about the Department of Commerce dropping its quest to put the Citizenship Question on the Census is incorrect or, to state it differently, FAKE! We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019

Trump now has ended his quest to add the question to the census. In the background, meanwhile, are other administration moves that critics argue also are geared to trying to depress census participation by communities of color, immigrants and other marginalized groups. Among them: a “test” census questionnaire circulating to nearly 250,000 households that includes the citizenship question; reduced regular Census personnel to handle follow-ups with those who initially don’t respond; and a greater digitization of the questionnaire process.

So what does our editorial board roundtable make of this? Has the president acted appropriately in trying to expand the government’s access to citizenship data on U.S. residents?

Ted Diadiun, editorial board member:

This argument draws a bright line between those whose concern is helping to keep people hidden here illegally, and those who want everyone – immigrants included – to obey the law. Nancy Pelosi to the contrary, this is not about making America white again. It’s about following and enforcing the law, inconvenient as that might be to her and others who are pleased to ignore it when it suits their purposes.

Thomas Suddes, editorial writer:

President Trump (at the moment, anyway) has backed off from using the 2020 Census as a kind of immigrant trap. Congratulations. Common sense won.

Lisa Garvin, editorial board member:

You have to ask yourself, why does the Trump administration want citizenship information so badly that it’s willing to circumvent the Supreme Court? His order to dig through government agency records smacks of desperation. Trump’s own Freudian slip to reporters and evidence from deceased Republican operative Thomas Hofeller leave little doubt that the intent in gathering everyone’s citizenship status can only be nefarious.

Mary Cay Doherty, editorial board member:

President Trump rightly changed course; his hands were tied. But the citizenship question remains important. Illegal immigrants should not count toward congressional apportionment. If Congress secured our borders and reformed immigration law, the citizenship question wouldn’t be so critical. But they won’t, so it is. And Democrats fan needless fears. Digitization will encourage census participation so fewer workers are needed to reach the 10 percent of adults who are non-internet users.

Eric Foster, editorial board member:

In a couple of years, I expect someone to write a book about what it took to get the president to change course on the Census issue. Who was the Don McGahn in this scenario? “I know what you want to do, Mr. President, but the Supreme Court just said .…” The next president might want to give that person a Congressional Medal of Freedom.

Victor Ruiz, editorial board member:

Another failed and pathetic attempt by our president to break the law. This country’s demographics are changing rapidly, and this was an intentional and desperate attempt to conserve an America that has exploited many. The changing face of this country cannot be stopped, and while history will judge our current president, my question is how much longer will his supporters allow him to act as if he’s above the law?

Elizabeth Sullivan, director of opinion, cleveland.com:

President Trump has made no secret of his partisan political motives in trying to have Big Brother “document” who is a citizen and who is not. The best and most lasting cure: Congress needs to grow up and pass real immigration reform.

Updated at 1:09 p.m. ET

Debbie Baker thought she qualified for a federal program that helps teachers such as her, as well as nurses, police officers, librarians and others. The Department of Education program forgives their federal student loans if they make their payments for 10 years and work in public service.

For 10 years, Baker, who was a public school teacher in Tulsa, Okla., checked in with loan servicing companies and was told she was on track.

""I said, 'I'm qualifying for public service loan forgiveness,' and they said, 'OK, great,' "" she says.

But it turns out that her $76,000 in student loans didn't get forgiven. Baker was finally told she was in the wrong type of loan. If she'd known that at the beginning, she could have switched loans and ended up qualifying. But she says nobody ever told her.

""When this hit ... I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, get mad,"" she says. ""I honestly did not think the federal government would do this to someone.""

Now, Baker is a plaintiff in a lawsuit being brought by one of the biggest teachers unions in the country against the Department of Education. The suit alleges the loan forgiveness program for millions of public service workers is in such a shambles that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

Have you had problems qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Share your story with NPR.

The American Federation of Teachers filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court. In the complaint obtained by NPR, the union is asking the court to order the department to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that it meets legal standards. It's also asking the department to come up with an appeals process for people who believe they have been treated unfairly.

Congress created the program more than a decade ago to encourage public service. So, if you make loan payments for 10 years and you work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit, the program promises to forgive the remainder of your federal student loan debt.

That promise sounded really good to a lot of people. More than 1 million have filed official paperwork to take part in the program. But there's a problem.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" says Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""This is a debacle.""

Plenty of consumer watchdogs agree.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" says Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

By the department's last count, only 1% of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson says, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven.""

He says they've made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves.""

As happened with Debbie Baker, if a student loan borrower is in the wrong type of loan, or the wrong type of repayment plan, they can't qualify for loan forgiveness.

There are different kinds of federal loans and a wide array of payment plans. If a student loan borrower is told they need to switch from one type to the other to qualify for the program, that's easy enough to do. For public service loan forgiveness, borrowers need to have a ""direct federal loan."" But if their loan servicer never tells them that, they can remain in the wrong type of loan or plan for years, thinking they're making progress toward loan forgiveness only to find out later that none of those payments counted towards forgiveness.

The teachers union lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education ""knows of — but completely disregards — repeated misrepresentations made by [student loan] servicers to borrowers who are attempting to qualify ... resulting in unwarranted denials of loan forgiveness.""

In other words, people like Baker aren't given the right information or advice, and many end up in the wrong types of loans or repayment plans and get unfairly disqualified. Government reports and investigations have found similar problems with borrowers getting bad information.

The lawsuit also alleges that loan servicers are having trouble keeping track of the number of qualifying payments people make — even when they are in the correct loan and payment plan and manage to do everything right.

Weingarten says the program is hurting the very people it's supposed to help. ""It is so broken, it is so unfair that it violates our basic United States Constitution requirement of due process,"" she says.

Another problem with borrowers getting rejected after many years of thinking they were on track is that many make life decisions based on the expectation of loan forgiveness.

Janelle Menzel is a high school math teacher in Brainerd, Minn. She says people would ask her: ""You have a degree in math, why are you teaching?"" She says they would tell her she could make ""so much more money in the private sector.""

Menzel says she loves teaching. And she thought she was going to get her student loans forgiven, so financially she decided it made sense. ""Oh yeah, definitely. That was a factor in it,"" she says.

But Menzel says that after 10 years of making payments, she was told by her loan servicer that she was in the wrong type of payment plan and couldn't qualify.

If a call center worker had told her that 10 years before, she easily could have switched into the right kind of loan. But she says nobody ever told her. And so that never happened.

She remembers after contacting her loan servicer repeatedly, trying to find a way to appeal, a call center worker told her, ""Look, you just need to give up.""

""And I remember sitting at the table watching my kids running around and playing and just thinking, man, I am stuck with this now,"" Menzel says. Thoughts of ""the freedom that would come with being released of the student loan debt kind of came crashing in in that moment,"" she adds.

Congress passed a partial fix, called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, that was designed to help at least some borrowers. But the teachers union lawsuit alleges the Department of Education ""has mismanaged [that program] as well."" As of March 2019, only 3.6% of applications for that new program have been approved.

The Department of Education says it can't comment on ongoing litigation. But the department's press secretary, Liz Hill, said in a statement to NPR on Thursday, ""the Department has improved internal processes and enhanced communications and outreach to borrowers."" As an example, Hill pointed to an automated PSLF Help Tool that assists borrowers in determining whether they are in the right types of loans and payment plans, and which forms to submit.

She also pointed to a department blog post about avoiding common mistakes.

The teachers union is asking the court to order a new appeals process through which the department could use its power to forgive or ""discharge"" loans for borrowers who were treated unfairly.

But in its statement, the department says it ""expects few people to be immediately eligible for a loan discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program due, in large part, to complexities of the program Congress created more than a decade ago.""

For those borrowers interested in the program, the Education Department says submitting an Employment Certification Form annually is key to making sure that borrowers are on track to qualify for forgiveness.

Navient, one of the nation's largest loan servicer companies, is not commenting on the lawsuit. But the company said in a statement to NPR, ""We understand the frustration borrowers face in navigating a complex federal loan program, which is why we consistently advocate for policy reforms to simplify the system.""

The Department of Education recently implemented a dramatic fix to a different program, TEACH Grants, that's now returning grant money to thousands of people who had grants taken away unfairly.

The filing went to Justice Elena Kagan, who has given environmental groups who brought the original lawsuit until 4 p.m. July 19 to respond with their own brief.

PENCE VISITS MIGRANT DETENTION CENTER NEAR SOUTHERN BORDER TO 'SEE FIRSTHAND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS'

Kagan will also likely ask all her colleagues to weigh in, but it’s unclear when an order will be issued.

Earlier this month, a divided three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco agreed with a lower court ruling that prevented the government from tapping Defense Department counterdrug money to build high-priority sections of the planned wall in Arizona, California, and New Mexico.

At stake is billions of dollars that would allow Trump to make progress on a major 2016 campaign promise heading into his race for a second term.

Trump declared a national emergency after losing a funding fight with the Democratic-led House that led to a 35-day government shutdown. Congress agreed to spend nearly $1.4 billion on barriers in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings, an amount well below the $5.7 billion the president requested.

Trump grudgingly accepted the money but declared the emergency in order to siphon up to $8.1 billion for wall construction. That amount includes $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion from Defense Department counterdrug activities and $600 million from the Treasury Department's asset forfeiture fund.

Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper has yet to approve the transfer of the military construction funds.

The environment for reporters covering the EPA just got a lot more toxic.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Paul Farhi', 'Media Reporter', 'July At Am', ""Paul Farhi Is The Washington Post'S Media Reporter.

(Michael Reynolds/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

Amid the many news releases issued each week by the Environmental Protection Agency, a few stand out. Such as these:

• “Politico Misleads On Trump EPA’s Progress Cleaning Up Superfund Sites.”

• “The Hill [newspaper] Gets It Wrong On New EPA FOIA Regulation.”

• “National Correspondent Misleads on Wheeler’s Remarks.”

While the Trump administration is not known for velvety smooth relations with the news media, federal agencies are far more likely to ignore reporters than to officially scold them. Not the EPA. Reporters whom the agency deems to have misreported can expect to hear about it, and not just through a polite phone call or an email requesting a correction.

Instead, the EPA goes public.

“A reader of Politico would have been rightfully confused about the results” of an inspector general’s report about a Superfund task force, the EPA declared in a June 24 release. “It is only fair to ask why they chose to ignore the key findings of this report.”

A day later, the EPA’s communications wing weighed in on the Hill’s story about a new regulation. “The Hill used a false premise and ran a grossly inaccurate story,” it said. It went on to list “THE HILL’s FALSE QUOTES,” “MORE OF THE HILL’S FALSE QUOTES” and “MORE FALSE REPORTING FROM THE HILL.”

A spokeswoman for the Hill, Lisa Dallos, said the publication stands by its story. Politico’s spokesman, Brad Dayspring, characterized the Superfund story as “fair and fact based.”

The EPA’s unusual approach is in some ways a return to its recent past. Under former administrator Scott Pruitt, who resigned a year ago amid various scandals, the agency attacked reporters on a semiregular basis. The pushback sometimes took on a nasty tone. Pruitt’s spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, who has also left the agency, once responded to a reporter who was seeking comment for a story by telling her, “You have a great day, you’re a piece of trash.”

Things simmered down with Pruitt’s departure, but have lately begun to grow toxic again.

The EPA’s top media manager says the approach nowadays is kinder and gentler but still firm. “I’m trying not to get into name calling or picking fights,” said Corry Schiermeyer, associate administrator for public affairs at the agency. “I honestly just want to ensure that when anyone reports about our policies and issues that the reporting is correct and accurate.”

The news releases, she said, are a way to establish an official record before a disputed story goes viral on social media: “If we sat back and didn’t do anything, it can spin out of control.”

Reporters on the beat, however, are somewhat baffled by the agency’s aggressiveness, especially because Pruitt’s replacement, former energy-industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, is more low-key than his predecessor.

Asked who decides when to publicly call out a news organization, Schiermeyer hedged. “That’s a good question,” she said after a pause. “I wouldn’t say it’s the policy of Corry Schiermeyer’s office. I would say it’s often done on a case-by-case basis, by my office or others within the agency who feel that something was an egregious mischaracterization.”

That includes Wheeler, who Schiermeyer said objected to a tweet by Yahoo News correspondent Alexander Nazaryan about a speech Wheeler gave in June. Wheeler’s apparent peeve led to a news release asserting that Nazaryan “deliberately spread false information on twitter by misreporting Administrator Wheeler’s comments.” In response, Nazaryan tweeted Yahoo News “stands by the accuracy of our reporting.” Nazaryan declined to comment for this story.

News sources typically seek redress through discussion and negotiation with reporters and their editors. But the EPA’s critiques of Nazaryan and Politico had one striking difference: The agency posted its news releases without seeking a corrections or retractions the organizations, effectively blindsiding both. Schiermeyer acknowledged officials failed to do so, but said neither Politico nor Yahoo contacted the agency before publication.

Most recently, the agency trained its fire on the Society of Environmental Journalists (SEJ), in effect challenging en masse reporters who cover the EPA. Agency officials objected to a letter written by the group to Wheeler about the agency’s new Freedom of Information Act regulations. In a news release, the agency criticized the letter, saying it included “numerous inaccuracies that were regurgitated from false articles.”

“They took it as an opportunity to discredit or suggest environmental journalists were misleading the public,” said Bobby Magill, SEJ’s president. “It’s part of a larger pattern of trying to smear the press.”

Magill, a reporter for Bloomberg Environment, said he objected to “the tone” of the EPA’s response. “It’s one thing to set the record straight,” he said. “It’s a whole other thing to suggest you’re intentionally misleading people.”

But by rebutting in such a public way, the EPA risks calling more attention to the stories it’s disputing, a potential example of the Streisand effect, in which an effort to rebut or suppress information has the unintended consequence of drawing more interest to it (the phenomenon was named for legendary singer and actor Barbra Streisand, whose attempts to keep an aerial photograph of her Malibu home out of public view led to a spike of interest in it). The disputed Politico story, for example, was available only through Politico’s subscription service, so few would have known about it before the EPA complained.

Schiermeyer, however, thinks the approach can prevent worse outcomes. The public naming and shaming “can slow things down and sometimes stop misinformation from continuing to be repurposed,” she said. “You might not be able to stop the first reporter, but at least the second and third and fourth reporter” will see information the agency considers accurate."

The bill, H.R. 299, enables homebuyers using a VA loan to borrow above the 2019 limit of $484,350 for most counties, without any down payment.

A VA spokesperson told HousingWire that the loan limit will be lifted for loans that are guaranteed or appraised on or after January 1, 2020, and that guidance for lenders would be coming ahead of this date, published on the VA home loan circular page of its website.

The VA also clarified other changes that will go into effect as a result of the bill.

In addition to alleviating limits for veterans looking to purchase a home, H.R. 299 temporarily increase rates for certain loans by 0.15-0.30%, the VA said.

The slight bump in loan fees is intended to help finance health care costs for veterans who are suffering the effects of Agent Orange exposure as a result of their service.

Additional changes to the VA’s loan guaranty program include the elimination of funding fee differences for borrowers who are veterans versus those who are members of the Reserve.

It also removes the loan limit for the Native American Direct Loan Program, exempts Purple Heart recipients from paying loan fees, and authorizes VA-designated appraisers to rely on third parties for appraisal-related information.

The bill’s passage comes after years of lobbying on behalf of numerous trade groups, including the National Association of Realtors, which teamed with other housing industry trade groups to ensure veterans’ health care benefits would be extended without a significant increase to VA loan fees.

Now that the bill has passed, it is expected to “fast-track” disability compensation for as many as 90,000 affected former service members, according to military.com.

The VA said it does not have any formal projections as to how the changes brought on by the bill will its home loan guaranty program."

Level 1 - Exercise normal precautions

Level 2 - Exercise increased caution

Level 3 - Reconsider travel

Level 4 - Do not travel

Ocasio-Cortez wants to ax Homeland Security. Some conservatives didn’t want it to begin with.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Marisa Iati'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/07/11/ocasio-cortez-wants-axe-homeland-security-some-conservatives-didnt-want-it-begin-with/,"

Although some activists have urged the government to abolish its immigration enforcement arm, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) came out in favor of eradicating the entire Department of Homeland Security.

The department’s creation after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, significantly threatened American civil liberties, Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday on the WNYC podcast “the New Yorker Radio Hour.” She said she wanted to get rid of Homeland Security, the formation of which she called an “egregious mistake.”

“People sounded the alarm back then, that these agencies are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight, and it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies,” she told the New Yorker’s editor, David Remnick.

Conservative political figures immediately castigated the congresswoman’s proposal.

“Moronic, stupid, naive and dumb,” former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said on Fox News.

""Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner.

[‘Outright disrespectful’: Four House women struggle as Pelosi isolates them]

The usefulness of a Department of Homeland Security, however, wasn’t always taken for granted. President George W. Bush’s administration initially had “zero interest” in creating a new department to protect against terrorism, The Washington Post previously reported. Vice President Richard B. Cheney thought it would needlessly increase the size of government.

“Creating a Cabinet post doesn’t solve the problem,” White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said in March 2002, according to The Post.

Some members of Congress worried the White House was concealing the department’s true cost to avoid alienating Republicans who opposed the growth of government, USA Today reported in 2002. Certain conservative Republicans, meanwhile, said they would not oppose Bush’s proposal but wanted to move slowly, according to the Houston Chronicle.

When the House of Representatives initially voted on the department’s creation the following July, 132 members opposed the move, including 10 Republicans. Congress eventually passed the Homeland Security Act and Bush signed it into law that November, creating the Department of Homeland Security.

Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday that her proposal was “not that radical,” citing the reluctance of some members of Congress to support the department’s creation less than two decades ago.

“When DHS was 1st formed by Bush 17 years ago, many members of Congress were concerned — incl GOP — that we were setting up a ticking time bomb for civil liberties erosion & abuse of power,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.

It’s really not that radical.

Like some members of Congress, non-politicians also criticized the new department, which merged 22 federal agencies tasked with securing the country’s borders, protecting its infrastructure and guarding against terrorism.

James Bamford, a journalist and filmmaker who covers intelligence agencies, told CBS News in 2002 that creating Homeland Security was a public relations move that could actually decrease efficiency.

“Instead of moving people together, you should be moving information together,” Bamford told CBS. “You should be taking information and finding better ways to distribute it; faster ways to distribute it among people.”

In a 2003 article in National Review, conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru criticized Bush’s record as president, noting that Bush had “raised defense spending, given new powers to law enforcement, federalized airport security and created a new cabinet department for homeland security. . . . More people are working for the federal government than at any point since the end of the Cold War.”

[‘I hate this mission,’ says operator of new emergency shelter for migrant children]

Homeland Security was originally staffed by 180,000 employees from the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal offices. It also encompasses the agencies that oversee immigration, including Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Homeland Security now has a workforce of more than 240,000, making it the government’s third-biggest department, behind Defense and Veterans Affairs.

The Transportation Security Administration, which screens passengers at airports, was absorbed into Homeland Security just a year after it was created in response to 9/11 in November 2001. Conservatives at the time expressed concern that the new agency was unnecessarily bureaucratic and gave too much power to the government.

“Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state — of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove — was mistrust,” Slate reported. “The second most common opinion was fear.”

Republicans’ ire for the TSA survived a decade after the agency’s creation. Then-Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) in 2011 said Americans were “no safer today than they were before 9/11,” according to Forbes. The GOP’s 2012 presidential platform called for the privatization of airport security.

Calls to abolish Homeland Security are now made year after year, in publications ranging from policy journals to mainstream news outlets. In a tweet from 2018 shared by Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday, Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) recalled a time when conservatives viewed Homeland Security as overly bureaucratic.

“Conservatives used to want to abolish DHS — as well as many other departments and agencies that bloat government,” wrote Amash, who announced on the Fourth of July that he was leaving the Republican Party. “If only today’s members of Congress cared as much about defending the Constitution as they do about defending ICE, an agency that’s existed only since 2003.”

9th Circuit rules in favor of Trump admin in 'sanctuary city' case,https://thehill.com,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/452862-9th-circuit-rules-in-favor-of-trump-admin-in-sanctuary-city-case,"The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ruled in favor of the Trump administration's efforts to prioritize federal dollars for local policing to towns and cities that complied with certain immigration policies.

The ruling, a split 2-1 decision, said the Department of Justice (DOJ) was within its rights to withhold Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grants from sanctuary cities and states over their refusal to work with federal immigration enforcement authorities and instead prioritize agencies that focused on unauthorized immigration and agreed to give Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) access to jail records and immigrants in custody.

The city of Los Angeles first sued the administration after it was denied a $3 million grant on the grounds that it did not receive the money because it did not focus on immigration for its community policing grant application. The decision reversed a district court’s ruling.

“The panel rejected Los Angeles’s argument that DOJ’s practice of giving additional consideration to applicants that choose to further the two specified federal goals violated the Constitution’s Spending Clause,” wrote Judge Sandra Ikuta, joined by Judge Jay Bybee.

“The panel held that DOJ did not exceed its statutory authority in awarding bonus points to applicants that selected the illegal immigration focus area or that agreed to the Certification,” she wrote.

Judge Kim Wardlaw wrote in dissent that the Justice Department’s efforts to prioritize immigration in determining the awarding of COPS grants was “Orwellian” and said the majority’s ruling goes “astray.”

“The majority goes astray by finding no meaning in Congress’s use of the term ‘community-oriented policing’ and then deferring under Chevron to DOJ’s Orwellian effort to define ‘community-oriented policing’ to include 'partnering with federal law enforcement to address illegal immigration,' ” she wrote.

“Congress did not authorize COPS grants for anything other than placing additional state and local cops on the beat and promote community partnerships,” she wrote.

Congress created the fund in 1994 to provide federal assistance to state and local law enforcement to get more cops on beats and improve police-community interaction. It allowed the Justice Department to administer the funds.

EPA restores broad use of pesticide opposed by beekeepers,https://finance.yahoo.com,['Ellen Knickmeyer'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/epa-reverses-ban-pesticide-seen-170829055.html,"In this June 5, 2019, photo, a bee pollinates a milkweed flower at the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Laurel, Md. The Environmental Protection Agency will allow farmers to resume broad use of a pesticide over objections from beekeepers. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency will allow farmers to resume broad use of a pesticide over objections from beekeepers, citing private chemical industry studies that the agency says show the product does only lower-level harm to bees and wildlife.

Friday's EPA announcement — coming after the agriculture industry accused the agency of unduly favoring honeybees — makes sulfoxaflor the latest bug- and weed-killer allowed by the Trump administration despite lawsuits alleging environmental or human harm. The pesticide is made by Corteva Agriscience, a spinoff created last month out of the DowDuPont merger and restructuring.

Honeybees pollinate billions of dollars of food crops annually in the United States, but agriculture and other land uses that cut into their supply of pollen, as well as pesticides, parasites and other threats, have them on a sharp decline. The University of Maryland said U.S. beekeepers lost 38 percent of their bee colonies last winter alone, the highest one-winter loss in the 13-year history of their survey.

Emails and other records obtained from the EPA through Freedom of Information Act litigation by the Sierra Club, and provided to The Associated Press, show sorghum growers in particular had pressed senior officials at the agency for a return to broad use of sulfoxaflor.

Sorghum growers regard honeybees as just another ""non-native livestock"" in the United States, lobbyist Joe Bischoff said in one 2017 email to agency officials, and by cutting threats to the bees, ""EPA has chosen that form of agriculture over all others.""

A federal appeals court had ordered the EPA to withdraw approval for sulfoxaflor in 2015, ruling in a lawsuit brought by U.S. beekeeping groups that not enough was known about what it did to bees.

EPA Assistant Administrator Alexandra Dapolito Dunn said Friday that new industry studies that have not been made public show a low level of harm to bees and other creatures beyond the targeted crop pests.

Dunn said EPA's newly reset rules for use of sulfoxaflor, such as generally prohibiting spraying of fruit and nut-bearing plants in bloom, when pollinators would be attracted to the flowers, would limit harm to bees. She called it ""an important and highly effective tool for growers.""

Michele Colopy, program director of the Pollinator Stewardship Council, one of the beekeeping groups that had successfully sued to block sulfoxaflor, said the EPA limits weren't enough to protect bees and other beneficial bugs whose numbers are declining.

""We understand farmers want to have every tool in their toolbox,"" when it comes to curbing insects that damage crops. ""But the ... pesticides are just decimating beneficial insects,"" Colopy said.

An environmental group charged the EPA with sidestepping the usual public review in reapproving broader use of the pesticide.

""The Trump EPA's reckless approval... without any public process is a terrible blow to imperiled pollinators,"" said Lori Ann Burd, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's environmental health program.

Separately, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced without fanfare on July 1 that it would stop collecting quarterly data on honeybee colonies, citing budget restrictions. Beekeepers and others used the data to track losses and growth in U.S. honeybee colonies.

Other Trump administration decisions have upheld market use of the weed-killing glyphosate, which is now the target of thousands of consumer lawsuits over alleged harm to people exposed to it, and shelved an Obama-era decision to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos as a threat to human health.

VA Appoints First-Ever Artificial Intelligence Director,https://www.nextgov.com,['Jack Corrigan'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2019/07/va-appoints-first-ever-artificial-intelligence-director/158365/,"The Veterans Affairs Department on Wednesday appointed its first director of artificial intelligence as part of a broader push to expand research into the emerging tech.

The agency tapped Dr. Gil Alterovitz, a Harvard Medical School professor and member of the Computational Health Informatics Program at Boston Children’s Hospital, to spearhead its efforts to improve veteran care through AI-enabled solutions. Alterovitz will be based within the agency’s research and development office, according to a blog post on the VA website.

Beyond his professional medical experience, Alterovitz comes to the job with a number of government bona fides under his belt. He served as a presidential innovation fellow in 2017 and recently helped the White House update its national AI research and development strategy. According to his LinkedIn profile, he also sat on the Obama administration’s Precision Medicine Task Force.

In his new role, much of Alterovitz’s work will center on deriving more insights from the troves of data the agency holds on the more than 9 million veterans in its care, according to the department. Because AI can analyze so much information at once, medical professionals see enormous potential for the tech to spur new medical breakthroughs, improve diagnoses and personalize patient treatment.

“That is what you need to do optimal AI—a lot of deep knowledge,” Alterovitz said in the post. “AI is key to really taking advantage of that data to help vets and potentially others, as well.”

According to the post, he’s already leading an effort to connect the department with AI experts in academia and industry, which could ultimately lead to more research collaboration and information sharing. Alterovitz is also taking stock of the various AI projects already underway in different parts of the department, the department wrote.

“Given how health care is evolving, AI is really the only way to move forward in terms of reducing costs and providing better care,” Alterovitz said."

Looking Back At Secretary Alex Acosta's Tenure At The Labor Department,https://www.npr.org,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/12/741237553/looking-back-at-secretary-alex-acostas-tenure-at-the-labor-department,"Looking Back At Secretary Alex Acosta's Tenure At The Labor Department

Secretary Alex Acosta stepped down Friday from the Department of Labor. NPR's Audie Cornish talks with Bloomberg Law senior reporter Ben Penn about Acosta's tenure at the department.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta resigned today. His resignation comes just days after his role in the more-than-decade-old plea deal of multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein was spelled out. Epstein was accused of sex crimes but received a light sentence after pleading guilty to lesser charges.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ALEX ACOSTA: I do not think it is right and fair for this administration's Labor Department to have Epstein as the focus rather than the incredible economy that we have today. And so I called the president this morning; I told him that I thought the right thing was to step aside.

CORNISH: That's Acosta at the White House, standing next to President Trump, who said this.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I just want to let you know - this was him, not me. Because I'm with him.

CORNISH: So what was Acosta like as secretary of labor? To learn more about Acosta's tenure, we have Ben Penn. He's senior reporter, covering labor and employment for Bloomberg Law. And welcome to the studio.

BEN PENN: Thank you for having me.

CORNISH: So to begin, this is a labor secretary who didn't have a business background, didn't have a labor background. So what made him unique to this position?

PENN: He came from a legal background. He was the dean of Florida International University Law School for about the previous eight years before he became labor secretary. He had been a U.S. attorney based out of South Florida - obviously, because of the Epstein case. So...

CORNISH: It seemed like he would have been on a judicial track.

PENN: Yes. So there was wide speculation, in part due to the fact that he is good friends with the Federalist Society's Leonard Leo, that his ultimate dream was to become a federal judge, and that is no longer a reality for him now that he is embroiled in the Epstein scandal. But it was definitely something that played a role in how he ruled the Department of Labor in a more legally-minded, deliberate, cautious manner.

CORNISH: How did his role change over time?

PENN: So in his first year and a half as labor secretary, he faced criticism from the business community and some of the more conservative forces in the White House for stalling deregulatory actions that businesses would have favored, such as a rule that would have been a more moderate approach than the Obama administration to determining who is eligible for overtime. And what we saw then, starting in 2019, once Mick Mulvaney became acting chief of staff, was Acosta really had some of his power taken away from him.

I reported earlier this year that Mulvaney instituted a formalized system where, whenever White House assistants and DOL agency heads below Acosta reached an impasse on a deregulatory matter, it would get automatically elevated up to Mulvaney for a final decision. And frequently, Acosta was getting overruled to the point that the Labor Department stopped exercising this system altogether because they knew that Mulvaney was going to have final say.

CORNISH: To that end, what kind of criticism did he get from, say, labor activists? How was he viewed?

PENN: Interestingly, labor activists did not really come out full throttle against Alex Acosta, and really, that's because they feel that Acosta gave them a fair shot. He was not a type of Cabinet member who sought to destroy the agency from the inside out, like other Trump Cabinet members have been criticized for. The perception was, among labor activists, that this was about as good of a labor secretary that they could ask for.

CORNISH: Who might take his place? What would the White House be looking for?

PENN: So right now, Acting Labor Secretary Patrick Pizzella - or at least he'll become acting labor secretary effective one week from today. Pizzella is well-liked by some members of the White House, I'm told, so it wouldn't surprise me at all if he already has an inside track on the nomination, if there were to be one.

CORNISH: That's Ben Penn, senior reporter with Bloomberg Law. Thanks for your reporting.

PENN: Thank you very much for having me.

Ocasio-Cortez made her remarks during a Friday appearance on the New Yorker Radio with host David Remnick.

“ICE is not under the (Department of Justice),” Ocasio-Cortez says. “It’s under the Department of Homeland Security. And so we have now—”

“Would you get rid of the Department of Homeland Security, too?” Remnick asks.

“I think so,” she says. “I think we need to undo a lot of the egregious, umm, a lot of the egregious mistakes that the Bush administration did.”

US yield curve continued to steepen overnight; Fed Chair Powell’s Senate testimony didn’t break any new ground; equities and currencies have consolidated overnight; NZ 10 year swap rate traded 6bps hi,https://www.interest.co.nz,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.interest.co.nz/currencies/100669/us-yield-curve-continued-steepen-overnight-fed-chair-powell%E2%80%99s-senate-testimony,"The US yield curve continued to steepen overnight, with a higher than expected US core CPI release and a very weak 30 year US bond auction pushing up longer-dated rates while shorter-dated rates remained anchored by expectations of near-term Fed rate cuts. Fed Chair Powell’s Senate testimony didn’t break any new ground and the market prices 31bps (of cuts) for the Fed’s meeting later this month. Equities and currencies have consolidated overnight after moving sharply in response to Powell’s dovish testimony to Congress the previous night.

After falling in response to Powell’s dovish testimony to Congress on Wednesday night, US rates headed higher overnight, led by the long-end of the curve. The 10 year Treasury yield increased 6bps to its highest level since mid-June, at 2.12%, while the 30 year bond yield rose 7bps to 2.65%. Global rates have also risen overnight, with the 10 year gilt yield up 8bps and Germany 10 year bund yield rising 4bps to -0.23%. The NZ 10 year swap rate traded 6bps higher than the NZ market close in London, at 1.815%.

Core CPI rose a higher than expected 0.3% in June, taking the annual rate of increase to 2.1% (vs. 2.0% expected). Some of the idiosyncratic factors that have weighed on US core inflation this year reversed in June, with used car prices rising 1.6% (the first rise in five months) and apparel inflation turning positive. The heavily-weighted shelter category – which makes up around 40% of the core index – increased 0.3% in June. Low vacancy rates and a strong labour market have supported higher rates of rental inflation over recent years, in turn boosting the rate of core CPI inflation. Shelter, however, comprises a much lower (around 18%) weight in the Fed’s preferred measure of core inflation, the core PCE inflation, which is currently running at 1.6%.

A very weak 30 year Treasury bond auction added upward pressure to long-end rates. The 30 year bond auction tailed 2.5bps, tentatively suggesting some investor resistance to the low levels of rates.

The short-end of the curve meanwhile has been more sticky – the 2 year Treasury yield is only 2bps higher – with market participants sceptical that the upside surprise to CPI will dissuade the Fed from cutting rates later this month, although the implied probability of a 50bp move was marked down slightly. There is now 31bps priced-in for the July meeting, suggesting a not insignificant risk of a 50bp move, compared to 33bps yesterday. The market prices 67bps of cuts by the end of the year and 96bps by the end of 2020.

Coming only a day after his dovish testimony to Congress, Fed Chair Powell’s Senate appearance unsurprisingly wasn’t market moving. The underlying tone of Powell’s comments was dovish, as he noted that “the neutral interest rate is lower than we had thought and I think we’re learning that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than we thought…so monetary policy hasn’t been as accommodative as we had thought.” The median estimate of the so-called ‘neutral rate’ was marked down by Fed officials at the June meeting from 2.8% to 2.5%.

There have also been a number of Fed officials on the wires overnight, including NY Fed President Williams, Atlanta Fed President Bostic and Richmond Fed President Barkin. Barkin and Bostic, neither of whom are voting members on the FOMC this year, both sounded unconvinced on the need to cut rates at this stage. Barkin noted that “with unemployment so low and consumer spending so healthy, it’s equally hard to make a case for stepping on the gas” while Bostic said he thought inflation wasn’t as low as some had suggested and he was sceptical about the need for a July cut. While a rate cut In July still seems like a foregone conclusion, and the core of the FOMC (Powell, vice-Chair Clarida, and Williams) have outlined the rationale for easing, the resistance among some regional Fed presidents probably argues more in favour of a 25bp move.

Equity markets have been little moved, despite the increase in longer-dated Treasury yields, with market participants seemingly taking comfort in the Fed’s likely rate cut later this month. The S&P500 is flat on the day, as it consolidates around the 3,000 mark. Trump tweeted that “China is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great Farmers that they said they would. Hopefully they will start soon!”, but there was little market impact.

The USD continued to drift lower through yesterday’s Asian trading session and into the London morning as the market digested Powell’s dovish message from his Congressional testimony. But the higher than expected CPI release halted the decline in the USD and it has since moved higher. The USD is down slightly since this time yesterday, by about 0.1% in index terms.

The NZD and AUD have outperformed (both around 0.25% higher over the past 24 hours), with the NZD trading around 0.6665. The NZD remains firmly mid-range.

There was little reaction to the release of the minutes to the ECB’s June meeting which noted that there was “broad agreement” among Governing Council members that the ECB might need to ease policy again. Since the June meeting, ECB President Draghi has effectively foreshadowed a new round of monetary policy easing, unless there was an improvement in the outlook for growth and inflation.

Interior Dept. says it spent $2.45M in public funds on Trump’s ‘Salute to America’,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://wtop.com/dc/2019/07/interior-dept-says-it-spent-2-45m-in-public-funds-on-trumps-salute-to-america/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of department's share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July 4 ""Salute to America"" at $2.45 million.

In a letter to lawmakers on Capitol Hill made public Thursday, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of the department’s share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July Fourth “Salute to America” at the Lincoln Memorial at $2.45 million.

Bernhardt called the use of public funds justified, and cited past administrations’ spending for concerts, parades and other celebrations in and around the National Mall.

Interior’s costs included crowd accommodations, such as temporary fencing and portable toilets.

The disclosure confirms what The Washington Post had previously reported: that close to $2.5 million was diverted from the National Park Service, which normally uses the money from entrance and recreation fees to make improvements to U.S. parks.

Arizona Democrat Raul Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the public funds were used to “celebrate President Trump.”

There are further concerns from local leaders as well.

In a Tuesday letter to Trump, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the president’s Fourth of July event on the National Mall, as well as protests by others, have left the city’s security fund bankrupt, and that it will be running at a deficit of more than $6 million by the end of September.

She attributed the Emergency Planning and Security Fund (EPSF) numbers to estimates by the District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency and said the total cost for the District is estimated at $1.7 million.

The EPSF covers public safety at events, anti-terror efforts and support for the Secret Service.

Security for the annual “A Capitol Fourth” concert, which was held the same day on the National Mall, was provided by the federal Capitol Police and U.S. Park Police, not D.C. police.

Bowser also said D.C. still hasn’t been reimbursed the $7.3 million extra it spent for Trump’s 2017 inauguration.

“These overages can be attributed to declining reserves, increased demand for heightened security, and a one-time draw down of $7.3 million to cover security costs associated with the 2017 presidential inauguration,” Bowser wrote.

The White House debates that figure.

Reached for comment about Bowser’s letter, the White House said: “We have received the letter and will respond in a timely manner.”

Senators are also seeking to probe the cost of the event, which included military flyovers and tanks on the National Mall.

WTOP has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request with the National Park Service, via the Interior Department, to see a cost breakdown for the event.

A Defense Department spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the Pentagon spent $1.2 million on the “Salute to America” celebration, which does not factor in the cost of flyovers, since the flyovers are being listed as training flights to “facilitate flying hours, which are imperative to military readiness.”

That puts known cost estimates for “Salute to America” at $5.35 million.

Obama's DHS secretary on upcoming ICE raids: 'We simply have to enforce the law',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/obamas-dhs-secretary-on-upcoming-ice-raids-we-simply-have-to-enforce-the-law,"Jeh Johnson, who served as secretary of homeland security under President Barack Obama, said there is nothing unusual with the upcoming raids from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that are targeting illegal immigrants who have orders for deportation.

""Deportations occur all the time. Of those who have been ordered deported by an immigration judge, hopefully after they have exhausted their appeal rights and had an opportunity to have their asylum case heard, we simply have to enforce the law, particularly if someone has been ordered deported,"" Johnson said on Morning Joe Friday.

""In other words, they’ve exhausted all their appeal rights. And so, it's important for migrants to know they have rights. But enforcement actions themselves are not extraordinary,"" he added.

Johnson has been a unique voice in speaking out against Democrats' recent rhetoric on immigration. When Democrats started to criticize the Trump administration for keeping migrants in ""cages,"" Johnson said that practice did not begin when Trump became president.

“Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented on Jan. 20, 2017, OK?"" he said.

He also called out the 2020 Democrats' proposal to decriminalize border crossing because that ""is tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders."""

US Suspends Low-Level Radioactive Waste Shipments to Nevada,https://time.com,['Scott Sonner'],,,,https://time.com/5624166/nevada-radioactive-waste-shipments-rick-perry/,"(RENO, Nev.) — A Nevada congressman called for U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry’s resignation Wednesday after the department acknowledged multiple shipments of low-level radioactive waste to a site north of Las Vegas may have been mislabeled and out of compliance with safety regulations for years.

The department had announced earlier that shipments of the waste from Tennessee to Nevada have been suspended while it investigates whether the materials were “potentially mischaracterized” as the wrong category of low-level waste. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals.

Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette also has ordered a department-wide assessment of its “procedures and practices for packaging and shipping all radioactive waste types,” according to a memo.

Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said none of the materials shipped to Nevada as early as 2013 from the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public.

But she acknowledged the shipments slated for disposal at the Nevada National Security Site were not in compliance with the site’s acceptance criteria.

The department’s National Nuclear Security Administration has launched an internal investigation “to determine how this went undetected for a six-year period,” Hynes said in a statement on Wednesday.

The low-level waste material is unrelated to weapons-grade plutonium that the department secretly shipped to the same Nevada site last year from South Carolina and is currently at the center of a legal battle with the state of Nevada in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

But Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nevada, said in calling for Perry to “resign immediately” that the new disclosure is further evidence that Nevada has been covertly “coerced” into illegally receiving nuclear materials “through negligence or outright trickery.”

Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and other members of Nevada’s congressional delegation stopped short of demanding Perry resign but were equally critical of his department’s handling of the waste.

“The level of incompetence at the Department of Energy is only matched by its dishonesty,” Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nevada, said.

Sisolak said Brouillette telephoned him on July 3 to inform him that the department “has been shipping incorrectly labeled low-level waste” from Tennessee to Nevada.

Sisolak also released a letter he and Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen sent to Perry on July 5 expressing their concerns and demanding more details.

The Democratic governor said he was more fully briefed on the situation during both classified and unclassified meetings in Las Vegas on Tuesday with senior department officials, including Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, head of DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration.

Sisolak said he originally was told the waste shipped out of compliance with the department’s criteria governing low-level waste disposal at the Nevada site included 32 total shipments that began in 2013 and ended last December. But his office clarified there were six shipments that included a total of 32 canisters.

Sisolak said the department hasn’t determined yet whether the material labeled as low-level waste may have included mixed low-level waste, which is regulated more stringently under state and federal guidelines and requires treatment prior to disposal.

For example, Sisolak said the Energy Department entered into a settlement agreement with the state in May after DOE was cited for accepting low-level radioactive waste at the Nevada site that was subsequently found to be contaminated with chromium at a toxicity level higher than is allowed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act — “thereby rendering it a mixed, low-level radioactive waste.”

Hynes said Wednesday the department leadership first was notified on July 3 that certain shipments of waste managed by a contractor at the Y-12 facility failed to comply with the Nevada site’s criteria, and may have been “mischaracterized” as low-level waste.

“The components that were shipped have been disposed of in a safe and secure manner at the NNSS, and as a precaution, planned future shipments of components from Y-12 have been temporarily suspended,” she said.

""Administrator Wheeler, I'd like to ask you to please support a fair contract for EPA workers,"" Loreen Targos, an EPA scientist in the Great Lakes area, is seen saying in a video provided by the union. ""Please reward my award-winning labor by negotiating a fair contract.""

Targos was receiving a Silver Medal award on stage at EPA headquarters when she unveiled a banner reading ""Care about EPA workers having a fair contract to address public health & climate change, Do you?"" She also criticized the agency's recent unilateral change to the master bargaining agreement with the American Federation of Government Employees, one of several unions representing EPA employees.

Targos said a fair contract is needed to continue research into ""fighting climate change.""

"Jeffrey Epstein has been charged with sex trafficking, a move this University of Utah professor has sought for nearly a dozen years",https://www.sltrib.com,"['Jmiller Sltrib.Com', 'Jessica Miller']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/07/08/jeffrey-epstein-has-been/,"A politically connected multimillionaire could end up spending the rest of his life in prison if he’s convicted on new federal charges leveled Monday accusing him of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls in Manhattan and Florida.

But a University of Utah law professor has been arguing for nearly a dozen years that if the justice system had worked the way it should, financier Jeffrey Epstein would have faced similar charges long ago.

Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who has cultivated a reputation as a victim rights champion, interjected in the long saga involving Epstein in 2008, when the man was allowed to quietly resolve similar allegations in Florida in an agreement that was initially kept secret from the women leveling the allegations. Epstein spent only one year in jail for a prostitution charge.

The Utah professor has been working with Florida-based attorney Bradley Edwards to challenge that lenient deal. They argue in a lawsuit that the resolution violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act because their clients were not allowed to confer with prosecutors and be heard at public proceedings regarding any pleas and sentencing.

On Monday, Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges, but not in the Florida courtroom as Cassell had been working toward.

Instead, federal prosecutors in New York took the step of filing criminal charges, alleging Epstein abused dozens of underage girls at his Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla., homes and paid his victims to bring in other young girls whom he assaulted.

Epstein was arrested over the weekend, and pleaded not guilty to two charges in federal court Monday.

It’s not clear from the indictment whether those allegations involve Cassell’s clients — who are identified in court papers as Jane Doe #1 and #2 — though there are overlapping dates. Cassell did say Monday that the women he represents are pleased with the latest developments.

“My clients are happy to learn about the arrest,” he said. “And look forward to seeing the process take its course.”

(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Paul Cassell makes an announcement regarding the Utah Supreme Court Petition on behalf of Jane Does and House Bill 281, during a news conference at the Salt Lake City and County Building, Wednesday, April 3, 2019.

Cassell and Edwards filed their suit in 2008, alleging that their clients were victims of sex-trafficking crimes committed by Epstein and were cut out of conversations about a plea deal that has been widely criticized as being too lenient.

Article continues below

Instead, they allege, the government secretly negotiated an agreement that precluded any federal prosecution — though federal prosecutors in New York said Monday that the deal only applied to the Southern District of Florida. The agreement allowed Epstein to plead guilty in state court in Florida to two counts of solicitation of a prostitution involving a minor. He served 13 months behind bars, but was allowed to leave daily for work.

Earlier this year, the judge overseeing the lawsuit involving Cassell ruled that prosecutors violated the law in offering Epstein a plea agreement without informing his victims. Now, attorneys are sparring in court papers over what should be be done next.

Cassell has argued the deal should be rescinded, and that his clients should be allowed to ask for federal prosecutors in Florida to try the case. Government attorneys say that’s not possible — and said undoing the deal could harm some of the victims. They are instead suggesting that a Department of Justice representative meet with the victims to explain the decision that was made then to offer a plea deal, hold a public hearing where victims can make impact statements and conduct additional trainings for federal prosecutors in central Florida.

Epstein, a 66-year-old hedge fund manager whose friends have included President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton, is accused in the new indictment of recruiting girls to give him a massage that over time became increasingly sexual. He then paid the victims hundreds of dollars, according to the indictment, and offered more money if the girls recruited other underage victims. The indictment alleges his victims were as young as 14, and federal prosecutors allege Epstein knew the girls were under 18 because some had “expressly told him their age.”

Federal prosecutors say Epstein committed the crimes between 2002 and 2005. He is accused of instructing the girls to perform nude or partially nude massages, which often escalated to other sex acts which included groping the girls.

Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said in a news conference Monday that the girls Epstein allegedly abused were “particularly vulnerable” to exploitation.

""The alleged behavior shocks the conscience,"" he said. ""And while the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, it is still profoundly important to many alleged victims, now young women. They deserve their day in court, and we are proud to be standing up for them by bringing this indictment.""

Cassell noted Monday that before Berman’s news conference, a giant poster was displayed which included a request for anyone else who may have been victimized to come forward and call 1-800-CALL-FBI with any other information."

US rift with UK deepens as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross cancels meeting over presence of British ambassador,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross-cancels-meeting-with-uk-trade-minister-over-presence-of-british-ambassador,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross abruptly canceled a long-planned meeting with Britain's Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox Tuesday because the British Ambassador to the U.S. Kim Darroch was also due to attend.

A Trump administration source said that the meeting was jettisoned because of the row over leaked secret cables from Darroch that described President Trump as ""inept"" and ""incompetent."" The source said that it showed the rift between the Trump administration over the leaks was ""a real thing"" and growing.

The source said that Ross has been on personally ""warm and friendly"" terms with Darroch, who has been ambassador since January 2016, sitting down for dinner with him only a few days ago. The cancellation of the meeting calls into question the ability of Darroch, 65, to do his job and could hasten his recall to London.

A Commerce Department spokesman told the Washington Examiner: ""The department is working to reschedule today’s meeting to a mutually agreeable time.” The spokesman declined to comment further.

On Monday, Darroch's invitation to a White House dinner was rescinded. On Tuesday morning, hours before the planned meeting with Ross, Trump mocked Darroch via Twitter, describing him as a ""pompous guy"" and a ""very stupid fool.""

President Trump said Sunday Darroch had “not served the UK well” by writing in official cables to London, subsequently leaked to the public, that the White House was “uniquely dysfunctional” and “inept."" He added: ""We are not big fans of that man … I can say things about him, but I won’t bother.""

Fox, a longtime ally of Washington conservatives, has criticized the leaks but defended Darroch, saying he was ""held in high regard."" He told BBC Radio Monday: ""It’s not a problem with the ambassador. This a problem with the ethics of the individual who carried out this particular leak.""

Darroch, a former British national security adviser and ambassador to the European Union, was due to leave his post at the end of the year and to retire."
Why the latest USDA report offers little good news for farmers,https://www.accuweather.com,[],,,,https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/why-the-latest-usda-report-offers-little-good-news-for-farmers/70008768,"July 08, 2019 Why the latest USDA report offers little good news for farmers

By John Roach, AccuWeather staff writer July 08, 2019, 4:42:51 PM EDT



The latest Crop Progress from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offered little comfort to U.S. farmers dealing with a difficult planting season. For the fourth straight week, the condition of corn and soybeans was rated below 60%.

The rain and flooding that has impacted Corn Belt farmers has affected the percentage of corn considered “good” or “excellent” in 18 key corn-producing states. That number this week is 57%; the first rating of the season was 59%, followed by consecutive weeks at 56%. The condition of corn rated “good” or “excellent” last year at this time was 75%.

The condition of soybeans in 18 soybean-producing states considered “good” or “excellent” is 53%, compared to 54% last week. That figure was at 71% this time last year.

The bad news continues for Illinois, which is joined by Iowa as the top corn-producing states, typically accounting for about one-third of the U.S. crop, according to the USDA. The condition of corn in Illinois rated ""good"" or ""excellent"" is just 37%, even lower than last week’s rating of 42%.

Other states with particularly poor corn condition data this week include Missouri (28%), Ohio (34%) and Indiana (38%). Those three states also had low percentages for the condition of soybeans, too: Ohio (28%), Missouri (35%) and Indiana (37%).

Next week’s numbers may not be much better.

AccuWeather predicts the 2019 corn yield will be the lowest since 2012

A great unknown still remains for US farmers

‘Things are looking up’ weather-wise for the Corn Belt, but is it too late?

Dry weather to gradually expand across northeastern US early this week

“The weather overall for the heart of the Midwest for the next 10 days is slightly negative,” said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Jason Nicholls. “There’s not a whole lot of rain, but the temperatures will be favorable because it will be somewhat warmer than normal. It does look like they’ll get some helpful rains later next week.”

A new AccuWeather analysis predicts there will be 13.03 billion bushels of corn produced this year. That would be the lowest total since 2012 when 10.76 billion bushels of corn were harvested. In 2018, the total was 14.42 billion bushels.

The USDA’s 2019 corn production estimate as of June 28 is higher, at 13.88 billion bushels.

But the talks have bogged down amid acrimony between Democrats and the White House, and now Washington’s leaders run the risk of a fiscal pileup that could also imperil President Trump’s effort to update the North American Free Trade Agreement.

White House officials have said the debt ceiling must be raised by early September to ensure the government can pay its bills. And spending on many federal programs expires at the end of September, requiring a separate deal to prevent a government shutdown.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin consulted with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) this week and met Wednesday with GOP leaders, alongside acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, trying to forge a solution. Pelosi has made clear that any increase in the federal debt limit should come as part of a broader, two-year budget deal — an approach also favored by leading Senate Republicans — but it’s far from clear whether lawmakers and the administration will be able to reach such an agreement before Congress leaves town for its annual summer recess in August.

The debt ceiling “is something we’re having discussions about, updating the numbers and potentially the need to do something before everybody leaves” for the August recess, Mnuchin told reporters after exiting a meeting in the office of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday evening.

“We just want it passed. We don’t care how it’s passed,” Mnuchin added when asked if the administration would prefer a stand-alone vote on the debt ceiling, as opposed to packaging it with a larger budget deal.

Mnuchin is serving as the White House’s emissary with Democrats because Pelosi has largely brushed aside most other senior White House officials.

She has dismissed Mulvaney, saying he has “no credibility” on spending issues because he pushed to shut down the government while serving in the House. She has also castigated Attorney General William P. Barr and accused him of lying to Congress, and made a cutting remark to the White House budget chief during a recent meeting .

The one bright spot had appeared to be her respect for U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer, who had spent more than a year carefully cultivating ties with top Democrats in a push to revamp NAFTA. But even that effort is now under extreme strain, as labor unions and vocal Democrats are demanding major changes that might be politically infeasible.

All these dynamics will test the withering relationship between Pelosi and Trump. Pelosi has tried to hold back her caucus from launching a formal impeachment proceeding against Trump, but she faces mounting pressure as the 2020 presidential campaign picks up steam.

Trump’s attacks against her became quite personal last month, when he called her a “nasty, vindictive, horrible person” and a “disgrace” during a Fox News interview in France. That led Pelosi to effectively dismiss him, responding “I’m done with him” just a few days later.

Pelosi has also shown little regard for Trump’s top deputies. She has been unsparing in her public criticisms of Mulvaney. At one point during a budget negotiation in May, Pelosi snubbed acting budget director Russell Vought when he spoke up to reiterate a point. Turning to Vought, Pelosi asked, “What was your name again, dear?” according to an individual who witnessed the exchange and spoke on the condition of anonymity to recount it.

This unraveling could have real consequences for the country.

A think tank warned on Monday that the debt ceiling must be raised very soon or the government could risk missing payments on its bills by early September, but so far lawmakers and the White House have not been able to come up with a solution. Part of the problem, congressional aides and White House officials said, is a disconnect between senior administration officials and Democrats on Capitol Hill.

[GOP in disarray as budget impasse threatens shutdown, deep cuts — and default]

On Tuesday, before speaking on the phone with Mnuchin, Pelosi went so far as to dismiss the idea of meeting with administration officials at all while the budget impasse languishes, saying it would be pointless.

“I don’t see any reason to have a meeting. They know where we are. We’ve met, we’ve met, we’ve met,” Pelosi told reporters.

Pelosi’s comments left Republican lawmakers fuming and alarmed as they pointed to the series of approaching deadlines.

To cut a deal, White House officials have signaled an openness to increasing spending levels for next year, a position they did not hold a few months ago. But Democrats want to lock in more spending increases, and talks have broken down repeatedly. Congress is scheduled to be on recess in August and the first week of September, leaving scant time for action.

“We’re headed for a train wreck, so she’s either got to step up and start leading or just yield to the Senate, I suppose,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). “I’m one, having served in the House, that’s a little bit sympathetic to the management challenges she has, but that’s the price of leadership.”

At the same time, Republican leaders and Trump administration officials had long hoped to see action on Trump’s revamped North American trade deal, a top promise from his campaign, before the recess. But that now looks barely feasible as House Democrats and organized labor press to reopen the deal to make changes including strengthened enforcement of environmental and labor standards, and to address provisions on prescription drugs they see as overly generous to industry.

Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a longtime Pelosi ally who has been vocal in the trade debate, dismissed the chances of a vote on a new trade deal before fall.

“It’s not going to happen,” DeLauro said. “It’s got to be right in the content, which is what we’re striving for. That doesn’t mean it’s not going to be done. But I don’t believe it will be done before the August recess.”

DeLauro added that Pelosi will be the one to make the call on when — and if — to move on the trade deal. “That’s her prerogative.”

In an interview at a CNBC event this week, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was waiting for a “green light” from Pelosi before moving forward. That ability of the speaker to single-handedly sink the North America trade deal by declining to put it on the floor has led to an increasingly desperate pressure campaign by Republican lawmakers and administration officials, including Vice President Pence, who has been traveling to Midwestern cities with manufacturing bases to make the case for the pact.

Trump had previously threatened Democrats that he would completely withdraw from the existing 1994 NAFTA deal if the updated version does not receive a vote, but he has not made that threat in a while as he tries to solicit more help from Pelosi.

“We need pressure on Speaker Pelosi to actually confirm that she will bring it up, and that she will be supporting this initiative,” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) pleaded Tuesday.

But if Pelosi is feeling pressured to act swiftly on the trade deal, she has not shown it. At a recent news conference, she alluded to — and dismissed — the anxiety expressed by Republicans over allowing the pact to linger so long that it becomes fatally tied up in the 2020 presidential campaign and gets killed by campaign trail politics.

“The ambassador [Lighthizer] frequently will say, ‘We just don’t want to get this into the presidential,’ ” Pelosi said. “But that really doesn’t have anything to do with — it’s about the substance of the agreement, not the politics at all.”

For Pelosi, the mounting pressures over the budget, debt ceiling and trade arrive as she is coming off the most divisive episode of her speakership to date, last month’s vote on an emergency border spending bill that tore apart her caucus. After Pelosi caved to demands from moderates and put a Senate bill opposed by liberals on the floor for a vote, some liberals turned on the moderates in an ugly and very public display of disunity, unloading on them for supporting the legislation.

[House passes $4.6 billion border bill as leaders cave to moderate Democrats and GOP]

Although Pelosi has long commanded widespread bipartisan respect as a steely negotiator, the episode led some to question whether she will be able to steer a trade bill or a budget deal through her restive caucus. Some senior administration officials and Republicans have questioned whether Pelosi controls enough votes to deliver on a compromise.

“After watching how much difficulty she had passing the emergency supplemental, I don’t know where the votes are — and she knows that better than I would,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). “She’s a dealmaker but she’s also going to extract as much out of the deal as she can, so that’s why she’s not in a big hurry.”

Even as Pelosi has sought to keep the lid on liberal demands for impeachment proceedings against Trump, that task could get exponentially tougher next week, when former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III will appear before Congress for the first time to testify.

Pelosi’s defenders, though, say that if deals on the budget or on trade prove elusive, the fault lies not with the House speaker but with a president who has proved to be an unreliable negotiator time and again. In past rounds of budget brinkmanship, Trump repeatedly shifted stances or undercut his own top lieutenants, leading Democrats to question whether they have a partner in the White House they can work with.

In private, Pelosi and Trump’s conversations on the border spending bill and other topics have been more cordial and productive than their public comments might suggest, aides say. But for the House speaker and the president, the coming battles over the budget and trade could prove the biggest test yet.

“If anybody can do it, it’ll be Nancy, and I think that over the years of her leadership she has proven that,” said Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee. But, Roybal-Allard said, “I think this time is more challenging than ever.”"
Former State Department employee sentenced to 40 months for taking gifts from Chinese intelligence,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/politics/state-department-chinese-spies-sentenced/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A former State Department employee was sentenced to more than three years in prison Tuesday after she pleaded guilty in April to trading sensitive information with Chinese intelligence officers in exchange for lavish gifts.

Candace Claiborne, who had worked for the State Department in countries across the globe since 1999, will also face three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000, according to the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.

""The targeting of U.S. security clearance holders by Chinese intelligence services is a constant threat we face, and today's sentencing shows that those who betray the trust of the American people will be held accountable for their actions,"" said John P. Selleck, the acting assistant director of the FBI's Washington field office.

Claiborne was charged in 2017 with taking gifts -- including electronics, vacations and a fully-furnished apartment, as well tuition payments to a Chinese fashion school for a family member -- from two Chinese officials. She was also charged with lying about her interactions with the officials on clearance forms and in interviews with government background investigators.

According to plea documents, Claiborne met with the intelligence officials monthly while on a posting in China and on multiple occasions handed over manila envelopes stuffed with printed cables, white papers and other non-public documents about the movements and discussions of US diplomats.

Rep. Nunes on Christopher Steele's grilling by DOJ investigators: A lot of the dossier 'was just made up',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/devin-nunes-christopher-steele-dossier-fbi-questioning,"Rep. Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday he believes the public will soon see that much of the Trump-Russia dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele was ""made up.""

According to a New York Times report, FBI officials questioned one of Steele's sources and ""came to suspect that the man might have added his own interpretations to reports from his own sources that he passed on to Mr. Steele, calling into question the reliability of the information.""

Steele was interviewed as part of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's probe of how the FBI used the unverified dossier, including its role in obtaining a surveillance warrant against then-Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Reacting on ""Fox News @ Night,"" Nunes, R-Calif., said Steele refused to talk to the House Intelligence Committee while he served as chairman in 2017 and 2018.

""This is a man who made up this entire document. As you're starting to see it's unraveling, his sources are not real or if they are real they're second and third hand. So a lot of this is just made up out of whole cloth,"" said Nunes.

Shannon Bream then asked Nunes about a Politico report which suggested Steele's 16-hour grilling led to ""new and important information"" and could therefore ""dampen expectations among the president's allies who’ve claimed that Steele’s sensational dossier was used improperly by the bureau to 'spy' on the campaign.""

Nunes scoffed at that notion, saying either Steele had credible sources or he did not.

""The fact remains that they used that garbage that was paid for by a political campaign before a court,"" said Nunes, adding that there is information that is ""equally as bad or worse"" that has not been made public about Steele's work."
DHS Admits It Doesn't Have to Reject Donations to Migrants,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Sam Brodey', 'Congressional Reporter']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dhs-admits-it-doesnt-have-to-reject-donations-to-migrants,"Americans have responded to reports of abysmal conditions at federally-run government migrant detention centers—where many, including children, lack access to basic necessities—by sending them donations of supplies like soap, toothbrushes, diapers, and toys.

So far, those donations have been rejected by the Department of Homeland Security, leaving the public and lawmakers alike angry and scratching their heads as to why. But the agency, which runs many of these detention centers, is now acknowledging that there is little legal basis to justify turning down donations from the public to help improve conditions for migrants.

Former DHS officials have contended in the press that it would be against the law for the government to accept donations of supplies for migrants provided by private citizens due to an obscure law called the Antideficiency Act, which bars federal agencies from using anything that has not been paid for through funds appropriated by Congress.

Unless, of course, the agency is DHS, which could take advantage of a massive loophole provided for them to do just that in existing law.

An appropriations bill signed into law in 2004 authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to “accept, hold, administer, and utilize gifts and bequests… to facilitate the work of the Department of Homeland Security.” There is also an exception for emergencies involving “the safety of human life.”

In response to questions from The Daily Beast, a DHS spokesperson did not say whether or not the Antideficiency Act prohibits the agency from accepting donated supplies for the benefit of migrants currently held in detention.

“CBP must comply with Federal law and relevant DHS policy in order to receive and manage donations,” said the spokesperson, referencing U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that directly manages detention facilities. “At this time we are coordinating among relevant CBP offices, including our Office of Chief Counsel to determine how we can most efficiently accept and manage donations from the public, in compliance with law and policy.”

A House Democratic aide told The Daily Beast that DHS could easily apply this 2004 statute to the current situation, putting the agency on solid legal ground to accept the boxes of hygiene supplies and toys that charities and private citizens have been ferrying to overcrowded, needy facilities in places like Clint, Texas. “The bigger issue, they’ve told us, isn’t the legal issue here, it’s more the logistical issue,” the aide said.

A House Republican aide echoed concerns about logistics and the capacity of the agency, which just obtained an emergency infusion of $4.6 billion from Congress to handle the situation at the border.

“Processing donations takes manpower,” said the aide. “Employees have to inspect donations, launder clothes, etc., at a time when CBP is already stretched thin.” DHS would not comment on its communications with lawmakers.

To this point, lawmakers from both parties and both sides of the Capitol have pressed the department for an explanation of why donations from the public are going unused. “This is something we need to address in hours and days, not weeks and months,” read a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, sent on June 3 by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) and signed by 13 GOP lawmakers and three Democrats.

That group asked DHS to tell them how they could provide resources to help them better process donations. But a spokesperson for Crenshaw said on Monday that they had not yet received a response to their inquiries.

In another letter to McAleenan, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) also urged DHS to “establish and publicize a process for accepting donations from charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, and NGOs to aid individuals in CBP custody.”

In June, a DHS official told reporters that they might use donations — but argued they weren’t necessary. “We are looking at the possibility of using some of those donations going forward,” said the official, according to CNN. “But those items, it's important to note, are available now.""

“I think they don’t want to create the idea they’re not capable of taking care of this on their own,” said the House Democratic aide."
U.S. State Department approves possible $2.2 billion arms sale to Taiwan,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan/u-s-state-department-approves-possible-2-2-billion-arms-sale-to-taiwan-idUSKCN1U32HT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to Taiwan of M1A2T Abrams tanks, Stinger missiles and related equipment at an estimated value of $2.2 billion, the Pentagon said on Monday, despite Chinese criticism of the deal.

China’s foreign ministry expressed anger about the sale and urged the United States to revoke it. The timing is especially sensitive as the Washington and Beijing are seeking to resolve a bitter trade war.

The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement the sale of the weapons requested by Taiwan, including 108 General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, would not alter the basic military balance in the region.

DSCA notified Congress on Monday of the possible arms sale, which it said could also include mounted machine guns, ammunition, Hercules armored vehicles for recovering inoperative tanks, heavy equipment transporters and related support.

Reuters reported last month that an informal notification of the proposed sale had been sent to the U.S. Congress.

The United States has no formal ties with self-ruled and democratic Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself.

The United States is the main arms supplier to Taiwan, which China deems a wayward province. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.

Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said U.S. arms sales to Taiwan were a serious violation of international law and a “crude interference in China’s internal affairs, harming China’s sovereignty and security interests.”

“China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed to this and has already made stern representations to the US side,” Geng told a daily news briefing.

“Taiwan is an inseparable part of China’s territory and nobody should underestimate the Chinese government’s and people’s firm determination to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and oppose foreign interference.”

China urged the United States to immediately revoke the planned arms sale and end all contacts between the U.S. and Taiwan militaries to avoid further damage to Sino-U.S. ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, he added.

Taiwan’s Presidential Office expressed “sincere gratitude” to the U.S. government for the arms sale.

“Taiwan will speed up investment on defense and continue to deepen security ties with the United States and countries with similar ideas,” Chang Tun-han, a spokesman for Taiwan’s president, said in a statement.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in March that Washington was responding positively to Taipei’s requests for new arms sales to bolster its defenses in the face of pressure from China.

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry confirmed it had requested those weapons and that the request was proceeding normally.

The U.S. commitment to providing Taiwan with the weapons to defend itself helps Taipei’s military raise its combat abilities, consolidates the Taiwan-U.S. security partnership and ensures Taiwan’s security, the ministry said last month in a statement."
The UK ambassador who called Trump 'inept' was reportedly disinvited from a Treasury Department dinner. The White House will have plenty more opportunities to shun him.,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Alexandra Ma'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/uk-ambassador-kim-darroch-disinvited-mnuchin-dinner-report-2019-7,"The British ambassador who called Trump ""inept,"" ""insecure,"" and ""incompetent"" in a series of leaked diplomatic cables was reportedly disinvited from a Monday dinner.

It appears to be a swift enactment of Trump's intention to freeze out Sir Kim Darroch, the first of many opportunities to show official displeasure.

Sir Kim Darroch was notably absent from a dinner that US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin hosted for President Donald Trump and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, Bloomberg and CBS reporter Mark Knoller reported.

Both cited unnamed US officials who said his invitation had been rescinded. Darroch's invitation after Trump tweeted on Monday that "" we will no longer deal"" with the British ambassador, Bloomberg and Knoller said.

Trump's tweet did not make clear whether the administration would cut off all communication with Darroch. The White House has yet to respond to Business Insider's request for clarification.

Business Insider has contacted the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office for confirmation and comment.

Monday's dinner, which was held in the Treasury Department's historic Treasury Cash Room, was attended by US officials including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Transport Secretary Elaine Chao, White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow, and advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.

Robert Kraft, the New England Patriots owner facing charges of soliciting prostitution and paying for sex in Florida, was on Trump's table, photos of the event show.

Christine Lagarde, the IMF director nominated to lead the European Central Bank, was also pictured at the table.

""This is a who's who of people in business,"" Trump said of the attendees, according to White House pool reporters.

Freezing Darroch out of Washington?

Darroch's leaked memos have already irked the Trump administration, and his apparent disinvitation from Monday's dinner could be the start of the White House's campaign to shun him in Washington.

Trump on Tuesday further piled on Darroch, calling him in a series of tweets a ""a wacky Ambassador,"" ""not someone we are thrilled with,"" ""a very stupid guy,"" and ""a pompous fool.""

Prior to the leak the British ambassador had hosted many high-profile events, which were attended by White House officials including Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway, former Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Mnuchin, Politico reported.

Their past attendance seem to contradict Trump's claim on Monday that Darroch ""is not liked or well thought of within the US.""

However, now that the displeasure of the president has been noted publicly, Trump's inner circle may help make this a reality.

'There are no winners here'

Despite Trump's protestations, British Prime Minister Theresa May defended Darroch, saying that she has ""full faith"" in him even though she disagrees with his view of the president.

Leslie Vinjamuri, head of Chatham House's US and Americas program, told Business Insider: ""Britain will keep Sir Kim in Washington, and he will be marginalized on a daily basis.""

""There are no winners here. Not in America and not in London. The US and UK need each other,"" she added.

""Trump is now going to be doing a workaround. The question is whether he looks to others in the British government for an ally, or whether he simply looks beyond Britain.""

The New York Times cited unnamed British officials in the US as saying that the leak may have been engineered to ensure that Sir Mark Sedwill, the current head of the UK civil service and a longtime diplomat, was not appointed.

According to this theory, the leak may have been trying to encourage the UK to appoint a more pro-Trump, pro-Brexit diplomat to succeed Darroch, the Times reported.

This is not the first time the Trump administration has snubbed its allies in Washington.

Last year it quietly downgraded the EU's diplomatic status, for an unexplained reason, from being the equivalent of a full nation state to a lesser rank.

This manifested itself when the EU ambassador, David O'Sullivan, was called on last from a line of more than 150 diplomats to pay respects at former President George H.W. Bush's funeral last December.

The administration also left O'Sullivan out of diplomatic events for weeks. The higher rank was later restored."
