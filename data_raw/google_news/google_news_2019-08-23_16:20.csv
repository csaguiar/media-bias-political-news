Trump Orders American Companies to ‘Start Looking for an Alternative to China’,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Alan Rappeport', 'Keith Bradsher']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/business/china-tariffs-trump.html,"Mr. Trump’s anger was compounded by remarks from the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, who did not signal another imminent rate cut and said the central bank’s ability to counteract the president’s trade war was limited. Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Powell on Twitter, suggesting he was as much an enemy as Chinese President Xi Jinping.

“My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?,” the president tweeted.

“I think China’s trying to show that, cooperation or fight, it is ready to do both and it is not going to be pressured into an unfavorable trade deal,” said Andy Mok, a trade and geopolitics specialist at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.

Mr. Mok said that China’s willingness to impose a tariff on imports of crude oil from the United States, even though China needs a lot of imported oil, shows Beijing’s determination. “One way you show your seriousness in a negotiation is to show you’re willing to incur costs,” he said.

The State Council Tariff Commission in Beijing said that the tariffs were a response to Mr. Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs by Sept. 1. Mr. Trump had initially said he would impose 10 percent tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese-made goods on that date, essentially targeting everything that the United States buys from China that has not already been hit by previous rounds of tariffs. He later delayed more than half of the latest round of tariffs until Dec. 15 to avoid hitting American pocketbooks during the holiday shopping season. A few tariffs were scrapped entirely.

Peter Navarro, director of the White House’s Office of Trade and Manufacturing, said on the Fox Business Network that China’s move was to be expected and that it would only galvanize support for Mr. Trump’s tough approach to China in the United States.

“I just think that the way that China is reacting to this whole thing is simply reinforcing America’s perception of China as a bad actor,” Mr. Navarro said. “When China tries to bully us, that only strengthens our resolve.”"

Trump's 'chopper talk' news conferences blow away White House press corps: report,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Danielle Wallace', 'Weijia Jiang', 'Cbs News', 'Stephanie Grisham', 'White House Press Secretary']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-chopper-talks-reporters-criticize-accesible-accountable-marine-one-helicopter-press-secretary-grisham,"Some reporters are complaining that President Trump’s recent ""gaggles"" on the White House lawn -- as Marine One’s helicopter rotors blare in the background -- make it more difficult for them to hold the president accountable and paints them in an unprofessional light, according to a report.

“If he was at a podium, we would be pressing him after he answers the question, we would be correcting him, we would be pointing out discrepancies in previous answers, and we’re not able to do that in the chaotic setting of a departure,” CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang told Politico. “Many times I’ve tried to ask a follow-up question, but he’s already pointed to somebody else.

But others say the brief, near-daily news conferences, dubbed “chopper talks” by late-night host Stephen Colbert, make the president more accessible than his predecessors who delegated the role of talking to reporters to their White House press secretaries during far-less frequent on-camera West Wing briefings.

“President Trump communicates directly with the American people more than any president in history,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Politico, when asked about Trump’s interactions with the media. “The fact that the White House press corps can no longer grandstand on TV is of no concern to us.”

“President Trump communicates directly with the American people more than any president in history. The fact that the White House press corps can no longer grandstand on TV is of no concern to us.” — Stephanie Grisham, White House press secretary

Grisham said she does not “know what any of the press could complain about” given they have nearl-daily access to the president when he stops to take their questions on the White House lawn.

Trump's “chopper talks” can last as briefly as a few minutes to as long as about a half-hour. The president scans a crowd of reporters, calling on some while ignoring others, and shouts answers over the noise — the wind often whipping his tie over the shoulder — before he then walks off all while the cameras are rolling.

According to CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller, who keeps detailed records of the presidency, Trump has stopped to answer reporter questions -- both departing or arriving to the White House on Marine One and on the tarmac before or after riding Airforce One -- more than 80 times. He said he found only three instances when former President Barack Obama similarly spoke to reporters in transit and, during such times, he used a podium.

While several reporters interviewed by Politico said they appreciated the frequent access, they believed the set-up on the lawn purposefully depicts media as unruly, unkempt and professional. Jiang described how she often has to do “a lot of gymnastics” and duck under tripods and over equipment to get close enough. The noise of the chopper also makes their questions inaudible on broadcasts, reporters said.

“There’s no question that it works to his advantage that we look unruly and disorderly,” veteran New York Times White House reporter Peter Baker told Politico. “It’s not like standing at a podium in the East Room or the briefing room, where you can have a civilized calling on people who raise their hands.”

The Trump administration has not held a formal White House press briefing in more than five months, Politico reported. When Trump first took office, press secretary Sean Spicer held frequent briefings. The amount and lengths of briefings dwindled under Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Grisham has not hosted a briefing since taking the job in June.

Former President Obama held 24 solo news conferences during his first 30 months in office, compared to Trump’s eight during that time span, Knoller said. Obama’s administration held daily news briefings, while Trump takes to Twitter almost every day to communicate with the public."
Trump is doing what Obama couldn't,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis John Blake', 'Rutger Bregman', 'Historian', 'Kehinde Andrews', 'Kevin Kruse']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/23/us/trump-obama-change-blake/index.html,"(CNN) Some Democratic voters are looking for a candidate who can restore the optimism of the Obama era.

But what if the progressive champion they're looking for is already sitting in the White House?

Call it the audacity of President Trump: He is bringing more hope and change than Obama ever could.

I know, I know. For some people, this is blasphemy. Yet one of the biggest ironies of Trump's presidency is that he has become a more effective catalyst for progressive social change than Obama.

He has discredited core conservative beliefs, boosted the popularity of left-wing causes and caused millions of Americans to face ugly truths about racism and bigotry that they used to deny.

I never thought I'd say this. As an African-American man, I felt pride when Obama walked into the White House. I loved seeing how devoted he was to his family. I smiled when he broke into an Al Green song onstage. And I blinked away tears when I saw that Oval Office photograph of a five-year-old black boy reaching up to touch Obama's hair just to see if it really felt like his.

And yet I wonder today if I and others drew the wrong lesson from his election. Maybe the deep, systemic changes that so many yearn for couldn't come through his temperate, ""No Drama Obama"" approach. Maybe real change only comes through chaos and crisis -- Trump's leadership style.

President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office on November 10, 2016.

I thought of what Dutch historian Rutger Bregman said when explaining why being a moderate isn't good enough anymore when confronting issues like global warming and the highest level of income inequality since before the Great Depression. These types of challenges are only addressed by people who are first derided as ""radical"" or ""utopian,"" he said.

""We're now in a time in American history and in world history where we cannot simply afford to be moderate,"" said Bregman, whose call for the rich to stop dodging taxes at the World Economic Forum at Davos went viral.

""We can't afford to just be tinkering around the edges,"" he added. ""If history teaches us anything is that change never starts in the center. But it always starts on the fringes with people who are first dismissed as crazy and unreasonable and ridiculous.""

Change works in even more mysterious ways. Trump is, in some ways, unintentionally doing what Obama was supposed to do.

You can already see this in several areas.

Trump has banished the ghost of Ronald Reagan

When Obama first ran for the Oval Office in 2008, he was widely criticized for saying he wanted to be a transformational president like Ronald Reagan.

Reagan's governing philosophy -- slashing taxes for the wealthy, reducing government regulation, cutting social programs -- has been the dominant political ideology for the last 30 years. Reagan distilled it in one memorable phrase : ""Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.""

We're now in a time in American history and in world history where we cannot imply afford to be moderate. We can't afford to just be tinkering around the edges. Rutger Bregman, historian and author

Some hoped that Obama would be the liberal version of Reagan and restore faith in the federal government. He did marshal government resources to save the nation from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. He also sparked the longest economic expansion in US history.

Obama's cultural impact is also incalculable. A generation of American children grew up thinking there was nothing strange about seeing a man of color in the Oval Office.

Then Trump came along.

His lesson: Don't fear the Gipper

He did this first as a candidate when he repudiated some of the core beliefs of Reaganomics. He said he would never cut Social Security ""like every other Republican,"" and vowed to raise taxes on wealthy people, like hedge fund managers. And he won with overwhelming Republican support, including moderates.

President Trump has taken on the legacy of Ronald Reagan in a surprising way.

Trump's successful campaign showed that even conservative voters wanted to raise taxes on the wealthy and cherished their big government spending programs -- so long as it helped them and not racial minorities.

Then he did something else that Obama couldn't do: He made Obamacare popular.

During his first year in office, Trump led a yearlong quest to replace Obamacare. It failed because of an unexpected backlash . People started cherishing their big government health program once Trump threatened to take it away.

Now a new generation of Democratic leaders is walking a path that Trump, in an odd way, helped clear. They are talking about raising taxes on the wealthy, expanding government programs like Medicare and Medicaid and creating a ""Green New Deal.""

The public seems ready to follow. Public support for left-wing policy-making has reached a 60-year high.

""The very terrain of political and policy debate among Democrats in 2019 is a tacit admission that the Obama presidency was a wrong turn to a great degree,"" Ryan Cooper wrote in an essay for The Week titled, ""Democrats Need to Get Over Their Obama Nostalgia.""

The Democrats' new presidential model is not Reagan but their greatest President: Franklin D. Roosevelt. They are embracing what one historian called a ""Rooseveltian vision of activist government.

Meanwhile, Trump has emboldened progressives in an even more counterintuitive way.

He's triggered a 'Trumplash' against his own policies

A CNN commentator once coined a memorable phrase to describe why Trump was elected.

""This was a whitelash against a changing country,"" Van Jones said on election night in 2016. ""It was whitelash against a black president in part. And that's the part where the pain comes.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez embodies a new attitude among Democrats that Trump helped make possible.

Three years later the pain has led to something else: A ""Trumplash,"" a ferocious backlash against the President that's boosted progressives and weakened conservatives in several ways.

Trump has operated at times like an Oval Office double agent -- a conservative by virtue of his rhetoric, but one whose actions tend to hurt his cause.

He's pushed more progressives to get involved in politics.

His denigration of women inadvertently helped inspire a record number of women running for the House in the 2018 midterms. And his anti-Muslim rhetoric helped inspire a record number of Muslim Americans to run for office.

He's pushed voting blocs into the arms of Democrats.

Latinos vote in November 2016 at a polling station in the Boyle Heights section of Los Angeles, California.

He's even damaged some powerful conservative interest groups.

The National Rifle Association has actually grown weaker in part because of a ""Trump slump."" Gun sales have slowed dramatically because no one is worried about Obama taking their guns anymore, and Trump is seen as gun-friendly. And the religious right has l ost credibility because of white evangelical Christians' steadfast support for Trump.

Trump also helped do something else that Obama couldn't. He revived the Obama Coalition, the group of young voters, women and racial minorities that first put Obama in office.

That coalition sat out the 2010 and 2014 midterms, leading to huge losses for the Democrats. They showed up, however, to oppose Trump and Republicans during the 2018 midterms. That election featured the highest voter turnout in a centur y, with young people voting in record numbers.

in decades -- That progressive wave is expected to spill into the 2020 presidential election. Voter turnout in 2020 is expected to reach its highest levelin decades -- some say since 1908.

He's sparked a more enduring form of hope

Trump also has done something even stranger: He's arguably brought more hope than Obama did, and here's why.

The hope of the Obama era became centered on one charismatic figure. That doesn't last. The legacy of great presidents outlives them. Franklin Roosevelt forged a New Deal Coalition that lasted for at least 30 years after his death. The Reagan coalition also lasted long after his term ended.

Obama's coalition evaporated after he left office.

The hope sparked by the Trumplash though, isn't centered on a charismatic figure. The anti-Trump ""resistance"" is built on the backs of ordinary citizens who have mobilized. That is a more durable form of hope.

A new generation of nonwhite voters are turning away from Republicans because of President Trump's rhetoric.

It's not as if Obama didn't know about the limits of charismatic leadership. He was a former community organizer who said in his farewell address, ""Change only happens when ordinary people get involved... and come together to demand it.""

Yet somehow during his presidency he became this messianic figure who was going to lead a ""glorious dance into a shining new era.""

""Yes we can"" became ""He's got this.""

That's not how lasting change occurs, said Kevin Kruse, a historian at Princeton University.

""There was the old Green Lantern theory of the presidency that people had in the Obama years. We elected Obama and he's going to solve all our problems,"" Kruse told me. ""There's been an awareness that this kind of approach, putting all of that trust in a top figure, can be a huge problem when Obama gets replaced by Trump.

""But also, that's just not how change works. You got to provide the pressure and actually do some of the heavy lifting yourself.""

He's removed the veneer that hid America's racism

There was one problem, though, that even Obama wouldn't even dare try to solve.

Remember when people used the phrase, ""post-racial?"" It was the notion that the US had somehow left behind its racis t past because it had elected its first black president.

Then Trump came along.

President Obama felt he couldn't talk bluntly about race.

He called Mexican immigrants ""rapists,"" referred to African nations as ""sh*thole countries"" and said there ""were very fine people"" who marched with white supremacists at a 2017 protest in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Trump was also widely condemned last month after he dispatched a series of racist tweets telling four nonwhite Democratic congresswomen that they should ""go back"" to the ""crime infested places"" where they came from, even though three of the four were born in the US and the fourth is a naturalized citizen.

Few are saying the US is post-racial now.

Trump's inflammatory rhetoric has done what Obama couldn't do because of his skin color -- convince countless white Americans that racism is still pervasive in our country.

Here is a hard truth about Obama's presidency. The nation's first black president couldn't be too black. He couldn't talk too bluntly about racism, because some white Americans just couldn't handle it. Remember how Obama was widely criticized for simply showing compassion for Trayvon Martin after the unarmed black teenager was killed by a neighborhood watch captain?

It doesn't make any difference what color the president is. Malcolm X could have been elected president and racism would have continued just the same. Kehinde Andrews, historian and author

Trump, though, has performed a public service. He has removed what one scholar calls ""the heartbeat of racism"" -- white denial.

In the Trump era, we have to talk about racism.

Kehinde Andrews , a historian and author of ""Black-to-Black: Retelling Black Radicalism for the 21st Century,"" has said that Trump is a better president for black America than Obama because he shows how deeply embedded racism is in America's DNA.

Obama couldn't do that because people would point to his success as evidence that racism was no longer a problem.

White nationalists and neo-Nazis march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.

""It doesn't make any difference what color the president is,"" Andrews told me. ""Malcolm X could have been elected president and racism would have continued just the same.""

Trump's racial rhetoric has even inspired a conversion experience among some conservative white commentators like Joe Scarborough and Max Boot.

Boot wrote after Trump's racist tweets: ""It is as blatant example of racism and xenophobia as we have seen in our politics in my lifetime... I am ashamed to have spent most of my life as a Republican.""

That conversion has trickled down to many ordinary white Americans. According to one poll , racial prejudice has actually declined because Trump's racially inflammatory rhetoric has ""pushed the majority of white Americans in the opposite direction.""

Racist policies work better when they don't seem to be racist... once the veneer comes off, a lot of people in the middle will shy away. Trump has taken away the veneer. Kevin Kruse, historian

Fewer media organizations now are contorting language to avoid calling Trump's words racist. No more ""racially infused"" or ""racially charged"" phrases. They're calling it as they hear it -- it's just racist.

In this way Trump has taken away one of the most effective weapons used by racists -- plausible deniability, Kruse told me.

""Racist policies work better when they don't seem to be racist,"" Kruse said. ""If you could give voters in the middle some plausible deniability that this isn't about race -- 'I don't believe in segregation, I believe in neighborhood schools; it's not voter suppression, it's voter integrity' -- If you put a more positive spin on it, it invites more people in who don't see this policy as racist.

""Once the veneer comes off, a lot of people in the middle will shy away,"" he added. ""Trump has taken away the veneer.""

Staring into the abyss: America faces two possible futures

What many see beyond this veneer, though, is frightening. There's a growing sense that Americans are struck in a ""hideous loop of hate."" One commentator says the US is on the verge of a ""political civil war.""

Obama and Trump represent two visions of this country. One looks to the past; another forward. Yet this Brown New America is coming; whether we like it or not. By next year, the majority of all Americans under 18 will be non-white.

""The US faces two possible futures: a thriving nation that embraces its new demographic makeup, or an escalation of fighting, racism and xenophobia,"" one commentator said recently.

So which future will we choose? I really don't know. There's no law that says we deserve a happy ending. Democracies die all the time. Tragedy is part of history.

But so many people hoped that Obama's election would be different. People talked about it in religious terms, as if his ascension meant we were getting closer to the promised land.

Community members attend a vigil for a high school student gunned down in this month's El Paso shooting.

Maybe we expected too much.

It was hard enough for some white Americans to accept a black president. Accepting one who also pushed through dramatic, systemic political change may have been impossible.

The Trumplash, though, has forced us to face questions about ourselves that we can no longer avoid. Pundits say the nation's ""essence"" and ""soul"" are now at stake. One said the sight of Trump ""leading a white mob in a chant about sending a black congresswoman 'home' will be featured in history books for decades to come.""

But maybe it's such chilling scenes that will cause us to turn away from the abyss. We won't wait anymore for some messianic figure from the left or right to fix it for us.

That's the only hope and change I believe in now."

The failure to look at the evidence back in 2016 occurred even though the agents believed access to the sensitive evidence was “necessary” to complete the investigation into Clinton’s improper transmission of classified emails — some top-secret — on her unsecure private email server, the memos show.

To make matters worse, the Trump Department of Justice (DOJ) has known about that decision since at least 2018, thanks to the work of the DOJ’s internal watchdog, Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, who provided DOJ leaders and Congress with a classified appendix explaining what happened.

But Johnson and Grassley have been unable to get answers for a year, even from Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrThe road not taken: Another FBI failure involving the Clintons surfaces Correctional officers subpoenaed in Epstein investigation: report Nadler asks other House chairs to provide records that would help panel in making impeachment decision MORE, about whether the FBI intends to look at the critical evidence it skipped back in 2016.

The Senate staff memo succinctly lays out just how egregious the FBI’s decision was in 2016.

The inspector general’s “appendix raised a number of serious questions because, as explained on page 154 of the unclassified DOJ IG report, the FBI decided not to seek access to certain highly classified information potentially relevant to the investigation despite members of the FBI case team referring to the review as a ‘necessary’ part of the investigation,” the Senate staff wrote.

“As a result of the findings in that appendix, Senator Grassley wrote a classified letter to DOJ on October 17, 2018, which remains unanswered. On January 15, 2019, at Mr. Barr’s nomination hearing, Senator Grassley asked Mr. Barr if he would answer the letter, if confirmed, to which he attested, ‘Yes, Senator.’ On April 16, 2019, Senators Grassley, Johnson, and Graham sent a letter to Attorney General Barr reiterating the need for a written response to that letter.""

The DOJ’s silence on the road that the FBI willfully chose not to take is all the more deafening given what we already know about the Clinton email case.

As I previously wrote, then-FBI Director Comey’s original draft findings in the Clinton case concluded her transmission of classified emails through an unsecure server was “grossly negligent,” the legal standard supporting a felony charge under the Espionage Act.

But the findings were edited and the term changed to “extremely careless,” and Comey chose on his own to announce on July 5, 2016, that he would not seek criminal charges, a decision that the DOJ's IG concluded had wrongly usurped prosecutors’ authority to make charging decisions.

In addition, as I have written, FBI general counsel James Baker believed — almost until the last minute before Comey’s announcement — that Clinton should, in fact, face criminal prosecution, but he was talked out of it.

ADVERTISEMENT

And in a passage that often gets overlooked by reporters and pundits alike, IG Horowitz concluded in his final report about the Clinton email caper that the anti-Trump biases that FBI agent Strzok and bureau lawyer Lisa Page expressed in text messages may have affected their decisionmaking to focus more urgently on the now disproven Trump-Russia collusion allegations rather than to finish work on the former secretary of State’s email problems, an investigation code-named Midyear.

“In assessing the decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead ... we were particularly concerned about text messages sent by Strzok and Page that potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions they made were impacted by bias or improper considerations,” the Justice Department's watchdog wrote.

So the FBI’s chief lawyer originally thought Clinton should be indicted, and the bureau wrote a draft supporting the felony standard, but then walked back its decision. And agents focused more on unsubstantiated Trump collusion than Clinton emails in what the IG feared might be a sign of bias.

And now we learn the FBI willfully chose to ignore highly classified evidence in the Clinton email case and has stonewalled Congress for a year on whether it intends to reexamine that evidence.

It’s exactly that sort of behavior that leaves many Americans wondering whether there are two systems of justice inside the FBI — one for the Clintons, and one for the rest of the country."

Emails from senior Veterans Affairs staff released Thursday reveal the frustration and scorn they felt at having to deal with the intrusion of three wealthy members of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in the agency’s plans to create a new digital health platform.

The 2017 and 2018 emails, which Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, show the outsized influence of the Mar-a-Lago members, Marvel Entertainment Chairman Ike Perlmutter, attorney Marc Sherman and internist Bruce Moskowitz.

Story Continued Below

The emails reveal how senior staff responded to what they saw as unhelpful meddling in their work. Essentially, they humored the three Trump friends while ignoring their advice, which they considered misinformed and potentially disruptive to veteran health care.

In one email, project head John Windom describes a meeting with the three as a “grin and bear it session.” Another calls them ""clearly out of their depth"" in demanding changes in the department's 2018 EHR contract with Cerner that the officials felt were unreasonable.

“Mr. Sherman does not understand the culture of VA or the federal government,” Windom said in another email with a colleague. “He appears to be a ‘big bang’ theory guy. The problem is, we must continue to deliver uninterrupted and quality care to our Veterans during the transformation within the parameters of the law and other regulations/policies.”

But a senior VA official involved in the EHR project, former Trump campaign official Camilo Sandoval, kept a list of the requests made by the three Mar-a-Lago members on a posterboard that he checked off from time to time, according to an official who worked directly with him.

The influence of the three Mar-a-Lago members was revealed by POLITICO in 2018, with additional details surfacing in FOIA documents requested by ProPublica. Congress is still investigating the group's interactions with department.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said last year that he had not spoken with any of the three since taking office. The VA on Thursday did not respond to an email inquiring into whether they are still involved in agency policymaking.

Two legal advocacy groups on Wednesday sued Wilkie for allegedly failing to preserve emails that they allege his predecessor, David Shulkin, sent from a personal account to conduct business with the Mar-a-Lago figures — activity that the suit claims was illegal.

“Despite misgivings, career VA employees were obligated to waste taxpayer time and resources to respond to the trio of Mar-a-Lago members, purely because of their connections to Trump,” the ethics group CREW said in a news release with the documents.

In one email released by CREW, a top VA official forwarded questions to another staffer that he said came from ""a POTUS friend/doctor.""

""We need to handle sensitively and with facts,"" acting Chief Information Officer Scott Blackburn said in the email. Ashwini Zenooz, a senior medical staffer on the project, responded that the requests are “just ridiculous. They don’t make sense and there is a basic lack of understanding… I’m just baffled.”

In another email, a staffer refers to Moskowitz as “the Dr from W Palm that is connected to Trump. ... He is outdated in his understanding of system but we need to be responsive here.”"

But on Monday, tucked between stories from The Washington Post and a public radio station, the briefing included a summary of and a link to a blog post from what the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated a “Hate Group”: Vdare.com, a frequent platform for white nationalists espousing anti-Semitic and anti-immigration rhetoric.

The Vdare post singles out immigration judges by name, uses their photos and refers to them with an anti-Semitic slur. The Justice Department sends the briefings to all EOIR employees, including its 400-some immigration judges, which means the judges named and pictured in the derogatory post also received the link to it this week — from their employer.

The briefing was circulated the same week as President Trump faced accusations of anti-Semitism for asserting that Jewish people who vote for Democrats show “great disloyalty” and for praising Henry Ford, a virulent anti-Semite. It also comes as the Justice Department moves to possibly decertify the union that represents federal immigration judges, which could silence a group critical of some of the administration’s immigration policies.

The union, the National Association of Immigration Judges, lambasted the briefing in a letter to EOIR Director James McHenry. Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the group’s president and one of the judges highlighted in the post, wrote that the union had received numerous complaints from judges across the country.

“The post features links and content that directly attacks sitting Immigration Judges with racial and ethnically tinged slurs and the label ‘Kritarch,’ ” Tabaddor said in the letter, which The Post obtained.

When used with a negative tone, the reference to kritarchy, a biblical term for a system of rule by judges in ancient Israel, is “deeply offensive and Anti-Semitic,” she wrote. “VDare’s use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control.”

An EOIR spokeswoman said the blog post, which BuzzFeed News first reported on, “should not have been included.”

“The Department of Justice condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest terms,” the office’s assistant press secretary Kathryn Mattingly told The Post.

She said the briefings are compiled by a contractor, but she did not respond to a question about whether the person responsible would be reprimanded.

Tabaddor asked EOIR to “issue an apology to all EOIR employees, particularly the impacted Immigration Judges.” As of Thursday evening, Tabaddor had not received a formal apology, she told The Post.

The union also called for “immediate steps to ensure that such posts or content is not enshrined as a legitimate news source in future EOIR publications.”

Monday was far from the first time the office’s daily briefing has included questionable content, said immigration attorney Matthew Hoppock, who writes about the EOIR and has researched the office’s morning newsletter.

In April, Hoppock published every EOIR briefing since September 2018, which he received after submitting Freedom of Information Act requests. He said he was appalled at how many stories from right-wing websites the Daily Caller and Breitbart News were included.

“The substance is really gross,” Hoppock said in an interview. “Sometimes they link to The Washington Post or BuzzFeed, but a lot of times it’s just nonsense. It feels like propaganda. It feels like they’re being given an agenda, when they’re supposed to be neutral.”

Another item that stood out to him was a link to a Fox News interview with Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state who led Trump’s short-lived election integrity commission. The piece was titled, “Migrants have no basis to claim asylum.”

“Why would you send that to immigration judges whose job it is to adjudicate asylum claims?” Hoppock said.

Hoppock criticized the department for spending money on the briefings, which are compiled by the contractor TechMIS. Steven Mains, the firm’s chief executive, said the newsletters are compiled based on a set of keywords.

“We make no editorial judgments based on viewpoints, but present the customer with all the news that fits their criteria,” Mains said.

He said the Justice Department has asked the company to omit Vdare content from all future briefings. Hoppock said any claims that the inclusion of far-right material was an innocent mistake are dubious.

“It’s not like they weren’t aware,” Hoppock said, citing a July report, published by the Young Turks, about the office’s distribution of Breitbart articles. “If it is a random Google scrape and they’re picking up white supremacist stuff, they should’ve stopped by now.”

In her letter, Tabaddor said that the union supports the First Amendment and the right to free expression but that “the Department of Justice’s use of its authority to legitimize and provide an imprimatur of respectability to this website under the guise of ‘news’ runs counter to American ideals of equality under the law.”

State Department facilitated Rudy Giuliani's secret meeting with Ukrainians about Joe Biden,https://www.salon.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.salon.com/2019/08/22/state-department-facilitated-rudy-giulianis-secret-meeting-with-ukrainians-about-joe-biden/,"Your message has been sent successfully

The State Department assisted President Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in setting up a meeting with a Ukrainian official to “strongly urge” the new administration in Ukraine to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden.

Giuliani backed out of a planned trip to Kiev earlier this year that was meant to dig up dirt on Biden. But the New York Times now reports the former New York mayor instead traveled to Madrid to meet with a top aide to new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, with help from the State Department.

Giuliani told the Times that he “strongly urged” the Ukrainian official, presidential aide Andriy Yermak, to investigate whether there was any impropriety in Biden’s diplomatic efforts in Ukraine while his son worked for a gas company in the country.

Giuliani said he urged Yermak to “just investigate the darn things” and came away “pretty confident they’re going to investigate it.”

Giuliani claimed to the Times that he traveled for the meeting as a “private citizen,” but acknowledged that his travel was arranged with the help of the State Department.

The meeting was arranged with the help of Kurt Volker, a special envoy to Ukraine. Giuliani said he “briefed State Department officials on the back-channel communications” after returning from the trip. He would not say whether Trump was aware of the outreach.

The move concerned Ukrainian officials, who accused Giuliani of complicating their efforts to set up a meeting between Zelensky and Trump at the White House. Ukrainian officials are worried, according to the Times, that Giuliani’s outreach has created a perception that the meeting would be contingent on the Ukrainian government doing his bidding.

Giuliani “did not totally reject the suggestion that he was complicating relations between the two governments,” the Times reported.

A Ukrainian news outlet warned that Zelensky, who was elected in April, risks serious blowback if he works with Trump.

“If Ukraine supports the current president [i.e., Trump] and sells out Biden, it would become a cause of deep and irreversible processes which later will circle back on Ukraine in a very unpleasant manner,” the site said.

Giuliani was heavily criticized after the Times reported in May that he had actively worked to urge prosecutors appointed by Zelensky’s predecessor to investigate a gas company for which Hunter Biden had worked.

Later that month, the Washington Post reported that Giuliani had met with a former Ukrainian diplomat who had ""made unproven claims that the Democratic National Committee worked with the Kiev government in 2016 to dig up incriminating information.""

After Giuliani’s early efforts were reported, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., warned Ukrainian officials not to work with Giuliani.

The lawmakers warned that any coordination between the Ukrainian government and Trump’s personal attorney “risk severely jeopardizing support for Ukraine in Congress.”

Yermak told the Times that he did not interpret Hoyer’s message as a warning to avoid investigating Biden.

Giuliani denied that he did anything wrong by pressuring the Ukrainians to go after Trump’s enemies.

""I wouldn't do an unethical thing in my life, I'm a really good lawyer,"" he told CNN. ""I'm proud of what I did.""

But former federal prosecutor Mimi Rocah suggested Giuliani may have gone too far this time.

"New VA drug aims to 'make a dent' in vet suicide crisis, Secretary Wilkie says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Melissa Leon'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/va-drug-veteran-suicide-robert-wilkie,"Twenty-two American veterans are said to die by suicide every day, and the Department of Veterans Affairs is taking a step to fight that sobering statistic at the request of President Trump.

The president on Wednesday said he instructed the VA to place a substantial order of Spravato, which is used to help treat depression in patients who might not have seen results from other treatments or drugs, although some medical experts have said the drug's effectiveness is not entirely clear.

Spravato would be part of a new combination of drugs administered in spray form, VA Secretary Robert Wilkie told Fox News on Thursday morning, noting that the VA has prescribed Spravato for years “but in intravenous form and under the supervision of anesthesiologists.”

“What we’re doing now is transitioning to the nasal spray,” Wilkie said on “America’s Newsroom.” “It’s still under the supervision of anesthesiologists at [the] VA, but FDA has approved the combination of several drugs and Spravato [as] a means to combat depression.”

VETERAN WALKS FROM WASHINGTON STATE TO DISNEY WORLD TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR SUICIDE AMONG SERVICE MEMBERS

“We are doing everything we can to address the issues involving depression and mental health. I’ve said many times that we’ve not even had that national conversation about mental health that we desperately need,” Wilkie stressed, pointing also to addiction and homelessness.

“It’s in its opening stages when it comes to that combination of drugs the FDA has approved for us, to see if we can make a dent in depression,” Wilkie told Fox News’ Jon Scott and Sandra Smith.

On Wednesday, before departing for the American Veterans (AMVETS) national convention in Kentucky, President Trump told reporters he had instructed the VA to buy “a lot” of Spravato.

“There’s a product that’s made right now that just came out by Johnson & Johnson which has a tremendously positive, pretty short-term, but nevertheless a positive effect,” Trump said, McClatchy reported. “I’ve instructed the head of the VA to go out and buy a lot of it, and we are buying a lot of it.”

At the AMVETS convention, Trump said there’s been no issue more urgent than the veteran suicide crisis.

“My administration is determined to do everything in our power to save the lives of our heroes,” Trump said.

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER CANCELLING STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR DISABLED VETERANS

The president said earlier at the White House that he hopes the VA is “getting [the medication] at a very good cost” from Johnson & Johnson.

One dose of Spravato is $295, according to McClatchy; a patient’s total daily cost could be more than $700 if they need two and a half sprays, which is common. Since the Food and Drug Administration has approved the treatment for the VA, Medicare and Medicaid would cover 65 percent of each dose, McClatchy noted.

Wilkie told Fox News on Thursday that a veteran can be given the Spravato nasal spray if his or her doctor and team approve its use.

Senior DHS official exits amid department leadership changes,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/dhs-andrew-meehan-leaving/index.html,"(CNN) A senior official in the Department of Homeland Security will leave the agency next month, marking the latest top DHS official to leave the administration in recent months.

Acting DHS public affairs Assistant Secretary Andrew Meehan decided to resign two weeks ago and his last day will be Sept. 20, according to a DHS official. Meehan has been a close confidant of acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, joining him at DHS headquarters to run the public affairs office.

Meehan, who also oversaw public affairs at Customs and Border Protection, is the latest public affairs official expected to leave the department. Earlier this week, Customs and Border Protection press secretary Katharine Gorka told CNN she was leaving her post at the end of the week. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Assistant Director of Public Affairs Carol Danko recently left the agency amid pressure from DHS, according to a source familiar with the decision.

Meehan's departure comes amid speculation that McAleenan won't last in the secretary role. Earlier this summer, McAleenan went to the White House prepared to resign, CNN reported. He was concerned about an immigration enforcement operation and felt he was being undermined by subordinate immigration hardliners who had a direct line to the President.

Meehan is in Panama this week with McAleenan for a ministerial meeting focused on enhancing regional cooperation and combating irregular migration. This, after a tense week between the White House and DHS over the rollout of a new rule on migrant children in government custody , according to a source familiar with the matter. The source said the White House had asked McAleenan to delay his departure for Panama to hold a news conference about the rule.

Meehan's resignation was not connected to the rollout, according to a source.

A separate source familiar with the situation told CNN that ""micromanagement by White House officials have made it close to impossible for the department to carry out its mission.""

Senior policy adviser Stephen ""Miller and others will bypass leadership and communicate directly with lower level staff whom they view as controllable and direct actions. No organization can operate that way and we should expect more senior officials to leave,"" the source said.

CORRECTION: This story has been updated to add ""acting"" to Meehan's job title as DHS public affairs assistant secretary."
Justice Department inspector general reportedly completes FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-inspector-general-reportedly-completes-fisa-abuse-investigation,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has reportedly completed his investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses by the Justice Department and FBI.

The Hill's John Solomon made the announcement Thursday evening on Fox News.

""What I can report tonight, Sean, is that the IG has completed his work on the FISA abuse report. It's expected to be transmitted as early as next week to Attorney General William Barr and that will begin a process of declassification,"" the investigative reporter told host Sean Hannity.

""I think we are still on track for that timeline, I've been saying on your show: mid-September to early October seems the most likely release point,"" Solomon said. ""It's going to be a tough report,"" he added.

The timeline for Horowitz's investigation, which began in March 2018, has repeatedly shifted over the past few months because of various developments.

Horowitz's team is examining the FISA application and three renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The applications relied heavily on the unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by Democrats.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors, which included Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications, and they have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Meanwhile, Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review of the origins of the Russia investigation, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside the government.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work. Over the past few days, the South Carolina Republican has said he expects Horowitz's findings to be ""damning and ugly"" for the DOJ. Graham also said he plans to meet with Barr this week to ""talk to him about how best to tell the story"" and predicted that after his report is released Horowitz will deliver ""chilling testimony"" in front of his panel."
Congress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458352-congress-pumps-brakes-on-interior-push-to-move-bureau-of-land,"The Interior Department says it is moving ahead with plans to relocate a Washington-based agency to Colorado after getting the green light from Congress, but lawmakers say no such approval has been granted.

The Department of the Interior is preparing to move 27 top officials at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo., while scattering other D.C.-based employees to existing offices out West.

The House Appropriations Committee was given 30 days to submit questions to Interior about the move and the reallocation of $5 million to cover related costs.

Lawmakers had a number of questions: What are the benefits to Interior and the American public? What problem will this solve? Why was BLM singled out for this move?

The 30-day period ended on Aug. 15, and Interior says it will now proceed with plans to move about 300 employees to Western states after answering all questions from lawmakers.

But some lawmakers beg to differ.

“The administration’s characterization of Congress having ‘blessed’ BLM’s relocation plan is false,” Amanda Yanchury, spokeswoman for Rep. Betty McCollum Betty Louise McCollumCongress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management Here are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment Clean water or mining pollution for the nation's favorite wilderness? MORE (D-Minn.), chairwoman of the House Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Interior Department, said in a statement to The Hill.

“Interior’s initial relocation plan was significantly lacking in the details necessary for the Committee to evaluate this proposal. That’s why Congress, in a bipartisan and bicameral manner, requested more information — to ensure the transparency and accountability of the administration’s actions,” she added.

BLM argues the move will position its staff closer to the lands the agency manages, but critics contend it will simply move high-level career staff out of D.C. and further away from the corridors of power, following a similar decision to relocate Department of Agriculture (USDA) research staff to a new outpost in the Kansas City area.

“As we’ve seen with affected USDA researchers, uprooting employees is this administration’s strategy for eliminating branches of government since it creates hardship and people are forced to quit,” she added. “It’s outrageous that this administration has now targeted BLM employees because the Interior Secretary— a former coal and mining lobbyist—doesn’t believe in the agency’s mission of preserving public lands.”

BLM retirees penned a letter to lawmakers on Tuesday arguing the move would “functionally dismantle” the agency. They also asked the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold a hearing on the move.

About 4 percent of BLM’s 10,000 employees are based in Washington. Nearly all of them would be transferred elsewhere under Interior’s plan, leaving just 61 workers in Washington, according to a memo to Congress from Interior.

""Now that the Department of the Interior has met its commitment to provide Congress with an opportunity to review its reorganization plan for the Bureau of Land Management, we look forward to moving ahead with a thoughtfully considered and carefully developed plan that will place the BLM's leadership closer to the lands and resources they manage,” an Interior spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

""We have answered every single question asked by the Committee. No additional follow up questions were received,"" the agency said.

But details beyond what is covered by Interior’s July 16 memo have been sparse.

Lawmakers say their questions range from basic logistics like finding office space and the overall timeline to bigger picture questions like whether it is even legal to move the agency’s headquarters without congressional approval.

Those concerns were expressed in a “four corners letter” signed by majority and minority appropriations leaders in both chambers.

“It’s absurd for the administration to assume Congressional approval when the Committee has not yet received sufficient answers to outstanding questions about the plan’s feasibility, costs, legality, and personnel issues. This is clearly an attempt by the Trump administration to steamroll ahead with this plan without regard to the concerns of a co-equal branch of government,” said Yanchury, McCollum's spokeswoman.

House Appropriations Committee staffers say talks with BLM about the request are ongoing and that the congressional panels were under no obligation to meet a 30-day timeline for approving BLM’s financial plans related to the relocation effort.

Interior has brushed aside legal concerns surrounding the move and has not answered several questions about when employees will have to decide whether they will accept the reassignment and when the new headquarters in Grand Junction will be open.

William Pendley, the top official at BLM, told staff in an email obtained by The Hill that they can expect more details soon.

“During the last 30 days, we have continued to develop an implementation plan for the move while ensuring the continuity of operations across the Bureau of Land Management. This email is to let you know that more information will be forthcoming shortly,” Pendley wrote on Aug. 16. “We look forward to working with you to make the process as smooth and transparent for everyone as possible.”

Democrats also have questions over whether the move is legal.

McCollum’s office pointed to a section of federal law that says “all offices attached to the seat of government shall be exercised in the District of Columbia, and not elsewhere, except as otherwise provided by law.”

In a response to McCollum shared with The Hill, Interior noted that agencies like the Food and Drug Administration are headquartered outside D.C., in the nearby suburbs.

Interior said an office attached to the seat of government should be interpreted as “an executive department, a term defined elsewhere in the U.S. Code to include the Department of the Interior, but not its component parts.”

“The provision referenced by your staff is not a bar to making this change, which will promote greater efficiency and use of taxpayer resources,” Cole Rojewski, director of Interior’s Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs, wrote to McCollum, adding that having every federal government office located in D.C. would be “impractical and unreasonable.”

Disagreement over the move is expected to spill into September as lawmakers work on appropriations for fiscal 2020, which begins on Oct 1. The House Natural Resources Committee will also hold a hearing in September to discuss the planning process behind BLM’s move.

Trump ends family separation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/trump-ends-family-separation,"Last summer, the country realized in horror that border authorities had been separating immigrant children from their parents, leaving the kids in inadequate and often dangerous federal housing facilities.

It was a true humanitarian crisis. While most of the press joined with Democrats in pinning the blame on Trump, the blame in fact rested on federal policy that had long predated Trump — namely, the Flores Settlement Agreement.

The Flores agreement, which essentially mandated family separation, will soon be history, thanks to Trump administration actions announced Wednesday. This change, if liberals don't successfully block them in court, will allow the federal government to keep families together in residential facilities when they arrive at the border seeking asylum.

It's hard to keep track amid the emotions and politics over ""kids in cages,"" so let's recount the factors that have created the crisis.

Thousands of families have arrived at our southern border in the past couple of years seeking asylum, knowing that the very act of asylum-seeking, regardless of merit, entitles them to stay in the United States. Each of these undocumented migrants is thus owed a court date in which they can make the case that they deserve admission as asylees rather than going through the ordinary immigration process.

The Flores agreement, created by federal courts in 1997, prohibits Customs and Border Protection from holding children in detention for more than 20 days. But with our current flood of asylum-seekers, the backlog in immigration courts is much longer than 20 days. That leaves us with two options: Either remove the children from CBP facilities while we hold the parents there (family separation) or just let the entire family go and hope they show up for the hearing months down the line (catch and release).

The scrapping of Flores creates a third option: keep families together until they get their day in court.

While the details still await release in full, the new regulation appears to be both a humanitarian and a strategic improvement on its face.

Sadly, and cynically, this is being portrayed as an effort by Trump to detain migrants indefinitely. We doubt the Trump administration has any interest in indefinitely keeping people in overcrowded facilities that we can't adequately equip or police. Yet, this is the theory among his critics. As MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff put it on Twitter, ""Detaining families indefinitely is always what Trump has wanted to do.""



Detaining families *indefinitely* is always what Trump has wanted to do.



A DHS official told me during separations it was the whole goal of ripping kids from parents — to force Congress to change the law to allow indefinite detention.



Now they’re trying to do it themselves. https://t.co/kjzE27ejGx — Jacob Soboroff (@jacobsoboroff) August 21, 2019



A more sober analysis would reveal that the administration's action is by far the best of three options. The first, under Flores, would require separating families while they await backlogged asylum proceedings. The second is what the Department of Homeland Security announced today, keeping families together while under supervision. The third option is a policy of open borders: simply not enforcing the border at all. We suspect this won't fly either, because even the politicians who support it are embarrassed by it and refuse to admit it in public.

The details will be crucial: For starters, the new rule should guarantee far better conditions for family housing units than anything that is being provided today. But the general thrust of administration action deserves to be lauded by border hawks and immigration advocates alike.

Congress needs to act to better fund our border facilities, to increase the capacity of our immigration courts, and to get rid of the incentives for families with weak asylum claims to appear at our border.

The Trump administration is righting an egregious wrong. Regardless of political preference and irrespective of all political theater, that's a good thing."
"Tour Results Show Best-Case Scenario For Corn, Worst-Case For Soybeans",https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/tour-results-show-best-case-scenario-corn-worst-case-soybeans,"Each night of the Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour, scout sample data is compiled and released. While the data is an extremely accurate representation of what scouts saw in the field for that day, it will not be exactly the same as the official Pro Farmer yield estimates released on Friday.

According to AgriTalk host and Crop Tour veteran, Chip Flory, in a year like 2019, the tour data measures the best-case scenario for corn and the worst-case scenario for soybeans.

“When we're out on tour, and we're looking at a mature corn crop, we are measuring actual yield,” he explained on AgriTalk Thursday. “When we're looking a crop that is as immature and as far behind and still has as much work to do as this one has to do. We are measuring that, yield potential.”

If samples are pulled from two fields, with one planted at the end of April and one planted in June, the later would be just past blister stage and the earlier would be entering the dent stage.

“When we measure that grain length, when we count the kernel rows and the populations, we're not accounting for any of the difference in the maturity in those basic raw numbers,” he said. “We need to understand that, and likely make some adjustments [in the official Pro Farmer estimate] to what the what this crop is going to be able to do going forward.”

Without a crystal ball to know exactly what the weather will do over the next five weeks, Flory said we must assume a normal finish to the crop.

“In some cases, that means we're going to take the top end off both the corn and potentially some of the soybeans out there,” he said adding a normal first frost date in Minnesota, South Dakota, northwest Iowa, northeast Nebraska, Ohio, Indiana and eastern Illinois could change the yield picture.

Worst-case for soybeans

While tour data shows the best-case scenario on corn, in soybeans the data shows the worst-case scenario because the tour looks at the number of pods in a 3x3 square, according to Flory.

“We're looking at how much of the bean production factory is up and running,” he says. “When we get these low pod counts on a slow-to-develop, late-planted bean crop, you've got to understand that this bean crop, if you give it the right conditions, can do more than what the pod counts are indicating.”

All of these factors including, maturity and other observations, made by scouts throughout the week are included in Pro Farmer’s official yield estimates.

“We need to keep that in mind, so I think we're measuring a worst-case scenario with pod counts, best case scenario with the yields,” he says. “There's lots of observations that go into the Pro Farmer crop estimate that are not in the very sterile numbers that we put out from crop tour.”

Trump Finds Unlikely Ally in Greenland Aspirations: Iran,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2019-08-22/trump-finds-unlikely-ally-in-greenland-aspirations-iran,"President Donald Trump faced almost universal opposition this week to his idea of purchasing Greenland from Denmark, though an unlikely ally emerged Thursday acknowledging the move would align with the commander in chief's perceived doctrine.

Iranian state news service Fars published an analysis Thursday afternoon detailing news this week that the president wishes to purchase the island governed by Denmark that straddles the Arctic Circle and where the U.S. maintains a key military base. It described Trump as ""unconventional and seemingly obsessed with reasserting U.S. hegemony"" but acknowledged the Arctic as a geopolitically critical region, currently contested by other powers like Russia and China.

""This scenario makes the island of Greenland, freezing and home to only 50,000 inhabitants, an extremely strategic location,"" Fars noted. ""Thus the idea that Trump aspires to acquire the island for the United States and militarize it accordingly is by no means unreasonable in his strategic calculus, even if the idea is a non-starter.""

Trump announced by Twitter earlier this week he was canceling a planned trip to Denmark in early September, later explaining he took issue with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's dismissal of his apparent bid. Trump on Wednesday called Fredericksen "" nasty "" for her comments. He also lamented via Twitter that Denmark does not spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense – a goal NATO countries in 2014 agreed they would each achieve by 2024.

Photos: Vanishing Greenland View All 12 Images

In its analysis, Fars noted of Greenland, ""Denmark on its own does not have the resources or capabilities to make it useful on behalf of NATO, which is why Trump likely hit out at them over military spending.""

Remaining on message with the regime's central talking points, it concluded that Iran should take seriously the White House's pursuit of Greenland as a part of what it considers U.S. efforts to ""to maintain worldwide military supremacy.""

""American history is defined almost solely by territorial expansion for strategic ends. It may have fallen dormant, but Trump has very much rekindled an old flame for strategic ends.

Though Powell didn't repeat his now-infamous July 31 comments that the Fed's recent rate cut was merely a ""mid-cycle adjustment,"" he did not promise additional easing as some investors had hoped.

Regarding the Fed's dual mandate of full employment and price stability, Powell said the ""economy is close to both goals. ""Our challenge now is to do what monetary policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market extend to more of those still left behind, and so that inflation is centered firmly around 2 percent.""

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was around 1.584%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was around 2.085%. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note was around 1.57%.

Fed funds futures indicated that traders were pricing in a 100% chance of a cut at the Fed's September meeting, with a minority expecting the Fed to cut by 50 basis points."
Trump says his mileage rules make cars safer. His EPA was worried they will kill more people.,https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/2019/8/21/20826601/trump-auto-company-fuel-economy-california,"President Trump on Wednesday tweeted a defense of his administration’s weakening of fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, citing safety benefits. It’s a change that automakers have already said they don’t want. And according to internal emails from the Environmental Protection Agency released in 2018, the rule change would increase highway fatalities.

In fact, four car companies — Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, and Honda — signed a surprise deal with the state of California earlier this summer to set stricter mileage rules for themselves than what the Trump administration proposed.

My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019

According to the New York Times, this sudden side deal with California so infuriated the White House that a senior official summoned leaders from Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, and General Motors in July to pressure them to support the administration’s policy.

But once the deal was announced, several other car companies said they were open to signing on as well. Mercedes-Benz is now preparing to join the California accord, the New York Times reported.

The California agreement would put car companies on course to average 51 miles per gallon across all their sales by 2026. This is weaker than the standard set under President Obama, but much stronger than Trump’s proposal.

The Obama rules restricted tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide from light-duty vehicles but gave companies several ways to comply. Meeting that target just by increasing fuel economy would have required car companies to average 54.5 miles per gallon across sales of cars, trucks, SUVs, and crossovers by 2025.

Some car companies thought this target was too aggressive, so when Trump came to office, these manufacturers petitioned to have the standard revised. But carmakers got way more than they bargained for: The Trump administration decided to freeze mileage standards after 2020, which would hold average fuel economy at just 37 miles per gallon.

The state of California, which has a waiver from federal rules to set its own emissions standards, said it wanted to uphold the Obama benchmark. In response, the EPA threatened to revoke California’s waiver.

That put California and the federal government on a collision course, with car manufacturers in the middle. California is the largest market for new cars in the United States, so it’s impossible for carmakers to ignore. Another 13 states and the District of Columbia have also adopted California’s vehicle emissions standards.

So auto companies were faced with the prospect of having two very different standards to meet across the country, or having to wait for the dust to settle from what was sure to be a long, messy legal fight.

To justify the rollback, the Trump administration has cited safety as its main concern. The reasoning is that new cars are safer than old cars, but forcing carmakers to meet tougher efficiency rules makes new cars more expensive. That means people end up driving their older, less safe cars for longer, according to the EPA’s published analysis.

The EPA publicly said the Trump rule change would save 1,000 lives per year, but an internal email from staffers obtained by the Associated Press showed that they expected the revision to actually increase highway deaths by 17 per year, undermining the EPA’s bizarre rationale.

Increasing fuel economy is an important tool for limiting air pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The transportation sector is now the largest source of carbon dioxide in the United States. Cars and trucks account for about 20 percent of all US carbon emissions.

So why is the Trump administration so insistent on relaxing a regulation beyond what the auto industry wants? Because oil producers want cars and trucks to use more fuel. As the New York Times reported in December, oil companies see higher fuel efficiency standards as a threat:

The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world’s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales. In recent months, Marathon Petroleum also teamed up with the American Legislative Exchange Council, a secretive policy group financed by corporations as well as the Koch network, to draft legislation for states supporting the industry’s position. Its proposed resolution, dated Sept. 18, describes current fuel-efficiency rules as “a relic of a disproven narrative of resource scarcity” and says “unelected bureaucrats” shouldn’t dictate the cars Americans drive.

But as the recent California deal shows, car companies would prefer to have stable regulations, even if it means a tougher standard for themselves.

Former VA pathologist charged in deaths of 3 veterans,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dr-robert-levy-former-va-pathologist-charged-in-deaths-of-3-veterans/,"Little Rock, Arkansas — A pathologist fired from an Arkansas veterans hospital after officials said he had been impaired while on duty was charged Tuesday with involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients. Authorities say he misdiagnosed them and altered their records to try to conceal his mistakes.

A grand jury indictment unsealed Tuesday charged Dr. Robert Morris Levy in the patients' deaths and on multiple charges of fraud and making false statements for his alleged attempts to conceal his substance abuse and incorrect diagnoses.

""In doing so, he was allowed to stay employed with the Veterans Administration, thus earning a salary, benefits and possibly a bonus,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said at a news conference in Fayetteville, referring to the Department of Veterans Affairs by its former name.

Levy, 53, who worked at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville, was paid an annual salary of $225,000, according to the indictment. He was fired from the hospital in April 2018.

In this Aug. 17, 2019, file photo provided by the Washington County, Arkansas Sheriff's Department, Robert Levy is pictured in a booking photo. Washington County Sheriff's Dept.

VA officials said in January that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating back to 2005. Levy has acknowledged that he once showed up to work at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks drunk in 2016, but he denied that he had worked while impaired. He entered an in-patient treatment program following that incident and returned to work in October 2016 after agreeing to remain sober and submitting to random drug testing.

Levy, who was being held at the Washington County jail, pleaded not guilty at a hearing Tuesday. Kees said that as of Tuesday morning, Levy had not obtained counsel to represent him in the case.

In the deaths, Levy is accused of falsifying entries in his patients' records after making incorrect and misleading diagnoses. In one case, a patient died of prostate cancer after Levy determined that his biopsy showed he didn't have cancer, prosecutors allege.

Prosecutors say a second patient died of squamous cell carcinoma after Levy misdiagnosed the patient with another form of carcinoma. In a third case, the indictment says, a patient with small cell carcinoma was treated for a type of cancer he didn't have following an incorrect diagnosis by Levy, and died.

In two cases, he's accused of falsifying patients' medical records to state that a second pathologist agreed with his diagnosis.

Prosecutors say Levy received bonuses in 2016 and 2017 that were based in part on him reporting that his clinical errors were less than 5%. But, according the indictment, almost 10% of the diagnoses he made had clinical errors.

""These charges send a clear signal that anyone entrusted with the care of veterans will be held accountable for placing them at risk by working while impaired or through other misconduct,"" VA Inspector General Michael Missal said.

Levy ingested 2-methyl-2-butanol, a chemical that would intoxicate him but that standard drug and alcohol screenings don't test for, according to the indictment. Levy is accused of lying to hospital officials when he told them he wasn't under the influence of any intoxicants. Levy is charged with multiple counts of mail and wire fraud for his purchase of the chemical.

U.S. Attorney Kees said at a news conference Levy ""had the medical expertise, the knowledge, the skill set and the equipment to know exactly how much of this substance to take. He had the equipment to measure it out precisely, and he had the knowledge to know how to ingest it so it wouldn't be fatal.""

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) said that ingesting between 18 and 27 grams of the chemical can produce signs of intoxication and cause unconsciousness after only 30 minutes, according to CBS Fort Smith, Arkansas, affiliate KFSM-TV. The NCBI also reportedly said that the effects can persist until the next day, and can include daylong sleeping and weeks of recovery.

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines, Kees said."

Defense Department Official Stresses CBD Ban For Military Members,https://www.marijuanamoment.net,['Kyle Jaeger'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/defense-department-official-stresses-cbd-ban-for-military-members/,"A Department of Defense (DOD) official is reiterating that military service members are barred from using CBD products despite the legalization of hemp and its derivatives under the 2018 Farm Bill.

Patricia Deuster, director of the Human Performance Laboratory at the federal government-run Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, said in a call with reporters this week that the non-intoxicating compound is “completely forbidden for use by any service member in any of the services at this point of time.”

While CBD products are widely available—in grocery stores, gas stations and online—the lack of regulations for these items from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) creates uncertainty about levels of THC in the preparations. And military members who test positive for THC can be punished with an other-than-honorable discharge and the potential loss of other benefits.

“It’s a real conundrum, and it’s going to be a major issue for the military because it is available [nearly everywhere],” Deuster said, according to Military.com, which first reported her remarks. “You go into any store, and you can find gummy bears with a supplement fact panel on it.”

Though the Tuesday press call simply provided clarity on existing military CBD policy, it represents the latest example of DOD interest in preventing the use of cannabis among service members.

The Navy released a notice earlier this month stipulating that “all hemp and CBD products are strictly prohibited for use by Sailors” no matter the legal status. And the Coast Guard said its members aren’t even allowed to visit marijuana shops or use online or delivery cannabis services, according to an order released last month.

That order didn’t specify policy around hemp-derived CBD, but a Coast Guard official told Mililtary.com that if members “have a desire to use a product that may or may not fall into the definition of what’s prohibited, they should seek guidance or use caution.”

Last year, the Air Force wrote in a post that “consumption [of marijuana] is not permitted in any fashion, period.” It emphasized the need to take caution as more states legalize, with one risk factor being your “friend’s grandma’s miracle sticky buns” that “might look mighty tasty and get rave reviews at the big shindig,” but could contain THC.

In a memo released in April, the Air Force said that “Airmen are advised against using CBD products” and could face disciplinary action if they use CBD that isn’t the FDA-approved drug Epidiolex.

The Army issued a similar notice in November 2016 that stated service members may not use marijuana, hemp or hemp oil.

Though not a military branch, NASA also sent a warning to its workforce this month that the unregulated nature of CBD products means employees could inadvertently consume THC that could get them fired.

“The problem is there is no regulatory framework to ensure that the CBD products being sold meet the Farm Act,” Deuster said on the call this week. “[CBD] is everywhere. We are waiting for the FDA to do something,”

She added that service members shouldn’t “believe what [the companies] are telling you” about the benefits of CBD.

Federal judge approves DHS request to force feed immigrant detainee on hunger strike,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/news/458493-federal-judge-approves-dhs-request-to-force-feed-immigrant-detainee-on-hunger,"A federal judge in San Diego approved Thursday a request from the Department of Homeland Security to force-feed and hydrate an immigrant detainee on hunger strike.

The San Diego Union-Tribune reported the 41-year-old man, a Russian citizen, has not eaten since Aug. 4 and has consumed only water, though he has refused to tell officials at the ICE facility how much.

The man is also refusing any medical examination, the clinical director at the Otay Mesa Detention Center said in a declaration.

The physician indicated in federal filings that they are concerned the detainee could suffer serious health problems due to the ongoing hunger strike.

U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw approved ICE’s request to restrain the man if necessary to perform a medical examination and forcefully feed and hydrate him.

“The Court finds that Plaintiff is likely to succeed in showing that its interests in preserving life and discharging its duties to care for those in its custody outweigh any interest Defendant might have in expressing himself through a hunger strike,” she wrote in the order.

The Hill has reached out to ICE for comment.

The Daily Beast identified the man as Evgenii Ivanov. He has reportedly lost 27 pounds and refused 51 meals since his stay began.

Ivanov has been in immigration proceedings since November. His next court appearance is scheduled for the end of next month."

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised Denmark as a cooperative ally following a phone call with his Danish counterpart.

Pompeo held the call with Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod Wednesday to discuss President Donald Trump's canceled state visit to the country, which had been scheduled to take place in early September.

""The Secretary expressed appreciation for Denmark's cooperation as one of the United States' allies and Denmark's contributions to address shared global security priorities,"" U.S. Department of State spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""The Secretary and Foreign Minister Kofod also discussed strengthening cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark — including Greenland — in the Arctic.""

Denmark's Kofod said Wednesday that the conversation had been ""frank, friendly and constructive"" and affirmed the two nations' strong bond.

""(The) U.S. and Denmark are close friends and allies with a long history of active engagement across (the) globe,"" he said on Twitter. ""(We) agreed to stay in touch on full range of issues of mutual interest.""

Trump surprised Danish officials on Tuesday when he took to Twitter to announce he would no longer go to Denmark next month, with the president later dubbing Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen ""nasty"" for her response to his idea that the U.S. could purchase Greenland. On Sunday, Frederiksen said Trump's suggestion of purchasing the territory was ""absurd,"" telling Greenland's Sermitsiaq newspaper that ""Greenland is not for sale.""

Greenland is a massive island and autonomous Danish territory between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The land mass is considered to be rich with coal, zinc, copper and iron ore.

Trump said Tuesday that he would reschedule his visit to Denmark ""for another time."""
Veteran's widow speaks out after former VA doctor charged in 3 deaths,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Omar Villafranca'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/veterans-affairs-pathologist-charged-robert-levy-involuntary-manslaughter-widow-speaks-out-today-2019-08-21/,"Fayetteville, Arkansas — The indictment of a former doctor at a VA hospital in Arkansas is sending shock waves through the nation's largest health care system. Dr. Robert Morris Levy, 53, is accused of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients — and he could be responsible for the deaths of at least a dozen others.

Kathy McCoy's husband, Michael, died late last year. He was a proud grandfather of 10 and a retired Army sergeant. In 2014, he went to an Arkansas VA complaining of pain in his leg.

""He was in constant pain. It got to where at the end he couldn't walk … he would crawl a lot,"" McCoy told CBS News. ""They kept saying it was arthritis.""

She said it ended up being a blood clot in the leg.

McCoy's case is one of thousands under review after VA pathologist Robert Levy was accused of manslaughter in the deaths of at least three veterans by misdiagnosis or falsifying their diagnoses.

""We looked at the most serious cases and the cases that were the most prosecutable and those are the three cases that we feel confident that we can take into court and get a conviction,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said.

Levy was chief pathologist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center of the Ozarks for more than a decade, but he was fired last year after he was accused of working while drunk.

The federal indictment accuses him of practicing while intoxicated by drinking a potent form of alcohol called 2-methyl-2-butanol — or 2M2B — a form of alcohol that can't be detected in a common drug and alcohol test.

Levy can be seen in police bodycam footage said to be from a 2018 DUI stop. It was released by a law firm representing some of his alleged victims.

An 18-month VA investigation into more than 30,000 cases under Levy's supervision found 3,029 showed errors or misdiagnoses, and concluded they may have led to at least 15 deaths, some from cancer.

McCoy explained that her husband felt like he trusted a system that ultimately failed him.



""I think there, at the end, he knew they had failed him,"" she said.

McCoy is buried here at the Fort Smith National Cemetery. But his family wonders if a proper diagnosis could have saved his life. In a statement, Levy said he's innocent and will defend himself vigorously.

"Facing farmer anger, Trump scrambles Cabinet to brainstorm on biofuel policy: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/facing-farmer-anger-trump-scrambles-cabinet-to-brainstorm-on-biofuel-policy-sources-idUSKCN1VC1RN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.

Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry. However, his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting on for re-election in 2020.

Trump met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They presented options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

One proposal that was discussed and was advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was rescinding seven or eight of the 31 waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals, but Trump was yet to make a final decision.

The sticking point is a technical proposal to redistribute projected volumes that could be exempted in the future through the annual biofuel mandate from 2020 onwards. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.

David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels.

“As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers won’t be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story,” Fialkov said.

The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible; and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The final one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump’s EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and billionaire Carl Icahn.

U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to a slump in crop prices and exports shrinking following Trump’s trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about the refinery waivers.

‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.

Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.

On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in the fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed.

“Enough is enough,” Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. “We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions.”

Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.

On Thursday, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.

Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market."
Justice charges 80 in massive online fraud case linked to Nigerian defendants,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/458446-justice-charges-80-in-massive-online-fraud-case-linked-to-nigerian,"The Department of Justice on Thursday unsealed a 252-count federal indictment charging 80 defendants, many of whom are Nigerian nationals, with conspiring to steal millions of dollars through online scams.

The indictment was unsealed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California and was made public shortly after authorities arrested 14 of the defendants across the United States, with 11 of these defendants apprehended in the Los Angeles region. The majority of the defendants are outside the country, with many likely in Nigeria.

The defendants involved in the case were charged with attempting to defraud individuals of millions of dollars through the use of business email compromise (BEC) and online romance scams, in addition to other schemes meant to target the elderly.

The investigation is being led by the FBI, with each of the defendants charged with “conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to launder money, and aggravated identity theft,” according to Justice Department. Some defendants also face fraud and money laundering charges.

U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna described the scams used by the defendants during a press conference on Thursday, saying that “fraud networks now target individuals and businesses alike.”

“In the BEC scams, the fraudsters will often hack a company’s email system, impersonate company personnel, and direct payments to bank accounts that funnel money back to the fraudsters in Nigeria,” Hanna said. “In the romance scams, victims think they are developing a dating relationship, when in fact they are just being tricked into sending money to the fraudsters.”

Hanna added that “we believe this is one of the largest cases of its kind in U.S. history.”

Paul Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, said during the same press conference that losses involved in this case for victims total around $10 million. He said defendants attempted to obtain $40 million from victims.

There were at least 32 victims in the case, from the United States and other countries including Japan, the United Kingdom, Lebanon, Ukraine, China, Mexico, Germany, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, and Trinidad and Tobago.

Delacourt said the case began in 2016 after one individual was victimized by the defendants. The two main defendants in the case are Nigerian citizens Valentine Iro and Chukwudi Christogunus Igbokwe.

“In the days ahead, we will be working with our foreign counterparts in nine countries to apprehend 57 additional defendants,” Delacourt said, noting that six defendants are still at large in the United States.

Delacourt emphasized the seriousness of these types of fraud, noting that in the first seven months of 2019, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center received more than 14,000 complaints related to BEC scams, with a total loss of nearly $1.1 billion for victims.

“This crime is growing exponentially in terms of losses and victims,” Delacourt said. “While we are happy to announce these charges today, we are not going to arrest our way out of this problem, and we so we continue to educate potential victims.”"

(Photo by Liz Ruskin/Alaska Public Media)

Protesters stood outside the Dena’ina Center Tuesday. Inside, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency addressed a luncheon sponsored by the Resource Development Council. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler spoke of easing regulations on industry. He talked about hot-button issues, like narrowing the definition of wetlands and chemical pollutants in drinking water.

He didn’t say a word about the hottest Alaska conflict facing the EPA: the proposed Pebble Mine, the project that draws protesters to nearly every relevant forum.

For over a decade, Bristol Bay fishing communities have been campaigning against the proposed gold and copper mine, though some Alaskans, including villagers closer to site, say they’d welcome the jobs.

In the latest turn on Pebble, the publication E&E News reported last week that political staffers at EPA headquarters watered down the concerns raised by scientists in the regional EPA office about the adequacy of the environmental review of the proposal.

The EPA is in a powerful position. It has the right to veto Pebble’s application, even if the Corps of Engineers wants to greenlight the mine.

But the head of the EPA says the decision won’t be his. Wheeler used to work at a law firm hired by Pebble, so he needs to avoid the appearance of a conflict.

“So far, you all are the first people to have raised Pebble to me,” he told reporters at the Dena’ina Center. “But if people do raise it, I just explain that under my ethics recusal with the agency, which I abide by, I can’t discuss Pebble mine.”

How the EPA decides whether to exercise its veto power is something mine developers and opponents are watching closely.

Wheeler left the decision to the EPA’s top lawyer, who Wheeler says is working with the agency’s Region 10 administrator, Chris Hladick. Hladick is an Alaskan who has worked in commercial fishing towns. Mine opponents worry he, and the scientists at Region 10, will be steamrolled.

Hladick says a team of 40 staffers worked on the document reviewing the Pebble environmental impact statement, and he says nothing out of the ordinary occurred.

“Anything that you do at the EPA comes with consensus of headquarters,” he said.

Region 10 was still able to produce a long document finding fault with the environmental statement on the mine.

“Yeah, 170 pages of comments,” Hladick said. “They’re pretty substantial.”

EPA’s critique hit home with at least one key player: Sen. Lisa Murkowski says the document Region 10 issued has her doubting that the environmental review of Pebble’s plan has been sufficiently rigorous.

“This is substantive,” she said of the criticism. “This is considerable. And it needs to be addressed. And if it can’t be addressed, there shouldn’t be a permit that issues.”

"As big cuts in foreign aid loom, State Department again endures resignations, turmoil",https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'Tracy Wilkinson', 'Tracy Wilkinson Covers Foreign Affairs The Los Angeles Times', 'Washington', 'D.C.']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-08-21/state-department-resignations-cuts,"Saying he could no longer be “complicit” in the Trump administration, Chuck Park, an eight-year State Department veteran most recently posted to a U.S. consulate in Mexico, last week became the latest American diplomat to publicly and pointedly call it quits.

“Over three tours abroad, I worked to spread what I believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance,” Park wrote in an essay. “But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home.”

The ranks of the United States’ foreign policy establishment are being roiled once again by resignations, reports of partisan intimidation and looming massive cuts in foreign aid that critics in Congress and elsewhere contend weaken American diplomacy worldwide.

When Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo took over the State Department 16 months ago, there was a surge in optimism that a dispirited corps would be reinvigorated after a tumultuous year of budget cuts and bungled management under former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson.

But morale is sinking amid signs that American foreign policy is now being dictated unchecked by a shoot-from-the-hip president and executed by a secretary of State with the political savvy to actually implement those controversial policies.

That includes efforts to essentially revamp the United States’ asylum programs, proceed with arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite bipartisan congressional opposition following the gruesome murder of a U.S.-based journalist in a Saudi consulate, and overturning of decades of U.S. policy in the Middle East by moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to the disputed city of Jerusalem and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over Golan Heights.

In parts of the world and international venues where American influence was once king, the United States has lost influence or is not present, critics say. Pompeo has declined to get involved in a delicate dispute between Japan and South Korea, two key Asian allies whose cooperation is central to regional stability and negotiations with nuclear-armed North Korea.

Pompeo will not attend this week’s Group of 7 meeting of the world’s top advanced democracies, leaving it to Trump –- who last year stormed away from the summit and refused to sign a final document, the first time that has happened. A communique this week from Western democracies offering support to the Hong Kong protesters facing off with China was signed by major world powers, but not the United States.

And in the coming days, the White House is expected to maneuver around legal hurdles to attempt to slash as much as $4 billion in U.S. foreign aid that supports critical programs around the world, including peace-keeping missions, and development, educational and human rights projects.

“We are not in a good place for dealing with the next super-crisis overseas, nor ongoing great power competition,” said Barbara Leaf, a retired 34-year veteran of the foreign service whose last post was as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, on Twitter. In an interview, she added, “We have lost decades of expertise vital to our national interests ... and we are stepping back a degree from the international engagement of the last 75 years that shaped” the world order.

For many diplomats like Park, the unconventional Trump approach has triggered an intense debate about whether to stay and promote good diplomacy, or leave an administration that violates their values. In social chat rooms and private conversations, they discuss what one diplomat called the “morality” of their work.

One of State’s most senior officials, the assistant secretary in charge of the Western Hemisphere, Kimberly Breier, abruptly resigned this month after reportedly clashing with White House advisor Stephen Miller over his aggressive immigration policies. Several people said they expected additional departures in the coming weeks.

Another diplomat told The Times this week he was quitting in part because Pompeo’s State Department seemed to have little use for input from its experienced foreign service officers. “We are serving a secretary of State who largely agrees with the president” instead of offering alternative viewpoints, said the diplomat, who is based in Latin America and requested anonymity because his resignation is pending. State’s “is a largely empowering voice,” he added.

Trump and Pompeo defend their policies, arguing the United States can no longer be the world’s police force or its benefactor. They say they are promoting a doctrine of “America first” that puts top priority on the prosperity and security of U.S. citizens.

But critics warn that could lead to U.S. isolation. “What we’re seeing, I think, is the institutionalization of America alone,” said Heather Conley, who heads the Europe program at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Other countries are trying to figure out who takes up the new mantle and [whether] can they hold on … until the U.S. returns to that leadership role, if it will.”

Speaking this week to the United Nations Security Council in New York, Pompeo defended the administration’s conduct of foreign policy, saying it was “reviving” America’s leadership role by joining multilateral efforts that are “meaningful,” “effective” and “reflect the values of freedom-loving societies,” such as the battle against Islamic State terrorism.

But in State Department ranks, there are frustrations on other fronts as well. A new report by the Inspector General’s office documents cases of Trump loyalists appointed to senior positions inside the department who went on to demand fealty to the administration and often berated and abused those they believed fell short.

The report recounted cases of “harassment” of career employees “premised on claims that they were ‘disloyal’ based on their perceived political views.”

Focusing on the State Department’s internal divisions over the United Nations and other multilateral organizations, investigators described a “negative and vindictive” environment in which one political appointee, senior advisor Mari Stull, punished and dressed down those she believed undermined Trump. She removed one senior official from the office and drove away dozens more, according to the report. She reportedly scrubbed officers’ social media, blacklisted those she deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump and labeled them “traitors,” it concluded.

Stull, who left the administration earlier this year, was formerly a food-industry lobbyist who came to the State Department from a wine blog she produced under the name Vino Vixen. She told those who complained that their objections were “pointless,” the report said, because “the Trump administration ‘has my back.’”

The inspector’s report also cited her boss, assistant secretary Kevin Moley, for failing to respond to complaints and granting her an “unprecedented level of independence,” according to an internal memo. He denied to investigators “the behavior attributed to me,” and remains in office.

A second inspector general report is underway on other alleged abuses, including the firing of a diplomat of Iranian descent, according to people familiar with the probe.

In cutting foreign aid, it remains unclear which programs will be targeted and how much money will be lost. To slash the money, the White House is attempting a workaround by submitting the proposed cuts late in the fiscal year so that Congress will not have time to act. The “rescission” package, as it is known, freezes foreign-aid money that Congress already approved for a 45-day review period. The fiscal year ends in Sept. 30, meaning the money will almost certainly go unspent and be returned to the U.S. Treasury.

The administration argues the action will help reduce the budget deficit. Agencies likely to be affected denied this, noting the money is a tiny fraction of the overall government budget.

Gayle Smith, former administrator of U.S. AID and president of the One Campaign, a global group that fights poverty and preventable disease, said the rescission move was “as ineffective as it is shameful.” It will “undermine U.S. leadership around the world,” she said, “subvert Congress’ spending authority ... and chip away at really powerful relationships” with private sectors, universities, civil societies and other non-governmental entities in scores of countries.

Trump this week said he was willing to listen to members of Congress but that he planned to go ahead with cuts. He argued that taking money away from countries or groups, citing Pakistan and the Palestinians, makes them more pliable in negotiations, though history has showed otherwise.

Opposition in Congress has come from both sides of the aisle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said the maneuver is illegal. Even Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said taking money from critical State Department programs “only undermines our national security interests and emboldens our adversaries.”

USDA Begs Americans to Finally Stop Washing Their Chicken,https://www.inverse.com,[],,,,https://www.inverse.com/article/58691-do-not-wash-chicken-poultry,"Raw chicken, with its slightly slimy sheen, doesn’t look clean enough to eat. That doesn’t mean that you should wash it with water, though. While it’s common practice for some — and even the legendary chef Julia Child washed her poultry — scientists consistently agree that rinsing chicken is dangerous.

A report from the US Department of Agriculture released on Tuesday is the latest in a long line of research to link poultry washing to an increased risk of becoming ill. That’s because raw chicken is often contaminated with Campylobacter bacteria, as well as Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens bacteria. Cooking chicken at 165 degrees Fahrenheit is all you need to destroy these bacteria and make the meal safe to consume.

Meanwhile, washing chicken easily spreads the bacteria to other surfaces and foods, increasing the likelihood of an unsuspecting encounter that causes people to become sick.

Want to know why you shouldn’t wash chicken? Watch where the germs go in this new CDC video. #FoodSafety https://t.co/TsOrI1FpGj pic.twitter.com/qkJOptArGT — CDC (@CDCgov) August 20, 2019

This investigation was a partnership between the USDA and North Carolina State University. Overall, 300 people were asked to prepare a chicken and a salad in a test kitchen located in either the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina or in Lillington, North Carolina. All participants self-reported that they had some experience washing or rinsing raw chicken at home. Their reasons for washing included the intention to “remove blood/slime” or “because that is how a family member does it.”

These participants were broken up into two groups — one that was told before the cooking experience that washing their poultry was dangerous, and one that was not. When they started cooking, 93 percent of the first group did not end up washing their chicken, while 61 percent of the second group did.

Overall, preparing raw chicken close to a salad created a potentially dangerous scenario. Twenty-six participants who washed their chicken accidentally transferred the chicken’s bacteria to their salad lettuce. But even when people didn’t wash their chicken, 31 percent still ended up with salad that was contaminated with chicken bacteria. This cross-contamination is chalked up to “a lack of effective handwashing and contamination of the sink utensils.”

“Please keep in mind that children, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems are especially at risk,” explains Administrator Carmen Rottenberg of USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. “Washing or rinsing raw meat and poultry can increase your risk as bacteria spreads around your kitchen, but not washing your hands for 20 seconds immediately after handling those raw foods is just as dangerous.”

The investigators also found that 60 percent of the sinks and counters in the test kitchens used by the chicken-washers were contaminated with bacteria as well. Furthermore, 14 percent of these surfaces remained contaminated even after they were cleaned.

Luckily, no one ate any of the food prepared in the test kitchen.

The report additionally notes that, while it’s popular to brine poultry in salt water, vinegar, or lemon juice, that practice only flavors the chicken. It does not destroy bacteria, and that bacteria, in turn, contributes to millions of cases of foodborne illnesses that strike Americans each year.

If you really want to get the slime off your chicken, the best thing to do is to pat the area down with a paper towel and wash your hands as soon as possible."

GOP Oversight report says Interior head met with group tied to former clients,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458474-republican-oversight-report-shows-interior-head-met-with-groups,"Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee released a report Thursday examining Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s calendar and alleged conflicts of interest in an effort to counter an ongoing investigation by Democrats.

But the report appears to confirm Bernhardt met with a group he recused himself from dealing with as part of his ethics pledge.

Democrats on the Oversight Committee have yet to release a report, but Republicans launched their own probe after they said Democrats launched an investigation without consulting them and issued an “unprecedented and overbroad initial document request.”

Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for a number of oil and gas companies, has been under fire from Democrats and environmental groups since joining the Trump administration as deputy secretary at the Department of the Interior (DOI). Democrats argue his background leaves him with a wealth of conflicts of interest, and have accused him of violating public records laws with how he

manages his calendar

.

The GOP report lists a number of findings, the majority of which state that, “contrary to allegations,” Bernhardt is not mismanaging his calendar, obfuscating meetings or violating ethics laws. Republicans instead accused Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsGOP Oversight report says Interior head met with group tied to former clients Nadler asks other House chairs to provide records that would help panel in making impeachment decision Nikki Haley voices 'complete support' for Pence MORE (D-Md.) and House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) of using “cherry-picked information to create a false impression"" about transparency at Interior.

“This interim staff report sets the record straight about the allegations levied against Bernhardt and DOI. The record is clear that contrary to public allegations of wrongdoing, DOI and Bernhardt have acted appropriately and ethically in maintaining and preserving the Secretary’s calendar records, as well as making them publicly available,” the GOP report said.

But Bernhardt's critics say the report shows he took meetings with former clients.

One part of the report aims to dissect a meeting of interest to Democrats involving Bernhardt and nine oil and gas companies.

That included the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association (LMOGA), a division of the U.S. Oil and Gas Association (USOGA).

“LMOGA appears to have an association to an entity on Bernhardt’s recusal list, U.S. Oil and Gas Association, but it does not appear that this association would require a recusal in all circumstances,” the report said.

Aaron Weiss with the Center for Western Priorities, which has criticized Bernhardt’s ethics record, said the secretary should not meet with a division of a group on his recusal list.

“They don’t ‘appear to have an affiliation’ — they are part of USOGA,” Weiss said. “They are on Bernhardt's recusal list.”

A spokesperson for Interior said another oil company, Statoil, did not attend the meeting because of advice from Interior ethics officials.

""Secretary Bernhardt is and always has been committed to upholding his ethical responsibilities, and he takes his ethics pledge very seriously. He seeks advice from career ethics officials before taking any meeting involving external parties and strictly follows their advice and guidance,"" a spokesman for the agency told The Hill.

The Hill has reached out to Oversight Republicans for further comment on the LMOGA meeting.

Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee did not respond to request for comment, but Oversight Democrats say the report from their Republican colleagues left many questions unanswered.

“The Republican Staff Report provides cover for the Trump Administration’s secrecy. The Committee still has unanswered questions about who Secretary David Bernhardt met with, when, and why. The Committee is also concerned about how the Department maintains records of Secretary Bernhardt’s meetings, as well as its compliance with FOIA, which remains a serious problem,” Cummings said in a statement to The Hill.

Interior has been under fire for a number of actions critics say make the department less transparent, from a public records policy that would give political hires more influence over what documents are released to leaving controversial meetings off of Bernhardt’s public calendar.

Interior previously outlined how meeting requests would be vetted by ethics officials before being added to the schedule on a Google document. Some meetings were added to the public calendar, but others were placed on “daily cards” used to outline Bernhardt’s schedule.

“Bernhardt’s calendars are not created to be public documents, but instead used as an internal method of allocating his time,” the report said.

House Democrats have questioned whether the method violates public record-keeping laws, but Interior said an outside review found the process did not result is destruction of federal records.

""We are pleased the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) found the Department of the Interior to be in full compliance with records management laws. We appreciate their thorough and professional review in response to Congressional inquiries,” Interior told The Hill in July.

The GOP report includes high praise for Bernhardt, saying he “is improving the ‘anemic’ ethics environment of the Obama administration” and repeatedly lists witness testimony saying Bernhardt has not violated ethics or public record keeping laws.

Weiss said the report cherry-picks interviews and hopes that all of them will be released publicly.

“This is truly a ridiculous document that reads like it was written by Bernhardt himself,” he said.

"President Trump decision to end DACA was lawful, Justice Department says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-decision-to-end-daca-was-lawful-justice-department-supreme-court,"The Justice Department submitted a legal brief to the Supreme Court Monday that stated President Trump acted lawfully when he decided to end the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA in September of 2017, according to a new report.

The Department of Homeland Security, “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court late Monday.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN END DACA PROGRAM

The Supreme Court will begin to hear arguments in November. A ruling is expected in the presidential election year, putting the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues of debates. A decision in favor of Trump would allow for the president to deport more than one million young adults residing in the U.S. under DACA protection, the New York Times reported.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was created under an executive order in 2012. The program gives some illegal immigrants -- known as ""Dreamers"" -- who were brought to the United States as children-- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year reprieve from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program, but federal courts have ruled that the phase-out could not apply retroactively and that the program should be restarted.

The White House fought back on those decisions, saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy. Federal appeals courts around the country have rejected efforts by the federal government to move ahead with phasing out the Obama-era program.

DACA proponents have also argued that Trump’s planned termination of the program violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed, as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees.

A decision from the Supreme Court to end DACA could galvanize young Americans to ensure Trump does not see another four years in the White House, the Times report stated. On the other hand, if the Court chooses to continue the Obama-era program, conservatives could argue Trump needs another four years to fulfill his campaign promises on immigration.

Farm Tensions Escalate as USDA Staffer Threatened in Midwest,https://finance.yahoo.com,"['Mario Parker', 'Michael Hirtzer', 'Isis Almeida']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farm-tensions-escalate-usda-staffer-194638894.html,"(Bloomberg) -- In a sign of rising tensions with the farm community, the Trump administration withdrew staff from a privately run tour of Midwestern corn and soybean fields after a government employee was threatened.

While the threat came from someone not involved in the Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour, the U.S. Department of Agriculture pulled all its staff as a precaution. Lance Honig, crops chief at the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, was scheduled to address the tour in Nebraska City Tuesday night but a video interview with him was screened instead.

“Federal Protective Services were contacted and are investigating the incident,” NASS Administrator Hubert Hamer said, without giving details on the threat. “The safety of our employees is our top priority.”

In another incident, which wasn’t connected to the threat, an arrest was made at a crop-tour event in Spencer, Iowa on Wednesday night.

The USDA’s data arm has been the subject of ire in recent months after crop estimates surprised traders and growers who had expected the agency to significantly reduce its outlook after rain delayed planting. The USDA had already been criticized for its June estimates and took the rare step of re-surveying farmers to get more accurate numbers.

Its withdrawal from the crop tour comes about two weeks after farmers leveled criticism at Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue at a fair in Minnesota over President Donald Trump’s yearlong trade war with China, which has eroded demand and pressured already low prices.

In a statement Wednesday, Farm Journal, the parent company of crop-tour organizer Pro Farmer, said it took the threat seriously and has also taken precautions to ensure the safety of participants.

“For 27 years the Pro Farmer Crop Tour has been a public service for the benefit of agriculture, in good times and bad,” it said. “And it’s clearly a stressful time right now.”

While security measures have been increased, there are no planned changes for the remainder of tour, which is scheduled to culminate in a crop report on Friday, Joel Jaeger, the general manager of Pro Farmer, said in an interview.

The first USDA staff to leave the tour were from NASS, followed by employees of the Foreign Agricultural Service, he said.

At nightly crop-tour stops in Indiana, Illinois and Grand Island, Nebraska, farmers questioned officials from both the USDA and Pro Farmer about the government’s methodology in determining corn planted area and yields. Some growers, stung by years of low prices, were frustrated by the rapid rise in prices in May and subsequent steep drop.

Corn for delivery in December is down about 11% since the release of the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report last week.

USDA officials said yield estimates were based largely on input from farmers as well as satellite imagery. Planted acreage numbers published by the Farm Service Agency earlier this month referred to Aug. 1 data and that figure has already increased, Chris Hawthorn, a NASS statistician, told farmers on the tour, explaining the difference between those figures and the ones published by NASS.

“We had a great time with the USDA guys yesterday,” said Jim Putnam, a Minnesota farmer, who traveled with two USDA staff on the tour Tuesday. “I’m sorry this happened. It makes us all look stupid.”

Last month, the Trump administration announced another $16 billion in aid to farmers to cushion the blow of its tarde war with China, after a $12 billion tranche in 2018. Earlier this month, Trump hinted his administration may provide more money for farmers if the trade war were to persist.

Trump’s overwhelming support in rural America was crucial to his narrow 2016 election victory. Maintaining the backing of farmers is critical to his re-election. Just this week, the administration has taken criticism from agricultural interests for its handling of the Renewable Fuel Standard, the policy that mandates use of corn-based ethanol and soy-based biodiesel.

On Tuesday, the Iowa Soybean Association sent a letter to Trump and Perdue, asking for a meeting to discuss the Environmental Protection Agency’s granting of small refinery exemptions, saying that the agency’s Aug. 9 announcement that it granted 31 waivers adds to the “economic pain Iowa’s farmers and biodiesel producers are experiencing.”

EPA's closure of Grosse Ile office dismays Democratic lawmakers,https://www.detroitnews.com,"['Leonard N. Fleming', 'Published P.M. Et Aug.']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/08/22/epas-closure-grosse-ile-office-dismays-democratic-lawmakers/2087697001/,"The Environmental Protection Agency's decision to close its Grosse Ile location to save $500,000 is being lambasted by Democratic legislators as a foolish move that undermines environmental vigilance in Michigan.

The federal agency's Michigan-based emergency response staff will be moving from Grosse Ile to new, state-of-the-art office space in Ann Arbor, EPA officials said. The move began officially Thursday ""and the 20 EPA employees are expected to start working from their new location on Monday,"" an EPA statement confirmed.

Long-running research projects credited with pivotal discoveries about the harm that pesticides, air pollution and other hazards pose to children are in jeopardy or shutting down because the Environmental Protection Agency will not commit to their continued funding, researchers say. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)

U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Lansing, said shutting down the EPA's Grosse Ile office is ""a problem.""

""Anything that's taking away EPA focus for us in Michigan and the partnerships that we need with the EPA"" is not good for the state,"" Stabenow said. ""The EPA is very involved with all the projects in Michigan that we're talking about that we've made progress on. We don't need somebody in Chicago or Washington, D.C. We need somebody on the ground right here.""

But EPA officials said keeping the office isn't feasible.

""Although the Grosse Ile facility once housed EPA’s Large Lakes Research Station and staff from NOAA and FWS, the building is now largely vacant and in need of costly renovations,"" EPA officials said. ""Moving to Ann Arbor — to space shared with EPA’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory — will save the agency more than $500,000 per year.”

U.S. Sen. Gary Peters said he's ""extremely disappointed"" by the EPA's move.

""You look around here with this magnificent body of fresh water that is unparalleled anywhere in the world and to think that you would close an office that's charged with keeping it clean makes no sense to me,"" Peters said. ""But it is kind of consistent with what we've seen from the Trump administration. They basically have tried to handcuff the EPA from doing the work that they need to do.""

The move will help the EPA, officials said, complete a thorough indoor air quality assessment of the new space. The duties that were performed in the Grosse Ile office will continue.

""EPA is committed to supporting all the communities covered by this field office and does not anticipate any impact on the on-scene coordinators’ mobilization capability or response times,"" officials said.

The move follows a November 2015 decision by EPA’s Office of Research and Development during the Obama administration to vacate the property, officials said.

Since the 1970s, EPA had operated out of what was the Grosse Ile Naval Air Station.

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn, is pushing for the Democratic-led House to approve language in an Interior Department appropriations bill that would prevent the EPA from closing Grosse Ile station. But it would face an uphill climb in the Republican-controlled Senate.

"Robert MacLean, chief of Park Police during Bijan Ghaisar killing, is promoted to top Interior Dept. law enforcement post",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tom Jackman', 'Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/08/22/park-police-chief-robert-maclean-promoted-top-interior-law-enforcement-post/,"MacLean, 53, has been a Park Police officer for 28 years. He did not return a request for comment. The move was first reported by Paul Wagner of Fox 5 News.

During MacLean’s tenure, unarmed motorist Bijan Ghaisar was fatally shot by two Park Police officers on Nov. 17, 2017. After Ghaisar was shot in a residential neighborhood of Fairfax County, Va., MacLean had his detectives begin a homicide investigation and told Fairfax police they were not needed, exercising the federal jurisdiction of the Park Police. Three days later, MacLean handed the case over to the FBI, though the bureau had not responded to the scene the night of the slaying. Ghaisar’s parents said Park Police officers treated them insensitively while Ghaisar, 25, lay in a coma, refusing to allow them to see their son for more than 10 minutes each hour or to touch him.

Video shows Park Police fired nine shots into Bijan Ghaisar's Jeep at close range, killing him

No decision has been made about whether to charge the officers involved in the shooting, Lucas Vinyard and Alejandro Amaya. U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu and a spokeswoman for the Justice Department’s civil rights division declined to comment earlier this week on when a charging decision might be made. Twenty-two months have passed since Ghaisar was killed.

Ghaisar’s mother, Kelly Ghaisar, was outraged by MacLean’s promotion. “Every time I even start to allow myself to think there might be some hope for justice, I get hit with news like this,” she said Thursday. “Chief MacLean allowed, and possibly ordered, his officers to guard my son’s body and treat my family in the most racist way possible. The U.S. Park Police have sat on this case after killing our son. It is a disgrace that it has taken this long to investigate this murder. This is another example of a law enforcement supervisor getting promoted despite obvious evidence of conduct that would likely end any other career.”

MacLean has remained silent about the shooting, refusing to disclose the names of the officers involved or details about why they shot. After MacLean refused to release videos of the shooting recorded by two Fairfax County police officers, Fairfax Police Chief Edwin C. Roessler Jr. in January 2018 released one of the videos that appeared to document the entire episode. MacLean declined to comment on the video.

When The Washington Post obtained the names of Vinyard and Amaya in the summer of 2018, MacLean refused a Freedom of Information Act request seeking to confirm the two men were Park Police officers, saying it was “personal information” and “would not shed light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties.”

Vinyard and Amaya’s names were released to the Ghaisar family by Fairfax County police, who publicly disclosed them in a lawsuit against the officers and the Park Police in March. They remain on paid administrative duty. The lawsuit is pending.

The Park Police are not equipped with body cameras or in-car cameras. No federal agents wear cameras. In response to the Ghaisar shooting, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D. C.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) introduced legislation requiring federal uniformed officers to use such cameras, and they said MacLean told them he supported the legislation. MacLean has not publicly commented on the idea, which has not had a hearing in Congress.

D.C.-area lawmakers reintroduce bill requiring body-worn, in-car cameras for federal officers

The Park Police have about 700 officers in Washington, New York and San Francisco. MacLean previously worked on the department’s SWAT team and in internal affairs, headed its homeland security division, was the department spokesman, and served on a crime and violence task force with D.C. police and other agencies. MacLean helped oversee security and planning for major events on the Mall such as inaugurations and Independence Day festivities.

His department was criticized in 2017 when Park Police officers twice handcuffed youths selling water on the Mall. “We have to come up with better alternatives to handcuffing or having juveniles handcuffed and exposed out in the public for that long,” MacLean said.

The Park Police were also criticized by an inspector general’s audit in 2014 for “dysfunction” in communication after not finding a traveler who wandered from Reagan National Airport and died.

MacLean’s new job with the Interior Department involves overseeing law enforcement, security and intelligence activities for seven agencies: the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service rangers, the Park Police, the Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement, Fish and Wildlife refuge law enforcement officers, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Reclamation. The law enforcement office is described as the Interior Department’s “focal point to provide program guidance and oversight of the Department’s law enforcement, security, intelligence, counterintelligence/insider threat, and information sharing programs,” according to the office website.

In announcing the job, Susan Combs, the assistant interior secretary for policy, management and budget, said, “Chief MacLean has a stellar record protecting visitors and resources and is proud of the partnerships he has forged that have focused on the mutual law enforcement mission that transcends organizational jurisdiction and structure.” He is expected to begin in his new post on Sept. 16, Combs said in an email to Interior Department employees.

The agency laid out its key priorities in a new “strategic intent” document released on Thursday, which CISA Director Christopher Krebs described in the introduction as the “keystone” for the agency.

Among Krebs’s operational priorities is addressing Chinese threats to U.S. supply chains and to the rollout of 5G networks, bolstering election security efforts at the state and local level, and protecting the cybersecurity of industrial control systems.

Other priorities are protecting federal networks against cyber attacks, such as ransomware incidents that have increasingly spread across the country, and defending “soft targets” and crowded venues from physical threats.

CISA is the primary agency responsible for assisting state and local governments with securing elections, replacing the former National Protection and Programs Directorate in a law that took effect last year.

“We know that our Nation’s banks, hospitals, power plants, election systems, and state and local governments are under constant attack, and CISA must stand ready to help these owners and operators shore up their defenses,” Thompson said. “This Strategic Intent document sets forth an ambitious agenda, and I hope to hear more from Director Krebs about how he plans to execute the priorities outlined today, and what resources CISA will need in order to do so.”

Krebs, who is the agency’s first director, laid out the strategic plan during a speech on Thursday at Auburn University’s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security in Auburn, Ala. He emphasized CISA’s core mission of “defend today, secure tomorrow.”

Krebs noted that he spends “probably 40 to 50 percent” on election security issues, adding that the 2018 midterm elections were secure in large part due to strides forward in securing elections against outside interference in the wake of the 2016 elections.

“I know what the Russians did in 2016, I know what they tried to do in 2018, I need to know what they’re going to try to do in 2020,” Krebs said.

Mueller testified last month on Capitol Hill that he expects the Russians to return and try to interfere during the 2020 elections.

Another key issue touched on in the strategy is addressing threats from China. Krebs said he has “significant concerns” in regards to Chinese tech companies being involved in the 5G rollout in the U.S., pointing to the Chinese intelligence law that requires companies to assist in the national intelligence work of the Chinese government.

“Why on earth would we put them in a position to control whether our communications systems are up or down?” Krebs said. “That is the threshold issue here.”"
"Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of Trump",https://www.newyorker.com,"['Susan B. Glasser', 'Isaac Chotiner', 'Erik Agard', 'Ian Frazier', 'Jane Mayer', 'Adam Gopnik', 'Adam Entous', 'Dexter Filkins']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/08/26/mike-pompeo-the-secretary-of-trump,"In the winter of 2016, Donald Trump was roaring through the primaries, and Mike Pompeo was determined to stop him. Pompeo, a little-known congressman from Wichita, helped persuade Marco Rubio to make a late stand in Kansas. Like many Republicans in Congress, Pompeo believed that Rubio had the national-security knowledge and the judgment to be President, and Trump did not. Urged on by Pompeo, Rubio’s team pulled money out of other states to gamble on winning the Kansas caucus. It was one of the few remaining contests in which Rubio still hoped to beat Trump, who, he said, was a “con artist” about to “take over the Republican Party.” On March 5th, Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, arrived in Wichita for the caucus. Rubio left his closing argument to Pompeo, who told the crowd at the Century II arena, “I’m going to speak to you from the heart about what I believe is the best path forward for America.” An Army veteran who finished first in his class at West Point, Pompeo cited Trump’s boast that if he ordered a soldier to commit a war crime the soldier would “go do it.” As the audience booed, Pompeo warned that Trump—like Barack Obama—would be “an authoritarian President who ignored our Constitution.” American soldiers “don’t swear an allegiance to President Trump or any other President,” Pompeo declared. “They take an oath to defend our Constitution, as Kansans, as conservatives, as Republicans, as Americans. Marco Rubio will never demean our soldiers by saying that he will order them to do things that are inconsistent with our Constitution.” Listening backstage, Trump demanded to know the identity of the congressman trashing him. A few minutes later, Pompeo concluded, “It’s time to turn down the lights on the circus.” Pompeo’s stinging rebuke of Trump got barely a mention in the local press, and Rubio finished third in Kansas. “We got smoked,” a former top Rubio campaign aide told me. Days later, Rubio’s campaign was over. In May, Trump secured the delegates needed for the nomination, and Pompeo reluctantly joined the rest of Kansas’s congressional delegation in endorsing him. Still, Pompeo had told the Topeka Capital-Journal, in April, that Trump was “not a conservative believer,” and, a few weeks later, he said, on CNN, “A lot of his policies don’t comport with my vision for how I represent Kansas.” At that point, Pompeo had never met Trump. Like many Republicans who called Trump a “kook,” a “cancer,” and a threat to democracy before ultimately supporting him, Pompeo disagreed with much of Trump’s platform. He took issue in particular with Trump’s “America First” skepticism about the United States’ role in the world. Pompeo was a conservative internationalist who had been shaped by his Cold War-era military service, and he remained a believer in American power as the guarantor of global stability. Yet, after Trump won the Presidency, Pompeo sought a post in his Administration and did not hesitate to serve as his C.I.A. director. In 2018, after Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, by tweet, Pompeo happily replaced him as America’s top diplomat. Pompeo, an evangelical Christian who keeps an open Bible on his desk, now says it’s possible that God raised up Trump as a modern Queen Esther, the Biblical figure who convinced the King of Persia to spare the Jewish people. He defines his own job as serving the President, whatever the President asks of him. “A Secretary of State has to know what the President wants,” he said, at a recent appearance in Washington. “To the extent you get out of synch with that leader, then you’re just out shooting the breeze.” No matter what Trump has said or done, Pompeo has stood by him. As a former senior White House official told me, “There will never be any daylight publicly between him and Trump.” The former official said that, in private, too, Pompeo is “among the most sycophantic and obsequious people around Trump.” Even more bluntly, a former American ambassador told me, “He’s like a heat-seeking missile for Trump’s ass.” Pompeo’s transformation reflects the larger story of how the Republican Party went from disdaining Trump to embracing him with barely a murmur of dissent. This account of how Pompeo became the last survivor of the President’s original national-security team and his most influential adviser on international affairs is based on dozens of interviews in recent months with current and former Administration officials, U.S. and foreign diplomats, and friends and colleagues of Pompeo’s; the Secretary did not answer repeated requests for comment. Thirty-one months into the Administration, the relationship between Trump and Pompeo, born in derision and remade in flattery, has proved to be surprisingly durable. Trump often gushes about Pompeo, even as he has berated his hawkish national-security adviser, John Bolton, for taking similar positions. “I argue with everyone,” Trump told a reporter. “Except Pompeo.”

Fifty-five, burly, and barrel-chested, Pompeo lives with his second wife, Susan, and their golden retriever, Sherman, in a rented house on the grounds of a military base across the street from the State Department. A film buff and an AC/DC fan, he seems modest and approachable in settings where he’s comfortable. When challenged, especially about the President, he gets testy and red in the face. He favors baggy gray suits and close-cropped gray hair. Trump, who often talks about whether someone “looks the part,” has made a point of calling out Pompeo’s unglamorous presence. At a recent appearance in South Korea, he summoned Pompeo to the stage with his daughter Ivanka, referring to them as “beauty and the beast.” Pompeo’s background bears little resemblance to that of recent Secretaries of State, all of whom came to the job after long careers in public life and with extensive international experience. Pompeo, in contrast, has had a “meteoric rise,” as his friend Steve Scalise, the House Republican Whip, told me. A little more than a decade ago, he was unknown not only in Washington but also in his adopted home state, where he had just lost his first campaign, placing third in a three-way race to become chairman of the Kansas Republican Party. Trump often touts Pompeo’s credentials as a top student at West Point and at Harvard Law School, but in six years as a member of Congress he never chaired a subcommittee or faced a genuinely competitive election, and he served just over a year at the C.I.A. He spent much of his career running a struggling Wichita aviation company. Pompeo’s disclosure forms reveal that he is the poorest member of Trump’s Cabinet, listing family assets worth roughly, in 2018, between two hundred thousand and seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Watch “The Backstory”: Susan B. Glasser reports on how Mike Pompeo reinvented himself and went from an obscure congressman to Trump's most influential adviser on international affairs. Born in 1963, Pompeo was one of three children in a working-class family in Southern California. His father, Wayne, was a Navy radioman in the Korean War. His mother, Dorothy Mercer, was one of ten children of small-town Kansas pool-hall owners. In conservative Orange County, Wayne was a passionate liberal, according to two sources who heard this from the future Secretary. Pompeo does not speak publicly about his political disagreements with his father, but they began early on: he has said that, as a teen-ager, he read Ayn Rand’s “The Fountainhead,” and became a staunch conservative. The valedictorian of his public high school, he was nominated for West Point by his congressman, Bob Dornan, a fiery hard-right favorite of the defense industry. “That should give you a good idea of where I am coming from politically if ‘B-1 Bob’ chose me for West Point,” Pompeo told the conservative magazine Human Events, in 2011. Pompeo thrived at West Point, where he majored in engineering management. “Man, it’s hard to be No. 1,” a classmate told me. “It’s not just being the smartest person. It’s being the person who shines your shoes the best and also has the most athletic skills.” After marrying his college sweetheart, Leslie Libert, the weekend he graduated, Pompeo took a prestigious posting as a tank commander in the U.S. Army’s 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, which patrolled the border between East and West in Germany. Five years later, with the end of the Cold War, the border was gone and Pompeo left the military, having risen to the rank of captain. He went to Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Law Review, then moved to Washington, D.C., and joined the blue-chip firm Williams & Connolly. In the late nineties, however, Pompeo radically changed his life. He quit the law firm after two years and divorced his wife. (He kept the dog, Byron; she got the cat, Keats.) He moved to Kansas, his late mother’s home state, where, in early 1997, he and “three of my best friends in the whole world” from West Point, as he put it recently, started a company, Thayer Aerospace. Their aim was to acquire firms that manufactured specialized machinery for aviation companies clustered in Wichita, a city known as “the air capital of the world.” Pompeo became Thayer’s C.E.O. While buying one of the companies for the new firm, he met Susan Justice Mostrous, a former Wichita State University homecoming queen. As the vice-president of a local bank, she was sitting on the other side of the negotiating table. “It’s true,” Pompeo told an interviewer, jokingly. “She took my money twice.” In 2000, he and Susan married and he adopted her son from her second marriage. Pompeo became a deacon of Wichita’s Eastminster Church, an evangelical congregation that eventually quit the mainstream Presbyterian Church because of its support for gay clergy. Over time, Pompeo got to know some of the city’s wealthiest benefactors, including David Murfin, one of the largest independent oil producers in Kansas, and Charles and David Koch, the billionaire Republican donors and skeptics of environmental regulation, whose company is headquartered in Wichita. In 1998, the Kochs’ venture-capital fund made a key early investment in Thayer. Within a few years, Pompeo was a trustee of the Flint Hills Center for Public Policy, which also has ties to the Kochs, and he was an early recruit for the Kochs’ national political organization, Americans for Prosperity. In 2010, amid the Tea Party backlash to President Obama, Pompeo made another career switch, running for an open Congress seat in the state’s Fourth District. The establishment climber from California had become a heartland evangelical. Pompeo ran a nasty race against the Democrat, an Indian-American state legislator named Raj Goyle, who, unlike Pompeo, had grown up in Wichita. Pompeo’s campaign tweeted praise for an article calling Goyle a “turban topper,” and a supporter bought billboards urging residents to “Vote American—Vote Pompeo.” In the heavily Republican district in a heavily Republican year, he won easily. “Pompeo’s singular ability is in navigating power,” Goyle told me. “On that I give him massive respect, the way he mapped Wichita power, the way he mapped D.C. power, the way he mapped Trump.”

The narrative of Pompeo’s transformation has been rewritten over the years, or never told at all. Most notably, the Kochs were far more significant backers of his business than he has publicly acknowledged. In 2011, the Washington Post reported that, according to Pompeo and his aides, the investment by the Kochs’ venture-capital fund “amounted to less than 2 percent” of Thayer’s total. Their statement was highly misleading. Corporate documents for 2003 filed with the Kansas secretary of state but not previously reported show that the Kochs’ fund had a nearly twenty-per-cent interest in Thayer. The Kochs were also involved in the firm’s management. Both the president and the chief financial officer of the Kochs’ venture fund sat, at various times, on Thayer’s board of directors, and in 2000 the fund helped secure loans of up to four million dollars for the firm to buy property. The Kochs’ extensive involvement was not a secret: their fund announced on its Web site that it was part of Thayer’s “equity sponsor group,” adding that it had given Pompeo’s firm wide-ranging support, including “acquisition capital, strategic input at the board level, and guidance in environmental risk issues.” The environmental risk turned out to be significant. Air Capitol Plating, an aircraft-parts processing company that Thayer took over in 1999, had for years been the subject of environmental complaints because of its use of the toxic chemical trichloroethylene, or TCE, dangerous traces of which had leaked into the local groundwater. In 2000, Thayer entered into a legal consent order with Kansas authorities, in which it admitted to the pollution and agreed to clean it up. To address the problem, Thayer had brought in another Koch-backed firm, Cherokee, which specialized in “risk management services” for firms “that face environmental challenges.” A new entity, Cherokee Thayer, assumed liability for the cleanup, although it appears that little if any cleanup was carried out. Instead, the company and the authorities spent years arguing over the extent of the contamination and what to do about it. Meanwhile, the firm continued to pollute, failed to file required reports in 2003, 2004, and 2005, and was fined more than a hundred thousand dollars by the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2005, the state found high levels of TCE in nearby residential wells, resulting in a “threat to human health,” and the E.P.A. named it a High Priority Violator. According to the State of Kansas, this month, twenty years after Thayer purchased A.C.P., a permeable barrier will finally be installed to insure that no additional TCE flows from the site into the water supply. In speeches, Pompeo often describes Thayer as a “small” company and himself as a “small businessman.” He has reminisced about Thayer as “a small, dirty, smelly, beautiful machine shop.” In fact, by 2000, according to a press release that year, the Kochs and other wealthy backers had invested ninety million dollars in the firm. Despite that funding, Thayer struggled financially when Pompeo ran it—another aspect of his past that Pompeo has publicly sought to revise. During his first run for Congress, in 2010, one of his Republican-primary rivals, a local millionaire named Wink Hartman, claimed that Pompeo was “forced out” of Thayer after having mismanaged the company into financial trouble, the Wichita Eagle reported. Pompeo denied the accusation, saying that he left Thayer on “excellent terms,” while acknowledging some difficulties, which he blamed on a downturn in the aviation industry after the 9/11 attacks. But the company’s problems began before 9/11 and continued well beyond. In 1999, the Thayer subsidiary Air Capitol Plating started going downhill. According to testimony from Randy Birchfield, a West Point classmate whom Pompeo recruited to run A.C.P., business had slowed and there were layoffs, cutbacks in bonuses and health-care benefits, and rumors of imminent bankruptcy. “Clearly, the trend lines were moving in a direction that wasn’t comforting for anyone,” Birchfield said, in a deposition in a lawsuit between Thayer and A.C.P.’s former owners. The firm’s difficulties persisted. Thayer’s former human-resources manager, Kenneth Bollinger, said that he “directed the systematic layoff of nearly half the employees after 9/11.” A company balance sheet showed that, as of May, 2004, Thayer had just thirty-one thousand dollars in cash on hand and a negative “net worth” of almost thirty-three million dollars. In 2005 and 2006, venders sued Thayer for more than three hundred thousand dollars in unpaid bills. In both years, Thayer authorized new shares to be issued, which would raise needed capital but could also dilute the stakes of early shareholders such as the Kochs’ fund. By April of 2006, Pompeo was no longer leading the company. The firm’s post-Pompeo president lists on his résumé today the “successful turnaround” of Thayer, which was renamed Nex-Tech Aerospace and sold to the private-equity firm Highland Capital, in April, 2007, with the assistance of a company that advertised expertise in the “wind-down” of “overleveraged and underperforming companies.” The same month as the sale, the Wichita Business Journal reported that the new C.E.O. described his job as being to “rebuild a reputation damaged by an era of missed deliveries and slow supplier payments.” Pompeo personally held a ten-per-cent interest in the firm as of 2003, but his financial-disclosure forms and his modest net worth suggest that he did not make much money from selling it. Pompeo, however, soon landed with one of his Wichita contacts, David Murfin, the Kansas oil tycoon. Murfin named Pompeo president of Sentry International, an oil-services firm that manufactured parts in China and elsewhere and sold them in the U.S. One Sentry joint venture was with a subsidiary of the Chinese national oil firm Sinopec, although Pompeo later told the Senate that he had no business ties to foreign government-owned entities. Like the Kochs, Murfin was a major player in Kansas Republican politics. Kelly Arnold, at that time the Sedgwick County G.O.P. chairman, told me that Murfin was “a key person for anybody running for office.” In January, 2007, Pompeo ran for the chairmanship of the Kansas Republican Party, against Tim Huelskamp, a future congressman, and Kris Kobach, a firebrand who represented the Party’s anti-immigrant right wing. “Pompeo’s pitch to the Party was: I’m going to run this thing like a business,” Dan Rasure, who helped Pompeo in that race, told me. “To the rest of the world this may sound crazy, given how much Pompeo has catered to the ultra-conservatives once he became elected, but, in Kansas terms, Pompeo is just straight-up what would be considered a moderate.” Coming into the state G.O.P. convention, Pompeo believed that he “had the race sewn up,” Rasure said, but Kobach flipped a bloc of votes, and won. Rasure stayed in touch with Pompeo, and persuaded him to become the first investor in his new alternative-energy startup, Sunflower Wind, which planned to make wind turbines. Pompeo, who personally invested as much as a hundred thousand dollars, served on the board and was a key adviser to the young C.E.O., who considered his advice invaluable. “I would never bet against Pompeo,” Rasure told me. But the firm went bust after one of its turbine blades cracked, and everyone involved lost money. Pompeo had better luck in politics. By 2010, Wichita’s U.S. representative, Todd Tiahrt, had decided to run for the Senate. In the crowded Republican primary to succeed him, Pompeo was again backed by the city’s business élite. Murfin became his campaign co-chairman. Pompeo won the primary with thirty-nine per cent of the vote. “Let’s make a pact—if neither of us is married by thirty, we read an article about how many people are getting married later these days anyway.” Cartoon by Will McPhail Soon after arriving on Capitol Hill, in 2011, he was the subject of articles in both the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post, in which he was portrayed, as one Kansas professor told the Post, as the new “congressman from Koch.” That Post article is where Pompeo and his aides misrepresented the Kochs’ investment in Thayer as an almost negligible two per cent. Pompeo would never again be directly challenged about Thayer. When he ran for reëlection in 2014, he aired a campaign ad touting his “remarkable success” leading the company. His positions evolved along with the story of his past. When Pompeo got to Congress, he argued that wind power was an expensive boondoggle and campaigned to end a production tax credit for wind technology, even though, not long before, he had personally invested in Sunflower Wind. By the time Pompeo joined the Trump Administration, he had written Sunflower out of his history, omitting from his Senate confirmation questionnaire his position as a member of its board.

In Washington, Pompeo found a way onto the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the critical panel for the business interests of his Kansas patrons. He appointed a former Koch lawyer as his chief of staff and acquired a reputation as a fierce defender of the Kochs. “Stop Harassing the Koch Brothers” was the title of an op-ed that he wrote in 2012, in which he dismissed attacks on them as “evidence of a truly Nixonian approach to politics.” Two years later, he called the Kochs “great men.” His loyalty was rewarded: according to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 he received more campaign funds from the Kochs’ network than any other candidate in the country. But Pompeo hoped to make his mark in Congress on national security, and the Intelligence Committee was the panel that he most wanted to serve on. He got there in part by aiding the committee’s chairman, Mike Rogers, who sought Pompeo’s help in quelling an incipient rebellion by his fellow Tea Party members over the renewal of the wide-ranging surveillance authorized in the U.S.A. Patriot Act after 9/11. On the committee, Pompeo was regarded by his colleagues as smart and hardworking, “very bright, very politically shrewd,” as Adam Schiff, a Democrat, put it, “with a certain pugnacious quality to his persona.” Pompeo gained attention as one of the most partisan promoters of conspiracy theories about the killing of the U.S. Ambassador and three other Americans at a diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. For years, Pompeo criticized Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s handling of the incident, and, when the select committee that was created to investigate it issued a bipartisan report clearing her, Pompeo and Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, were the only dissenters, arguing that Clinton knew Benghazi was a “terrorist attack” but, with the 2012 Presidential election only two months away, she covered it up. Pompeo confronted Clinton when she testified before the panel on October 22, 2015. He badgered her about why she had given her private e-mail address to her outside political adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, but not to the Ambassador to Libya. Their encounter was widely seen as a disaster for Pompeo, and he later told a local Republican club in Kansas that even his wife, Susan, had given him an F for his performance. “He was a Benghazi crazy,” a former senior intelligence official who dealt with Pompeo told me. Although his allegations were discredited, the investigation revealed that Clinton had deleted thirty thousand e-mails from a private server that she used while she was Secretary of State. Given that a subsequent F.B.I. investigation into Clinton’s e-mails hung over her 2016 campaign, the former official said of Pompeo, “at the end of the day, he succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.” Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran was another obsession. Pompeo befriended the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, a younger fellow Harvard graduate and Army veteran, and they argued that not only would the deal fail to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon; it was also an appeasement of the world’s worst sponsor of terrorism. In 2015, they travelled together to Vienna and then revealed what they said were “secret side deals” that the Obama team had agreed to with the Iranians. Pompeo’s pronouncements on Benghazi and on the Iran deal led to new media prominence on Fox News and other right-wing outlets, where he became one of the fiercest critics of Obama’s foreign policy. He trafficked in outlandish theories and engaged in slashing personal attacks. On “Meet the Press,” Pompeo called Clinton’s role in Benghazi “worse, in some ways, than Watergate.” But Pompeo grew restless in the House. In 2014, according to a Kansas Republican he consulted, Pompeo briefly considered challenging Kansas’s senior senator, Pat Roberts, in that year’s primary. In the spring of 2016, he publicly flirted with a challenge to the state’s other Republican senator, before dropping that, too.

By the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pompeo had, at least in public, changed his mind about Trump. “I am excited for a commander in chief who fearlessly puts America out in front,” he told the Wichita Eagle while in Cleveland as Trump accepted the nomination. He expressed even more excitement about Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, whom Pompeo considered a “friend and mentor” from their time together in Congress. Pence, too, had strong ties to the Kochs, and Pompeo found a connection to Pence’s campaign in Marc Short, a veteran operative for the Kochs’ organization. Although the Kochs had opposed Trump in the Republican primaries, Short signed on as an adviser to Pence and is now his chief of staff. “Marc knows Mike well,” a Republican friend of Pompeo’s told me, and Short got Pompeo to help Pence with debate preparation that fall. When Trump won, Pence repaid the favor by recommending Pompeo. The weekend after the election, Pompeo called a Kansas Republican who had worked for Trump and told him that he hoped to become either C.I.A. director or Secretary of the Army. The two decided that he should work his ties to Pence and to a West Point classmate, David Urban, who had run Trump’s campaign in Pennsylvania. Urban was also hearing from Steve Bannon, Trump’s ultranationalist chief strategist, who called Urban to suggest that he urge “the old man” to name Pompeo to the C.I.A. post. Urban did so. On Wednesday, November 16th, Pompeo was summoned to Trump Tower for an interview with the President-elect. The men had never met, and still disagreed about key issues, such as Russia. Trump wanted to lift sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s regime, and disdained the U.S. intelligence community’s finding that Russia had intervened on his behalf in the election. “You’re wrong about Putin,” Trump told Pompeo, according to an account that Pompeo later offered to Republican insiders. “No,” Pompeo said. “You’re wrong.” Two days later, Trump announced that Pompeo was his nominee for the C.I.A. job. Trump seemed to know little about him, and Representative Devin Nunes, a member of Trump’s transition team, later said that he didn’t think Pompeo had even filled out a vetting questionnaire. After the announcement, Jeff Roe, Ted Cruz’s former campaign manager, called Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and reminded him of Trump’s fury at Pompeo’s Kansas caucus speech. As Tim Alberta recounts in his book, “American Carnage,” Kushner put the call on speaker, so that Trump could hear. “No! That was him? We’ve got to take it back,” the President-elect roared. “This is what I get for letting Pence pick everyone.” But the appointment stood. Two weeks later, Pompeo was hanging out with Trump in Urban’s box at the Army-Navy football game. Pompeo reminded other Republicans that he and Trump had a common enemy: Barack Obama. “He just made his political peace with reality—this is our President,” a former official in the George W. Bush Administration told me. Just months earlier, Pompeo had compared the “authoritarian” Obama to Trump, but Pompeo now saw joining Trump’s Cabinet as “an opportunity to kind of right the wrongs,” the former Bush official said. On January 23rd, Pompeo was confirmed, in a 66–32 vote. By then, he had deleted his entire congressional Twitter account, including a plea to the President-elect, days before Trump named him C.I.A. director, to “make the undemocratic practice of executive orders a thing of the past.” Trump, of course, did no such thing.

When Pompeo arrived at the C.I.A., he faced a political furor generated by the new President. Days before his swearing-in, Trump had compared the U.S. intelligence community to Nazi Germany for its handling of a secret dossier on Trump’s Russia ties. Then, at a welcoming ceremony in the lobby of C.I.A. headquarters, the President had attacked the agency again and made false claims about the size of the crowd at his Inauguration. Still, Pompeo managed to soothe the C.I.A. bureaucracy. He promised members of the Directorate of Operations that they would no longer be micromanaged, as they were under Obama. He vowed “to serve as an important bridge, if not a heat shield, not just from the White House but from any sort of political attacks,” Juan Zarate, a former U.S. official whom Pompeo asked to lead his transition to the C.I.A., told me. Pompeo also personally delivered the President’s Daily Brief to Trump, giving the C.I.A. valuable access to a skeptical President. “Mike got them in the room every day, and that is the most important thing the agency expects to have with its director,” the former senior intelligence official said. Pompeo used the sessions to establish a friendly relationship with the President, a contrast to Trump’s friction-filled dealings with other top national-security advisers. “He clicked with Mike early on, and Mike has had the benefit of that. Mike gets the President,” Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Trump’s, told me. Steve Scalise said that he remembers White House meetings in which “the President would look to Mike Pompeo before he even looked to Tillerson to get his assessment on different hot spots. That told me the President had incredible trust for Mike’s judgment, and it’s well founded.” Pompeo and his wife, who played an active role both in his office on the Hill and at the C.I.A., cultivated relationships not only with Trump but inside Trumpworld. One of these was with the Cabinet’s glitziest couple, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton. They made a seemingly odd foursome—the poorest member of Trump’s inner circle and one of its richest, an evangelical Kansan and an actress who got in trouble for vamping in opera-length black leather gloves at the U.S. Mint. Yet Linton recently told Los Angeles magazine that her favorite thing in Washington was dinner with the Pompeos. When the interviewer seemed incredulous, she replied, “But Pompeo is fun! He’s warm; he’s gregarious; he’s a great storyteller. He’s a lovely man. I love his wife, Susan.” Pompeo seemed to relish the C.I.A. job. He told a friend that, while flying around the world to meetings on a U.S. government plane, he would read the agency’s secret histories of wars in places like Afghanistan and Central America. Still, the former senior intelligence official said, “he wasn’t satisfied with being C.I.A. director. He wanted to be national-security adviser or Secretary of State.” “We didn’t know what to get the man who has everything. So we burned down your house first.” Cartoon by Liana Finck By the fall of 2017, Rex Tillerson was in trouble with the President. That summer, he had called Trump a “fucking moron,” and he often disagreed with Trump on policy decisions, such as withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. When Trump demanded an immediate withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, Tillerson pushed for more time. Most other advisers agreed with Tillerson, but Pompeo, a former senior official told me, twice sat in the White House Situation Room and supported leaving the Iran deal, sidelining his agency’s concerns about doing so. The Iran deal was one subject on which Trump and Pompeo were closely aligned before 2016. Another former senior intelligence official told me that Pompeo gave “strong brushback” to experts on the Iran desk at the C.I.A. after they concluded that Iran was complying with the terms of the deal—a sore point, since Trump was claiming that Iran was not doing so. The first former senior intelligence official told me that Pompeo challenged the agency’s Iran analysts: “He would ask, ‘What evidence? Are the Iranians cheating?’ ” At the White House, Pompeo waged what the former senior official saw as a “concerted campaign” to replace Tillerson. The escalating internal fight over Iran played into it. “Pompeo was working it hard. He saw and heard from the President how much he was souring on Tillerson,” the former official told me. “He was making the case to Trump: You’ve got a whole lot of people around you who don’t agree with you. I’m your guy.” An important proponent of Pompeo was Jared Kushner, who repeatedly clashed with Tillerson after Trump assigned his son-in-law an expansive portfolio that included everything from China to Mexico to Mideast peace. At a Washington social event in late 2017, a guest commented to Kushner on Tillerson’s troubles with Trump. “The problem will be solved very quickly if I have my way,” Kushner responded. When another guest suggested that Pompeo, who was present, should get the job, Kushner replied, “Of course.” Several months later, in March, 2018, Tillerson was returning home from a trip to Africa when Trump fired him and announced Pompeo as his replacement. “We’re always on the same wavelength,” Trump said. “The relationship has been very good, and that’s what I need.”

In the spring of 2018, on his first day as Secretary of State, Pompeo invoked the bluster of the Second World War general George Patton, vowing that the U.S. would “get its swagger back.” The reference to such an undiplomatic figure was odd, unless you knew that Patton is Trump’s most admired general and that the hagiographic movie about Patton’s life is one of his favorites. Pompeo followed up with a social-media campaign that featured photos of himself and Patton, and a State Department logo with a new motto: the “Department of Swagger.” Diplomats quickly surmised, as a former senior department official put it, that Pompeo’s opening pitch was to a “constituency of one.” Managing Trump as Secretary of State, however, would prove harder for Pompeo than it had been. As C.I.A. director, Pompeo spent many hours with the President, and he could punt difficult questions by saying that it was not his role to offer policy advice. Now he would often be away travelling, while Bolton, the new national-security adviser and a veteran bureaucratic infighter, had daily Trump time. The State Department was also in disarray from Tillerson’s tenure. Waves of experienced Foreign Service officers quit or were forced out, as Tillerson insisted on an extensive reorganization plan, instituted a hiring freeze, and accepted crippling budget cuts. The White House also blocked State from hiring any of the hundred and forty-nine G.O.P. national-security officials who signed “Never Trump” letters during the campaign. With State in crisis, Pompeo reached out to some veteran diplomats who had quit or been pushed aside, promoted a career Foreign Service official to serve as the department’s No. 3, lifted Tillerson’s hiring freeze, and consulted all the living former Secretaries of State, including Hillary Clinton, who took his call even though he had savaged her over Benghazi. The gestures helped smooth his Senate confirmation. In the end, Pompeo received even more Democratic votes, seven, than Tillerson had. Pompeo used his standing with the President as a selling point for a department in need of White House clout and a semblance of stability. “The department appreciates the fact that they have a Secretary who the President trusts,” Fred Fleitz, who served as Bolton’s chief of staff at the National Security Council, told me. Democrats noticed, too. “Morale is better at the State Department. It’s still at a historic low watermark, but people feel better,” Chris Murphy, a Connecticut senator who has vehemently opposed Pompeo on issues such as U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, told me. “There are some silver linings to Pompeo’s time at State that even critics like me can’t ignore.” Yet Trump’s impulsive style created constant complications for Pompeo, as it did for other officials. Trump undercut Pompeo with his abrupt decision, last December, to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria (which led to the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis); his unilateral recognition of Israel’s post-1967 annexation of the Golan Heights (a day after Pompeo, who was in Israel at the time, publicly said that he knew of no such plans); and his spur-of-the-moment decision to cut U.S. foreign aid to Central America. On North Korea, Pompeo was “very skeptical,” according to a former senior U.S. official, that Trump’s talks with Kim Jong Un would produce a breakthrough on denuclearization—a problem, since Trump’s first assignment to Pompeo was to oversee those negotiations. Trump has made a practice of alarming longtime allies, musing aloud about cancelling the mutual-defense treaty with Japan, threatening to pull U.S. troops out of South Korea, deriding Europe’s largest powers as NATO deadbeats, and dismissing the European Union as a “foe.” All of this has made for tense Pompeo visits in normally friendly precincts. In Washington, though, Pompeo has managed to maintain Trump’s confidence while remaining on speaking terms with a foreign-policy establishment that is deeply unsettled by the President. “He’s in a sense become the real adult in the room,” Ian Bremmer, the founder of the geopolitical advisory firm the Eurasia Group, told me. “It is less the case than he would like, but vastly more the case than anyone else.” Pompeo’s Republican friend told me, “He’s not an enabler of Trump. He does a lot to try to manage him.” Others believe that Pompeo is merely posturing. He is a politician who knows his audience; he wants to give the impression that “he generally agrees but he’s working with this wild man,” another former senior State Department official, who has met with Pompeo privately, told me. “He always has this sheepish ‘I know,’ but won’t show his hand.” He suggests, without being specific, the former official added, that he’s got “his finger in the dike.” When it comes to personnel, Pompeo has sent the right signals to the G.O.P. establishment by hiring a few Republican opponents of the President. He tapped Elliott Abrams, who wrote an anti-Trump op-ed in 2016, to be his special envoy to Venezuela. (Trump blocked Tillerson’s attempt to hire Abrams.) He asked Jim Jeffrey, George W. Bush’s deputy national-security adviser, to serve as the special envoy for Syria, even though he signed a Never Trump letter. This spring, Pompeo appointed the Fox News contributor Morgan Ortagus to be his spokesperson, although she, like Pompeo, had publicly opposed Trump in 2016, prompting the conservative magazine The National Interest to observe that “Mike Pompeo’s house has become a hall of NeverTrump.” In each case, Pompeo carefully managed the President. “He’ll be meeting with Trump about something else and then, like, at the end of the meeting he’ll be, like, ‘Oh, by the way, I’m bringing on Jim Jeffrey,’ ‘Oh, by the way, I’m bringing on Elliott Abrams,’ ” the Republican close to Pompeo told me. Trump agreed to the moves, but only because the jobs did not require Senate confirmation. “It’s fairly clear he has a deal with the President where if there’s no confirmation hearing, where people can talk about the 2016 race, then he can hire whoever he wants,” a senior Administration official told me. Fifteen months after Pompeo took over the State Department, the question is not whether he has stayed in Trump’s good favor but to what ends Pompeo is using the relationship. He “agrees certain things the President has mandated don’t make any sense,” a third former senior department official told me. When Trump unilaterally cut two hundred and thirty million dollars that was meant to help stabilize parts of Syria where U.S. forces were present, Pompeo “went to the President several times to fix it. He just lost,” the former official said. He concluded that this typified Pompeo’s approach. “He will go at Trump to try to change his mind, but if he can’t he’ll go, ‘O.K., we’re doing what the President has said.’ ” Pompeo’s own ideological agenda is also becoming clearer, as indicated by recent controversies over orders to U.S. diplomatic missions not to fly the gay-pride flag; the creation of a new State Department commission stocked with conservatives to review human-rights policy based on “natural” rights; and comments by the Secretary that were skeptical of climate change at an international climate-change conference. In the end, Pompeo may be remembered as the most conservative, ideologically driven Secretary of State ever to serve. He is certainly no sentimentalist about the world, and, while he does not share Trump’s affinity for dictators like Putin and Kim Jong Un, he has remained notably silent on human-rights abuses in places such as North Korea. In Saudi Arabia, he smiled during a photo op with the Crown Prince soon after the gruesome killing of the dissident columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and angered many members of Congress, including some in his own Party, by appearing to dismiss concerns about it. Pompeo and his advisers had thought that the episode would be a repeat of China’s 1989 massacre of protesters in Tiananmen Square: a controversy that produced outrage in Congress but then passed. Instead, Pompeo was “struck and frustrated by how it hasn’t blown over,” the Republican friend told me. Pompeo is also more political than any other recent Secretary, with the exception, perhaps, of Hillary Clinton. In some ways, he’s approached the job like a future Presidential candidate, hosting Republican strategists such as Karl Rove and wealthy patrons such as the former Goldman Sachs C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein at regular “Madison Dinners,” named for the fifth Secretary of State (and fourth President). The dinners are orchestrated by Pompeo’s wife, Susan, who travels frequently with him and whose unusual requests are now being investigated by congressional Democrats after a whistle-blower complained that the couple was inappropriately using government resources and treating Pompeo’s security detail as “UberEats with guns,” CNN reported. “Oh, yeah, Thrag spoiled the ending of this one at work today.” Cartoon by Pia Guerra and Ian Boothby At times, Pompeo’s concern for his political image can seem to shape policy decisions. Last September, he ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in the Iraqi city of Basra, despite objections from some State Department officials. “He did not want Basra to be his Benghazi,” a former senior U.S. official who discussed the decision with Pompeo said. Another former senior U.S. official, with experience in Iraq, told me, “Absolutely, it was an overreaction. He wears Benghazi around his neck.”

In a recent speech at the Claremont Institute, in California, Pompeo outlined his version of the Trump doctrine, claiming that “realism” “restraint,” and “respect” guided the President’s approach to the world. It was his most ambitious explanation yet of the Administration’s foreign policy, asserting that renewed nationalism is necessary as the U.S. faces a new era of great-power competition with China and Russia. It sounded plausible, Republican, and entirely unlike the President. “The problem with the speech is that it doesn’t reflect Trump’s foreign policy,” said Brett McGurk, a former State Department official who oversaw the anti-Islamic State coalition, until he quit in protest over Trump’s decision to pull out of Syria. “It’s not based on realism. It’s not based on restraint. It’s based on declaring grand objectives, few of which the Administration is willing or able to meet.” This gets at a central challenge of Pompeo’s tenure: turning Trump’s tweets and “instincts” into a coherent foreign policy, as his policy-planning chief often put it. Pompeo insists on that goal, though doing so often involves essentially ignoring the President himself. On Syria, for example, Pompeo, Bolton, and other officials disagreed with Trump’s order to immediately withdraw U.S. forces, but they sought to manage him rather than confront him, as Mattis did, while enlisting other allies, such as the Israelis and members of Congress, to lobby Trump for a reversal. In public, Pompeo defended the decision, arguing, in defiance of the facts, that it constituted a continuation of Trump’s policy. Eventually, Trump agreed to keep some troops in Syria. The episode was one of many in which Pompeo has struggled to avoid coming into public conflict with the President. In recent months, Pompeo has repeatedly tangled with members of Congress and journalists who ask about the President’s policies and his inflammatory statements. Such questions, he has said, are “silly,” “bizarre,” “ticky-tack,” “insulting and ridiculous and frankly ludicrous.” Yet none of the people I spoke with thought Pompeo harbored any illusions about the President. In private, Pompeo’s gripes sometimes echo those expressed by fired predecessors, among them H. R. McMaster, Trump’s second national-security adviser. One of the former senior officials told me that he had heard identical complaints from Pompeo and McMaster: “ ‘We put together carefully crafted policies on things and the President blows it up with a tweet, and I have to go in and put Humpty Dumpty back together.’ ” Until now, Pompeo has derived his power by being better than anyone else at anticipating where Trump is going to end up and managing to get himself there. As Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, put it, Pompeo has cultivated a “special skill,” figuring out “how to get Trump moving in the direction he wants.” The risks of getting publicly out of synch with Trump, however, have gone up for Pompeo this summer, as tensions with Iran rise. The President, a self-styled grand global dealmaker, has said that his goal after withdrawing from the nuclear deal is to bring Iran back to the negotiating table for a better deal. Pompeo, an Iran hawk far longer than he has been a Trump supporter, has been driving the Administration’s hard-line “maximum pressure” strategy. The possibility of a real divide with Trump emerged in June, after Iran shot down a U.S. drone. Pompeo and his internal rival Bolton, a longtime advocate of Iranian “regime change,” initially backed a retaliatory military strike, and Trump agreed, only to reverse himself when planes were already in the air. Even before that incident, Fred Fleitz, Bolton’s former chief of staff at the N.S.C., had told me that Bolton and Pompeo are closely aligned on Iran, at least. “He and John are on the same sheet of music,” Fleitz said. Whatever their ideological convergence on Iran, relations between the two seem to have worsened in recent months, to the extent that the former White House official was told recently that they are “not even on speaking terms” and communicate largely through intermediaries. Pompeo, asked last month about his relationship with Bolton, noted, “There’s always tension among leaders of different organizations.” But for now it’s Bolton, not Pompeo, who appears to be the odd man out. In a sign of Pompeo’s ability to remain in Trump’s good graces, the President publicly bristled at Bolton, not him, after the aborted Iran strike. Then, with Pompeo by his side, Trump made an unprecedented, hastily arranged visit with Kim Jong Un to the North Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone, while Bolton went off on a previously scheduled trip to Mongolia."
Instagram Hoax Fools Department of Energy Head Rick Perry,https://futurism.com,[],,,,https://futurism.com/rick-perry-instagram-hoax,"A hoax meme is currently spreading across Instagram — and Rick Perry, the head of the United States Department of Energy, just fell for it.

The image is nothing more than a huge paragraph of text warning users that Instagram is changing its privacy policy “tomorrow,” and if they don’t repost it, Instagram will have “permission” to use everything they’ve shared on the platform.

“Feel free to repost!! #nothanksinstagram,” Perry wrote alongside the image, which has since been deleted from his Instagram page but still up on his Twitter account at the time of writing.

If we saw the post on our not-so-internet-savvy parents’ Instagram feed, we’d probably roll our eyes and scroll on — but the idea that the person responsible for the United States’ nuclear arsenal fell for the hoax is downright terrifying.

The post is clearly fake for countless reasons, some of which are obvious — part of the word “now” is missing, for example, and some words are only partially bolded.

Others are a bit less conspicuous, such as the reference to the Rome Statute.

The average person might not know that that’s an agreement that established the International Criminal Court, an entity — which, as The Next Web pointed out, the United States isn’t even a member of — tasked with investigating such atrocities as genocide and crimes against humanity.

Think they would care about a social network “stealing” photos of your newborn nephew or your barista’s stellar latte art?

Oh, and that’s the other thing: Instagram doesn’t need to “steal” those photos.

Take a look at the platform’s Terms of Use, and you’ll find that, when you post anything on the site, you “grant to [Instagram] a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).”

So, to recap, Perry not only couldn’t tell that something was off about the hoax just by looking at it, he also apparently doesn’t know what the Rome Statute is or how social media works in general.

Again, this man is in charge of the U.S.’s nuclear arsenal — and a person with so much power really shouldn’t be this easily fooled.

USDA cuts buyout packages for employees who won't relocate,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/usda-buyouts-kansas-city/index.html,"(CNN) The US Department of Agriculture is shrinking payments offered to employees who applied for buyouts rather than relocate to the greater Kansas City area, according to a document obtained by CNN.

The one-time payouts are being reduced from $25,000 to $10,000 because so many workers applied, according to the document.

The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents workers at the affected agencies, says employees of the two research-related agencies that are being moved out of the the Washington area are ""extremely upset.""

A USDA spokesperson told CNN that the department said the change was made in order to offer payments to all eligible employees, rather than offer only the higher amount on a first-come, first-served basis. Workers still have the option to refuse the reduced payment if they decide to relocate, the spokesperson added.

The change comes after a union-compiled survey released last month showed an overwhelming number of the reassigned employees will likely choose to leave rather than relocate -- losses that could drain institutional knowledge and talent at two units that fund agricultural research across the nation and produce crucial reports, including data on agricultural markets and estimates of US and international agricultural productivity.
