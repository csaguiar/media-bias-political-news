Trump's tariffs trip up the all-American RV industry,https://www.reuters.com,"['Timothy Aeppel', 'Min Read']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-rvs/trumps-tariffs-trip-up-the-all-american-rv-industry-idUSKCN1UD18L,"ELKHART, Ind. (Reuters) - Carrie Gray points to a stack of unwelcome mail on a conference table at the offices of Renegade RV, one of the leading U.S. manufacturers of high-end recreational vehicles. She’s buried in bad news from most of her about 350 suppliers.

“We got letters from 75 percent of them demanding tariff-related price increases,” explains Gray, Renegade’s materials manager.

About 85% of the recreational vehicles sold in the United States are built in and around Elkhart County, making it a popular stop for politicians to tout their visions for U.S. manufacturing – including President Donald Trump, who staged a rally here last May.

And yet this uniquely American manufacturing sector has been caught in the crossfire of Trump’s trade war, according to interviews with industry insiders and economists, along with data showing a steep sales decline amid rising costs and consumer prices. The industry has taken hits from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and other duties on scores of Chinese-made RV parts, from plumbing fixtures to electronic components to vinyl seat covers.

Shipments of RVs to dealers have fallen 22% percent in the first five months of this year, compared to the same period last year, after slipping 4% in 2018, according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association.

The RV industry’s woes illustrate how even the most “American” of manufacturers, the kind of industries Trump has vowed to protect, can be heavily exposed to tariffs in a world of globalized supply chains.

Tariff-related price hikes have forced manufacturers to pass on some of the increased costs though higher RV prices, which in turn has contributed to slower sales. As dealers cut orders, many plants furloughed workers or reduced hours, including Renegade, which has reduced its headcount of 160 by about 10 workers since May at its two factories here.

Michael Hicks, a Ball State University economist who tracks the industry, said its decline is far worse than he or other analysts expected and could signal a wider economic downturn. RV shipments have fallen sharply just before the last three U.S. recessions.

“The RV industry is a great bellwether of the economy,” said Hicks, because the vehicles are an expensive and discretionary purchase, easily delayed by consumers who start to worry about their financial stability.

The Commerce Department said in a statement that it has “met with private industry” to hear concerns about steel and aluminum tariffs and that it has granted most U.S. companies’ requests for tariff exemptions among the applications it has fully processed. The department referred questions about tariffs on Chinese goods to the office of the United States Trade Representative, which did not respond to requests for comment.

The RV industry may have contributed to its own problems by building too many factories during a sales boom in recent years, leading to an oversupply now. But tariffs were the pivotal factor in the industry’s decline, said managers at RV manufacturers and suppliers.

“The tariff price increases are what tipped the RV business — it started the landslide, no question,” said Tom Bond, the materials and purchasing manager at Adnik Manufacturing, an Elkhart-based division of Norco Industries that has been hit with higher costs on metals it uses to make components such as seat frames.

Sitting in an office near the front of the Adnik factory, Bond and Ronald Dick, the company’s brand manager, spent an hour griping about the speed and scope of their materials costs increases. And yet, like many in this region that strongly supported Trump’s election, they often added the caveat that they support the larger goal of the tariffs to protect U.S. factories from unfair foreign competition.

“It’s good for our country in the long haul,” said Dick, “but it’s going to hurt.”

Thor Industries Inc - which controls nearly half the RV market - said its sales in North America fell about 23% in its fiscal third quarter, which ended in April, compared to a year ago. The company said in a release that it has cut production and shifted to four-day weeks at some North American plants.

Workers such as Demiris Jahmal Williams are bracing for bumpy times. He has worked for a division of Thor for the last seven years, often working as many hours as he wanted. But his hours were cut recently, and his factory’s normal week-long shutdown in July was extended to three weeks.

“This is the worse I’ve seen it,” he said.

The unemployment rate in Elkhart county has risen to 2.6%, up from a post-recession low of 2.1% last April. During the last recession, the jobless rate in Elkhart County soared to more than 19%.

Tim Sullivan, CEO of REV Group, Renegade’s parent company, said U.S. suppliers have raised prices alongside their foreign counterparts because tariffs have sparked a rush of demand for U.S. parts.

“It’s been a total feeding frenzy,” he said.

Michael Happe, CEO of Winnebago Industries Inc, said he expects tariffs will add more than $10 million to the company’s costs this fiscal year, ending in August.

The upshot, he said, is that most RV manufacturers have had to boost prices they charge dealers.

“Those make their way to the end customer,” he said.

CUTTING WORKERS AS STEEL PRICES RISE

Despite its all-American image, the RV industry relies on imports for everything from air compressors and appliances to bedding fabrics and the LED light strings that have become a popular interior feature.

The cost of metals surged dramatically after sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum were imposed last year. Those prices have since moderated, but manufacturers say many of the price increases on the metal parts they buy haven’t gone away.

Elkhart’s RV industry anchors a large network of related transport equipment companies, including utility trailer makers and specialty bus manufacturers, who rely on the same supply chains. Matt Arnold, president of utility trailer manufacturer Look Trailers based in Middlebury, Ind., said the axles he buys had three price hikes and are now 28% higher than before tariffs, while his Chinese tire rims were hit with a 65% tariff.

(For a graphic on how tariffs drive up trailer costs, see: tmsnrt.rs/2O3HLvO )

His rim supplier shifted to a source in Vietnam, but those still cost 8% more than he was paying before. In response, he boosted his trailer prices by about 20%, but that tanked sales. So far, he’s had to shutter his Georgia factory, laying off 80 people, and cut about 10% of his workforce in Indiana.

RISING RV PRICES, SLOWING SALES

Tariffs have so far translated into a 5% increase in RV sticker prices for consumers, estimates Gregg Fore, chief revenue officer at trade magazine RV Business and the former owner of an RV parts supplier, based on anecdotal reports and proprietary sales data he has seen.

“That doesn’t sound like a lot, until you start to talk about adding $1,000 to the price of a $20,000 vehicle,” he said.

Many RVs cost far more. Renegade, for instance, sells models that cost as much as $750,000 and can come with multiple bathrooms, heated tile floors and cedar closets.

Some industry leaders say the business will stabilize once dealers reduce excess stocks. But many of the region’s leaders are worried, including Jackie Walorski, the Republican who represents the area in Congress.

Walorski is an outspoken critic of President Trump’s tariffs, although she steps lightly. In a statement, she praised the President’s tax cuts and other policies for helping fuel economic growth.

“At the same time, I have not been afraid to stand up for Hoosiers when tariffs and retaliatory measures have put those gains at risk,” she said, using a common nickname for Indiana residents. “As I’ve told the president, we need to put a stop to China’s unfair trade practices by using a scalpel, not an axe.”"
Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Lobbied Trump in A$AP Rocky's Case,https://www.tmz.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.tmz.com/2019/07/18/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-trump-involved-asap-rocky-case-sweden/,"Exclusive TMZ/Getty

President Trump is very much aware of A$AP Rocky's legal sitch in Sweden -- and he's got his team working to get him freed ... thanks in part to Kim K and Kanye West.

That's right ... we've learned Kim and Kanye lobbied The White House to jump in and get involved in the drama across the pond -- where A$AP's been behind bars for more than two weeks now as prosecutors determine if the rapper should be charged with aggravated assault.

Here's how it went down. We're told as soon as Kim and Kanye heard about A$AP's predicament earlier this month ... Kanye urged Kim to get on the horn and talk to Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- with whom Kim is very familiar from her previous White House work.

Our sources say Kim filled Jared in on what was happening, and Jared then took the info to Trump himself ... whom, we're told, acknowledged something seemed amiss.

In addition to Kim and Kanye, Kareem Lanier and Pastor Darrell Scott of the White House’s Urban Revitalization Coalition, also played a big role … helping to connect ASAP’s management directly with Kushner through a phone call.

We're told Trump told Kushner he believed A$AP was being held unfairly, and wanted to help. As we reported, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo got involved and unleashed a few deputies in an attempt to get some action. A State Dept. member was supposed to arrive in Sweden Thursday. We're told the State Dept. is now actively working to get A$AP out of jail, thanks in large part to Kim's efforts.

‘Send Her Back’: The Bigoted Rallying Cry of Trump 2020,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Conor Friedersdorf', 'Staff Writer At']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/send-her-back/594253/?utm_medium=offsite&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=newsstand-ideas,"On Wednesday night in North Carolina, Donald Trump agitated rally-goers with inflammatory rhetoric about Representative Ilhan Omar, a naturalized American born in Somalia, until his supporters began chanting “send her back”––as if a legal immigrant who became a U.S. citizen can or should be denied equal treatment under the law and extra-constitutionally deported by the president.

Burning a copy of the U.S. Constitution would show no more contempt for it than the crowd’s bigoted, nativist reverie about tyrannically deposing an elected member of Congress. No opinion expressed by the congresswoman, no matter how wrongheaded, could excuse the un-American mob.

The crowd’s authoritarian outburst and the purposefully divisive, irresponsible presidential rhetoric that prompted it portends an ugly Trump campaign for reelection. Like “lock her up,” the chant that Trump rally-goers directed at Hillary Clinton in 2016, “send her back” is poised to travel the country with the president.

Already, the civic poison of the chant has been televised and celebrated on social media by Trump supporters. Naturalized immigrants must have heard it and felt anxious. Racists must have heard it and felt glad. Children must have heard it, too, and felt uncomfortable, knowing in their gut that the chant is wrong. Some kids are surely being malignly influenced by its repudiation of the American creed."

“I think I’m winning,” he told reporters as he left for a rally on Wednesday.

As the whole world now knows, the president was widely denounced for saying a quartet of young minority congresswomen, known as the squad, should go back to “the crime infested places from which they came.”

That would, in one case, have been Cincinnati. But the message was that if you were nonwhite, you must be some kind of foreigner. It was pretty clear to a lot of Americans that telling people to go back where they came from was a racist trope. Trump said he didn’t care. And, of course, he didn’t.

In fact, he now seems to be running for re-election against the squad. “These left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force of evil,” he told the cheering crowd in North Carolina on Wednesday night, launching into a hot assault on Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota while the crowd yelled “Send her back!”"
Trump's USDA buried sweeping climate change response plan,https://www.politico.com,['Helena Bottemiller Evich'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/18/usda-suppresses-climate-change-plan-1598987,"The USDA’s climate resilience plan was supposed to be an update to a 2010 plan on climate science — a document that was released publicly during the Obama administration. | Getty Images Agriculture Trump's USDA buried sweeping climate change response plan

The Agriculture Department quashed the release of a sweeping plan on how to respond to climate change that was finalized in the early days of the Trump administration, according to a USDA employee with knowledge of the decision.

Staff members across several USDA agencies drafted the multiyear plan that outlines how the department should help agriculture understand, adapt to and minimize the effects of climate change.

Story Continued Below

Top officials, however, decided not to release the plan and told staff members to keep it for internal use only, the employee told POLITICO. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.

The goal was to map out “the science that USDA needs to pursue over the next five to eight years for the department to meet the needs of the nation,” according to the plan, a copy of which was shared with POLITICO.

The revelation comes after a recent POLITICO investigation found that the department had largely stopped promoting its own scientific findings about the consequences of climate change. The USDA has also moved away from using phrases like climate change, climate, and greenhouse gas emissions in press releases and social media posts.

The scuttled plan, prepared in 2017, liberally uses those terms. The document also calls on USDA to help farmers, ranchers and forestland owners “understand their effect on climate change.”

A spokesperson for the department declined to answer specific questions about the plan but said that USDA has no policy in place to discourage dissemination of climate science or use of climate-related terms. The spokesperson also noted President Donald Trump repealed an Obama era executive order that required government agencies to conduct climate planning and that the current administration has different requirements in place.

The USDA’s climate resilience plan was supposed to be an update to a 2010 plan on climate science — a document that was released publicly during the Obama administration.

The plan had begun to go through an internal clearance process before a senior official quashed its release, according to the person familiar with the decision.

The 33-page plan sets ambitious goals for addressing a broad range of climate change effects. It proposes “moving agriculture and natural resource systems to carbon neutral and beyond” by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through practices such as increasing carbon storage in crops and soils.

It also notes the importance of studying the “human dimensions” of climate change — such as how it affects production, trade, pricing, and producer and consumer behavior.

The agenda proposes to make climate change “an explicit and functional component” of “all USDA mission areas through the timely development, delivery, and application of relevant science.”

The document acknowledges that climate change is already affecting farmers and ranchers as well as forests.

""Changing temperatures and precipitation, along with altered pest pressures, influence rates of crop maturation and livestock productivity,"" the document states.

""Forests are already experiencing increased disturbance, including widespread wildfires and pest-related die-offs, as a result of changing climactic conditions and prolonged drought,"" the plan continues. Elevated carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is already affecting the quality of grassland forage, the report notes.

But the plan also suggests farmers can make money by cutting greenhouse gas emissions and adopting practices that promote carbon sequestration.

The document also says that USDA should be working to ""increase public awareness of climate change"" and how it is likely to affect agriculture and forestry in particular.

News of the report comes as USDA’s chief scientist is scheduled to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee this morning.

Scott Hutchins, deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, is expected to field pointed questions from lawmakers about burying climate science at the department as well as on plans to relocate two research agencies out of Washington to Kansas City, as recently announced by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.

Both those agencies — the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture — were cited as important partners in carrying out the climate change plan.

Feds Say Former VA Employee Used Vets’ Ailing Kids to Scam Millions,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Lachlan Markay', 'Seamus Hughes']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/feds-say-former-va-employee-used-vets-ailing-kids-to-scam-millions?source=politics&via=rss,"A Department of Veterans Affairs employee used a network of shell companies to steal millions of dollars from a VA program to provide health services to children of veterans who are suffering from a debilitating spinal condition, federal prosecutors say.

The Justice Department lodged 23 federal criminal charges late last year against Joseph Prince, a former Veterans Affairs employee who prosecutors say used his position to steer almost $20 million in taxpayer money to companies run by family members and associates. Those companies then provided huge kickbacks to Prince, his wife, and other family members, the government alleges.

The previously unreported criminal case appears set to go to trial in Colorado in November. Prince has pleaded not guilty. An alleged co-conspirator, Roland Vaughn, initially did the same, but recent federal court filings indicate he is set to change that plea to guilty at a hearing early next month. Neither of their attorneys responded to requests for comment on the case.

Before he was fired late last year, Prince worked at a VA facility in Denver, where he oversaw a program that provides health benefits to the families of Vietnam and Korean War veterans with children who suffer from spina bifida, a debilitating spinal birth defect. Part of Prince’s job entailed counseling those families about the treatment options available to them through the VA. Prosecutors say he exploited that position of trust to steer patients to seven different home health agencies that subsequently kicked back money to Prince and his family.

The scale of the alleged fraud was extraordinary, according to data filed by federal prosecutors in search warrant affidavits. Of the $25.2 million the VA paid to home health agencies through the spina bifida program from June 2017 through June 2018, $18.9 million, or 75 percent, was paid to the seven companies implicated in the indictment against Prince.

Prince’s alleged scheme involved selling VA patients on home health services offered through the department’s spina bifida program. Certain services can be performed by family members and others without medical training provided they register with the VA ahead of time. Those services include basic assistance with daily tasks such as meal preparation and home care, but home providers can also be certified by medical professionals to help with bladder and bowel care often required for spina bifida patients. They can then submit invoices for services provided for reimbursement at a preset hourly rate.

According to the indictment, Prince sold patients on the benefits of doing that home health work themselves and recouping the hourly payments that the VA provided. He even allegedly encouraged them to falsely inflate the number of hours they worked, and falsely told some that there were minimum hourly billing requirements.

Prince then referred the patients to one of seven home health companies, assuring them that the companies could secure them the best reimbursement rates and assist with VA red tape. One of those companies was run by Prince’s wife. Others had reached pre-arranged deals with Prince under which he would steer them VA patients in exchange for referral fees. In many cases, Prince even sent patients prepopulated VA forms with his preferred home health agency.

Prince vouched for the companies’ track records even though, according to prosecutors, none were run by medical professionals. He used terms like “preferred,” “handpicked,” and “vetted,” and promised that the companies would assist with the red tape and would take the smaller fees than their competitors off of VA reimbursement checks.

In fact, the companies were taking huge premiums—paying home health caregivers between $16 and $20 per hour while filing for VA reimbursement at hourly rates between $86 and $141.

When patients found out about that discrepancy, they were livid. After receiving a regular statement of benefits from the VA, one beneficiary referred to a Prince-affiliated agency wrote to Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI) in April 2018. “Our daughter is in the Spina Bifida Program,” the unnamed parent wrote, according to documents filed in court. “The program has a provision to provide health care for her at home for the rest of her life. We were told that we would be paid for this. We signed a contract with a company that would take care of getting us paid, but they didn’t tell us that they got to keep 82% and pay us 18% for doing all the work. This is highway robbery.”

The scheme was extremely lucrative for both Prince and the home health agencies with which he worked. Prosecutors say his wife’s Advantage Home Health Agency alone received more than $4.3 million in VA payments as part of its work for the spina bifida program. Three agencies owned by Prince’s half-sister received more than $7.1 million.

Together, all seven agencies kicked back roughly $1.5 million to Prince individually, according to the indictment, and hundreds of thousands more to members of his family.

Some of the money went directly into Prince’s bank account, while some was paid to a consulting firm he owns. He used the funds to buy a house and a car, pay down student loans, fund plastic surgery procedures (for whom it’s not clear), and even to donate to his and his wife’s church, according to documents filed by federal prosecutors.

In an emailed statement, the church said Prince “has not been associated with our congregation for quite a while,” but that “we are saddened to learn of these allegations, and our prayers are extended to all who may have been victimized by the crime alleged.”

Prince was arrested last summer after an investigation by the FBI and the VA inspector general's criminal investigations division. The evidence against him appears to be considerable, due in large measure to the official record of his time at the VA. Because he worked in a call center, all of Prince’s phone conversations were recorded. And his emails were preserved as required under the Federal Records Act. Federal prosecutors have amassed an evidentiary record consisting of at least 6,000 printed pages and 1,414 audio files.

“Evidence at trial will include the testimony of numerous witnesses, including VA employees, at least 16 caregivers… as well as the playing of recorded phone calls between Mr. Prince and the beneficiaries, which will be time consuming,” according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have also filed more than 40 federal seizure notices on the bank accounts of those involved in the scam, hoping to get back nearly $3.2 million taken by Prince and his associates.

During questioning after his arrest, Prince denied any wrongdoing, and said “he thought he was providing more benefit to the beneficiaries and caregivers by sending them to companies that were going to pay them more for the same services.”

Privately, his tone was far different. The FBI recruited the owner of one of the implicated home health agencies to conduct a monitored phone call with Prince, during which he admitted receiving kickbacks from the agencies to which he referred patients. “It may not be” legal, Prince admitted.

“All it takes is one person to say something and that’s the end of it for everybody,” he added. But “everything is fine if nobody finds out.”"
Mnuchin says Treasury will ensure bitcoin doesn't become 'Swiss-numbered bank accounts',https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/mnuchin-says-us-will-ensure-bitcoin-doesnt-become-like-anonymous.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday the department will police bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with ""very, very strong"" regulations so that they don't become cloaked in secrecy.

""We're going to make sure that bitcoin doesn't become the equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts, which were obviously a risk to the financial system,"" Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

""I want to be careful that anybody who's using bitcoin — regardless of what the price is — is using it for proper purposes and not illicit purposes,"" he added. ""And there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.""

Certain Swiss banks historically offered clients additional secrecy though numbered accounts known only to the client and select bankers. While affording customers another layer of privacy, such accounts have been criticized by governments around the world for helping potentially bad actors avoid government scrutiny or avoid taxation.

Mnuchin was also asked if bitcoin's use in illegal transactions disqualifies it as a legitimate currency, given that the U.S. dollar is often used by bad actors for illegal purposes.

""I don't think that's accurate at all, that cash is laundered all the time,"" Mnuchin replied. ""We combat bad actors in the U.S. dollar every day to protect the U.S. financial system."""

Homeland Security has gutted programs aimed at stopping WMD terrorism,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-homeland-security-wmd-terrorism-20190830-story.html,"The Trump administration has quietly dismantled or cut back multiple programs that were created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to help detect and prevent terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction, a Times investigation has found.

The retreat has taken place over the last two years at the Department of Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block potential chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

The changes, not previously reported, were made without rigorous review of potential security vulnerabilities, The Times found, undermining government-wide efforts aimed at countering terrorist attacks involving unconventional weapons, known as WMD.

More than 30 current and former Homeland Security employees and contractors voiced concern that the changes — including the cancellation of dozens of training exercises and the departure of scores of scientists and policy experts — have put Americans at greater risk.

“What we had done in the past was analytically based: Where are the threats? Where can we get the most return on the taxpayers’ investment for security?” said Paul Ryan, who until mid-2017 helped lead Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was merged with another office last year.

“We’re not as secure as we were 18 months ago,” said Ryan, a retired Navy rear admiral.

The cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, who has been appointed by President Trump to successive posts at Homeland Security, a long-troubled department that has seen waves of leadership changes and policy upheaval since 2017.

McDonnell declined through a Homeland Security spokeswoman to be interviewed for this report, and the department did not answer written questions submitted on June 27.

On July 15, the spokeswoman, Ruth Clemens, emailed a three-sentence statement, saying that the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads, “is focused on preventing WMD terrorism by working with federal, state, and local partners across the nation.”

It also said, “some programs were realigned or restructured to better address threats, remove bureaucratic redundancy, and fully align with [Trump’s] National Security Strategy.”

Trump pledged in that 2017 document to “augment measures to secure, eliminate, and prevent the spread of WMD and related materials … to reduce the chance that they might fall into the hands of hostile actors.”

Among the programs gutted since 2017, however, was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” whose specialists conducted dozens of drills and assessments around the country each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing “dirty bomb.”

Another Homeland Security unit, the Operations Support Directorate, had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The directorate participated in less than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year, according to internal Homeland Security documents.

Experts at Homeland Security’s National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center had worked with counterparts throughout the federal government to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

The center has been reduced to a shell: Its leadership is out and its staff has shrunk to three positions from about 14.

A separate Homeland Security component, the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

Also cut back was the use of specialized, mobile detection units to help protect large public events from nuclear and radiological threats. The deployments have helped train local and state responders for a potential emergency.

For the first time in years, Homeland Security did not send a unit to protect the NCAA Final Four college basketball championship in April in Minneapolis or to an annual hot air balloon festival last fall in Albuquerque.

Homeland Security also has halted work to update a formal “strategic, integrated” assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks.

The assessment had previously analyzed millions of potential WMD threat scenarios. Under a directive President George W. Bush signed in 2007, the assessment is supposed to be updated at least every other year to provide objective guidance for the government’s purchases of detection-related technologies and medications for use following an attack.

“These risk assessments are how we stay ahead of the game,” said a former Homeland Security official, one of many who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing a security clearance or other retaliation. “If we don’t keep updating those assessments, then we essentially lose the little bit of focus that we have on the problem and we really risk a strategic surprise.”

The risk assessments provide “an understanding of where to make investments that are targeted to reduce the risk of terrorism,” a current Homeland Security official added. If effective detection technologies are not put in place and if the right medications are not procured for the nation’s emergency stockpile, “that’s putting people at risk,” the official said.

Overall, more than 100 scientists and policy experts specializing in radiological and nuclear threats have been reassigned or left to take jobs unrelated to their expertise, The Times found, undermining the department’s ability to protect the nation from devastating attacks.

Similar turmoil has unfolded among those who had specialized in countering such biological threats as airborne spores of anthrax.

In the worst biological attack in U.S. history, letters laced with powdered anthrax spores were sent through the U.S. mail soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Five Americans were killed and 17 others were infected. In July 2008, an Army scientist, Bruce E. Ivins, killed himself after he learned he was about to be indicted for the anthrax deaths.

Current and and former Homeland Security officials warned in interviews that cutting back training around the country could erode readiness among those who would first confront a WMD terrorism attack.

“You keep the country safe by empowering state and local first responders who are out and about 24/7, 365 [days a year],” said one former Homeland Security official.

“The real thing could happen tomorrow with no warning,” another former official said. “And the only practice our defenders are going to have is through these ‘red team’ studies and actual exercises. That activity is necessary to ensure even basic competence.”

The changes have undermined the U.S. government’s multi-agency commitment since 2006 to build and maintain a “global nuclear detection architecture,” according to the present and former officials.

The goal, specified in legislation, was a layered network — from locations overseas to inside U.S. cities — to detect and assist the seizure of radiological or nuclear materials that could be wielded by terrorists.

McDonnell has become a formidable figure at the Department of Homeland Security since Trump named him director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in early 2017. In May 2018, the president promoted him to be an assistant secretary of Homeland Security, heading the new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

Trump signed the legislation that formally merged the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was responsible for reducing the risk of radiological and nuclear terrorism, with the Office of Health Affairs, which had run BioWatch, the nation’s system for detecting potential airborne biological terrorism threats.

McDonnell has used broad discretion over the last two years to shift priorities and policies regarding WMD terrorism. Some of the changes are at odds with priorities authorized by formal presidential directives and by legislation enacted into law, The Times found.

The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center, for example, was established in 2006 under Bush, and affirmed by legislation signed by President Obama in 2010, to help counter smuggling of nuclear materials that could be used in an attack. It has now been effectively gutted.

Separately, the presidential directive that Bush signed in 2007 required Homeland Security to update the integrated assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks “not less frequently than every two years.” The directive remains in force, along with two related mandates, but the update is incomplete and is more than two years overdue, The Times found.

Michael Grossman, who collaborated with Homeland Security specialists during his six years as chief of the Los Angeles County sheriff’s anti-terrorism section, said any slippage in attention to the WMD threat concerns him, in part because regaining readiness would take time.

“If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready,” he said.

Current and former Homeland Security officials said they have struggled to grasp McDonnell’s rationale for cutting back training and other efforts intended to improve readiness, detection and tracing. They cited instances when specialists were removed from their areas of expertise in apparent retaliation for raising concerns about his policies.

Although the mobile detection units were deployed 70 or more times a year in response to requests from state and local officials, for example, McDonnell told subordinates he wants them used chiefly to support other Homeland Security operations and agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard.

Those agencies already have nuclear-detection equipment and procedures in place, according to congressional testimony and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

In 2016, Customs and Border Protection deployed specialized equipment to scan almost 100% of the cargo bound for and arriving at U.S. ports of entry, for example. It uses 1,400 giant radiation portal monitors to scan vehicles and cargo at land-border crossings, seaports, airports and mail facilities, the GAO reported that October.

Trump has repeatedly vowed to prevent terrorists from gaining access to unconventional weapons. In December, he said the “efforts will require close collaboration with and support to” the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency, based in Vienna.

But McDonnell has disbanded the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with the IAEA to help ensure dangerous nuclear material is seized overseas before it could be smuggled into the United States.

An IAEA official said “numerous” collaborations with Homeland Security over the years had bolstered nuclear security worldwide but that the joint efforts had come to a near-standstill.

“We hope that they would join in again,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

The Homeland Security division had participated in exercises with other IAEA member nations and helped generate “guidelines and best practices” that were adopted by 42 nations, according to one of McDonnell’s predecessors.

“This strategic partnership will continue to serve as a force multiplier for nuclear security efforts for years to come,” Huban A. Gowadia, then director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, told the House Homeland Security Committee in February 2015.

To aid the collaborations, Homeland Security embedded a specialist at IAEA headquarters for several years. McDonnell eliminated the position.

Asked about the now-canceled position, an IAEA spokesman said in an email that the specialist had assisted member states “in strengthening their efforts to detect nuclear and radioactive material.”

Officials participating in a program known as Securing the Cities, which was intended as Homeland Security’s last layer of defense against radiological or nuclear terrorism, also have raised concerns.

Securing the Cities was supposed to fortify defenses in five major urban areas — greater Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Long Beach; New York City and nearby Newark, N.J.; Chicago; and Houston.

Overall, Homeland Security has provided the cities with training assistance and direct financial grants totaling about $145 million for detection equipment from 2007 to mid-2018. (The Los Angeles-Long Beach area was made part of Securing the Cities in 2012.)

But a GAO report dated May 13 described “confusion and uncertainty” among city officials participating in the program. According to the report, the chaotic circumstances have arisen, in part, because McDonnell has said he wants Homeland Security to reduce its participation and let other federal agencies play a larger role.

The GAO report said, however, that the agencies McDonnell had cited — the FBI and the National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the Energy Department — didn’t intend to do so.

Homeland Security officials told the GAO “that they have not conducted any studies or analyses that would justify making changes to the program,” the report states.

“We asked, `Why are you making changes and what are these changes going to look like?’” David Trimble, the supervising analyst for the report, recalled in an interview. “The details were very light. [Homeland Security] couldn’t really provide us a road map of where they were going. We found no analysis behind it.”

McDonnell’s overall objectives are unclear.

According to congressional budget experts, $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for his office — went unspent. The unspent funds reflect indecision surrounding the shifted priorities and staff departures, current and former Homeland Security officials said.

On Dec. 18, dissatisfaction at the changes erupted at an “all-hands” staff meeting convened by McDonnell and attended by Kirstjen Nielsen, then-Homeland Security secretary, along with scores of subordinates from the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

A supervisor, responsible for ensuring that operational expenditures are based on validated needs, stood and voiced concerns about McDonnell’s leadership and asked Nielsen to intervene, according to people who were in the room.

McDonnell sat silently and did not respond.

Soon after, Nielsen’s office instructed a personnel official, Sharon M. Wong, to conduct a “workplace climate assessment” to elicit opinions from current and recent staff members. Many of those who spoke with The Times said they also shared their misgivings with Wong.

One official said he had raised concerns about McDonnell’s efforts to install BioDetection 21, a controversial nationwide system intended to replace BioWatch for detecting airborne infectious agents such as anthrax. The replacement technology McDonnell is backing failed repeatedly in field testing sponsored by Homeland Security scientific staff.

The Times disclosed the test results and McDonnell’s support for BioDetection 21 in February, prompting a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation that is ongoing.

In early May, after Nielsen resigned, Wong submitted her results to the office of the acting Homeland Security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, according to people familiar with the matter. The results have not been released publicly.

Although morale at Homeland Security has long ranked lowest of all federal departments, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office had routinely scored much higher, according to surveys conducted by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.

In 2014, the office ranked 11th among similar “subcomponent” offices. Last year, it ranked 415th — last among its peers.

"Mnuchin says progress being made on debt limit deal, markets shouldn't be concerned",https://www.cnbc.com,['Jeff Cox'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/mnuchin-says-progress-being-made-on-debt-limit-deal-markets-shouldnt-be-concerned.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Thursday the administration and congressional leaders are continuing toward resolving an impasse over the debt ceiling and he is confident an agreement will be reached that will ensure the U.S. does not default on its obligations.

""I don't think the market should be concerned,"" he said. ""I think everybody is in agreement that we won't do anything that puts the U.S. government at risk in terms of our issue of defaulting. I think that nobody wants a shutdown in any scenario. So I don't think the market should be concerned, and we're working hard. We'll get there one way or another.""

In what he called his ""most conservative"" scenario, the U.S. could lose its spending ability by early September. At that point, the Treasury would not be able to make payments on its $22 trillion debt load, a potentially catastrophic event that would ripple through financial and world markets.

Both sides have been negotiating on reaching future spending limits and a longer-term agreement on continuing to allow the government the ability to borrow. There have been some indications that an agreement is near, though CNBC's Ylan Mui reported earlier that the two sides remain significantly apart.

In the interview on ""Squawk Box, "" Mnuchin said he has been having ""daily conversations"" with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., they have reached an agreement on ""top-line"" spending numbers over a one- and two-year period, and are now working on ""offsets"" to put caps on spending.

He added that everybody involved is aware of the risks that the inability to reach a deal would bring.

""I've discussed that with the leadership of both the House and the Senate,"" he said. ""That's why I've encouraged them to raise the debt ceiling before they leave.""

Lawmakers plan on leaving for their August recess on July 26.

The Treasury has been using a series of ""extraordinary measures"" to keep the government running while the spending impasse continues. The measures currently in use entail halting sales of state and local government series Treasury securities, redeeming existing sales and suspending any new investments of civil service and Postal Service pension funds, and suspending reinvestments of the Government Securities Investment Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund.

Mnuchin earlier had said that those measures could keep the U.S. afloat into November, but recently shortened the time span."
Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area,https://www.npr.org,['Merrit Kennedy'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/07/17/742519999/future-of-key-farming-research-uncertain-as-2-3-of-usda-staff-say-they-wont-move,"Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

Two vital research agencies at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are hemorrhaging staff as less than two-thirds of the researchers asked to relocate from Washington to the Kansas City area have agreed to do so.

When U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the planned new location of the research agencies last month, he said it ""will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders"" and ""increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture.""

But groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists call it a ""blatant attack on science"" that will ""especially hurt farmers, ranchers and eaters at a particularly vulnerable time.""

The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA's Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, said the relocation ""has resulted in catastrophic attrition at USDA's top research agencies.""

""Evidence suggests that the relocation of these agencies is an attempt to hollow out and dismantle USDA science that helps farmers and protects our food supply,"" the union added.

The USDA gave employees until just before midnight on Monday to notify their employers whether they planned to accept the relocation.

On Tuesday, a USDA spokesperson told NPR that at ERS, 72 employees accepted relocation and 99 declined or did not respond. At NIFA, the spokesperson said 73 accepted and 151 declined or did not respond. That means the total number that accepted is about 36% of those reported.

The USDA spokesperson said that these numbers may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the date employees are expected to report to the area, and employees can change their statuses until then.

They added that the USDA is working ""to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA's work.""

Last month, the USDA said that of the 644 jobs in the two agencies, 544 would be relocated and 100 would remain in the D.C. area. The numbers reported on Tuesday by the USDA do not appear to account for some 150 positions that the USDA initially announced would be relocated.

The department did not immediately respond to explain the difference, though the employees' union has reported high rates of ""retirements, employees securing new jobs, and employees choosing to be terminated."" A statement last month from three Democratic senators said that ERS had a vacancy rate of 20% and NIFA had a vacancy rate of 26.4%.

NIFA provides grants for research on agriculture-related science, and the ERS conducts research and analysis on topics such as outlooks on major crops and livestock, how much food is going to cost and whether U.S. households will be food secure.

It's not yet clear whether the research agencies will be located in Kansas or Missouri, according to The Kansas City Star.

Lawmakers from both states, including Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, have supported the move. ""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" the Republican said, as NPR's Frank Morris reported.

An ex-employee of ERS recently told Morris that ""efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale."" He said the way the agency is run has become increasingly partisan, and he resigned after the surprise announcement about relocations.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee told Morris.

Some of ERS' recent studies, as Morris noted, may be politically uncomfortable for the Trump administration:

""ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.""

Perdue said last month that the move would save the USDA some $300 million. That number has been met with skepticism by some analysts. The Agricultural & Applied Economics Association estimated the relocation would actually cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million, partially due to the lost value of the research from staffers who decide not to move."
"House votes to hold Attorney General Barr, Commerce Secretary Ross in contempt for failing to comply with subpoena on 2020 Census",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team"", 'July At Pm']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-to-vote-to-hold-barr-ross-in-contempt-over-2020-census-citizenship-question/2019/07/17/8dbeb35c-a89c-11e9-a3a6-ab670962db05_story.html,"President Trump, joined by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, left, and Attorney General William Barr, speaks during an event at the White House on July 11, 2019. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)

The House on Wednesday voted to hold Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt for failing to provide documents related to the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, escalating the fight between Democrats and the White House over congressional oversight.

The 230-to-198 vote along party lines came one day after the House approved a resolution condemning President Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority congresswomen.

After a string of legal defeats, Trump last week abruptly retreated from his efforts to add the question to the census, announcing that he will instead order federal agencies to provide the Commerce Department with records on the numbers of citizens and noncitizens in the country.

But lawmakers continue to demand answers about the motivations behind the administration’s 19-month effort to ask about citizenship status on the decennial survey. In May, new evidence emerged suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to Republicans and whites. The Trump administration has said it needs the information to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.

Barr and Ross wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) earlier Wednesday saying they “strongly oppose” the resolution and asked her to postpone the vote so they could continue working through a legally mandated process toward a compromise.

“By taking this action, the House is both unnecessarily undermining inter-branch comity and degrading the constitutional separation of powers and its own institutional integrity,” the two Cabinet members wrote.

In a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the vote “ridiculous” and said it was “yet another lawless attempt to harass the president and his administration.”

“House Democrats know they have no legal right to these documents, but their shameful and cynical politics know no bounds,” she said.

Ross said in a statement that the vote was a “PR stunt” and that Democrats “made every attempt to ascribe evil motivations to everyday functions of government.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec defended the department’s efforts and said that “holding the Attorney General in contempt for working in good-faith with Congress marks a new low for Speaker Pelosi’s House of Representatives.”

The impact of the contempt vote is largely symbolic. Those found in criminal contempt are normally referred to the Justice Department for prosecution; in this instance, the Justice Department would not prosecute itself.

During Wednesday’s floor debate, Republicans cast Democrats’ holding of the vote as merely a political show.

“We may be in July, but it’s Groundhog Day all over again,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. Pointing to the contempt vote, a Democratic resolution on impeachment and Tuesday’s resolution condemning Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority Democratic congresswomen, McCarthy said Democrats are consumed with passing measures “attacking Trump” while voters are more concerned with kitchen-table issues.

Rep. Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) defended the administration’s efforts to inquire about citizenship, contending that asking such a question is “standard operating procedure” in other countries, including Canada and Australia. “Knowing who is in our country should not be controversial,” she said.

Some Democrats responded by arguing that the administration’s efforts were part of a broader pattern of seeking to dilute the power of minority voters. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) said the push for the citizenship question was “disturbing” because “it’s in a context of voter suppression that’s all across America.”

“Asking the citizenship question on the census is part and parcel of that scheme to discourage minority voting in America, to frighten immigrant communities,” Connolly said.

Others, such as Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), said the battle was about congressional oversight of the executive branch, noting that the Trump administration had “already lost” the policy battle in the courts.

“They lost because their justification was ‘contrived,’ according to Chief Justice Roberts,” Raskin said, adding: “This is about congressional power.”

Trump’s order came after the Supreme Court ruled that the administration cannot move forward on adding the question without providing a solid justification for its plan.

In their letter, Barr and Ross wrote that their departments had made “significant efforts” to accommodate Congress’s requests, and they disagreed that they had tried to obstruct lawmakers’ inquiry. They claimed that the “limited materials still at issue are subject to a number of legal privileges that have been upheld in the pending litigation, as well as the president’s assertion of executive privilege.”

“There is no information to hide; there are institutional integrities to preserve,” they wrote.

In April, the Oversight Committee authorized its chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), to issue subpoenas for a deposition of John Gore, principal deputy assistant attorney general, and to Barr and Ross for documents related to the 2020 Census decision. But the Justice Department said it would not comply with the subpoena for Gore to testify about the question, and the administration has vowed to stonewall all House subpoenas.

In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox Business Network, Ross maintained that the administration will push ahead on gathering citizenship data through other means.

“Well, I think it’s just gamesmanship on their part,” he said of the continued opposition by Democrats. “They know we’re going to come much closer to the answer than we ever have before, because with the president’s executive order, we’re having much better access to federal documents than we ever had before.”

Wednesday’s vote is only the latest attempt by House Democrats to force the administration to submit to congressional oversight. Last month, the House voted to seek court enforcement of subpoenas for Barr and former White House counsel Donald McGahn.

A move by the House to hold a sitting attorney general in contempt of Congress is rare but not unprecedented: In 2012, the Republican-led House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt over his failure to provide material in the probe of Operation Fast and Furious, a federal government program targeting gun trafficking by Mexican cartels.

"Protesters vent anger at NY mayor, U.S. DOJ after chokehold decision",https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Allen', 'Min Read']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-garner/protesters-vent-anger-at-ny-mayor-us-doj-after-chokehold-decision-idUSKCN1UC2HX,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several hundred people took to the streets of New York on Wednesday to protest the U.S. Department of Justice’s decision not to bring charges against a New York City policeman in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man in 2014.

The demonstrators also vented their anger at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who has declined to fire Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the five years since Eric Garner died in police custody.

De Blasio told reporters on Wednesday that he was surprised to learn that the Justice Department would not bring charges and that he regretted delaying the start of disciplinary proceedings against Pantaleo for years at the DOJ’s request.

“You can do something about it,” said Takiema McKiver, 30, from Queens, responding to de Blasio’s comments. “You can’t just say that you can’t do something about police brutality. You’re the mayor; this is your city.”

De Blasio, who is running for his party’s presidential nomination, said New York City’s police commissioner would decide by August whether to punish or fire Pantaleo.

The officer has been on desk duty since he was seen in bystanders’ cellphone videos putting Garner in a prohibited chokehold and wrestling him to the ground on July 17, 2014. Garner is heard in the videos of the incident saying “I can’t breathe!” at least 11 times shortly before he died.

The death of Garner, 43, who was initially approached by police because they suspected him of illegally selling untaxed cigarettes, touched off a nationwide furor and helped give rise to the Black Lives Matter movement.

In announcing that it would not bring charges against Pantaleo, Justice Department officials said they could not conclusively determine whether Pantaleo willfully committed misconduct, which must be established to prove that he violated Garner’s civil rights.

“We asked for (Pantaleo) to be prosecuted. We asked him to be fired. We asked for it. Now we’re demanding he gets fired,” Garner’s daughter, Emerald, said at the demonstration.

Protesters chanted “Hey hey, ho ho! Pantaleo has got to go!” and “I can’t breathe!” as they were addressed by civic rights activists. The crowd later marched to NYPD headquarters in Lower Manhattan, where they laid down cardboard coffins.

Filmmaker Spike Lee mingled in the throng, accompanied by a camera operator, but declined to speak to a Reuters reporter.

Pantaleo was the latest example of an American law enforcement officer to avoid criminal liability in killings of unarmed black men."
"Donald Trump is not America's first racist president, but hopefully he'll be our last",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Paul Brandus', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/17/donald-trump-racist-president-hates-what-makes-america-great-column/1743525001/,"CLOSE

Why does Trump hate the things that make our country great? And how do the rest of us get beyond this hatred and ignorance?

It was amusing at the start of the great racist tweet controversy to hear the media asking, “Is President Donald Trump a racist?” We are well beyond such questions.

“I am the least racist person you have ever met,” he has said on numerous occasions. If you were living solo on a deserted island and he showed up, that might be true, but for everyone else, it’s just another one of his delusional claims. In fact, I have met the president myself, and he’s off by one word. He is not the least racist person I’ve ever met — he is the most.

Trump supporters reading this will probably get upset and melt like snowflakes.Yet since October 1973, when Richard Nixon’s Justice Department sued Trump and his father Fred for barring blacks from their apartment buildings, it has been known that the president is a racist — and a congenital one at that.

Trump racism goes back decades

The least racist person you have ever met? You don’t know the history of the Central Park Five (Trump called for the death penalty for the accused teens), or the history of blacks who worked at his casinos (fine paid for discrimination, and much more) in Atlantic City.

The least racist person you have ever met? “Laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control,” he said in a 1997 Playboy interview.

The least racist person you have ever met? Mexicans? “they’re rapists.” White supremacists waving swastikas in Charlottesville? “very fine people on both sides.” On and on and on.

Before we move on, here’s my favorite. Remember when Trump (you know, the least racist person you’ve ever met) said that Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS” and that many African nations were “s---hole countries?”

One country he has singled out is Nigeria; he said once Nigerians have seen the United States, they would never “go back to their huts.”

His base loves this stuff, but guess what? The joke’s on them. According to Trump’s own Census Bureau, Nigerian immigrants are far better educated than white Americans. For instance, 17% of Nigerians who are here have a master’s degree; just 8% of whites do. And 4% of Nigerians who are here have a Ph.D. Just 1% of whites do.

Holding these figures down are lesser educated white folks like Trump himself and his relatives. None of them have an advanced degree — though Tiffany Trump, a second-year law student at Georgetown, may be the first to earn one.

Racism from Andrew Johnson to FDR

Americans have survived racist presidents before. Woodrow Wilson, a southerner, opposed postwar Reconstruction because ""the dominance of an ignorant and inferior race was justly dreaded."" He opposed giving blacks the right to vote, claiming “it was a menace to society,” and as president he oversaw the re-segregation of the federal government. He lived in the White House a century ago.

Calvin Coolidge signed an immigration bill aimed at keeping out “the yellow peril” — i.e. Asians, along with Africans and Arabs. “America must be kept American,” he said in 1923.

Trump's tweets: Bullies told me to go back to my country. At first it silenced me, now it spurs me on.

And everyone knows that after Pearl Harbor was bombed, Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, leading to the forced relocation of 117,000 Japanese Americans from the West Coast to inland internment camps. FDR’s defenders pointed out that we had just been bombed by Japan and were at war.

But few know that in 1925, Roosevelt wrote that “Japanese immigrants are not capable of assimilation into the American population...Anyone who has traveled in the Far East knows that the mingling of Asiatic blood with European and American blood produces, in nine cases out of ten, the most unfortunate results.”

FDR led us through the Great Depression and World War II. He was one of our greatest presidents. Yet those words cannot be ignored.

Visions of racial superiority

There are other examples — Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was probably the worst of all — but you get the idea. American history is dotted with presidents who harbored visions of racial superiority.

But not in the modern era, at least not to the degree that we have seen with Trump. He went from bad to worse just the last few days with his attacks on ""The Squad"" -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar, D-,Minn., Ayanna Pressley D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., all young freshmen congresswomen of color. And then he doubled down Monday, saying they hate America?

Actually, Trump seems to hate America himself. After all, he has complained about several amendments to our Constitution. He has complained about our system of checks and balances, our judicial system, our free press, people who are different than him.

Why does he hate the things that make our country great? And how do the rest of us get beyond this hatred and ignorance?

Donald Trump is not our first racist president. Let us hope, however, that he will be our last.

Homeland Security acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan is testifying on Capitol Hill Thursday as Democrats step up oversight of an immigration crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border.

The House Oversight and Reform Committee could bring McAleenan to task for strained conditions at U.S. immigration detention centers and cases of children separated from their parents.

Maryland Democrat Elijah Cummings, the panel's chairman, says he wants McAleenan to explain the Trump administration's child separation policy and its treatment of immigrants.

""I'm very glad he is coming. And I think America needs to hear what he has to say because he's accountable,"" Cummings said. ""My aim has always been to show America what is happening and then ask America, 'Is this what you believe in? Does this reflect your values?' I believe that if you show it to them and they see it and see children in cages and they see how they're treated and they hear the testimony of members of Congress and others, that they will take the appropriate action.""

McAleenan is the former acting commissioner for Customs and Border Protection. He began serving as the CBP commissioner in March 2018 before being elevated as the acting head of homeland security in April.

McAleenan simultaneously serves as CBP's acting commissioner.

The former agency secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, resigned from the post April 7 following a turbulent tenure at the post, and McAleenan was named as her replacement that day.

The ranking Republican for the House oversight committee, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, said McAleenan will likely touch on delays getting emergency, supplemental border aid from Congress. On Wednesday, McAleenan was visiting McAllen, Texas, for a close-up view of the CBP's largest immigration detention center.

Jordan said McAleenan will touch on his experience on that trip and his nearly 20 years as a CBP official to his testimony.

""I think Secretary McAleenan is going to talk about what they are doing, talk about the fact it would have been nice if 2.5 months ago when the president asked for the supplemental aid to deal with the crisis on the border ... if the Democrats would have helped us get the money then instead of saying the crisis was manufactured, it was contrived and when the real crisis got worse, trying to blame the president,"" he said.

North Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, another member of the House oversight committee, said he advised McAleenan to ""be very transparent and very forthcoming"" in Thursday's hearing.

""Hopefully, we'll be able to see what's being done, what has not being done and candidly what we can do as Congress to alleviate the crisis at the border,"" Meadows said. ""Not just from a humanitarian standpoint, but certainly from the influx of hundreds of thousands of people that we don't have the facilities nor the ability to handle properly.""

Cummings says he also wants to know how much the U.S. government is spending on the detention of children, which he said may cost as much as $350 a day. His panel also wants to know exactly how many children are being separated from their parents, he added.

The Maryland Democrat said while Republicans have accused Democrats of attacking Border Patrol agents, he said that's not the point. Rather, he wants his panel to get to the bottom of the border crisis.

Thursday's hearing comes amid a fight between Republicans and Democrats over which policies best deal with the humanitarian crisis at the border. The hearing also comes after dueling White House and congressional visits to evaluate conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border.

On Friday, a group of freshman House Democratic members delivered emotional testimony before the House oversight committee on those concerns. The lawmakers recently traveled with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus July 1 to the border to examine the conditions.

""We do have a crisis at our border, it is one of morality,"" Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said. ""As we have seen this current strategy unfold, intentional and cruelly created by the Trump administration, dead set on sending a hate-filled message that those seeking refuge are not welcome in America, in our America.""

Also on Friday, Vice President Pence and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., led a Republican congressional delegation to a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The visit delivered dramatic images of more than 300 detained men, some wearing disposable face masks, standing in cramped quarters behind chain-link fences.

""For [Second Lady] Karen [Pence] and me, it was frankly heart breaking, as parents, to talk to young children who told us of having walked two to three months up the Peninsula to cross into our country,"" Pence said after the visit to a detention facility. ""That has to change.""

This Friday, a bipartisan group of House members, led by Reps. Lloyd Smucker, R-Penn., and Dean Phillips, D-Minn., plan to visit points of entry, a Border Patrol station and a processing center. The group, known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, said they hope the fact-finding mission will lead to new solutions.

""The crisis at the border is one of the most pressing issues facing our nation and must be addressed by Congress,"" Smucker said in a statement. ""I am hopeful that the Problem Solvers Caucus can once again work together to put forth bipartisan solutions to this critical issue."""
"China will not use its Treasury holdings as a weapon against the US, says expert",https://www.cnbc.com,['Grace Shao'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/us-china-trade-war-beijing-will-not-weaponize-us-treasury-holdings.html,"The move fueled concerns that China, the largest foreign owner of U.S. Treasurys, could employ the so-called ""nuclear option"" — the ability to sell off its Treasury bonds and trigger a surge in interest rates that would damage the American economy.

As trade tensions between the two countries escalated in March, Beijing cut down its U.S. debt holdings at the fastest pace in about two years.

China has other ""weapons"" in its trade battle with the United States — and selling off its U.S. Treasury holdings will not be one of them, said Richard McGregor, senior fellow at think tank Lowy Institute.

If China were to do anything to the U.S. dollar, that would obviously hurt Chinese holdings of the U.S. dollar.

""Weaponizing"" U.S. Treasury holdings has always been a ""non-starter"" for Beijing, said McGregor.

""The Chinese current account deficit is now under 1% of GDP,"" he explained. ""If China were to do anything to the U.S. dollar, that would obviously hurt Chinese holdings of the U.S. dollar. And I also don't think they want to see the disruptive affect that will have.""

McGregor said China has other options in the trade battle.

""China can manage its economy, manage its entry to its economy,"" he said.

Beijing can manage foreign access to the Chinese economy, and decide whether to boost the presence of foreign firms or deny them further access.

More importantly, he said, people should be watching how Chinese private companies navigate their way through this difficult time, because the implications of their success will have a major impact on the Chinese economy.

""They're the big exporters, not state companies,"" said McGregor, author of ""Xi Jinping: The Backlash.""

""I think what we need to watch is how they sort of manage or limit the damage — that is if the trade war goes on, and particularly if we get another round of tariffs.""

Some of China's largest companies by market capitalization are along the eastern coast of the country: notably tech conglomerate Tencent in Shenzhen, tech behemoth Alibaba in Hangzhou, and various commercial banks in the Shanghai region.

McGregor said how some of those companies ride out the current crisis could offer clues to the health of the world's second largest economy.

""What happens to the private companies along the coast there, which are the sort of the real driving force of the Chinese economy, they could be really hurt,"" he said."

Senior Trump administration officials confirmed Tuesday that the vast majority of Bureau of Land Management headquarters staffers must leave Washington by the end of next year under the Interior Department’s reorganization plan.

In a 17-page letter to lawmakers, Joe Balash, Interior’s assistant secretary for land and minerals, detailed how the administration plans to move 84 percent of the agency’s headquarters staff west of the Rockies by the end of 2020. The relocation, which The Washington Post first outlined Monday, will move all but 60 Washington-based staffers, a sweeping change to the agency that manages more than 10 percent of America’s land.

“This implementation plan will delegate more responsibility and authority down to the field, optimize services available to the American people, is demonstrably cost-effective, and will provide an increased presence closer to the resources the BLM staff manages,” Balash wrote to Sen. Tom Udall (N.M.), the top Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and environment.

A total of 27 leadership jobs will be relocated to Grand Junction, Colo., about 60 miles south of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s childhood home of Rifle, “as part of an initiative to establish the Headquarters,” Balash said. Colorado will receive more reassigned positions than any state — 85.

Seventy-four of the reassigned employees will report to BLM state directors instead of headquarters staff, he said, and staffers will be reassigned to states including Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.

Although Balash provided an estimated cost benefit of the reassignments — at least $50 million over 20 years — there was no analysis of the price of the actual move beyond $5.6 million for the first 27 employees who volunteer.

[Interior to move most of Bureau of Land Management’s D.C. staff out west as part of larger reorganization push]

Hours before Interior formally notified Capitol Hill of the move, Balash and Casey Hammond, the principal deputy assistant secretary of land and minerals management — who has been running the bureau on an acting basis since May — provided employees with details about the reorganization.

According to a participant in the employee briefing at the agency’s office in Southeast Washington, the tension in the room was palpable as employees questioned what the move would mean for those with two-career families or other obligations that might tie them to Washington. The staffer spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation.

When Hammond declared “There is no need to panic,” the participant said, several people in the audience laughed.

“This announcement is deeply unsettling, and has created a lot of uncertainty for us,” the participant said. “The best part of my job is my co-workers, and they are working to tear us apart for purely political reasons. I’m sick to my stomach.”

Hammond and Balash emphasized the relocation would save the government money because the cost of living was cheaper out West and the lease on the BLM’s main building, in Southeast Washington, was set to expire. But one employee suggested in the meeting that staffers’ pay will also decline once they relocate and urged colleagues to write their member of Congress, prompting applause.

Other employees embraced the reorganization, according to the meeting participant, asking how early they can leave Washington.

Balash also said that officials are looking to relocate staffers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, but the department has not done as comprehensive an analysis of those moves.

Several lawmakers have already embraced the reorganization plan, including Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Republican Reps. Rob Bishop (Utah) and Scott R. Tipton (Colo.). In a statement Monday, Bishop said that he would work with Bernhardt to place the staffers moving to Utah in the right place.

“The BLM personnel will be moved where they will have a greater impact on, and input by, the people who live in the regions where their influence is greatest,” Bishop said. “Not by bureaucrats from thousands of miles away.”

But critics of the plan such as Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), who chairs the House Subcommittee on Interior, environment, and related agencies, said in a statement that it made no sense for the administration to unilaterally reorganize an agency when the president has yet to nominate a permanent director for the BLM after more than 2 1/2 years in office.

“After my discussion with Secretary Bernhardt this morning, serious questions remain: What are the benefits to the Interior Department and to the American public? What problem will this move solve? Why is BLM singled out for this move? How much will the move cost?” McCollum asked.

“Assuming the goal is to improve efficiency, streamline operations, and improve lines of communication,"" McCollum added, ""perhaps Mr. Bernhardt should prioritize securing a permanent director — which BLM has lacked for the duration of this administration — before the Department spends millions of taxpayer dollars playing musical chairs with employees’ lives.”

Kate Kelly, public lands director for the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, questioned in an email why the administration would reassign nearly all of the bureau’s D.C. staff when 95 percent of them already work out in the field.

“The true impact of this move is to make the agency and its leadership invisible in a city where — like it or not — the decisions about budgets and policies are made,” she said. “The constant shuffling, shrinking and disassembling of BLM’s workforce will have long-term implications for the health of the agency.”

In a telephone conference with reporters later in the afternoon, led by Balash and Susan Combs, the assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, another reason for the move was offered: eliminating travel costs to the District for westerners who meet with BLM officials.

“The American public interested in BLM can talk to a decision-maker without having to travel to the east coast,” Combs said. “I think it’s a disservice to the American public if we’re not there to give an answer on the spot.”

But the officials offered no analysis of how often westerners travel to Washington to meet with decision-makers, and at what cost. Similarly, they offered no cost analysis of flights by decision-makers to the West.

It is unclear what sort of congressional authorization is required to carry out the administration’s plan. When a BLM staffer raised the issue on Tuesday, Hammond replied that the department had already received the $5 million needed to carry out the initial stage of the move in May.

According to a Senate Appropriations aide, longstanding spending law guidelines — including ones included in Interior’s current funding bill — require the department “to notify and seek congressional approval of reorganization efforts . . . for certain actions, and do apply to this relocation effort."""
"Sanders, Omar call for Labor Department investigation of all US Amazon warehouses",https://www.cnet.com,['Ben Fox Rubin'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnet.com/news/sanders-omar-call-for-labor-department-investigation-of-all-amazon-warehouses/#ftag=CAD0610abe0f,"Ben Fox Rubin/CNET

A group of 13 members of Congress on Tuesday asked the Department of Labor to investigate all of Amazon's US warehouses, citing a long list of concerns about working conditions, labor violations, injuries and mistreatment.

The group is led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic candidate for president, and Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The members are all Democrats except Sanders, who's an independent, and include prominent party members including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard.

In a statement Tuesday, Sanders called on the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration to open an investigation immediately and ""prosecute those responsible to the fullest extent of the law.""

""People who work for a company owned by the wealthiest person in America should not have to risk their lives, health or well-being on the job,"" he said, referring to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. ""They must be treated with dignity and respect.""

Amazon shot back Tuesday, saying Sanders has an open invitation to visit its warehouses ""but to date has never stepped foot in one of our buildings."" The company said if Sanders had seen the facilities, he'd have learned that the company already implemented multiple layers of safety protocols at its warehouses. That work includes monthly employee surveys of safety, more than 1 million hours of safety training last year, and $55 million in safety improvement investments in the past year.

""The allegations outlined in this letter are not an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings,"" Amazon said, adding that people as young as 6 can tour the buildings to see for themselves.

Sanders rejected Amazon's suggestion, saying in a tweet Tuesday afternoon he preferred surprise inspections be conducted by the Labor Department.

""I am not interested in a photo op at an Amazon warehouse,"" Sanders' tweet said. ""I am calling for Labor Department inspectors to come in, unannounced, and do thorough investigations of the facilities where hundreds of workers have told me about horrendous conditions and abuse.""

The congressional request continues long-running criticisms of how Amazon operates its warehouses, with years of news reports detailing employees being overworked, closely monitored and forced to move faster. While Amazon has faced heavy criticism in the press and from several members of Congress, a comprehensive government report on its warehouse conditions hasn't happened.

Now playing: Watch this: For these women, working at Amazon while pregnant ends...

Sanders' criticisms follow his repeated attacks against Amazon last year, when he called on the company to raise its minimum wage. When it did in October, he congratulated it for making that change.

The congressional group sent a letter requesting an investigation during Prime Day, Amazon's annual summer sale. In its fifth year, Prime Day has started to garner plenty of negative attention, with protests going on across the US and Europe on Monday.

On Wednesday, a Department of Labor spokesperson said: ""OSHA has confirmed receipt of the letter. The agency is still reviewing the letter at this time.""

I stand in solidarity with the courageous Amazon workers engaging in a work stoppage against unconscionable working conditions in their warehouses. It is not too much to ask that a company owned by the wealthiest person in the world treat its workers with dignity and respect. https://t.co/GxagHx70pb — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) July 15, 2019

Amazon said Monday that Prime Day has ""become an opportunity for our critics, including unions, to raise awareness for their cause, in this case, increased membership dues."" The company has often mentioned that it raised its minimum wage to $15 last year and offers a comprehensive benefits package that includes paid education, parental leave and opportunities for promotion.

Amazon's roughly 300,000 US employees aren't represented by unions.

In Tuesday's letter to OSHA, the members of Congress outlined several workplace problems they want investigated, including a report from Mother Jones that highlighted hazardous warehouse floor conditions that can cause long-term injuries. The group said they've heard hundreds of stories directly from people who worked for Amazon that present extremely poor conditions for employees, including high temperatures, closely monitored productivity that causes workers to avoid bathroom breaks for fear of falling behind, mental health issues, and calls for a faster pace that ultimately lead to injuries.

One former worker, a Navy veteran, said, according to the letter: ""There was a point where I would find myself crying on my shift ... I really felt like I just didn't wanna be alive anymore.""

""This work environment creates a high risk of physical injuries, a risk increased by Amazon's intentional disregard for the health and safety of their employees,"" the letter said.

In addition to Omar, Sanders, Gabbard and Ocasio-Cortez, Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Deb Haaland, Ayanna Pressley, Barbara Lee, Jan Schakowsky, Ro Khanna, Al Green, Debbie Dingell and Andy Levin joined the call for an investigation and signed the letter to OSHA.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Lynn Bo Bo/AP Lynn Bo Bo/AP

The State Department said it has issued sanctions to four top military leaders in Myanmar over what it called ""gross human rights violations"" during the ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Rohingya Muslim minority.

Targets of the sanctions include the military's commander in chief Min Aung Hlaing, his deputy Soe Win, Brig. Gen. Than Oo and Brig. Gen. Aung Aung. The sanctions, which were announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday, mean the leaders and their immediate families are barred from entry into the United States.

""With this announcement, the United States is the first government to publicly take action with respect to the most senior leadership of the Burmese military,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""We designated these individuals based on credible information of these commanders' involvement in gross violations of human rights.""

A U.N. fact-finding mission said last year that the military ""took the lead in killing thousands of Rohingya civilians, as well as forced disappearances, mass gang rape and the burning of hundreds of villages."" It recommended that Min Aung Hlaing and other top leaders be tried for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

A spokesperson for the Myanmar military, Brig. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, told The New York Times that the new travel ban won't have much effect on the leaders.

""It doesn't matter that they banned travel to the United States for the generals,"" said the spokesperson. ""But it does insult the Myanmar military's dignity.""

Pompeo's statement said that Min Aung Hlaing ordered the release of his men convicted of killing a group of Rohingya men in Inn Din, which was the subject of a Reuters investigation that won the Pulitzer Prize. ""The Commander-in-Chief released these criminals after only months in prison, while the journalists who told the world about the killings in Inn Din were jailed for more than 500 days,"" Pompeo said. He called it an ""egregious example of the continued and severe lack of accountability for the military and its senior leadership.""

Fortify Rights, a human rights organization based in Southeast Asia, said the sanctions alone are ""not sufficient but a step toward more justice and accountability.""

""It is the military as an institution which needs to be targeted,"" Mark Farmaner, director of the advocacy group Burma Campaign UK, said in a tweet. ""The military will not change its behavior because a small number of its members have reduced holiday options."""
"3 blue states file suit against Treasury, IRS over state and local taxes workaround",https://www.cnn.com,['Donna Borak'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/blue-states-treasury-irs-salt-lawsuit/index.html,"Washington (CNN) New York, New Jersey and Connecticut aren't backing off from a legal fight with the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service.

The three blue states filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York challenging the constitutionality of the Trump administration's decision to block a workaround that would have helped high-tax areas to bypass a $10,000 limit on federal deductions for state and local taxes.

""The final IRS rule flies in the face of a century of federal tax law that says state choices to provide tax incentives for charitable donations do not affect the federal deductibility of those gifts,"" according to a joint statement released by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office.

In June, the Treasury Department finalized regulations that would bar individuals in high-tax states from creating charitable funds in exchange for state tax credits -- a maneuver developed as a workaround for changes to the treatment of state and local taxes under the 2017 tax reform

""The regulation is based on a longstanding principle of tax law: When a taxpayer receives a valuable benefit in return for a donation to charity, the taxpayer can deduct only the net value of the donation as a charitable contribution,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement.

Democratic lawmakers have repeatedly issued dire warnings about the limit, saying the measure primarily hurts Democratic-leaning states that tend to have taxpayers with higher incomes and higher home prices.

The controversial limit was a key revenue raiser in the $1.5 trillion tax code overhaul, which slashed tax rates for corporations and individuals.

This is not the first time these three states, along with Maryland, have challenged the deduction cap. In their latest lawsuit, the states argue that the rules violate the Administrative Procedure Act because they are inconsistent with federal tax law regulations about deducting charitable contributions.

""This is entirely unacceptable and as I've said before, the IRS should not be used as a political weapon,"" Cuomo said in the joint statement. ""The IRS regulations lack any basis in the law, upend decades of precedent without authorization from Congress, and target programs established by New York and other states to incentivize charitable contributions."""
DOJ: Antitrust ruling against Qualcomm could ‘put our nation’s security at risk’,https://www.cnet.com,['Shara Tibken'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnet.com/news/doj-says-antitrust-ruling-against-qualcomm-could-put-our-nations-security-at-risk/,"Stephen Shankland/CNET

The US Justice Department is weighing in on Qualcomm's appeal of a ruling that declared the chip giant to be a monopoly. And the government's citing national security and 5G leadership as reasons for an appeals court to let Qualcomm delay renegotiating its licensing contracts.

The Justice Department on Tuesday filed an amicus brief with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking the judges to grant Qualcomm a reprieve. The filing followed a request by Qualcomm last week that the appeals court grant a stay in remedies ordered by US District Court Judge Lucy Koh in May after she declared the wireless chip provider to be a monopoly.

At the time, Qualcomm said carrying out the remedies -- before the case went through the appeals process -- would be irreversible and would change its business model. The reforms included renegotiating licensing agreements previously reached with handset makers like LG, licensing wireless patents to rival chip makers and submitting to monitoring by the Federal Trade Commission. Qualcomm wanted the injunctions to be put on hold while the case made its way through the appeals process.

Now playing: Watch this: Powerful chipmaker Qualcomm is just too powerful, judge...

The Justice Department on Tuesday sided with Qualcomm, as did the US Department of Energy CIO Max Everett and Ellen Lord, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. They cited 5G and national security as reasons for granting Qualcomm's reprieve. The Justice Department also said Qualcomm will likely win an appeal that will overturn the May ruling. The group said Judge Koh ""misapplied Supreme Court precedent,"" and the ordered remedy is ""unprecedented.""

""The district court's ruling threatens competition, innovation and national security,"" the Justice Department said. ""Immediate implementation of the remedy could put our nation's security at risk, potentially undermining US leadership in 5G technology and standard-setting, which is vital to military readiness and other critical national interests.""

Everett said the Department of Energy ""believes that any remedy that causes undue financial strain on Qualcomm may result in undermining Qualcomm's position in the growing 5G market (among other telecommunications markets) and ceding to foreign entities, in particular China, a dominant position in the development and expansion of 5G technology."" He noted that Qualcomm plays a key role in US telecom infrastructure and supply chain, and its competitive position ""is critically important to the Department of Energy.""

And Lord of the Defense Department said that the department ""firmly believes that any measure that inappropriately limits Qualcomm's technological leadership, ability to invest in research and development (R&D), and market competitiveness, even in the short-term, could harm national security. The risks to national security include the disruption of DOD's supply chain and unsure US leadership in 5G.""

She added that the Defense Department believes Qualcomm is the market leader in wireless chips because of its expertise and R&D expenditure and that Qualcomm holds important Defense Department security clearance and contracts.

""A hobbled Qualcomm, without the ability to make significant investments in R&D, presents a serious threat to DOD's extensive networks, advanced telecommunications systems, and ultimately its ability to control the battlespace,"" Lord said.

This isn't the first time parts of the US government have jumped to Qualcomm's defense, even though it was a US government agency -- the FTC -- that brought the antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm two years ago.

President Donald Trump a year ago blocked Broadcom's proposed $117 billion acquisition of Qualcomm, saying the deal threatened to ""impair the national security"" of the US. Then in May, before Koh issued her ruling, the Justice Department asked for a hearing on Qualcomm's possible punishment if a California judge agreed with the FTC. The Justice Department said the court should carefully consider what remedy to carry out because it's worried about the US' position in the race to 5G.

Qualcomm and the FTC declined to comment.

Monopoly battle

Two years ago, the FTC accused Qualcomm of operating a monopoly in wireless chips. The FTC said Qualcomm forced customers like Apple to work exclusively with it and charged ""excessive"" licensing fees for its technology, in part by wielding a ""no license, no chips"" policy. Qualcomm's practices prevented rivals from entering the market, drove up the cost of phones and in turn hurt consumers, who faced higher handset prices, the FTC said.

Qualcomm argued the FTC's lawsuit was based on ""flawed legal theory"" and that customers choose its chips because they're the best. It also argued that competition is fierce in the mobile chip market and that Qualcomm never stopped providing processors to customers, even when they'd been arguing over licenses.

The parties faced off in an 11-day trial in January. In May, Koh ruled in the FTC's favor, saying Qualcomm was a monopoly that illegally hurt competitors in the wireless chip market. The ruling, which came four months after the trial ended, said Qualcomm must change how it does business and renegotiate license deals with its customers. To hold the company accountable, the court said Qualcomm must also submit compliance and monitoring reports for the next seven years and report to the FTC on an annual basis.

""Qualcomm's licensing practices have strangled competition in the CDMA and premium LTE modem chip markets for years, and harmed rivals, OEMs, and end consumers in the process,"" Koh wrote in her ruling in May.

The ruling came as a surprise to Qualcomm and others in the mobile market. For Qualcomm, the verdict called into question the company's entire business model. While it sells processors that connect devices to mobile networks, it also generates a significant percentage of its revenue from licensing. If it can't collect royalties based on the value of a handset -- which it had done in the past -- it will generate less money and may have to rethink its model entirely. Even though it's appealing the ruling, Qualcomm's licensees likely will try to alter their contracts.

Koh, in her ruling, said Qualcomm can't force a customer to sign a license before it'll supply that company with chips. It ""must negotiate or renegotiate license terms with customers in good faith under conditions free from the threat of lack of access to or discriminatory provision of modem chip supply or associated technical support or access to software.""

Though Qualcomm likely won't have to renegotiate its new agreement with Apple -- the two settled their long-running licensing and patent disputes during opening arguments in a May trial -- it'll have to offer other customers the chance to change their terms.

Qualcomm's appeal

Qualcomm filed a motion last week with the US Appeals Court for the Ninth Circuit, asking the court to grant a stay because carrying out the actions would ""fundamentally change the way it has done business for decades."" If the appeals court ultimately finds in Qualcomm's favor, the chip giant said, the company won't be able to undo the changes it's made. Qualcomm also filed a request for an expedited briefing and hearing for the appeal.

""This court has repeatedly found that a stay is warranted when -- as here -- an injunction imposes changes on a party's business practices and commercial arrangements that cannot be undone by this court's later reversal of the district court's judgment,"" Qualcomm said in its filing requesting the stay. ""There is no basis to depart from that settled, sound practice.""

Qualcomm also invoked the global race to 5G and the US' priority to lead when it comes to the super fast, next-generation technology.

""Unless stayed, the injunction will significantly impair an American company that is the worldwide leader in the development of cellular technologies, at a critical moment in the development of the worldwide standards for next-generation 5G cellular systems, thereby forfeiting the lead to foreign interests,"" Qualcomm's filing said.

The company said firms are already are trying to renegotiate their contracts with Qualcomm and noted it ""will be forced to negotiate under the cloud of an injunction requiring it to accept terms to which it would not otherwise agree.""

Wireless networking gear giant Ericsson -- one of the companies that testified in the January trial -- also filed an amicus brief in Qualcomm's favor on Monday. The wireless networking gear giant argued that the district court's order requiring Qualcomm to license its standard essential patents to other chipmakers, as well as the requirement it renegotiate its current licenses, ""threatens to disrupt the stability and predictability necessary to permit 5G investments to go forward.""

""The district court's injunction substantially alters the status quo governing Qualcomm's relationship with other players in the cellular phone industry,"" Ericsson said. ""Requiring Qualcomm to negotiate new licenses and to re-negotiate existing licenses -- with the expectation (realistic or not) that it could seek to re-negotiate those agreements if it wins its appeal -- creates an unacceptable level of uncertainty in the industry and threatens significant disruption that should be avoided by maintaining the status quo pending appeal.""

State Department bureaucratic bloat undercuts Syria and Islamic State strategies,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/state-department-bureaucratic-bloat-undercuts-syria-and-islamic-state-strategies,"AMUDEH, Syria — On the day I left Syria, Special Envoy James Jeffrey visited to try to sell local leaders on his proposal for a buffer zone between Syrian Kurds and Turkey. America’s Kurdish allies listened politely, but confused. For the past 11 months, Jeffrey has been the “special representative for Syria Engagement and special envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.” The Syrian Defense Forces were the tip of the spear to defeat ISIS and were largely successful. Their civilian counterpart, the Syrian Democratic Council, runs northeastern Syria generally with tolerance and efficiency on very little income. Schools operate, municipalities pick up garbage, and the region even boasts its own cellphone company.

To unravel that stability and security in a flawed attempt to appease Turkey is unwise. It is also not clear it is consensus U.S. policy.

Over the last several decades, special envoy positions have proliferated for the simple reason that the State Department bureaucracy can suffocate policy implementation. Under normal circumstances, the State Department is slow and unwieldy. The bureaucracy is byzantine and beset by petty turf fights that undercut cooperation to a common cause. Nor does every issue conform neatly to preexisting bureaucracy. The fight against ISIS, for example, initially involved Syria and Iraq (two different State Department desks), and coalition affairs mandated interactions with Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, among other countries.

Still, most State Department reform efforts single out the proliferation of special envoys that often impose a bureaucracy upon an existing bureaucracy. A 2001 Council on Foreign Relations’ Independent Task Force report , for example, called on the State Department to “Reduce appointment and use of special envoys.” A separate Brookings Institution report the same year also found negatives to outweigh positives regarding special envoys. “Such innovations may provide political cover against charges that the administration is ignoring a foreign policy issue critical to a vocal constituency,” Clinton administration National Security Council officials Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay wrote , “but they undercut the nation’s diplomatic establishment.”

Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson targeted the envoy positions in his anemic reform attempts, but his successor Mike Pompeo resurrected many positions. In September 2018, career Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne authored a Wilson Center report finding “the use of stand-alone special envoys or representatives should remain limited to a few roles of high importance and be well integrated into existing 'bureaus' and interagency structures. Otherwise, these ‘specials’ will likely add to the silos and bureaucratic infighting that have long complicated efforts to produce and implement a coherent foreign policy, and they can contribute to fragmented international policy.”

Back to Syria and Iraq: While Jeffrey is a special envoy, he is of equal rank to Joel Rayburn , deputy assistant secretary for Levant Affairs and special envoy for Syria. Add into the mix William Roebuck , deputy special envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and senior adviser to the special representative for Syria engagement who, grandiose title aside, acts as an informal ambassador often resident in northeastern Syria. Perhaps such special envoys were needed for the year plus in which Sen. Tim Kaine prevented a confirmation vote on the Trump administration’s pick to be assistant secretary of state for near Eastern affairs. But David Schenker assumed his post last month and so in theory should also oversee Levant policy.

It’s not just the State Department that is confused. Surveying senior Iraqi officials in Baghdad and Syrian Kurdish officials at a counter-ISIS conference in Amudeh, Syria, earlier this month, few officials had a clear notion of which American officials were in charge and whether the emphases of each interlocutor were personal or reflective of policy. In short, Iraqis and Syrian officials say some U.S. officials are pro-Turkish, others seem to emulate Lawrence of Arabia in their infatuation with Arab tribal politics, and others still are relatively seeking to make their voices heard.

The bottom line is Syria policy is broken, but the proliferation of diplomats taking charge only makes matters worse. Every additional envoy or diplomat working on Syria and Iraq gives Syrian and Iraqi officials a reason for confusion or an excuse to feign confusion. Five years ago, it may have made sense for the Obama administration to embrace a special envoy position to defeat the ISIS but, with that group no longer controlling territory, it makes far more sense to return to a more traditional State Department structure.

Certainly it is ironic that, for all the criticism that Trump made of President Barack Obama and Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry during his campaign, Trump's team appears intent on replicating their bureaucratic bloat at the expense of effective policy creation and execution.

EPA hails Trump's work on reducing air pollution,https://thehill.com,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453601-epa-hails-trumps-work-on-reducing-air-pollution,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pointed to a new study released Wednesday to emphasize what it characterized as the Trump administration’s achievements in decreasing air pollution.

The report showed that emissions from all six measured criteria air pollutants decreased between 2016 and 2018, the years Trump has been in office.

It hailed this as part of decades-long trend of falling pollution rates that began in 1970, when the Clean Air Act was implemented. The results of the annual national air quality report showed that the emissions of six key pollutants dropped by 74 percent in that time period. The pollutants measured do not include carbon dioxide or methane, known greenhouse gases.

A statement from EPA added that the U.S. economy has grown 275 percent since 1970.

“They are taking credit for long term improvements in air quality that are results of regulations we’ve had in place for many years,” said Gretchen Goldman, research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The way they frame it is we’ve mostly seen improvements of air toxics emissions, but at the same time they are doing that, they are changing policies that will actually make it worsen air toxics emissions.”

Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Paris climate deal since entering the White House.

The administration in the last year also replaced former President Obama’s Clean Power Plan for regulating emissions from power plants and revoked the “once in, always in policy,” which loosened regulatory compliance standards for certain sources of air pollution previously considered “major.”

“Despite EPA’s press release spin, reductions in air pollution during the Trump administration have stalled, while the Department of Energy estimates C02 emissions alone actually spiked in 2018, something Administrator Wheeler and his agency conveniently failed to mention, of course,” said Alex Formuzis, a spokesperson for the Environmental Working Group.

Critics say the damage from Trump’s policies are unlikely to be measured for some time.

“This is a long-term thing, you don’t see improvements and declines with a quick turn around, the way the process is, it’s a science based policy, often when you change a policy it’s years till you see the outcome, Goldman said.

Goldman pointed to the Obama administration’s 2015 ozone rule. Industry compliance results for that rule weren’t measured and released until this year.

“It’s going to be a while until we see the public impact of that but it’s 100 percent coming,” she said.

"US Treasury yields lower amid weaker housing data, trade concerns",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/17/us-treasury-yields-tick-lower-amid-renewed-trade-concerns.html,"U.S. government debt yields fell on Wednesday amid weaker-than-expected housing data and following President Donald Trump's Tuesday comments that there is still a ""long way to go"" on trade talks with China.

At around 4:00 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note , which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 2.052%, while the yield on the 2-year Treasury note yielded 1.82%.

The Commerce Department said in a report on Wednesday that U.S. homebuilding fell for a second straight month in June and permits slumped to a two-year low, hinting at a softer housing market despite lower mortgage rates.

The government said that housing starts decreased 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.253 million units last month as a plunge in multi-family homebuilding dragged on the data. The sector has hit a soft patch in recent quarters and likely subtracted from GDP in the second quarter.

Builder confidence, meanwhile, ticked up just one point in July to 65, according to a Tuesday report from the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI).

""Builders report solid demand for single-family homes. However, they continue to grapple with labor shortages, a dearth of buildable lots and rising construction costs that are making it increasingly challenging to build homes at affordable price points relative to buyer incomes,"" said NAHB Chairman Greg Ugalde, a homebuilder and developer from Torrington, Connecticut.

Trade worries have also kept Treasurys in demand after President Donald Trump raised doubts on the trade progress between China and the U.S. and renewed threats to slap tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods."
"Justice Department ends inquiry of hush-money payments in final months of Donald Trump's campaign, judge says",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kristine Phillips', 'Kevin Johnson', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/17/doj-ends-investigation-hush-payments-involving-donald-trump-michael-cohen/1755046001/,"CLOSE President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid money to women to be quiet about alleged affairs with Trump during his 2016 campaign. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Federal prosecutors in New York concluded their investigation of hush-money payments Donald Trump's former personal lawyer orchestrated to quiet potential sex scandals in the final months of his presidential campaign, a judge said Wednesday.

The notice, contained in a brief order issued Wednesday by U.S. District Judge William Pauley, was an unceremonious end to an inquiry that implicated the president.

Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he engineered payments to two women who claimed to have had extramarital affairs with Trump to silence them before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors in New York said those payments violated federal campaign finance laws, and they and Cohen said Trump directed his lawyer to arrange the payments.

Pauley revealed the end of the investigation as part of an order in which he instructed the government to make public some of the search warrants it used when investigating Cohen, who pleaded guilty to two campaign finance violations for the payments, as well as a set of other felonies. He is serving a three-year prison sentence.

“We are pleased that the investigations surrounding these ridiculous campaign finance allegations is now closed,” Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said Wednesday. “We have maintained from the outset that the president never engaged in any campaign finance violation.”

Between the New York inquiry and the special counsel investigation of Russian election interference, which concluded in March, Trump has spent nearly all of his presidency under scrutiny from federal prosecutors. Now that the campaign finance inquiry is closed, Sekulow said he knew of no other federal investigations in which Trump is a subject.

Pauley's announcement signals the end of a criminal investigation in which authorities examined Trump and his private business, the Trump Organization. Typically, prosecutors do not announce the end of an investigation or agree to provide details about their work if they intend to pursue additional charges.

One of Cohen's lawyers, Lanny Davis, reacted with dismay. ""Why is Michael Cohen ... the only member of the Trump company to be prosecuted and imprisoned?"" he said. ""Especially since prosecutors found that virtually all of Michael’s admitted crimes were done at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald Trump? Why?”

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Prosecutors had asked to keep documents under seal, indicating that the investigation into the campaign finance violations was ongoing. Pauley said they changed that position in a sealed filing Monday, and as a result, the search warrant materials should become public.

“The campaign finance violations discussed in the Materials are a matter of national importance. Now that the Government’s investigation into those violations has concluded, it is time that every American has an opportunity to scrutinize the Materials,” Pauley wrote.

Pauley ordered the government to make the information public Thursday morning.

Cohen and federal prosecutors said he arranged payments to two women in the final months of Trump's 2016 campaign: Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal and pornographic actress Stormy Daniels.

Trump denied the affairs and said he did not know about the payments.

Prosecutors said in a court filing Cohen participated in an agreement involving a tabloid to “suppress” McDougal’s story and “prevent it from influencing the election.” The agreement involved “Corporation-1,” which agreed in August 2016 to buy McDougal’s story for $150,000. The description of ""Corporation-1"" matches public description of the National Enquirer

The Enquirer's parent company acknowledged in an agreement with prosecutors that it made the payment because McDougal's story could have jeopardized Trump's campaign.

Cohen arranged a separate payment – spending $130,000 out of his own pocket – to Daniels, who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Trump in 2006. Prosecutors said Trump’s business reimbursed Cohen for his payment to Daniels, added $130,000 to pay for Cohen’s taxes and $60,000 as a bonus. Prosecutors said the payments were disguised as legal bills.

Cohen said during congressional testimony in February that his former boss masterminded the “cover-up” of the payments to Daniels and directed him to lie about them, including to first lady Melania Trump. He presented the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee with a copy of a personal check that he said Trump signed during the first year of his presidency to reimburse him for the payments. Cohen said the check, which was for $35,000, was one of 11 installments.

Cohen said the other checks were signed by Donald Trump Jr. and Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's finance chief.

During an FBI raid in April 2018, investigators sought bank records and other information on payments to Daniels and McDougal. Court records revealed that the investigation went far beyond the hush-money payments and that the FBI had been looking broadly into financial crimes by Cohen.

Cohen's statements to Congress led to a congressional investigation of Trump's finances. The oversight committee sought to obtain copies of Trump's financial records in its investigation on whether Trump incorrectly reported his finances in government disclosure forms, whether he has undisclosed conflicts of interest and whether he complied with the emoluments clause, which prohibits a president from receiving payments from foreign governments.

Cohen, who had vowed to ""take a bullet"" for Trump, called his former boss a ""racist,"" a ""con man"" and a ""cheat.""

""I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your fixer, Mr. Trump,"" Cohen said.

The president castigated Cohen, saying he was lying to reduce his prison time.

U.S. State Department official suspected of DUII in Bend,https://www.oregonlive.com,['Bend Bulletin'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/07/us-state-department-official-suspected-of-duii-in-bend.html,"A senior official with the U.S. State Department was arrested this month on suspicion of drunken driving after crashing her vehicle while returning from a wedding.

Susan A. Phalen was arrested July 6 on suspicion of DUII and reckless driving near Central Oregon Community College. As of Tuesday, she had not been charged with a crime, according to the Oregon Judicial Information Network.

At 10:39 p.m., dispatch received a report of a single-vehicle rollover crash on Mt. Washington Drive. Bend police Officer Matthew Baldwin arrived to find a 2019 Land Rover Discovery on its side in the middle of the northbound lane and Phalen sitting on the curb with a COCC campus security officer standing near her, according to court documents.

Baldwin said he “immediately” noticed numerous signs of impairment in Phalen, such as watery and bloodshot eyes, slurred and slow speech.

She allegedly needed help standing, according to court records.

Phalen reportedly told the officer she had been returning to her Airbnb after a wedding in Tumalo. Unfamiliar with the area, she attempted to follow her navigation by making a left turn when she rolled her vehicle.

The nearest road was Regency Drive, about one-eighth of a mile up the road, Baldwin said.

Phalen reportedly admitted to drinking margaritas at the wedding, but refused to perform roadside sobriety tests or take a breath test for alcohol, according to court records.

“I have no comment,” Phalen told The Bulletin when reached.

Phalen, 49, of Alexandria, Virginia, is listed as a senior adviser for external affairs for the State Department, according the department’s current directory. Her career in government stretches to the 1990s and has included stints as communication director for the House Homeland Security Committee and before that, the House Intelligence Committee. More recently, she was director of external affairs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to her LinkedIn page.

Phalen made headlines last year when a fellow press secretary left FEMA, citing in his resignation letter a “boys club” mentality that excluded Phalen.

Phalen resigned from FEMA in early 2018.

"Veterans Affairs abandoned 200,000+ health care applications this year",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/veterans-affairs-abandoned-200-000-health-care-applications-this-year/VR5zYSyyBn0LnTndnE2x1L/,"An arm of the Veterans Affairs Department in Atlanta eliminated 208,272 applications from across the country for health care early this year amid efforts to shrink a massive backlog of requests, saying they were missing signatures or information about military service and income, according to records reviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Veterans groups say the VA should have done more to communicate with the veterans before closing their applications, some of which date back to 1998. Troops face additional challenges in applying for VA health care, they said, as they grapple with reentry into civilian life, change addresses following overseas deployments and suffer from combat stress.

In the middle of the controversy is the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, the Atlanta office that oversees the process by which veterans seek access to the VA medical system. It and its parent agency have come under intense scrutiny in recent years for mismanagement and delays in providing medical care, presenting a thorny challenge for the administration of President Donald Trump, who focused on veterans’ care during his presidential campaign.

As of April, 8.8 million veterans were enrolled in the VA’s health care system, the agency’s records show. The VA said it enrolled 395,417 people in its health care system and rejected 98,897 in the fiscal year ending in September. Its backlog of pending applications totaled 317,157 in April, down from a high of 886,045 last year, according to records the VA sent the AJC.

That current backlog is still “way too high,” said Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based advocacy group. He suggested additional collaboration between the VA and veteran service groups could shrink it more.

“Something is not quite working right if we are not getting that number lower than it is,” he said. “We need to be working together to get that number down.”

Butler joined Adrian Atizado, deputy national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity based in Kentucky, in criticizing the VA’s efforts to reach the veterans before rejecting and closing their 208,272 applications.

The VA sent out one rejection letter to each of those applicants in 2016. In 2017, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers — including Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson — urged the VA to send the applicants an additional letter clarifying what missing information they needed to turn in. The lawmakers were responding to allegations that a coding error caused the VA to send veterans incorrect letters about what they still needed to submit.

The VA said it opted against sending an additional letter after its Office of Inspector General determined there was no such error and that the letters it sent in 2016 were appropriate and complied with federal law.

Isakson, who leads the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, was unavailable for an interview, according to an aide. But his spokeswoman said the VA took Isakson’s recommendation to have the inspector general review the issue and then briefed the senator’s committee about its decision to close the applications.

Atizado called the VA’s decision to send just one letter to the applicants in 2016 before closing their cases this year “quite unfortunate.”

“When we hear about the VA not taking a more thoughtful approach to a situation like this — when they only send one letter because they have an incomplete application — I think we all should be expecting our government and this administration to do better by our veterans,” he said.

The VA said veterans may reapply for health care. The agency said it is now striving to contact people about incomplete applications up to six times each with phone calls and letters. Its Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, meanwhile, has added 115 employees since July of 2016.

The 208,272 eliminated cases didn’t receive such treatment, though. That also has drawn renewed criticism from Scott Davis, a VA employee and whistleblower who testified before Congress in 2014 about problems at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, located off Clairmont Road.

“This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits,” Davis wrote in an article for the Washington Examiner in May.

Defending its decision, the VA pointed to a federal law that says applications that remain incomplete for a year cannot be approved.

“In accordance with federal law, VA closed 208,272 incomplete health care enrollment applications between January and February,” the VA said in a prepared statement. “It would have been illegal for VA to keep the applications open.”

Davis disputed that, saying the law doesn’t say anything about closing applications. In an interview, he accused the VA of “purging applications under a law that does not give them the authority to do so.”

Asked how many of the 208,272 applications the agency closed were from former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients and combat veterans, the VA told the AJC that the newspaper would have to file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for that information. The AJC did that last month and its request is still pending.

In the interview, former EPA head Gina McCarthy expected the Trump administration’s backwardness on climate change—but not on no-brainers like limits on power plant mercury emissions and auto industry regulation, both of which were being complied with. “They’re just obsessed with undoing everything Obama did. You can tell this with Trump. He’s still somehow campaigning against Obama.” McCarthy was the EPA’s administrator from 2013 to 2017, and now teaches at the Harvard School of Public Health.

USDA: More than half of eligible workers refuse assignment to Kansas City,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/usda-researchers-kansas-city-relocate/index.html,"Washington (CNN) More than half of the employees from two research agencies at the Department of Agriculture slated to relocate from the Washington area have refused reassignment to Kansas City, the department said Wednesday.

Such losses among the research employees affected by the reassignment could result in a drain of institutional knowledge and talent at two agencies that either fund agricultural research across the nation or produce crucial reports, including data on agricultural markets,10-year projections for the farm sector and estimates of US and international agricultural productivity.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and the department have argued that the move will lower living costs, save taxpayer dollars and move the agencies closer to ""stakeholders."" But many employees at the two affected agencies -- the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) -- view the change as politically driven and a way to disrupt climate research and other work with which their bosses disagree by pushing out experienced personnel

At ERS, 72 researchers accepted relocation while 99 either declined or did not provide a response. At NIFA, 73 workers accepted reassignment while 151 declined or did not provide a response, according to a USDA spokesperson. These numbers, which could fluctuate, are also in line with a survey released last week by the union representing NIFA and ERS employees. Staff must report to work in Kansas City by September 30.

Employees from both agencies turned their backs to Perdue in protest at an all-hands meeting last month when he announced the final location for the move.

"In Eric Garner case, Justice Department declines civil rights charges against New York City police officer",https://www.foxnews.com,['Lucia Suarez Sang'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-will-not-pursue-charges-against-cop-involved-in-eric-garners-death-source,"Despite disagreement between top prosecutors regarding the strength of the case, the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday ultimately declined to bring civil rights charges against the New York City police officer involved in the controversial and racially-charged death of Eric Garner -- with Attorney General Bill Barr stepping in to make the ultimate decision, a person familiar with the case confirmed to Fox News.

Garner, who was black, died in 2014 during his arrest for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes outside a Staten Island convenience store. The 43-year-old refused to be handcuffed, and cops -- including the white officer who the DOJ declined to prosecute -- took him down.

A senior justice official familiar with the case told Fox News the DOJ's Civil Rights Division recommended charges be brought against officer Daniel Pantaleo -- but the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York disagreed, saying the government's burden of proof could not be met.

Ultimately, the decision fell to Barr, who broke the tie and made the final call not to bring charges after several briefings with lawyers on both sides of the issue and after viewing the video of the arrest gone awry on numerous occasions.

In the video, taken by a bystander, Garner was heard crying out “I can’t breathe” at least 11 times before he fell unconscious. The phrase has since become a rallying cry among those protesting perceived racial injustices perpetrated by police departments nationwide.

FLASHBACK: ERIC GARNER CHOKEHOLD DEATH: NO INDICTMENT FOR NYPD COP, DOJ TO OPEN CIVIL RIGHTS PROBE

The decision not to bring charges against Pantaleo comes a day before the statute of limitations was set to expire, marking five years since the encounter that led to Garner’s death.

A state grand jury has also refused to indict the officer on criminal charges. Civil rights prosecutors have advocated charges in the case, though they've met fierce resistance.

Garner's family and attorney were informed of a decision Tuesday morning. During a press conference later with the Rev. Al Sharpton, Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, demanded the police department act immediately to fire Pantaleo.

""We are here with heavy hearts because the DOJ has failed us,"" she said. ""Five years ago my son said he couldn't breathe 11 times. Today we can't breathe because they have let us down.""

She added: ""We will keep pushing. This is not the end. We are asking the commissioner to make the right decision.""

An attorney for the family said the DOJ's failure to bring charges against Pantaleo was a ""national shame"" and said every candidate running for president will need to take a position on this case.

Chokeholds are banned under police policy and, though Pantaleo maintained he used a different and legal takedown maneuver called the “seatbelt,” the medical examiner’s office has said a chokehold contributed to Garner’s death.

But, according to a senior Department of Justice official, prosecutors still felt they couldn't reach the bar for proving Pantaleo or other officers acted ""willfully"" during the physical confrontation.

""What's communicated to the officer is relevant, but it is not determinative to what was going through the officer's mind,"" the official said.

ERICA GARNER, DAUGHTER OF NYPD CHOKEHOLD VICTIM, DIES AFTER SUFFERING HEART ATTACK

Part of the Department's thinking in the matter relied on Supreme Court precedent, specifically, the case 'Graham v. Connor,' in which the high court ruled ""not every push or shove violates the Fourth Amendment"" and the fact that police officers must make ""split-second decisions"" has to be taken into account.

The particular test that could not be met was whether the officers -- and Pantaleo in particular -- carried out their actions ""willfully,"" the official said. To meet that burden, the government would have been required to prove officers were acting with ""some clarity of thought.""

""We expect a different outcome when a member of the public comes in contact with a police officer,"" a senior DOJ official said. ""But the decision to bring federal charges is a different matter.""

The New York Police Department brought Pantaleo up on departmental charges earlier this year. An administrative judge has not ruled whether he violated policy. He could face dismissal, but Police Commissioner James O’Neill has the final say. O'Neill will not make a formal decision until the police administrative judge who oversaw the disciplinary trial renders her verdict, the New York Times reported.

The NYPD said in a tweet on Tuesday that the internal department disciplinary case against Pantaleo is ""proceeding and a determination has NOT yet been made.""

""Today's announcement by the US Department of Justice does not affect this process,"" it said.

None of the other police officers involved in Garner's death have been charged with a crime or disciplined by the Police Department.

""All the officers involved need to be off the books. The steers of New York City are not safe with them,"" Carr said. ""Five years ago, it was my family. Tomorrow it could be yours... We are going to keep fighting. This will not be swept under the rug.""

In the years since Garner’s death, Pantaleo has remained on the job but not in the field, and activists have decried the fact he's still being issued paychecks that include union-negotiated raises.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement that the city put their faith in the federal government to act on possible charges against Pantaleo and that they ""won't make that mistake again.""

""New York City is not the same city it was five years ago. We are a different city, and we must act like a different city,"" he said. ""Moving forward, we will not wait for the federal government to commence our own disciplinary proceedings.""

The city of New York also reached a civil settlement with Garner's family in 2015 for $5.9 million.

"A Revere veteran’s legal marijuana job cost him a VA loan. Now, Congress is stepping in",https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2019/07/16/fought-good-fight-revere-veteran-shocked-congress-cared-about-his-home-loan-rejection-over-legal-marijuana-job/kPnw9QCisvNtgvUshzwXeJ/story.html,"It was validation for the 35-year-old disabled Army veteran from Revere. He never imagined that anyone would care that the Veterans Administration had rejected his home loan application in January, just as his family was set to move, because the VA disapproved of his job managing a marijuana store.

The US House of Representatives passed your amendment, said the caller from Representative Katherine Clark’s office. Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.

But now, the House had shown it agreed that the veteran should have received his earned benefit. On Friday, it passed a measure banning the VA from considering veterans’ income from state-approved cannabis industries as a reason to deny them their benefit of a low-rate home loan guarantee with no money down.

“I’m blown away — I can’t believe it,” said the veteran, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his military relationship. “It’s cool because we fought the good fight and something really went the way it should go.”

In January, after the veteran’s house purchase fell through at the last moment because of the VA’s rejection, he contacted his congresswoman, Clark. She filed the amendment to ban the VA’s practice as part of the larger defense budget. Separately, she sent a letter, signed by 20 lawmakers, to the VA requesting more policy details in light of the veteran’s case. The letter noted that more than 211,000 people work in the legal cannabis trade nationwide, which generates $11 billion in sales per year.

“The cannabis industry is a growing part of our economy and no one, let alone our veterans, should be penalized for being part of it,” Clark said in a statement Friday after the House vote. “The passage of this amendment ensures that our service members receive the benefits they deserve while modernizing the policies of the VA.”

The VA did not respond to a request for comment, but previously said it would reply directly to the lawmakers.

Because the Senate had already passed its version of the defense budget, a joint committee will determine whether the measure will be included in the bill that lands on President Trump’s desk.

The Revere veteran’s experience highlights one of the many ways that veterans and others can get caught between federal marijuana prohibition and states that have legalized pot.

Some veterans have reported a loss of benefits or being labeled unemployable as a result of consuming marijuana or working in the legal marijuana industry. Many veterans who find medical relief from pot say they’re financially overburdened and medically underserved because the VA doesn’t discuss or cover the drug as it does with other medications, including opioids.

The Revere veteran started working in the cannabis industry after finding that medical marijuana helped ease his chronic pain resulting from tearing both shoulders in a military training exercise. The cannabis also allowed him to get off opioids, he said, which made him “a shell of myself.”

Last year, he became the assistant manager of a marijuana retailer, now one of the state’s 22 pot shops. He loves helping patients find relief. The job gives him fulfillment that he’d missed since the Army.

In January, when he learned why the VA rejected his home loan, the veteran vented to his coworkers. One of his colleagues connected him to a mortgage company that helped him secure a reduced-rate home loan that he could afford.

The veteran and his family are no longer crammed into a tiny apartment or his parents’ home. Last week, they moved into their new house: a yellow four-bedroom in Dracut with a sunroom, white countertops, and a huge backyard perfect for his three children.

“It’s a dream come true,” the veteran said. “It’s a bigger, better, beautiful house. Maybe everything happens for a reason.”

State Department looking at redirecting Central American aid to Guaido,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/state-department-northern-triangle-funding-guaido/index.html,"(CNN) A State Department spokesperson confirmed to CNN Wednesday that the State Department is looking to redirect some funding originally designated for the Northern Triangle -- Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- to embattled Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido.

""Working with Congress, we are exploring reprogramming some of the funding towards promoting democracy in Venezuela, including supporting the interim Guaido government and National Assembly,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

The United States and dozens of other nations have backed Guaido in his bid to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. However, almost six months after the US recognized the opposition leader, Maduro remains in power.

""Our programming, existing and planned, is targeted to address the Venezuela crisis. We are investing in good governance, human rights, technical assistance for the Guaido government, independent media, and civil society,"" they said. ""The principle objective of our funding for Venezuela aligns with our principle policy objective: to restore democracy to Venezuela.""

The spokesperson said that none of the funding being reprogrammed is humanitarian assistance; it all falls under development assistance. They noted that the State Department ""regularly adjusts funding as priorities evolve"" and that it is ""technical process tied to our strategic planning so that we spend taxpayer dollars responsibly and in line with Administration priorities.""

"EPA pushed for tighter, more enforceable PolyMet water permit",https://www.duluthnewstribune.com,['Jimmy Lovrien'],,,,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/energy-and-mining/3976773-EPA-pushed-for-tighter-more-enforceable-PolyMet-water-permit,"A newly released Environmental Protection Agency memo shows the federal agency continued to urge the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to set stiffer standards on its water permit later given to PolyMet, the company looking to build the first copper-nickel mine in Minnesota, up until two days before the water permit was issued to the company.

The memo, first given to the Minneapolis Star Tribune by the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704, which represents EPA employees in the midwest, was written by Kevin Pierard, chief of the NPDES Programs Branch and dated Dec. 18, 2018. The MPCA issued its water and air permits to PolyMet on Dec. 20.

Pierard outlines concerns and comments made by EPA staffers reviewing a draft of PolyMet’s national pollutant discharge elimination system, or NPDES, permit, which regulates water discharged from industrial activities.

In the memo, Pierard explains the EPA urged the MPCA to require water quality based effluent limits, or WQBELs, in its permit to PolyMet, instead of operating limits, which the federal agency said are less enforceable.

Opponents of PolyMet argue the project could send tainted runoff into the St. Louis River watershed and Lake Superior.

WQBELs set standards on pollutants discharged into the environment and are enforceable under the Clean Water Act and apply at the discharge point where dilution may occur.

But instead of requiring PolyMet to follow those standards, the MPCA plans to regulate contaminants such as arsenic, cobalt, lead, nickel and mercury with operating limits, which the state agency said is “more conservative and protective” than WQBELs because operating limits are measured prior to discharge and don’t require dilution, MPCA spokesperson Darin Broton said in an email to the News Tribune Wednesday.

But the EPA memo maintains operating limits are more difficult to enforce.

“Unlike WQBELs and (technology-based effluent limitations), internal ‘operating’ limits may lack a clear regulatory connection to controlling surface water discharges,” Pierard wrote, acknowledging that EPA lawyers determined PolyMet’s operating limits set by the MPCA are still “arguably federally enforceable.”

But he added, “We note that federal enforceability of these operating limits is less certain and more complex than if these limits were established as WQBELs.”

Broton said the MPCA did not find “reasonable potential” for discharge to exceed water quality standards in the receiving water, which would have required a WQBELs.

“PolyMet’s proposed reverse osmosis treatment is extremely effective in removing pollutants,” Broton said. “Using this data, staff did not find that the discharge had reasonable potential to result in an exceedance in the water quality standards and therefore needed WQBEL.”

Paula Maccabee, counsel and advocacy director of WaterLegacy, an environmental group opposed to PolyMet, has long argued WQBELs for PolyMet are required by law.

“With operating limits, it’s uncertain whether it can be enforced at all,” Maccabee said Wednesday. “It’s uncertain what kind of action could be required, even if there’s a violation. So in every possible way, it’s a second best or maybe third best alternative. Water quality based limitations are what the law requires and should require.”

The EPA memo echoes concerns made by the EPA in an April 2018 document released last month on an earlier draft and a leaked email that critics of the project say shows the MPCA tried to suppress those comments from reaching the public record.

The handling of those comments is being investigated both by the EPA’s Office of Inspector General and Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor. Similarly, the Minnesota Court of Appeal’s cited the permitting processes “procedural irregularities” and sent the case to a district court for a hearing.

Through a rights offering last month, Swiss mining giant Glencore now owns almost 72% of PolyMet shares. PolyMet must still raise almost $1 billion to finance the project."
Fewer than half of USDA workers will follow agency to KC,https://www.kansascity.com,['The Associated Press'],,,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article232730352.html,"Employees protest plan to move USDA jobs to Kansas City The USDA’s decision to move hundreds of research jobs out of Washington to Kansas City has triggered a backlash among federal employees. Employees stood in silent protest during a meeting about the move to Kansas City. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK The USDA’s decision to move hundreds of research jobs out of Washington to Kansas City has triggered a backlash among federal employees. Employees stood in silent protest during a meeting about the move to Kansas City.

Fewer than half of the USDA researchers offered transfers from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City will follow their jobs here, the agency announced Tuesday.

But those who did decide to make the 1,000-mile journey still don’t know exactly where they’ll be working.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced on June 13 that the ag department would ship more than 500 jobs from Washington to Kansas City. Local leaders in Kansas and Missouri cheered the bi-state recruitment effort, though it sparked an immediate backlash from employees in D.C.

A USDA spokesperson told The Star that 72 employees in the ag department’s Economic Research Service accepted their transfer to Kansas City. Another 99 turned down the offer — a number that included employees who did not respond by a Monday deadline. In USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 73 employees signed on to the transfer while another 151 turned it down.

In total, the agency reports 145 workers will follow their jobs to Kansas City, while 250 will leave the agency, meaning 36.7% accepted their transfer assignments. As USDA announced earlier, the two agencies will keep a combined 97 positions in the Washington area.

Some of USDA’s positions were already vacant, as workers began leaving the two agencies in the fall, when news of the relocation first emerged. In June, the agency announced 547 jobs would move to Kansas City. With only 145 signing up to move, that means it may have to hire as many as 400 workers.

Those numbers confirmed earlier predictions that many workers would flee USDA’s ranks rather than move to Kansas City.

USDA says the figures may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the last date employees can report to Kansas City. Employees can change their decision up until that date.

“With employee decisions made, the Department will work to promptly implement an aggressive hiring strategy to ensure continuity of work during the transition,” USDA said in a statement Tuesday.

The USDA spokesperson told The Star that human resources was working with both agencies to begin bringing on employees July 22 — the first date new and relocating employees may begin work in Kansas City.

Economic development officials from Kansas and Missouri joined forces to lure the two agencies to the region. But now, cities on both sides of the state line are working to land the final site of USDA’s offices. While all property owners can place bids, sources previously told The Star that six sites across the metro got USDA’s attention.

Tim Cowden, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council, said his organization has been working with affected USDA employees over the last month. He said an acceptance rate below 40 percent is in line with that of a typical headquarters relocation.

“We are committed to working with all USDA employees interested in relocating to KC. In fact, we have a team dedicated to them,” Cowden said in an email. “We expect there will be others who may elect to relocate to KC and our community is ready to welcome them.“

On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and more than a dozen other Democratic lawmakers wrote to the agriculture secretary urging him to slow down the relocation process.

While those members of Congress pledged to continue efforts to halt the move, in the meantime they asked the ag secretary to allow researchers to work remotely or from existing offices in the D.C. area until the feds have secured a permanent home in Kansas City.

USDA is looking for about 115,000 square feet of office space on either side of the state line.

The General Services Administration, the federal government’s real estate arm, will consider sites in a city center or suburban office park setting. GSA recently extended the deadline for developers to propose sites for the new USDA offices by one month. Those proposals are now due Aug. 7, though employees will begin working at temporary offices this fall in Kansas City.

“This predicament makes it nearly impossible for your employees to determine where they will be living, where to send their children to school, and other important decisions until they know where the final office space will be located in Kansas City,” Van Hollen’s letter said.

Experts believe the USDA’s move may portend a “new frontier of economic development” in which cities and states vie to lure federal offices away from Washington, D.C. On Monday, Republican senators announced that the federal Bureau of Land Management would ship jobs to three western states as it seeks to relocate its headquarters from the nation’s capital.

The agriculture department has argued that moving to Kansas City will put researchers closer to farmers and drastically reduce expenses given the Midwest’s relatively lower cost of living.

But many scientists — including the Union of Concerned Scientists — suspect that USDA’s relocation is meant to diminish USDA research.

The Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economic Association predicted the move could cost U.S. taxpayers upward of $182 million in lost productivity and research capacity.

And Tuesday’s letter from Democrats claims that it could take as long as two years to build out new office space in Kansas City.

“We remain concerned that this restructuring will gut the ability of these agencies to successfully carry out their important missions,” the Democrats said. “We also remain concerned that the quality of work being done at ERS and NIFA has already been undermined and will continue to degrade.”

USDA did not respond to questions from The Star about the timeline to establish permanent office space.

But GSA’s request for bids on the project calls for an extended construction period: from the time a lease is awarded, property owners have up to 330 days to make physical improvements.

Employee transfer notices showed USDA workers might temporarily work out of existing USDA office space on Beacon Drive near Swope Park in south Kansas City."

New inspector general report details management issues at Norwood VA,https://www.augustachronicle.com,['Susan Mccord'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.augustachronicle.com/news/20190716/new-inspector-general-report-details-management-issues-at-norwood-va,"Nurse training and staffing, leadership and hiring problems plague Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center in a new report from the Department of Veterans Affairs' Office of Inspector General.

A new report from the inspector general for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs points to more mismanagement at the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center.

Among the 97-page document’s findings included the VA downplaying the death of a critical care unit patient in late 2018 when a nurse improperly inserted a feeding tube into the patient's lung. By assigning the death a lower safety score, the VA wasn't required to analyze its root cause, the report said.

The death led investigators to discover that only two of 42 critical care registered nurses had adequate documentation of their competencies – such as knowing how to properly insert a feeding tube – in their personnel files. Neither of the two nurses involved in the incident had such documentation.

In his response to the report, VA Medical Center Director Robin Jackson said the nurse manager overseeing the nurses and one of the RNs had abruptly resigned and that the competency issues would be addressed. During a March 14 visit, however, the facility was unable to provide the inspector general's office with evidence that all CCU nurses had completed training in proper insertion of the tube, the report said.

The report, based largely on anonymous complaints, the report is the latest mark against the Augusta center. It came under fire in 2013 for being part of a nationwide VA backlog of patient consults, with some veterans dying while they waited for an appointment. In 2016, Augusta VA supervisor Cathedral Henderson was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison for falsely reporting that veteran requests for care had been fulfilled to address the backlog.

A statement from Jackson's office said the center is implementing the inspector general's recommendations and is pleased that many of the anonymous allegations ""were largely unfounded.""

Several of the unfounded allegations led to other findings by the inspector general's office, such as a claim that a patient died while waiting for an intensive care bed. Though the death was not substantiated, investigators determined the hospital had no ""crash bed"" policy ensuring the availability of a bed in an emergency, the report said.

Substantiated allegations included leadership problems, significant staffing shortages and security issues, the report said.

Underlying the VA problems are a “facility culture” short on communication, the report said. Investigators “heard or read multiple accounts of the facility director publicly humiliating employees,” it said, including use of a “sarcastic, negative tone.”

Jackson joined the facility as interim director in April 2017, promising better access to care and more accountability, and was made permanent director in April 2018. He replaced Maria Andrews, who retired from the system after two years at the Augusta VA. She replaced Robert Hamilton, who managed the center for two years after Rebecca Wiley's tenure from 2007 to 2013. Wiley accepted $18,000 in performance bonuses while three patients died waiting for a consultation, according to prior Augusta Chronicle reports.

In the new report, investigators said they were repeatedly told hiring at the Augusta VA is inefficient and takes months. Those interviewed called it “awful,” “extremely difficult” and “exquisitely problematic.” with an average hiring action held up by one of several procedural step for nearly 58 days.

Though an early 2018 VA report found staffing levels to be adequate, in February both CCU and RN staffing was “substantially below” authorized levels, with 11 of 53 CCU nursing positions vacant and six of 36 ER nurse slots open.

Unexcused absenteeism is a related problem. On four days last year, more than 30 percent of nursing staff called out of work. On Aug. 30, half the staff didn’t come in. From Oct. 1 to Feb. 28, 30 emergency room RNs called in absent for 97 of their shifts.

“Staff absences frequently impacted the facility’s ability to maintain safe CCU staffing levels and that unit managers failed to consistently use the available administrative actions to address unexcused staff absences,” the report said.

Nearly 25,000 patients in the 2018 fiscal year were treated at the VA's emergency room, which is in service to the area's veteran population that exceeds 40,000. The two Augusta VA hospitals and clinics in Aiken, Athens and Statesboro employ 2,450 people and have a budget of around $400, according to a 2018 news release.

Other issues in the report included a lack of security in the emergency room that saw an emotionally distraught patient – whose written suicide threat was overlooked by staff – left the ER through an open door and killed himself the next morning.

Despite planned enhancements, investigators on Jan. 29 observed emergency room doors unsecured and propped open, with a security contract awaiting a signature, the report said.

It also raised concerns about critically ill patients being wheeled through a pedestrian bridge at the downtown campus to nearby AU Medical Center and the lack of clear policy about it. Employees attributed the measure in part to slow or inconsistent response by the local government EMS providers.

Jackson's office said several hires had been made to prevent future issues, including a permanent director, associate director, chief of staff, assistant director, human resources chief and chief of employee and labor relations."
Trump administration denies possible ouster of Commerce Secretary Ross,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-census-ross/trump-weighs-ousting-commerce-secretary-ross-nbc-idUSKCN1UA0VD,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday denied a media report nbcnews.to/2XPQJ4B that President Donald Trump is considering removing Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after a Supreme Court defeat on adding a citizenship question to the census.

Trump retreated on Thursday from adding a contentious question on citizenship to the 2020 census, but insisted he was not giving up his fight to count how many non-citizens are in the country and ordered government agencies to mine their databases.

Although Trump has previously been frustrated with Ross, in particular over some failed trade negotiations, the 81-year-old commerce secretary has so far kept his job.

Since late last year other media outlets have reported at different times that Trump, whose administration has been characterized by high turnover in top posts, was considering replacing Ross.

Mnuchin told reporters that Trump remained satisfied with Ross in his role. “I have every reason to think Secretary Ross is doing a good job. I’ve never heard anything otherwise,” Mnuchin said.

The Commerce Department said in a statement Monday that Ross was currently overseeing the department’s response to Hurricane Barry and noted that he had joined Trump on his trip to Wisconsin and Ohio on Friday.

Ross “will continue to work on behalf of the American people and the President’s America First agenda,” the department said.

However, NBC reported early Monday that Trump has been making calls to “allies outside the White House about replacing Ross.”

The White House declined to comment on Monday. Trump is set to have a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

On Friday, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigned amid fresh scrutiny of his handling of a sex abuse case when he was a federal prosecutor in Florida more than a decade ago. Trump, who had supported the labor secretary amid calls for him to resign, said it was Acosta’s decision to step down.

Late on Friday, Trump said he disagreed with the findings of a Commerce Department investigation that found uranium imports threaten to impair U.S. national security and instead ordered a 90-day review by federal agencies, saying “a fuller analysis of national security considerations with respect to the entire nuclear fuel supply chain is necessary.”"
"Controversial agency relocation slammed as attack on science by lawmakers, employees",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/agriculture-usda-blm-move-dc-climate-trump-protests-science-e8e534ec12fc/,"Employees and Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on the Trump administration’s plans to relocate hundreds of positions within two agencies outside of Washington, D.C. — a move some see as an effort to clamp down on science.

While the planned moves of both the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and parts of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) differ in their scope and rationale, resistance to both plans has shaped up similarly.

Critics are expressing concern over the motivations behind the efforts, which would lead to a mass-exodus of agency experts unwilling to relocate. This would spur a science brain drain in line with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on reports and research from within his own government.

“These decisions… are meant to displace seasoned scientists and regulators who have honorably served Republican and Democratic Administrations alike,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) in a statement to ThinkProgress responding to both the BLM and USDA relocation plans. Van Hollen sits on the Interior and Environment Appropriations subcommittee.

Responsible for administering public lands, BLM has become a battleground under the Trump administration as the White House has rolled back the boundaries of national monuments and advocated for fossil fuel drilling on U.S. acreage.

Now, the bureau is sparking controversy again. Administration officials confirmed this week that the overwhelming majority of BLM positions in D.C. are set for relocation. Around 84% of BLM staffers will be asked to relocate by the end of next year to areas outside of the nation’s capital, mostly to western states.

That announcement comes a month after Secretary Sonny Perdue mandated that over 500 USDA employees move en masse to Kansas City — located in both Missouri and Kansas — by Sept. 30, and gave them a deadline of July 15 to respond.

In the case of BLM, the Interior Department (DOI) plans to concentrate many of the positions in Grand Junction, Colorado, in addition to a range of western states stretching from Arizona to Alaska. Joe Balash, DOI assistant secretary for land and minerals, called the decision “demonstrably cost-effective” in a July 16 letter to Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), ranking member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and Environment.

The Trump administration argues that the move would both cut expenses and shift workers closer to the public lands they focus on, an argument supported by many Republicans including Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), who sits on the Natural Resources Committee.

But Democrats immediately raised objections. Udall said he had “serious reservations” about the move, as did his subcommittee counterpart in the House, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN). Democrats in both chambers of Congress indicated this week that they feel the plan is largely an effort to push out the D.C.-based senior staff who do not want to relocate.

Many of those employees are experts in their field, including scientists. “It’s a way for them to get rid of a lot of professional staff here in Washington,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) in a statement.

Many BLM employees are already located in other parts of the country and support for moving the bureau has been somewhat bipartisan over the years. But the latest push for relocation by the Trump administration coincides with a heated clash between USDA and its employees.

Given until this past Monday to make their decision, scores of USDA workers have opted out of moving. Of the employees with the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), more than half declined to relocate, according to Politico.

ERS workers in particular argued that the move would disrupt their work and efforts to publish important scientific reports. NIFA, meanwhile, is responsible for grant funding that touches climate, economic, and agricultural work that uses D.C. as a home base.

Many USDA employees have also argued that the move is politically motivated. ERS has recently released reports critical of Trump’s escalating trade war with China and its impact on farmers.

Experts also worry the move is a warning shot with implications for climate science. An investigation by Politico last month found that USDA has repeatedly sought to bury studies showing the danger of climate change. That report noted that some scientists see the ERS move as a foreshadowing of wider repercussions for research that doesn’t align with the administration’s broader “energy dominance” agenda.

USDA workers have fought through their union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), to dispute the move, but the department has rejected those efforts. Moreover, there is concern that other departments could face similar moves, like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, both of which are under DOI’s jurisdiction.

But Democrats asserted that they are looking into measures to combat the relocations, emphasizing that the move could be costly to taxpayers in addition to dramatically shifting the wealth of knowledge offered by current government staffers.

Lawmakers indicated they might seek to halt the relocation by blocking its funding in the upcoming appropriations bill that covers both the DOI and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A group of senators, including Van Hollen, have also introduced legislation to keep both BLM and USDA in the D.C. metro area.

“This Administration is acting to undermine the subject-matter experts at many of our federal agencies,” said Van Hollen, who added that his office would “continue to use every tool available to push back against these actions.”"
U.S. State Department Warns Sweden Regarding A$AP Rocky Arrest: 'Treat American Citizens Fairly & With Respect',https://www.billboard.com,['Michael Saponara'],,,,https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8520059/us-state-department-sweden-asap-rocky-arrest,"A$AP Rocky has remained in Swedish detention since his arrest on July 3. With reports circulating of his mistreatment behind bars and no clear path to his release anytime in sight, Politico learned Sunday that the U.S. Department of State has issued a warning of sorts urging the Swedish government to make sure Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, is treated properly in prison.

""There are certainly some facts about the arrest and detention that raise concerns,"" a department spokesperson said in a statement. ""We expect all governments, including Sweden, to treat American citizens fairly and with respect. We hope to see A$AP Rocky and his colleagues back on tour and reunited with friends and family soon.""

The report goes on to state that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been briefed on the issue and many top officials will continue to monitor the Harlem native's situation very closely. Prosecutors in Sweden legally have until Friday to decide if they will pursue assault charges against Rocky and three others in his crew. Rocky was arrested July 3 following an altercation before his performance at SMASH festival.

A petition calling for Rocky's release on Change.org has accumulated nearly 600,000 signatures and has been shared by Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj, T.I., Post Malone and more famous friends."
"Oracle loses DoD court challenge, $10bn Pentagon cloud contract to go to AWS or Microsoft",https://www.datacenterdynamics.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/news/oracle-loses-dod-court-challenge-10bn-pentagon-cloud-contract-go-aws-or-microsoft/,"The DoD has downplayed the role the individuals had in making the JEDI contract criteria, and dismissed claims of impropriety.

Judge Eric G. Bruggink dismissed Oracle's case, backing the DoD's claims that no conflicts of interest influenced the procurement process.

The main reason given for dismissing the case was that, because the original contract criteria were found legal, and Oracle was unable to compete under those criteria, ""we conclude that it cannot demonstrate prejudice as a result of other possible errors in the procurement process.""

In a statement, Pentagon spokesperson Elissa Smith said: “This reaffirms the DoD’s position: the JEDI Cloud procurement process has been conducted as a fair, full and open competition, which the contracting officer and her team executed in compliance with the law.

""DoD has an urgent need to get these critical capabilities in place to support the warfighter and we have multiple military services and combatant commands waiting on the availability of JEDI. Our focus continues to be on finalizing the award decision.”

Earlier this year, the court dismissed a similar case brought by IBM.

The JEDI contract is now set to proceed, with only Amazon and Azure eligible, with an award expected to be announced in late August.

There remains perhaps one more roadblock, however, with Senator Marco Rubio last week writing an open letter to National Security Advisor John Bolton: ""JEDI has the potential to be a $10 billion, 10-year contract. This type of fiscal and time commitment should demand a procurement steeped in competition and conducted without bias toward any one vendor.

""However, DoD has used arbitrary criteria and standards for bidders. Even though 200 companies were initially interested, DoD instituted such a restrictive criteria that only four companies bid on JEDI. DoD then further used the arbitrary criteria to eliminate two of the bidders, IBM and Oracle, leaving only Amazon and Microsoft. And in the end, DoD plans to award this massive contract to a single vendor, even though multiple vendors would ensure continuing price competition and access to the latest innovations.""

Rubio, who in 2016 received $4m in campaign donations from Oracle founder Larry Ellison, added: ""I respectfully request that you direct the delay of an award until all efforts are concluded in addition to evaluating all bids in a fair and open process in order to provide the competition necessary to obtain the best cost and best technology for its cloud computing needs.""

It has also seen cryptocurrencies exploited to support illicit activities including cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, human trafficking and more. Still, Mnuchin said the US ""welcomes responsible innovation, including new technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system and expand access to financial services.""

""With respect to Facebook's Libra and other developments in cryptocurrencies, our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse,"" Mnuchin said. He noted that Facebook (and any other cryptocurrency providers) will have to meet the same safeguards as traditional financial institutions, including those put in place by the Anti-Money Laundering Council, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Bank Secrecy Act.

That should come as no surprise to Facebook. While it's likely prepared to meet those standards, it will have to navigate pushback like this from the Treasury Department and the President himself, who claims cryptocurrencies are ""highly volatile and based on thin air.""

A government watchdog said Monday the Environmental Protection Agency did not follow its own guidelines when filling two key science advisory panels with fewer academic researchers and more industry voices.

The findings from the Government Accountability Office, published Monday at the request of several Senate Democrats, provide additional fodder for critics who say President Trump's deputies are trying to degrade the way EPA assesses scientific research. Both panels are part of the EPA and made up of scientists from outside the agency who advise it on the best science surrounding issues like air pollution, pesticides and hazardous waste.

The agency itself disputes the watchdog's findings, arguing in a letter submitted to the GAO that its way of choosing new panelists for the Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee is “more rigorous” than under the EPA's old guidelines.

The GAO described a sharp decrease in the number of university researchers serving on the Science Advisory Board, which reviews the integrity of scientific information used by the EPA when writing rules, over the first 15 months of the Trump administration. The number of university researchers on the panel went from 36 in January 2017 to just 22 in March 2018. The panel had between 44 and 47 members during that period.

The decrease came as the number of researchers from consulting firms or from companies regulated by the agency went up, a fact that Democrats latched onto as more evidence the Trump adminisitration is overly influenced by polluting industries.

“After a careful investigation, the non-partisan GAO confirms what we’ve been critical of all along: The Trump Administration is violating its own rules by putting industry officials in charge of crucially important science advisory boards,” said Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee who with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) led a group of Democrats in asking the GAO to investigate the agency's practices. “This is not a trivial issue, but a serious problem that has profound consequences for enforcement and regulatory actions across the agency.”

Among those who under Trump joined the Science Advisory Board are Brant Ulsh, a health physicist at M.H. Chew & Associates who has argued the EPA has overplayed the risk of small doses of radiation; and John Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama at Huntsville whose work critical of NASA's climate scientists has been often cited by so-called climate “skeptics.”

The watchdog agency found fewer ""notable"" changes to the composition of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee.

That decrease in academics on the Science Advisory Board is due largely to a Trump administration policy barring scientists who get EPA grants from serving as advisers, according to Genna Reed, a science and policy analyst in the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“It's a pretty clear connection to draw,” she said. The ban, put in place by former EPA chief Scott Pruitt, drew praise from industry lobbying groups and condemnation from scientific organizations such as Reed's when it was announced in 2017.

According to the GAO, in the past agency staffers weighed in with written recommendations on who should be selected for these two boards. That part of the selection process was spelled out in one of the EPA's own handbooks.

But in the Trump administration, officials ignored those internal guidelines and chose advisers without much of a paper trail. Instead of written recommendations, EPA management instead requested briefings with staffers.

“That was our key finding: The EPA didn't follow this key step with these two committees,” said J. Alfredo Gomez, director of the GAO's natural resources and environment team.

In the past, EPA head Andrew Wheeler cast the panel appointments as an effort to gather scientific opinions from a diverse set of voices. But when selecting researchers for the Science Advisory Board, there is one region of the country the Trump administration seems to turn to frequently: the South.

At the start of the administration, about a quarter, or 28 percent, of the panel hailed from the generally conservative region, which spanned Delaware to Texas in the GAO's analysis. About 15 months later, Southerners constituted more than half of the board.

One of the newcomers is Michael Honeycutt, the top toxicologist in the state of Texas who in 2017 was chosen to chair the Science Advisory Board and who has accused the agency of “overstating” the risks associated with mercury, a toxic heavy metal that can cause brain damage.

In a letter commenting on a draft of the GAO report, the EPA urged the watchdog to delete from the final version the conclusion that EPA ignored its own rules when selecting members of the panels because it is within Wheeler's authority to set new guidance.

“EPA has already provided GAO its thorough explanation on their conclusion that the Agency did not follow its own policy — the assertion is incorrect and should be removed from the report,” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud wrote in an email Monday.

The GAO acknowledged Wheeler had that discretion, but ultimately recommended that the EPA follow the handbook's guidelines.

— Another agency is moving staff out of Washington: The Interior Department is planning to yank most of the Bureau of Land Management’s Washington-based employees out of the District and move them out West. Some top employees are set to be transferred to Grand Junction, Colo., and others will move to other cities, The Post’s Juliet Eilperin and Lisa Rein report.

The context: “The proposal to move roughly 300 employees from a key Interior Department agency — among them the majority of top managers — comes as Trump officials are forcibly reassigning career officials and upending operations across the federal government,” they write. “Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue finalized plans this summer to move about 550 jobs at two of his department’s scientific agencies from the nation’s capital to greater Kansas City. The White House is trying to abolish the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources agency, and has threatened to furlough as many as 150 employees if Congress blocks it.""

Two sides to the argument: In a statement supporting the move, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said the “problem with Washington is too many policy makers are far removed from the people they are there to serve... Ninety-nine percent of the land the BLM manages is West of the Mississippi River, and so should be the BLM headquarters,” he added. Meanwhile, Steve Ellis, who retired as BLM’s deputy director in 2016 told Rein and Eilperin: “If I wanted to dismantle an agency, this would be in my playbook … It’s important for these agencies to have a meaningful footprint in D.C.”

Eilperin with more details:

Under the plan (I got additional details last night), Utah will get several dozen jobs, as will Nevada and Colorado. More than 80 percent of headquarters jobs will move West. https://t.co/rddUkHXdTY — Juliet Eilperin (@eilperin) July 16, 2019

THERMOMETER

— Tracking the deluge from Barry: There were rainfall totals reaching 15 inches in parts of Louisiana on Monday, as the impact of tropical depression Barry poured down on the state, though later than anticipated, The Post's Jason Samenow reports. “Since late last week, forecasters said Barry would be a drawn-out event, with heavy rain a threat lasting two to three days. But the worst was expected over the weekend, when meteorologists predicted tremendous amounts of rain in Louisiana. Rivers were forecast to surge to historic heights,” he writes.

Still, more rain is yet to come: “Dangerous, significant flash flooding is likely, especially across south-central Louisiana,” the National Weather Service wrote in a statement. Samenow adds the agency is predicting “five to eight inches more of rain in this area through the afternoon and rainfall rates as high as two to four inches per hour.”

— This climate scientist is also an evangelical Christian, and she’s trying to persuade skeptics: Katharine Hayhoe, a leading climate scientist, has found a way to talk to people about science by talking to them about faith, The Post’s Dan Zak writes in this profile of the Texas Tech University researcher. During a keynote address at the Citizens’ Climate Lobby conference in Washington, Hayhoe — who is also a lead author on the U.S. government’s latest National Climate Assessment — displayed an ability to communicate that seems “miraculous by the standards of modern climate politics: She can convert nonbelievers — or, to put it in her terms, make people realize that they’ve believed in the importance of this issue all along,” Zak writes. “She knows how to speak to oilmen, to Christians, to farmers and ranchers, having lived for years in Lubbock, Tex., with her pastor husband. She is a scientist who thinks that we’ve talked enough about science, that we need to talk more about matters of the heart.” “We humans have been given responsibility for every living thing on this planet, which includes each other,” she said at the conference. “We are called to tend the garden and be good stewards of the gifts that God has given us.”

— How extreme heat is changing sports: Scientists say the hottest places on the planet are getting hotter, faster. Las Vegas, for example, the location of an annual race called Running with the Devil, is the “fastest-warming city in the country and has seen an average temperature increase of nearly 6 degrees since 1970,” The Post’s Rick Maese reports in the latest piece in a series on how climate change is affecting the world of sports. “The Running with the Devil race, intentionally scheduled for extreme conditions, might not be an exact peek into the future, but it does highlight many of the challenges already confronting much of the sports world. How does heat affect performance? What dangers lurk on the outdoor courses and fields exposed to the summer sun? How does one stage a safe event in extreme conditions?”

— Man, it’s a hot one: Last month was the Earth’s hottest June on record, 1.7 degrees above the norm for the global average temperature for the month, according to data from NASA. “The month was punctuated by a severe heat wave that struck Western Europe in particular during the last week, with numerous all-time-hottest-temperature records falling in countries with centuries-old data sets,” The Post’s Jason Samenow and Andrew Freedman report. “NASA is the second institution to confirm that it was Earth’s hottest June, as the Copernicus Climate Change Service had already determined that June 2019 was the warmest such month on record for Europe and globally.”

— No word on what caused New York City’s blackout: Con Edison warned the city could see more power outages this summer after a weekend power failure left 73,000 residents in the dark. “We expect that there could be service outages — those things happen during heat waves,” the power company’s chief spokesman, Mike Clendenin, said in an interview with PIX 11, according to the New York Post. He also said there’s still no explanation for what caused the blackout. “We are very, very focused on examining exactly what transpired and caused that outage,” Clendenin said. ““There’s a lot of patience and poise that New Yorkers displayed during the outage itself. The same kind of patience and diligence is going to be needed as engineers and experts dive into the date and actually analyze how equipment tripped off, or what went wrong, that led to the large outage.”

Meanwhile, in Washington: ""Power was cut off Monday night to as many as 7,000 homes and businesses in the District, many of them in Northeast, near Capitol Hill according to Pepco,"" The Post's Martin Weil reports. ""The utility said it had issues with equipment at a substation in Northeast.""
