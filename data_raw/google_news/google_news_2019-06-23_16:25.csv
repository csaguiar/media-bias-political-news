Why Trump can't fill the gaping holes in his government,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/politics/trump-cabinet-vacancies-apprentice/index.html,"It was so seamless on The Apprentice.

But that was TV. In the real world, as President, things are are much more difficult for Donald Trump , which is how the US comes to be facing the possibility of military action against Iran without a confirmed Secretary of Defense.

It's also how the US is facing what Trump calls a national emergency at the border with Mexico without a permanent Secretary of Homeland Security.

And on the flip side, it's why Trump is stuck with the Federal Reserve Board Chairman he nominated in 2017 but has since soured on and routinely vilifies for not cutting interest rates.

Since taking office, Trump has blown through West Wing staffers and Cabinet secretaries at a rate unprecedented in modern US politics

He's a mercurial boss -- high on an aide or Cabinet secretary one day and ready to fire them the next, which means he's been through multiple principals and understudies and still can't find the right fit for key cast members.

Trump's generals are all gone

Recall that early in Trump's presidency he surrounded himself with former generals -- James Mattis at the Pentagon, Michael Flynn and then H.R. McMaster as National Security Adviser, and John Kelly first as DHS Secretary and then as White House chief of staff.

All of them are gone now.

Trump speaks alongside his first Secretary of Defense, retired Gen. Jim Mattis on December 6, 2017.

In the place of generals, and despite his pledges to drain the swamp, Trump has sought out former defense contractors. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, before running for Congress, ran an aerospace company. Outgoing acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan spent a career at Boeing. New Defense nominee and current Secretary of the Army Mark Esper worked at Raytheon.

Coincidentally or not, Trump is ramping up to use the military as a blunt force instrument against Iran; he was ""cocked and loaded"" Thursday before changing his mind about a strike to make Tehran pay for a downed US drone.

Many, many vacant or 'acting' positions

Trump is working through Cabinet secretaries (acting and confirmed) at a remarkable clip, but he likes to take his time with formal nominations.

He let Shanahan serve as acting Pentagon chief for more than five full months before nominating him in May. Shanahan pulled his name from the confirmation process when the Washington Post published a story about his difficult divorce and domestic incidents between his ex-wife and troubled son.

He waited a month from the time Sessions resigned to formally nominate his replacement William Barr while testing the lines of succession at the Justice Department by installing Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general rather than Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

There's been a temporary acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan, running the Department of Homeland Security for months since the departure of Kirstjen Nielsen in April. Despite a border crisis for which he declared a national emergency, he has yet to nominate a successor.

Nearly 40% of Senate-confirmable positions are not permanently filled, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that tracks these things. More than 50% of such positions are not filled at the Justice Department. Of the 24 top-level roles listed at the DHS website , 12 are either acting or vacant.

The situation at DHS is perhaps the most concerning, given Trump's efforts to end-run Congress to build his border wall and the controversial detention of children and families who are caught entering the US.

Trump did recently nominate Ken Cuccinelli, a divisive conservative voice and Virginia politician, as acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services.

The laws governing succession at the Pentagon are different, but Esper will have to resign as Army secretary before he can be nominated as Defense Secretary, thanks to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998.

That act stipulates that an acting secretary like Esper can only serve for 210 days, but there are exceptions. The clock stops when a person is nominated -- but that person can't stay on as the acting secretary.

The act, passed by a Republican-controlled Congress during the Clinton administration, stipulates that only a principal deputy to a position can serve in an acting capacity for a position to which she or he has been nominated, according to a very thorough examination of the law by the Congressional Research Service

A difficult boss

Many see Trump's embrace of temporary staffers in top Cabinet roles as an effort to subvert the Senate's Constitutional role of ""advice and consent"" in who runs government agencies. And there's probably something to that; he's loathe to let his secretaries testify before Congress.

But Trump has also embraced it for roles that don't require Senate confirmation. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has been acting in that role since December of 2018.

""Acting gives you much greater flexibility. A lot easier to do things. So that's the way it is,"" Trump said when asked about the situation

Part of it may be the same reason Trump no longer has a communications director or that his press secretary (still Sarah Sanders, who is resigning at the end of the month) hasn't given a press briefing in more than 100 days. And why he hasn't made any move to replace former Fox News executive Bill Shine as communications director, a role most infamously held by financier Anthony Scaramucci for just ten days

Trump sees himself as defense secretary, homeland security secretary, press secretary and communications director. For a man who made his living putting his own name on buildings, there is only room for his own opinion.

And that's probably why he's so galled by Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman who has yet to cut interest rates as Trump has demanded.

But there's little Trump can do. The law makes clear that the Fed chairman serves in that role for four years. Powell assumed the role in early 2018.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Trump wouldn't rule out demoting Powell , an unprecedented level of meddling with a position that's supposed to be shielded from it.

All of this reinforces how difficult it must be to work in close proximity to Trump. You could check in on Twitter to learn that you're fired or, he might publicly disagree with you during an interview, as he did recently for FBI Director Christopher Wray.

The FBI director is wrong ,"" Trump said, agitated when George Stephanopoulos pointed out Christopher Wray said politicians should tell the FBI if they're contacted by a foreign government wanting to interfere with the a US election.

in an Oval Office meeting. Try negotiating a trade deal on his behalf. US Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer has been contradicted by his boss in an Oval Office meeting.

Or he might kick you out of a room for coughing, as he recently did for Mulvaney . But if he fires you, he might not hire a replacement.

When he took office, Trump promised to surround himself by the very best people. But he's running out of them. And despite his repeated claim that plenty of people want to work in his administration, it has a lot of empty spaces."
Middle East peace plan: Jared Kushner proposes $50bn fund,https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-middle-east-48731440/middle-east-peace-plan-jared-kushner-proposes-50bn-fund,"Video

US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has unveiled the first section of the US Middle East peace plan.

Focusing on economics, it envisages more than half of a $50bn (Â£39bn) fund being spent in the Palestinian territories over 10 years.

The plan will be presented at a conference in Bahrain next week, but the Palestinian Authority has said it will boycott the event, having refused to engage with Mr Trump since the US recognised Jerusalem in 2017."
Pence says US 'not convinced' downing of US drone by Iran 'was authorized at the highest levels',https://www.cnn.com,['Kate Sullivan'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/politics/mike-pence-iran-us-drone-not-convinced-highest-levels/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday reiterated President Donald Trump's claim that there are doubts the order to shoot down a US drone by Iran was made at the highest levels.

""The President also had doubts as to whether or not the downing of our unmanned aircraft was actually authorized at the highest levels,"" Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""

Pence said, ""We're not convinced that it was authorized at the highest levels,"" and told Tapper he would not speak about the intelligence the US has related to the incident.

The vice president said after Trump was provided with casualty assessments for a retaliatory strike, the President ""concluded that it was not a proportionate response to shooting down an unmanned American aircraft.""

Trump said Friday he called off an attack on Iran just as the US was ""cocked & loaded"" to strike because he decided there would be too many deaths for it to be a proportionate response to the downing of a US drone last week.

"Trump says he never threatened to demote Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, but has the 'right' to do so",https://www.cnbc.com,['Spencer Kimball'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/23/trump-says-he-never-threatened-to-demote-federal-reserve-chairman-jerome-powell.html,"President Donald Trump, left, and Jerome Powell, governor of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Trump's nominee for chairman of the Federal Reserve, walk to a nomination announcement in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017.

President Donald Trump said he never threatened to demote Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, though he maintained he has the authority to do so.



""I didn't ever threaten to demote him,"" Trump said in an interview with NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that broadcasted Sunday. ""I'd be able to do that if I wanted, but I haven't suggested that.""



""I have the right to do that, but I haven't said that,"" the president continued.



Trump went on to criticize the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, saying Chairman Powell made a mistake.

""Obama had someone that kept the rates very low,"" Trump said. ""I had somebody that raised the rates very rapidly -- too much. He made a mistake, that's been proven.""



The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates steady, indicating that there would not be a cut in 2019. The central bank, however, forecast one to two possible rate cuts in 2020.



When asked Tuesday whether he wanted to demote Powell, Trump said: ""Let's see what he does.""

Bloomberg had reported that Trump considered demoting Powell in February, but White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the president wasn't currently considering such a move.

""It's a six-month-old story,"" he told reporters. ""It allegedly happened six months ago and it's not happening today and therefore I have nothing to say about it. It is what it is.""

Powell was asked point blank at a news conference after the Wednesday Fed meeting about how he would react if Trump said he wanted to demote him.

""I think the law is clear that I have a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it,"" Powell said.

When asked whether he should address Trump's repeated criticism, the Fed chairman said he doesn't ""discuss elected officials publicly or privately.""

The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times since Trump took office and originally indicated two more rate hikes in 2019. The central bank pivoted and adopted a more dovish stance after its hike in December sent markets reeling.



Trump has repeatedly claimed the stock market would be higher and economic growth stronger if the Fed had not raised rates.

In the same ""Meet The Press"" interview that broadcasted Sunday, Trump was asked whether he believed Fed policy would jeopardize his reelection chances.

""I think the economy is so strong we're going to bull through it,"" the president said. ""But I'm not happy with his actions, I don't think he's done a good job."""
Officials accuse DHS chief Kevin McAleenan of leaking ICE raids plan to sabotage operation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/officials-accuse-dhs-chief-kevin-mcaleenan-of-leaking-ice-raids-plan-to-sabotage-operation,"This week's big leak about a major Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation was orchestrated by acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan in an effort to sabotage the raids before they were scheduled to take place, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

In a move he said was to placate Democrats, President Trump announced on Saturday that the nationwide immigration enforcement operation planned to start Sunday â aimed at migrant families who illegally remain in the country despite being denied asylum â was called off to give lawmakers two weeks to work on a plan to fix legal âloopholesâ he said have enticed migrants to come to the U.S.

However, all five officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner confirmed McAleenan's decision to go rogue and stymie the operation was what prompted the White House to call off the 10-city operation.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post on Friday.

The sources said only a small number of people in the White House, ICE, and DHS were even aware of the planâs details, including which cities, the date and time, and who would be targeted.

Two officials said the acting secretary, who was promoted internally in April, had fought for months during closed-door discussions with White House officials, the former acting ICE Director Ronald Vitiello, and the new acting ICE Director Mark Morgan against the plan, which they noted was similar to one the Obama administration carried out in 2015.

âI know he has not approved of this operation for months,â one person familiar with those private conversations said during a phone call Saturday night. âThe president wouldnât leak that. ICE wouldnât leak that. Thereâs only a few people involved in these discussions â¦ The only one who could have shared the details of those operations were Kevin.â

âThatâs our belief,â a second official said when asked if McAleenan was behind the leak. âThe secretary was not supportive from day one.â

The first official said McAleenan may have leaked it so that he could âbe the martyrâ in the face of anticipated blowback in the future.

A third official claimed McAleenan âcares more about what liberals and 'Never Trumpers' in Congress and the media think of him the achieving the express mission of his department.â

â[T]his will leave an un-erasable mark on his tenure,â the third official wrote in a text message Saturday evening.

Leaking the information would only have âbenefitted one personâ who had knowledge of the plan, according to the first person, who added there was âno doubt in my mindâ McAleenan either told the Post himself or had a close comrade at DHS take care of it.

âHis hands were dirty,â that same official said.

McAleenan traveled with the author of the Post report, Nick Miroff, on a government plane down to the border on Wednesday.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

Following the Post report Friday, ICE advised the White House not to go forward with the raids, in part because those who were the targets might have fled the locations Enforcement and Removal Operations officers had expected to find them.

âLeaking the locations and details to stop the operation from happening not only harmed operational integrity, but it put the safety and well-being of his own officers in jeopardy,â the third official wrote.

âThatâs law enforcement sensitive information. You just donât reveal that,â the second official said. âIt gets people hyped up. It gets the NGOs activated, and then anyone wearing a jacket with the ICE name on it is really chastised. Cities are coming out saying, âHereâs how you can protect yourself against it.ââ

That same official said the âworstâ consequence of the leak, especially if it was directed by the departmentâs leader, was how it endangered personnel.

âIt really jeopardized the safety of law enforcement officers â thatâs the part thatâs really detrimental,â the official said."

VA employees say agency is actively retaliating against whistleblowers,https://thehill.com,[],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/449882-va-employees-say-agency-is-actively-retaliating-against-whistleblowers,"Three employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs said in new interviews that they were sidelined at their jobs and stripped of responsibilities after they raised alarms about improper treatment of patients.

In interviews with USA Today the three staffers, physician Katherine Mitchell, CT technologist Jeffrey Dettbarn, and physiologist Minu Aghveli said that they were removed from patient care positions to prevent them from learning of future or ongoing abuses at the agency.

The three are set to testify before Congress on a wide range of patient mistreatment this week.

""The VA is two-faced: What it says it does and what it actually does are two entirely different things,"" Mitchell told USA Today. ""Whistleblowers who are brave enough to report problems serve as a vital safety net for veterans. If people canât identify problems, veterans will suffer and die. Thatâs what it boils down to.""

""As a physician, nurse, and basically as a human being, I will not back down if someoneâs health or safety is being threatened,"" she added in the interview.

Dettbarn, who said he hoped to return to patient care, added that a culture of fear at the agency had led to few staffers advocating on behalf of patients.

""There's nobody there to watch out for the veterans,"" he told the newspaper. ""They've got everybody else scared to say anything. Who's taking care of those patients?""

Sidelining those who speak out, she added, ""jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system.""

A spokesman for the agency declined to comment to USA Today on the assertions from Mitchell and the others, while stressing that the agency was working on implementing new rules to protect whistleblowers.

""These include providing timelier resolutions, more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers,"" he said."
Ex-top CIA official perturbed by John Durham's review of intelligence analysts,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Manuel Balce Ceneta'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-cia-official-perturbed-by-john-durhams-review-of-intelligence-analysts,"A former top CIA official warned of dire consequences from the Justice Department's review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

Michael Morell (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)

As part of the ""investigation into the investigators,"" U.S. Attorney John Durham's team reportedly wants to talk to at least one senior CIA counterintelligence official and a senior CIA analyst who examined Russia's role in meddling in the 2016 election.

The review is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity he can take prosecutorial action. Top CIA officials are said to be anxious over the federal prosecutor's efforts.

Michael Morell, who was deputy director of the CIA during the Obama administration, said Durham's interest in speaking to a CIA analyst concerns him.

""I see no problem with a DOJ review of whether the CIA and other intelligence community agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities related to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons â U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals,"" Morell told CBS News, where he is now a senior national security contributor.

""Having said that, I see a DOJ review of whether or not the intelligence analysts made the right call as wholly inappropriate. I cannot ever remember a DOJ review of analysis,"" Morrell added.

""[Durham] and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis,"" Morell said. ""He and his team could well impose a law enforcement standard in coming to a conclusion â a much higher bar than exists in the intelligence community for analytic judgments.""

American officials say Attorney General William Barr, who is overseeing Durham's efforts and earlier this year riled Democrats when he said ""spying did occur"" against the Trump 2016 campaign, wants to understand how the CIA coordinated with the FBI and how the agency came to its conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the order to sow discord in the election to help Trump and undermine his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.

That effort culminated in the January 2017 release of a intelligence community assessment, commissioned by former President Barack Obama. In that report, the CIA and FBI expressed ""high confidence"" that Russia sought to boost Trump while the National Security Agency had ""moderate confidence.""

The Senate and House intelligence committees both reviewed the assessment, revealing a partisan divide. While the Senate panel, known for being largely bipartisan, called it a ""sound intelligence product,"" the House Intelligence Committee was more critical. In 2018, the then-GOP led House panel said most of the assessment's analysis ""held up to scrutiny,"" but noted the judgment about Putin ""failed to meet most of the analytic standards set forth in the primary guiding document for [intelligence community] analysis."" Democrats on the committee disagreed with that assessment.

Democrats argue Barr's effort is part of a plan to stonewall the public from learning about President Trump potentially committing obstruction of justice. Upon the conclusion of his Russia investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller laid out 10 instances of possible obstruction but declined to make a determination about whether he should be accused of a crime.

""Trump and Barr conspire to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies. The coverup has entered a new and dangerous phase,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in a tweet after the president gave Barr sweeping powers to declassify documents in the investigation.

Siding with Democrats, Morrell said he feels ""strongly"" the Justice Department has ""NO business"" doing a follow-up review of the intelligence community analysis. ""It does not have the knowledge & expertise necessary to get the right answers and it could well have a chilling effect across the analytic community,"" he said in a tweet."

Department of Labor: Asmussen 'willfully' underpaying staff,https://www.horseracingnation.com,[],,,,https://www.horseracingnation.com/news/Department_of_Labor_Asmussen_willfully_underpaying_staff_123,"For the third time since 2012, Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen is facing a lawsuit from the United States Department of Labor, with Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta alleging more violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.



A suit filed June 7 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York claims Asmussenâs operations in the state â including at Belmont Park, Saratoga and Aqueduct â have since 2016 underpaid more than 100 grooms and hot walkers.



Asmussen in 2013 settled a similar lawsuit in this same court. In 2015, another suit in Kentucky alleged his barn didnât keep proper wage and hour records.



The 2019 filing, first reported on by the New York Post, reads that, âDespite affirmatively recognizing and agreeing to comply with the FLSA as part of their resolution of previous overtime and record keeping violations, Defendants continue to willfully withhold from employees hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages owed for long hours caring for Defendantâs prize-winning horses.â



Horse Racing Nation has contacted Asmussenâs attorney, the Oklahoma City-based Clark Brewster, for comment.



Asmussenâs New York operation is only the latest back under the microscope after trainer Chad Brown was in May hit with $1.6 million in back wages and penalties after an investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division.



The latest lawsuit, which concludes by lists names of 112 employees who complied with the government, says Asmussenâs violations were three-fold:



âFirst, Defendants knowingly undercount employeesâ actual hours worked, concealing from payroll and time records many of the hours spent performing assigned tasks.



âSecond, rather than paying employees based on their actual hours worked, Defendants have paid a combination of fixed salaries and lump sums based on factors such as the number of horses cared for, or number of additional tasks assigned. Accordingly, in workweeks for which employees worked overtime, Defendants have failed to properly calculate and pay employees the required overtime premiums.



âThird, Defendants have denied their H-2B visa employees the proper additional overtime wages owed to those employees at the rates required by the Act and the H-2B non-immigrant visa program.â



Asmussenâs hot walkers are assigned a base schedule of roughly 46.5 hours per week, while grooms work 60 more hours over seven days, the filing says. But according to the lawsuit, that does not take into account race day activity and travel as well as other tasks that arise, such as overseeing a horse during veterinary or blacksmith visits.



The suit alleges that Asmussen âregularly failedâ to compensate grooms and hot walkers for six to 12 hours per week. Some employees, meanwhile, were evidenced to have received pay for 40 hours week after week regardless of how many hours were logged.



For some overtime work, employees were funded a lump sump, such as a $25 payment for working on race day âwithout calculating the actual overtime premium owed to each employee for the additional hours as requiredâ by the Fair Labor Standards Act.



Asmussen's ""typical"" weekly pay for a hot walker with four horse in his or her care was $462 in 2018. Grooms with that many horses were earning $662.75 weekly base pay last year, per the Department of Labor.

Huawei sues Commerce Department over seized equipment,https://www.politico.com,['Steven Overly'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/21/huawei-commerce-department-lawsuit-1376703,"Huawei is suing the U.S. Commerce Department, saying it mishandled the Chinese company's equipment after a seizure. | Andy Wong/AP Photo technology Huawei sues Commerce Department over seized equipment

Chinese telecom giant Huawei has filed a civil lawsuit against the U.S. government accusing the Commerce Department of mishandling equipment that it seized from the company in 2017.

According to the complaint filed Friday, the U.S. government took possession of several pieces of equipment, which were being shipped from an independent testing facility in the United States to China, in order to determine if the technology was subject to export controls.

Story Continued Below

Huawei contends it provided the necessary documentation and was told such disputes are usually resolved in 45 days. Nearly two years later, Huawei believes the equipment is still sitting in an Alaskan warehouse, according to the complaint.

Huawei is not seeking financial compensation but instead wants the court to force the Commerce Department to decide whether export control clearance is necessary and, if not, release the equipment.

A spokesperson for the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit comes as tensions between Huawei and the U.S. government have reached a fever pitch.

The Justice Department charged Huawei earlier this year with violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and stealing trade secrets from U.S. competitors. Meanwhile, Huawei sued the U.S.government, saying a law passed by Congress that banned federal agencies from doing business with the company was unconstitutional.

What's more, the Commerce Department slapped severe trade restrictions on Huawei last month that prevent U.S. companies from selling vital equipment to the company, a penalty that Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei recently said could cost the company $30 billion in lost sales over two years.

Trumpâs decision-making on Iran strike highlights absence of a confirmed defense secretary,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Paul Sonne', 'National Security Reporter Focusing On The U.S. Military', 'June At Pm']",06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-decision-making-on-iran-strike-highlights-absence-of-a-confirmed-defense-secretary/2019/06/22/6f617d8c-950e-11e9-b72d-d56510fa753e_story.html,"When the White House summoned the Pentagonâs top civilian leader to consider a possible military strike against Iran, two men answered the call: Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary who had just announced he would step down amid revelations of family violence, and Mark T. Esper, the Army secretary slated to replace him, who had no formal standing to be in the room.

The arrival on Thursday of the two men at the White House, neither of whom came with the Senateâs imprimatur to sit at the table, brought into sharp relief the perils of a civilian leadership void that President Trump has tolerated at the Pentagon for more than half a year since Jim Mattis resigned as defense secretary.

The end result â an 11th-hour reversal of a military strike that could have sparked an open conflict with Iran â fed into the fears of those who saw Mattis as a bulwark against a process that could leave matters of war and peace up to Trumpâs last-minute whims and his interactions with cable news commentators. The deliberations over how to respond to Iranâs downing of an unmanned U.S. drone highlighted the absence of a top Pentagon civilian leader armed with the experience and status necessary to influence the commander in chief.

[âI stopped itâ: How Trumpâs last-minute reversal on Iran unfolded]

âIn the end this is a human process,â said Leon Panetta, who served as defense secretary and CIA director for President Barack Obama. âWhat human beings tend to do is they make judgments about people who are at the table, and whether or not they have the strength and the position and the knowledge and the experience to be able to voice their opinions.â

âIf they know that somebody is acting,â Panetta said, âif they know that somebody is just there on a temporary basis, then mark my words: There is an automatic assumption that what they say doesnât carry a lot of weight.â

Signs have emerged that the crisis with Iran has possibly been a wake-up call for the White House about the need to install a permanent leader at the Pentagon quickly, despite Trumpâs predilection for acting officials. After urging from impatient Republican lawmakers, Trump announced late Friday that he would nominate Esper to replace Mattis on a permanent basis.

âThe Department does not discuss meetings with the Commander in Chief â including who is in attendance,â Jonathan Hoffman, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement. âThere is no confusion by anyone at the Pentagon â or to our adversaries â as to who is the head of the United States Department of Defense.â

He said Shanahan would be acting secretary until midnight on Sunday, and Esper will take over the first minute of Monday.

Esper comes with defense qualifications that outstrip Shanahanâs, having served for years as an Army officer, a policy adviser in Congress, a top Pentagon official, a defense industry lobbyist and an executive at a well-known conservative think tank. Most recently, he ran the U.S. Army as its top civilian, overseeing the manning and equipping of the largest branch of the American military by personnel.

Esper studied in the same U.S. Military Academy class as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, giving him a long-standing relationship with the most important fellow Cabinet official for most secretaries of defense. He also has worked for the past year and a half in tandem with Gen. Mark A. Milley, the top uniformed officer in the Army, who is due to take over this fall from Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. as next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

âItâs crucial to have someone at the helm of the Pentagon who can look across the complicated international security landscape, across the regional issues and the functional issues, and recognize the pros and cons of using military force,â said Mara Karlin, a former top Pentagon strategist in the Obama administration who is now a professor at Johns Hopkins University. âShanahan did not have the political experience or the policy experience to do this, but appeared to be trying.â

Karlin said that Esper has demonstrated a willingness to choose internal winners and losers in his management of the Army â a critical quality for a defense secretary â and also comes with a wealth of other experience in defense matters.

âThe question is what does meaningful civilian control of the Pentagon look like?â Karlin said. âI think there is evidence that Army Secretary Esper could exert that. He has worked across the Washington apparatus. He has touched this world from a whole bunch of different perspectives.â

Whether Esper can gain the personal trust of Trump, and feel comfortable expressing independent views in front of the president, remains to be seen. During his nearly six months as acting secretary, Shanahan regularly faced explicit questions about his independence and standing with the president. With the imprimatur of the Senate, Esper may also be able to choose appointees for a number of Pentagon positions occupied by acting officials and build out a more robust staff.

Esperâs likely confirmation later this year comes after the extraordinary events surrounding Iran, which raised questions for former top officials about the decision-making process involving military action.

Previous presidents, including Obama and Bill Clinton, have made late-stage decisions to stand down on military strikes in the works, but Trumpâs description of the moments that led up to his decision is what raised alarm bells for some former officials.

In tweets and an interview with NBC News, Trump said that minutes before the military action was due to launch, he asked his generals how many Iranians would die, and when he heard approximately 150, he stopped the planned strike because he felt it wasnât proportionate. If the presidentâs version of events is true, former top Pentagon officials say, it represents at worst a breakdown in the chain of command and at best a departure from the traditional practice of running through the casualty impact of military actions well before any decisions are made.

âI canât think of a more chaotic situation than to have the president abort an operation while military forces are moving into position to conduct a military action â and do so on the basis that he wasnât told pertinent information,â said Jeremy Bash, a former top official at the Pentagon and the CIA during the Obama administration. He described that process, if it played out the way Trump described it, as a âtrain wreck.â

The lack of a confirmed defense secretary during the deliberations Thursday also would have put an unfair onus on the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Eric Edelman, a former U.S. ambassador and top Pentagon official in the George W. Bush administration. The chairman is the official military adviser to the president, but the defense secretary is supposed to present the broader implications of any military options, and they tend to coordinate on their position on a military strike before presenting options to the White House.

âYouâve created this imbalance where you have one guy with a foot out the door and the other guy who hasnât been nominated yet â how are they going to opine or say anything meaningful that is going to have an impact on the process?â Edelman said. âThen it puts everything in the hands of the chairman, which isnât fair.â

Ultimately, the decision about the use of force rests with the commander in chief; a deliberative and considered process leading up the decision is designed to give the president confidence that all options were examined carefully. It also can assure the public that decisions possibly resulting in the death of U.S. troops, enemy forces or civilians on the ground are made in a way that isnât cavalier.

âThe toughest decision a president has to make is to deploy forces in harmâs way. Every president Iâve worked with, thatâs what tears their insides out,â Panetta said. âBut if you at the very least go through that process â and evaluate all these issues and the consequences â then at the end of the day you have to make a tough decision, but at least it is one that is carefully considered.â"
Hundreds of migrant caravan members found to have US criminal histories: DHS files,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hundreds-of-migrant-caravan-found-to-have-criminal-histories-dhs-files,"Hundreds of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the southern border as part of massive migrant caravans were found to have criminal histories in the U.S., according to newly obtained Department of Homeland Security documents.

The DHS files were provided to House Oversight Committee Republicans in May and included internal data showing more than 1,000 migrants traveling as part of caravans to the border within the past nine months had âU.S. criminal historiesâ and hundreds had âU.S. criminal convictions.â

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

The files detailed one migrant caravan of nearly 8,000 individuals that started toward the border in October 2018 and arrived south of California by December. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 660 of them had U.S. criminal convictionsâwith 40 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and three convicted of murder.

In January 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracked another caravan that left Honduras with more than 3,300 migrants. ICEâs Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) team identified that 860 of those individuals had U.S. criminal histories, including more than 20 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, nearly 30 convicted of sexual offenses, two convicted of violence against law enforcement, and one convicted of attempted murder.

The documents, provided to House Oversight Republicans, also revealed that CBP is currently monitoring another âmovement of several groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 4,000â in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Veracruz, but did not specify how many of those migrants are believed to have criminal records.

In a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday, committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, requested further information about caravan members with criminal backgrounds to âassistâ in their âoversight of the crisis at the southern border and better understand the threat posed by large caravans.â

Jordan requested arrest warrants, court documents and other materials detailing the criminal histories of the migrants in the January 2019 and October 2018 caravan; an update of CBPâs monitoring of the caravan movement in Mexican states; and summaries of ICE HSI materials by July 5.

In his letter, Jordan referred to President Trumpâs decision in February to declare a national emergency and referred to his comments that the âsouthern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcoticsâ threatening âcore national security interests.â

The newly revealed DHS information comes amid a stunning surge across the border this year. Last month, the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border skyrocketed to levels not seen in over a decade, with CBP reporting nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissibleâmore than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. The number was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years, officials said.

âWe are in a full-blown emergency,â Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said earlier this month. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

FOOTAGE SHOWS MIGRANTS WALKING AROUND BORDER WALL TO ENTER US

McAleenan, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also warned that 90 percent of asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the U.S.

The continued crisis at the border comes as Trump has sought to extend and shore up the border wall, declaring a national emergency in a bid to divert billions toward construction -- an effort being challenged in the courts.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

Through the agreement, the U.S. is slated to extend its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. also committed to accelerating asylum claims while Mexico said it will âoffer jobs, healthcare, and education according to its principles.â

The deal also stated that Mexico will take âdecisive actionâ to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border.

Dominican Republic official pushes back as US State Department hikes number of American tourist deaths to 10,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://wtop.com/world/2019/06/dominican-republic-official-pushes-back-as-us-state-department-hikes-number-of-american-tourist-deaths-to-10/,"Dominican Republic Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia pushed back on reports of a pattern of suspicious deaths of American citizens Friday, as the U.S. State Department hiked the official number of Americans who have died there in the last year to 10.

(SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic) â Dominican Republic Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia pushed back on reports of a pattern of suspicious deaths of American citizens Friday, as the U.S. State Department hiked the official number of Americans who have died there in the last year to 10.

The tourism minister said the number of Americans who have died in the Dominican Republic has actually decreased this year, and that over the last three years there was a 56% reduction in the number of U.S. tourist deaths in the DR.

On Friday, the U.S. State Department confirmed the death of Mark Hurlbut in the Dominican Republic in June 2018.

State Department officials also recently announced that Thomas Jerome âJerryâ Curran of Bedford, Ohio, died on Jan. 26, 2019, while traveling in the Dominican Republic with his wife, Janet.

Curran, a retired police officer, and Hurlbut join a list of eight other people who have died in the Dominican Republic in the last year, including Yvette Monique Sport, who died in June 2018; David Harrison, who died in July 2018; and Robert Wallace, Miranda Schaupp-Werner, Cynthia Day, Nathaniel Holmes and Joseph Allen, who all died this year.

âTo say that an exaggerated number of Americans have died in the Dominican Republic, what some media have characterized as an avalanche of deaths, does not correspond with the reality that we are seeing today in the Dominican Republic,â Garcia said.

No link between the deaths has been established, and U.S. State Department officials say there has been no âuptickâ in American deaths in the Caribbean country.

The attorney for Holmes and Day, the couple who was found dead in their Dominican Republic hotel room in May, responded to Garciaâs press conference, saying, âWe will let the facts and medical reports tell the story. The family continues to mourn the death of their love ones.â

Dominican authorities have asked for the FBIâs help in conducting toxicology analyses in the investigation into the deaths of Schaupp-Werner, Day and Holmes. Garcia did not release any new information about the cases, including toxicology reports that might shed light on the touristsâ cause of death.

FBI officials have informed Dominican authorities that getting the results of the toxicology analyses could take up to 30 days, and it could be an additional two weeks until the results are released. Garcia said the reports so far have not been shared due to privacy concerns.

Speaking specifically about the case of Holmes and Day, Garcia said that because the Dominican Republic has ânothing to hide,â they asked the FBI to participate and to conduct an additional toxicity report.

Garcia said the Dominican Republicâs tourism industry has been a âmodelâ for the world because of its standards.

"Sonny Perdue turning back on USDA workers, rural Americans",https://www.kansascity.com,"['Kevin Hunt', 'Dave Trabert']",,,,https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article231849668.html,"Employees protest plan to move USDA jobs to Kansas City The USDAâs decision to move hundreds of research jobs out of Washington to Kansas City has triggered a backlash among federal employees. Employees stood in silent protest during a meeting about the move to Kansas City. Up Next Ã SHARE COPY LINK The USDAâs decision to move hundreds of research jobs out of Washington to Kansas City has triggered a backlash among federal employees. Employees stood in silent protest during a meeting about the move to Kansas City.

You may not know me, but I am one of you. I was born and raised on the outskirts of Columbia, Missouri, in a rural setting. I come from a farming family that harvested tobacco for generations on the same land where I took my earliest steps. I was a member of my local 4-H chapter and my father taught me how to grow crops. I learned my professional skills from undergraduate and graduate programs at the University of Missouri.

Iâm also one of the hundreds of United States Department of Agriculture employees who have been directed to relocate to a temporary workplace in Kansas City by Sept. 30, while the search for a permanent site in the area is conducted.

USDA employees are not the âbeltway elitesâ that Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue characterizes us as. Iâm one of you. My story at the USDAâs Economic Research Service, or ERS, is also not unique. Many of my colleagues came from the heartland to represent rural America right here in our national capital, 15 miles up the Potomac River from George Washingtonâs farm at Mount Vernon.

We are federal employees who are dedicated to our mission: âDo right and feed everyone.â We study the many issues affecting the diverse fabric of American agriculture and rural communities. We are longtime professionals: agricultural economists, social scientists, statisticians, nutritionists and geographers and more.

We are your family and former neighbors who moved out of town and still come home to visit. Our staff hails from Hawaii to Maine and nearly every place in between. Most are from small towns and farming communities. A majority of us, like myself, are from the Midwest and graduated from your regional colleges and universities.

The ERS is the kind of place that embodies the public service values we grew up with back home, and folks with our experiences help make Washington, D.C., work better and expand its perspectives. But Perdueâs plan doesnât make the USDA work better. It has created incredible dysfunction in federal service that did not exist prior to his announcement â an abrupt relocation to a still-unspecified location without public debate, comments or congressional approval.

During Perdueâs announcement of Kansas City as the new location for the ERS and the USDAâs National Institute for Food and Agriculture, we chose to turn our backs to him, to mirror the secretary â as he continues to turn his back on American farmers. His plan is silencing necessary research and analysis that our land grant universities, 1890s colleges, extension system and the private sector use on a daily basis to communicate critical data to American farmers. We are a voice in the capital for rural America, made up of rural Americans, bringing data-driven analysis to the public sphere.

We work at the USDA because we want to help farmers and everyone in the agricultural sector to make the best, most informed decisions they can. But by forcing this move on a rushed time line, Perdue is cutting us off at the knees.

When reporters asked Perdue how the relocation would personally impact his employees, he went off script long enough to reveal how seriously he takes us and our work by saying, âI understand that no one ever wants their cheese moved.â

If Kansas City doesnât slow down the current reckless speed of this move, youâll host the gutted shell of an agency that may never fully recover. You donât want that, and we donât want that.

Iâm one of you. As a son of the Show-Me State, I need leadership to show me why relocating us from Washington, D.C., is right for us and the Midwest. USDA employees just want the chance to do our vital jobs right, so that we can keep being a voice for rural America."
Would-be presidents canât wait to rule by fiat,https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2019/06/23/would-presidents-can-wait-rule-fiat/eyIbk5rwdfF2I3XyxQ1zTN/story.html,"Some of Klobucharâs promises are wholly conventional (âVisit our troopsâ) or matters of routine management (âReduce State Department vacanciesâ). A few are about as noteworthy as calling water wet (âFill judicial vacanciesâ).

âAfter four years of Donald Trump,â declared Senator Amy Klobuchar in a statement on Tuesday, âa new president canât wait for a bunch of congressional hearings to act.â To that end, the Minnesota Democrat, who hopes to become the new president in January 2021, issued a 16-page list of all the âconcrete steps she will take in her first 100 daysâ if she is elected to the White House.

Many, however, would represent real shifts in US policy. Klobucharâs pledges include the immediate importation of prescription drugs, a boost in the hourly minimum wage for federal contractors to $15, and a return to the Iran nuclear deal. Those arenât modest adjustments; they would significantly change the way the federal government currently operates. Obviously thatâs Klobucharâs objective â and for many voters, the undoing of President Trumpâs work canât begin soon enough.

But do Americans really want their government to operate on the basis of unilateral presidential decrees? When Klobuchar dismisses any thought of waiting âfor a bunch of congressional hearingsâ before upending the governmentâs priorities and principles, what she is really dismissing is the constitutional order, which puts Congress, not the president, in charge of changing US law. There is nothing ambiguous about Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution. âAll legislative powers,â it begins, âshall be vested in a Congress of the United States.â All â not just the ones a president isnât too impatient to wait for. Yet Congress is almost an afterthought in Klobucharâs approach.

The senator from Minnesota is far from alone. Most of the leading Democratic presidential candidates are vowing to bypass Congress and use executive orders to get what they want.

Senator Elizabeth Warren says that on her first day as president, sheâll order a âtotal moratoriumâ on new fossil fuel leases, closing the door to drilling for energy offshore and on public lands. Senator Bernie Sanders will ban companies that outsource American jobs from qualifying for federal contracts. Beto OâRourke would direct US officials to release from detention any undocumented immigrants with no criminal background. And Kamala Harris threatens an ultimatum: If members of Congress donât âget their act togetherâ and pass new gun-control laws within 100 days of her inauguration, she warns, she will impose the restrictions without them.

This tide of executive unilateralism rises with each incoming president.

George W. Bush authorized the use of âenhanced interrogation techniques,â including waterboarding and other practices widely considered torture, notwithstanding the prohibition of torture under longstanding US law and treaty. Barack Obama insisted many times that he had no authority on his own to waive the deportation of youthful undocumented immigrants â but then did so anyway by executive order in 2012. After Congress refused to fund a massive wall on the Mexican border, Trump declared that a national emergency empowered him to spend the money just the same.

For every such high-profile example of a president making law by edict, many more occur out of the spotlight. Increasingly, the vast powers of the federal bureaucracy are deployed not as Congress directs through legislation, but as presidents command through executive order. One of the first priorities of each incoming president now is to sign a slew of new directives countermanding the old ones. Before Trump entered the White House, he excoriated his predecessor for âconstantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs.â That hasnât stopped him from spending the last 30 months engaged in power grabs of his own. It wonât stop his successor from going even further.

This is not a partisan complaint. Democrats and Republicans are equal offenders. Presidents are growing more and more autocratic, and that should alarm all Americans, whatever their political leanings. âThe natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground,â Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1788. Could even he have imagined, though, just how much liberty Americans would eventually yield? Or just how much power they would allow presidents to amass?

There was a time when even the most dominant presidents took it for granted that they could not simply act without regard to Congress. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln had no choice but to move unilaterally, since the nation was under attack and Congress was out of session. But as soon as legislators returned to Washington, he took pains to secure congressional legitimacy for his actions. The same was true of Franklin Roosevelt. âEven through the World Wars and Depression,â writes Bruce Cannon Gibney in The Nonsense Factory , his sweeping new study of Americaâs legal system, âFDR accomplished most of his work through Congress . . . returning time and again to Congress and voters for support.â

Todayâs presidents and would-be presidents, by contrast, make no secret of their intention to sidestep Congress. We can keep letting them get away with it. But an ever-more-overbearing presidency is not a recipe for American happiness. If that isnât clear yet, just wait.

Chip stocks fall after Commerce Dept bars 5 more Chinese companies from buying US parts,https://www.cnbc.com,['Yun Li'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/chip-stocks-fall-after-commerce-dept-bars-5-more-chinese-firms-from-buying-us-parts.html,"The U.S. Commerce Department has banned five more Chinese entities from buying U.S. components after blacklisting telecom giant Huawei last month.

Higon, Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit, Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology, Sugon and Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology are the five Chinese firms added to the department's entity list, according to a filing.

The department said the activities of these companies ""pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.""

Shares of U.S. semiconductors came under pressure after the announcement. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled more than 3%, while Xilinx and Nvidia also fell 2.2% and 1.5%, respectively.

The move came before President Donald Trump's key meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit this month to discuss the lingering trade differences. The U.S. and China have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods, while ramping up tit-for-tat threats in the ongoing trade war.

The Commerce Department said Sugon and the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology are the leaders in China's development of exascale high-performance computing.

Sugon has publicly acknowledged ""a variety of military end uses and end users of its high-performance computers,"" the department said. Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology's mission is ""to support China's military modernization,"" the department noted.

The U.S. restrictions on Huawei have forced many American chipmakers and tech companies including Google to cut ties with the Chinese giant. Huawei's U.S. chip suppliers, including Qualcomm and Intel, are reportedly quietly lobbying to ease the Huawei ban."

Global Entry is a Customs and Border Protection program that ""allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival"" in the US. The Trusted Traveler Programs website , which includes Global Entry, already has an alert warning applicants that the ""extended partial government shutdown has resulted in a backlog,"" of applications and renewals.

The personnel shift comes amid a swell of migrant families and children that have arrived at the US border this year. The influx has strained DHS immigration resources and caused concerns about overcrowding and delayed US Border Patrol processing.

In response to efforts at the border, ""CBP is temporarily reducing staff at Global Entry Enrollment Centers nationwide and reassigning them to support frontline traveler processing during the busy summer months,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

""Regrettably, this situation has forced the cancellation of some scheduled appointments and may make it difficult to schedule an immediate interview,"" the statement said.

â A bright, white dot spotted over the Dayton area and numerous suburbs of the city could be part of the U.S. Department of Defenseâs Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, also known as DARPA.

>> Live Doppler 7 Radar

âDARPA launched three balloons from Cumberland, Maryland, in a flight test for the Adaptable Lighter Than Air Program,â said Heather Babb, spokeswoman for the Department of Defense. âALTA will demonstrate capability for wind-borne navigation of a lighter-than-air vehicle over extended ranges.â

>> PREVIOUS: What was that bright, white dot hanging over parts of the Miami Valley?

Babb stopped short of confirming that the bright, white dot spotted by numerous News Center 7 viewers was indeed a DARPA balloon, however another spokesperson for DARPA said given the location it was likely one of their balloons.

Sightings of the object were reported Tuesday to News Center 7 from viewers in Xenia, Englewood, West Milton, West Carrollton and Eaton.

DARPAâs ALTA programâs balloons can fly at altitudes of more than 75,000 feet.

âWhile they do not have independent propulsion, the ALTA vehicle is designed to navigate by changing altitude and thus taking advantage of different wind profiles aloft,â according to DARPAâs website.

DARPA dates back to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and also has played roles in precision weapons and stealth technology, and other technology advances such as the Internet, automated voice recognition, language transition and GPS.

DARPA is comprised of about 220 government employees in six technical offices, who oversee about 250 research and development programs."
EPA to connect Loudoun homes contaminated by landfill to public water,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://wtop.com/loudoun-county/2019/06/epa-to-connect-loudoun-homes-contaminated-by-landfill-to-public-water/,"The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with Loudoun County and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of drinking water contamination in the Board Run Farms community that was first discovered in 1989.

More than 120 properties in the Broad Run Farms community affected by Hidden Lane Landfill superfund site groundwater contamination will be hooked up to the public water system by the federal Environmental Protestion Agency, according to Virginiaâs Loudoun County.

The construction wonât cost property owners a dime but it will cost the agency millions.

The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with both the county and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of Broad Run Farms drinking water contamination first discovered in 1989.

The chemical that was discovered is called trichloroethylene, or TCE. According to the National Toxicology Program (an interagency group coordinated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), itâs primarily used in two ways: to make hydrofluorocarbon chemicals, especially refrigerants, and as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts.

The NIH also says itâs a known carcinogen and can increase the risk of cancer.

âWe are grateful to the EPA for this decision and while we advocated for the extension of public water to the entire Broad Run Farms community, this is a significant action that will benefit those residents most directly impacted in the community,â Algonkian District Supervisor Suzanne Volpe, who represents the area on the Board of Supervisors, said in a Thursday news release.

âI would also like to commend the dedicated and long-term efforts of Loudoun County staff as well as the Virginia Department of Health and the Department of Environmental Quality for getting us to this milestone.â

Thereâs no word yet on when construction of the new water lines is slated to begin.

Justice Dept review of intel in Russia probe fuels fears of politicization,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-review-of-intelligence-in-russia-probe-fuels-fears-of-politicization/,"A mix of concern, confusion and defiance has spread through elements of the intelligence community as a murky picture emerges of Attorney General William Barr's review of its investigative and analytical work on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In particular, current and former intelligence officials are questioning the purpose and propriety of the attorney general's intention, first reported by The New York Times, to enlist John Durham, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut, in scrutinizing the analytical judgments that led a group of agencies to conclude that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign to boost then-candidate Trump's electability.

That judgment, put forth in a declassified Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) commissioned by former president Barack Obama and released in January 2017, pooled the findings of the CIA, FBI and NSA. The CIA and FBI expressed ""high confidence"" in that conclusion, while the NSA had ""moderate confidence.""

""I see no problem with a DOJ review of whether the CIA and other intelligence community agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities related to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons â U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals,"" said Michael Morell, a former CIA deputy director who is a CBS News senior national security contributor. ""Having said that, I see a DOJ review of whether or not the intelligence analysts made the right call as wholly inappropriate. I cannot ever remember a DOJ review of analysis.""

""[Durham] and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis,"" Morell said. ""He and his team could well impose a law enforcement standard in coming to a conclusion â a much higher bar than exists in the intelligence community for analytic judgments.""

Both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have already examined the process by which the ICA was assembled and offered their declassified assessments.

In their March 2018 final report on Russia's active measures, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee â without describing what kind of evidence was examined â said ""most"" of the ICA's analysis ""held up to scrutiny."" But they criticized its judgment on Putin's strategic objectives for having ""failed to meet most of the analytic standards set forth in the primary guiding document for IC analysis."" (The committee's Democrats dissented from that view.)

That document â Intelligence Community Directive 203 â stipulates, among other things, that analytic products should be ""objective,"" ""timely,"" and ""independent of political consideration.""

But in July, the Senate Intelligence Committee â whose leadership has maintained a vastly more united and bipartisan front than the fractious panel in the House â issued a declassified summary of a months-long assessment that found the ICA to be a ""sound intelligence product."" The committee said it had reviewed ""thousands of pages of source documents and conducted interviews with all the relevant parties â including agency heads, managers, and line analysts â who were involved in developing the analysis and drafting the assessment.""

""In all the interviews of those who drafted and prepared the ICA, the Committee heard consistently that analysts were under no politically motivated pressure to reach any conclusions,"" the summary said. ""All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content, and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process.""

Analytical disagreement, the committee said, was ""reasonable, transparent, and openly debated.""

The Senate panel is expected to release a declassified version of a far more extensive report on the ICA in the coming months, though the bulk of their assessment is likely to remain classified.

Asked whether the Justice Department's review was duplicative of the panel's work, a spokeswoman for the Senate Intelligence Committee declined to comment.

Morell said a DOJ probe into analysts' conclusions could have a ""chilling effect"" on the analytic process.

""Any analyst asked to submit to an interview with Durham's investigators will want to have their own personal attorney at their side,"" he said. ""Imagine that â needing an attorney to explain an analytic judgment.""

""This will all be watched closely inside the IC and the prospect that DOJ prosecutors may ask questions about how an analyst came to a conclusion could well lead analysts to demur,"" Morell said.

A Democratic House Intelligence Committee official who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing, sensitive matters said the panel had engaged at multiple levels with multiple intelligence agencies and had ""heard a sense of anxiety"" and ""palpable unease.""

The official expressed concern that ""purposeful overreach"" by DOJ could undermine what have been shown to be sound conclusions, and that normal differences of opinion raised in the course of discussion that would go into crafting an analytical judgment could be exploited for political purposes.

In this case, the official said, in what could be a politically motivated effort to score-settle with former CIA Director John Brennan â has been sharply critical of President Trump â routine, healthy discussion could be cast as Brennan putting his thumb on the scale.

""There is no evidence that was the case. These assessments have withstood continued scrutiny for more than two years, and have only been buttressed by continued analysis and collection,"" the official said.

A spokesman for Mr. Brennan declined to comment. The CIA and NSA declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The House Intelligence Committee's Democratic chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said at the National Press Club this week that he had met personally with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, but the committee has otherwise had ""very little visibility"" into the scope and progress of the review. A Senate Intelligence Committee official also said that panel was in close communication with the intelligence community and similarly had not been offered details about the review beyond the contents of a letter the Department of Justice sent earlier this month.

In its letter, sent in response to an earlier inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee, DOJ indicated the review was ""broad in scope and multifaceted, and is intended to illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals."" It did not explicitly mention a review of analytic processes or the ICA itself."
DOJ investigating Jared Kushner transactions in Deutsche Bank money-laundering probe,https://www.salon.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/20/doj-investigating-jared-kushner-transactions-in-deutsche-bank-money-laundering-probe/,"The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into potential money laundering by Deutsche Bank, including transactions linked to White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.

The investigation apparently centers on why Deutsche Bank officials failed to alert the Treasury Department about potentially suspicious transactions by Kushnerâs family and company in 2016, including transactions involving Russian individuals, the New York Times reports.

Reportedly, bank officials did not submit the reports to Treasury, even though its employees prepared ""suspicious activity"" reports on the Kushner transactions and others. A spokesperson for Kushner Cos., the family's real estate corporation, told the Times that the firm is not under investigation.

The DOJ has already contacted Tammy McFadden, a former anti-money-laundering compliance officer at the bank who told the Times in May that she flagged transactions involving Kushnerâs company but that her superiors had declined to file the suspicious activity reports with the federal government.

Some of McFaddenâs colleagues had similar experiences in 2017 when they flagged transactions by entities owned by President Trump. It is unclear whether the FBI is investigating the bankâs handling of those transactions, according to the Times' report.

Congressional Democrats have already received some files from Deutsche Bank as they probe the bankâs dealings with Trump. Deutsche Bank was the only mainstream financial institution willing to lend Trump money after a series of high-profile bankruptcies and defaults in the 1990s. The bank lent him more than $2 billion over the last two decades, including $350 million that Trump still owes, the Times reported.

Two House committees have subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records related to Trump but the president sued to block the bank from turning the files over. A federal judge rejected Trumpâs request to block the subpoena and the president's lawyers are currently appealing that ruling.

Deutsche Bank has been under a DOJ investigation since 2015, according to the Times, when agents probed the bankâs role in laundering money for wealthy Russians. The bank was hit with steep fines in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, but has not faced any criminal charges. The DOJ expanded its investigation last fall.

McFadden told the Times last month that she was fired by Deutsche Bank last year after raising concerns over the bankâs practices and has since filed complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.

On Wednesday, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) also called on the Federal Reserve System to investigate whether Deutsche Bank had violated the law by refusing to submit the suspicious activity reports on the Kushner and Trump transactions.

âDeutsche Bankâs careless attitude towards banking compliance laws and failure to police its accounts may now be impacting American government at the highest levels,â said CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder. âQuestions about transactions between President Trump and foreign actors whose conduct seemingly warranted suspicious activity reports, potentially facilitated by Deutsche Bank, harms the public legitimacy of the institution of the presidency itself.â"
Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress,https://thehill.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449626-former-epa-staffer-says-wheeler-lied-congress,"A longtime former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staffer is accusing Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump proposal would nix agency reviews of long-term climate impacts | Greens rip decision | House votes to block offshore drilling for one year Overnight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress MORE of lying in a letter he wrote to Congress Thursday that denied agency staff were shut out as EPA developed a controversial rollback on Obama-era fuel standards.

Critics of the rollback have long contended that the EPA sidelined its Office of Transportation and Air Quality when developing the rule. The office is home to the agencyâs in-house lab for testing vehicles emissions.

Wheeler denied that accusation this week, but Jeff Alson, a former senior policy advisor to that office, said Wheeler is not telling the truth.

âI know that is a lie because I was there. I was one of 20 people at EPA working on this for a decade,â Alson told The Hill. Alson retired in April of last year after working 40 years at the agency.

The issue of sidelined staffers came to a head as lawmakers probed the stalled negotiations between EPA and California, which has long had more stringent standards for vehicle fuel economy and is fighting the EPA rollback.

As lawmakers grilled EPA officials over the failed negotiation, the EPA delivered a letter from Wheeler that blamed California for the standstill.

It also accused the stateâs negotiator, California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols, of incorrectly saying the Office of Transportation and Air Quality were shut out of the rulemaking process.

""Her testimony that EPA professional staff were cut out of this proposal's development is false,"" Wheeler wrote.

Alson said the administration has denied pushing aside career staff before, but he found this instance particularly grievous.

âTo see it in a formal letter that was given to Congress and to specifically accuse someone else of lying when in reality that person was being truthful and when Administrator Wheeler was the one doing the lying, it just put me beyond the point of no return,â he said.

The EPA said Wheeler's letter speaks for itself.

""Career, professional staff within the Office of Air and Radiation were involved in the development of the proposal and continue to be involved in the final stages as we work with NHTSA to finalize this rule,"" a spokesperson said in an email to The Hill.

A key pillar of former President Obama's environmental legacy involved strengthening fuel emissions standards for cars to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2026. But Trump's rollback would freeze the average fuel economy at 37 mpg.

Alson said his office did have two or three âcheck the boxâ meetings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the other agency involved in drafting the rollback, but he said the agency did not collaborate with his EPA office in developing the standards and would not share any of their information with the EPA.

âNHTSA would say nothing about what they were assuming. They wouldnât give us a copy of their models, they wouldnât share their assumptions, they wouldnât share their projections of how much the standards were going to cost,â he said. âThey wouldnât give us anything.â

When Bill Wehrum, EPAâs head of the Office of Air and Radiation, appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thursday, several Democrats questioned him about the role of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality.

Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress Democrats grill Trump officials over fuel standard rollback MORE (D-N.Y.) pointed a Government Accountability Office report that said, âNHTSA cannot be expected to have the same level of in-house expertise related to vehicle power train design and environmental issues as EPA.â

When Tonko pressed Wehrum on the Office of Air and Radiationâs involvement, Wehrum said their work with NHTSA was a âvery powerful combination.â

âEPA has had a substantial amount of involvement,â Wehrum said.

Alson said retirement has freed him to talk in ways his colleagues who still work at the EPA cannot. He has been vocal in his opposition to the rollbacks, including penning an op-ed in The Hill, but said he has held back from addressing inaccuracies from administrator's until now.

âThe truth is Mary Nichols is telling the truth and Administrator Wheeler is lying, and itâs shameful and it breaks my heart that the man that heads up the agency where I worked for 40 years and spent my life trying to make the world a little bit better can blatantly lie to the American public.â"
Trump tells Fox News DOJ looking into whether his phone calls were monitored,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'President Trump', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hannity-campaign-launch-justice-department-phone-calls-monitored,"One day after formally launching his 2020 presidential bid, President Trump told Fox News' ""Hannity"" exclusively on Wednesday that investigators are working to determine whether his personal phone calls were secretly monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 campaign -- a possibility he called ""the ultimate.""

Trump also hammered House Democrats for putting his former top communication advisor Hope Hicks ""through hell,"" after pictures of Hicks testifying before a closed-door session on Capitol Hill earlier in the day leaked on social media.

Hicks is the Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer for Fox Corporation, and Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation.

""What's happened to the Democrats -- and in the meantime, they're not doing any work in Congress,"" Trump told Sean Hannity, calling the party ""unhinged.""

""They're not allowed to do that. It's probably illegal,"" Trump said, referring to the leaked pictures of Hicks. Some Democrats complained that Hicks, in her appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, was ordered by the White House to stay quiet about her time as an aide to Trump, citing legal privileges.

But, Trump condemned Democrats' ongoing hearings on collusion and obstruction as an attempt at a ""do-over"" of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Take a look at Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""How come the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC? Just think about that one, Sean."" That was a reference to the DNC's decision in 2016 to turn over its server to the private security firm Crowdstrike, rather than the FBI, after what prosecutors said was a Russian-led hack.

The Hill's John Solomon reported earlier Wednesday that the FBI, in search warrant affidavits, relied heavily on leaked Ukrainian financial documents concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- even though the bureau was repeatedly warned that the documents were untrustworthy and likely fake.

Earlier this year, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko opened a probe into the so-called ""black ledger"" files that led to Manafort's abrupt departure from the Trump campaign. The investigation commenced after an unearthed audio recording showed that a senior Ukrainian anticorruption official apparently admitted to leaking Manafort's financial information in 2016 -- including his ties to pro-Russian actors in Ukraine -- to benefit Clinton.

CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' TRUMP SAYS

A Ukrainian court recently ruled that the Manafort leak amounted to illegal interference in the U.S. election. A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one."" â President Trump

Trump told Hannity the episode was hardly surprising, given that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), through the firm Fusion GPS, funded British ex-spy Christopher Steele's creation of an unverified and largely discredited dossier. The FBI went on to cite the dossier in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

""I think it's a disgrace,"" Trump said.

Numerous issues with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Mueller's report made plain, for example, that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

""The fact is, they were spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies to do it. ... We're trying to figure out whether they listened to my calls. That would be the ultimate. We'll see what happens. If that happens, we'll probably find out. If they spied on my campaign and they may have, it will be one of the great revelations in history of this country. It will be very interesting. I think we're gonna find out.""

Trump said Attorney General Bill Barr is working ""very hard"" to get to the bottom the matter.

DOJ INVESTIGATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AS PART OF ONGOING REVIEW OF FBI MISCONDUCT

The lengthy phone conversation began with Trump recounting the Tuesday night launch of his campaign in the jam-packed Amway Center in Orlando. Thousands of Trump supporters arrived more than 40 hours in advance to secure a spot, despite sweltering Florida heat. Some had been camped in chairs for several nights.

""It was an incredible scene -- and outside there were thousands of people,"" Trump told Hannity, comparing the atmosphere to that of a national college football championship. ""It was just an electric evening. ... It's a tailgate party for our country.""

Trump noted that the U.S. has become ""number one in the world in energy,"" referring to the fact that the U.S. is the world's leading crude oil producer. The head of the International Energy Agency said in 2018 that, because of the ""shale revolution,"" the U.S. ""is becoming the undisputed leader of oil and gas production worldwide.â

The positive economic indicators, Trump said, have led Democrats to desperately pivot to discussing obstruction, now that Mueller's report found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign, despite multiple efforts by Russian-linked actors to involve the Trump team in its hacking efforts.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one,"" Trump said, before touting his administration's economic successes. ""We have the best, lowest unemployment rate for blacks, Asians, Hispanics -- nobody's ever seen numbers like this... If the other side had won, we'd have gone into a depression.

""We have more poeple working today -- almost 160 million people -- than have ever worked in the history of our country,"" Trump added. ""Think of it -- it's a great number.""

Trump also denied a Wall Street Journal report that he will live-tweet the upcoming Democrat primary debates, but suggested it might not be a bad idea.

""Instead of fake news, I'll make them correct news -- and maybe that's OK,"" Trump joked.

""When I make a speech, like last night -- there was a fantastic woman in the front with a sign, 'Please keep tweeting, it matters,'"" Trump continued. ""And, I think it does matter. I don't do it because I enjoy it. When somebody says an outright lie on MSNBC or CNN ... I can counteract those lies, and I have many more followers than they do."""
"A worthless degree? Betsy DeVos wants to change rules for which colleges stay open, close",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Chris Quintana', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/06/21/college-closing-accreditation-betsy-devos-u-s-department-education/1505318001/,"CLOSE Trump's education secretary's plans for reforming U.S. education revolve around charter schools and vouchers. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

Going to Brightwood College in the 2018 fall semester was supposed to be a safe bet. So thousands of students enrolled across the country.

For those students and others, a degree is supposed to be a lifeline. They sink in time and money that could be spent in the workforce, all for the prospect of higher earnings and a more fulfilling career.

But Brightwood studentsâ investment didnât pay off. Whatâs more, a regulatory group had signed off on the collegeâs programs â only to change its mind.

Accreditation, as itâs called, is meant to prevent predatory or shoddy schools from leading students astray. And the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had given its signal to students that Brightwood was a worthwhile investment.

Yet in December 2018, the agency revoked the accreditation of Education Corp. of America, which ran the Brightwood locations and other colleges across the country. The closures of dozens of institutions followed swiftly. Students had spent the time and money but still had no degrees and no clear path forward.

Don't be one of them: A college closed, leaving thousands without a degree. How to keep it from happening to you

Many of them still struggle. In a Facebook group for students of the closed college, some commiserate over what they call worthless degrees. Others try to give advice about how to get their student loan discharged or receive their transcripts.

Whatâs more, the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had a checkered history itself. President Barack Obama's administration had moved to strip it of its powers to OK school programs, but after a legal battle, President Donald Trump's administration undid that move.

The Education Corp. of America colleges were just some of the institutions that suddenly closed in recent years. ITT Tech closed in 2016. Corinthian Colleges did the same in 2015. Both had been accredited by ACICS. The accrediting group said it gave multiple warnings, but the colleges weren't able to meet its standards.

What happened?: The trouble at for-profit colleges, in 5 graphs

Now, the Education Department is looking to change the arcane and bureaucratic process of accreditation.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and accreditors of universities say new rules will ultimately allow colleges to offer programs more quickly and effectively. That means students landing a job in fields that are hiring, they say.

âWith these reforms, our nationâs colleges and universities can spend more time and effort on serving students and less time, energy, and money focused on bureaucratic compliance,â DeVos said in a statement.

Critics of the newly proposed rules say they would make it easier for shady colleges to operate for longer and with less federal oversight.

Many colleges are already doing a poor job of preparing students, said Clare McCann of the think tank New America. Giving them more latitude under the guise of innovation may lead to students taking chances on junk programs, she argued.

âWhat these regulations really do is make it so it is much harder to hold those schools accountable,â McCann said.

If anything, the government should hold these agencies to a higher standard, she said.

The public has until July 12 to give feedback on the proposed changes. Hereâs what you should know.

Did your college close? Why Brightwood College, Virginia College closed â and what students should do

What is accreditation?

To receive federal money, universities must meet the quality standards of an accrediting organization. According to the Education Department, these agencies ensure schools have âqualified instructors, an adequate curriculum, and necessary support servicesâ for students. In other words, theyâre meant to prevent students from ending up with worthless degrees.

Accreditation can essentially be seen as a seal of quality for students, the government and even future employers. And students atunaccredited colleges canât access federal money in the form of student loans.

The government doesnât directly accredit schools, but the Department of Education does decide who is and isnât fit to be an accreditor. The new rules were agreed upon by department officials, accreditors, college leaders and students during several negotiation sessions.

Whatâs the Education Department trying to do?

Among the changes, the proposed rules would allow colleges to offer new programs with less scrutiny from accreditors. The idea is that colleges could see a hole in the workforce and quickly come up with a new degree or credential to fill it. Accrediting agencies and for-profit colleges like this proposed change.

Under the current rules, it may take months to make changes to a programâs curriculum, said Judith Eaton, president of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The group is made up of 3,000 colleges, and it focuses on accreditation. The new rules, she argued, would mean a less onerous process for accreditors when dealing with the federal government. And, she said, the new rules may make it so that universities feel free to experiment with, for example, new credentialing programs or increased online courses.

If a college or accrediting group abused the new rules, the Education Department should crack down quickly, she said.

What about colleges that fail?

The proposed rules would also allow schools that have failed to meet accreditation standards up to four years to fix their problems â double the previous amount of two years. The rationale? These changes sometimes take a long time, and allowing the university to fix a problem may lead to more students graduating.

Closing an underperforming college right away, in contrast, may leave those students without an education and nowhere to go to finish their degree.

That is a change welcomed by Nicholas Kent, a vice president at Career Education Colleges and Universities, a group of for-profit colleges.

Critics have said the measure may allow bad colleges to do more damage, but Kent called that description âdisingenuous,â saying different programs will have different needs. A nine-month certificate program, he said, will need less time to fix a problem compared with a 6-year-doctoral program.

And he said accreditors are not required to give four years to everyone. Instead, they have the discretion to do so, and they can set up other check-ins.

But allowing a bad institution to operate longer may mean more students attend the failing institution, wasting time and money. And it could cost taxpayers more money because the school could continue to get federal grants and loans, Antoinette Flores, an associate director at the liberal Center for American Progress, has argued.

Plus, she said, the proposed rules could make it easier for outside entities to buy failing colleges. The Department of Education wants to limit a new owner's liability.

âIn practice, that means weâre never going to see any of these institutions going away,â Flores said. âThat increases the likelihood weâre recycling failed, toxic assets in the system, and weâre never really getting rid of the lowest performances.â

What happens next?

Want to review the proposed rules yourself? Visit the Federal Register, where the proposal is available in its entirety.

The period for public comment ends July 12, so if you have an opinion, file it on the Federal Register's website.

Any rule changes would follow the public comment period.

Shocker: DOJ Files Suit to Block Quad From Acquiring LSC Communications,https://www.piworld.com,['Mark Michelson'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.piworld.com/article/shocker-doj-files-suit-to-block-quad-from-acquiring-lsc-communications/,"In what many printing industry observers, including myself, view as a shocking development, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Antitrust Div., filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on June 20 seeking to block Quadâs proposed $1.4 billion, all-stock acquisition of LSC Communications.

According to an article published by CTFN that quoted a person with inside knowledge of negotiations which were in process to reach a settlement agreement, ""As early as the morning of June 20, the DOJ was prepared to approve the merger with divestitures, but Quad's lawyers pushed back on the package."" The same individual also reportedly indicated that some type of resolution could still be presented, at some point, that would meet DOJ approval.

However, the DOJ lawsuit (click here to read the full complaint) on the surface appears very adamant about its opposition to the proposed merger of the two companies, and doesn't specifically divulge what divestitures would be required, if any, for the antitrust regulatory agency to ultimately approve the deal.

If the transaction is not consummated by Oct. 30, 2019 â or if there is a final, non-appealable court order preventing the acquisition â either Quad or LSC can terminate their merger agreement. In this case, Quad would also be required to pay LSC a âregulatory approval reverse termination feeâ of $45 million.

The DOJ complaint maintains that the transaction would combine the only two significant U.S. providers of magazine; catalog; and education and one-color trade book printing services, denying publishers and retailers throughout the country the benefits of competition that has spurred lower prices, improved quality, and greater printing output.

âAmerican publishers and retailers rely on Quad and LSC to print and distribute billions of magazines, catalogs, and books each year,â said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, of the DOJâs Antitrust Div., in a statement. âLSC is Quadâs primary competitor. If this deal were allowed to proceed, Quad would dominate the markets for magazine, catalog, and book printing services, and be able to raise prices and reduce quality at the expense of publishers, retailers, and, ultimately, American consumers.â

The lawsuit also contends that Quad/LSCâs gravure (Quad is the only remaining gravure long-run publication printer) and web offset printing and distribution resources vastly exceed those of their competitors, making them ""the only realistic options for many publishers and retailers.""

The DOJ complaint, which also cited several examples, alleges that Quadâs proposed acquisition of LSC would put an end to the âprice warâ between the two head-to-head competitors and allow the combined company to dominate the magazine; catalog; and education and one-color trade book printing markets.

They bid aggressively against each other by leveraging their scale and scope, and by undercutting one anotherâs prices, the DOJ complaint argued. This has led to reduced margins, which ultimately led Quad and LSC to contemplate a merger. ""As LSC [chairman, president and] CEO Tom Quinlan remarked to investors mere months before the current deal was announced, combining LSC and Quad would eliminate 'battle[s]' between the two and could help lead to '[p]ricing stability,'â the DOJ indicated.

The DOJ complaint specifically quotes internal presentations and emails describing the level of intense competition that exists between Quad and LSC:

Internal documents outline the âtwo-horse race between LSC and Quad.â

A Quad internal presentation explained, âwe are the only printer other than LSC that can offer the largest publishers a complete solution.â

Executives observed a publisher âexploiting the fact that LSC [and] Quad[âs] CEOs want to beat each other into oblivion.â

A senior Quad executive remarked of LSC, âWeâve been in a price war with them for some time. Donât see that changing.â

After hearing news of the merger, one Quad executive reflected on a recent battle between it and LSC and remarked, âI admit, in the case of [a large customer] Iâm taking significant satisfaction in the news ... Iâm sure itâs a bitter pill for them to swallow.â

Quad and LSC Will Defend Their Case Vigorously

For their part, Sussex, Wis.-based Quad and Chicago-based LSC plan to fight the ruling ""vigorously,"" arguing that their merger would create a highly efficient print manufacturing and distribution platform that will strengthen the role of print in an increasingly multichannel media world dominated by digital advertising.

âThe DOJâs position ignores the dynamic conditions in the U.S. commercial printing industry, which consists of nearly 50,000 companies, generates an estimated $76 billion in aggregate annual revenues, and provides ample competition for the supply of printed products, especially in the face of decreasing demand,"" Joel Quadracci, Quad chairman, president and CEO, said in a release issued by Quad. ""Neither Quad nor LSC accounts for more than 5% of that total print industry revenue. By comparison, two digital media companies, Google and Facebook alone, have worldwide digital ad sale revenues totaling more than $75 billion â nearly the same amount as the entire printing industry.

""This underscores a key point: Our competition is not only other printers, but also other forms of media. Quad is in the business of manufacturing advertising and, therefore, is a direct competitor to digital channels,"" Quadracci added. ""Given the continued migration of advertising dollars to digital channels, the printing industry has pursued platform consolidations as a key way to eliminate inefficient and expensive overcapacity, streamline operations and create the efficiencies. This will help ensure print remains an economically feasible alternative to digital channels for publishers and retailers.

""Our goal is to make print a more effective and affordable media option to that of digital giants such as Google and Facebook. The DOJ does not appear to recognize the competitive effect of digital media on the print industry.""

Similarly, LSC issued a statement contending why the merger would benefit the companiesâ clients:

There is significant excess capacity in the printing industry today and this transaction would improve efficiencies and lower printing costs;

Many printers have the capability to print the same jobs as LSC Communications or Quad and successfully compete with both companies on quality and price;

Barriers to expansion and entry in the printing business are low and printers can easily expand their production capacity through acquisitions or with modest capital expenditures on equipment and facilities that are readily available; and

The trend toward digital substitution increases competition and disincentives price increases.

âWe believe that the DOJ is wrong in its assessment of our transaction and that its action is counterproductive, especially in the context of the industry trends and continued consolidation,"" LSC Chairman, President and CEO Quinlan said. ""We continue to believe that our proposed combination will provide an overall more efficient experience for our clients.""

What Were the Stumbling Blocks for Approval?

As reported by Printing Impressions earlier, apparently one of the DOJ's issues was the fact that Quad is the only remaining printer with rotogravure printing capabilities suited for long-run (1 million or more copies) publication printing. More likely, though, what DOJ considered is the dominant position the combined entities would have on the mailing and distribution side of the business.

In May 2018, LSC announced its acquisition of RR Donnelley's Print Logistics business. That followed on the heels of its July 2017 acquisition of Fairrington Transportation, a mailing and logistics provider. And, in November of last year, it purchased The Clark Group, a third-party logistics provider of distribution, consolidation, transportation management and international freight forwarding services.

As one savvy reader commented to Printing Impressions, ""Unless the DOJ intercedes, Quad is going to have a virtual monopoly on mail consolidation such as co-mail, co-pal and cross-docking, and also on newsstand distribution. Other than a small company here or there, nobody else has the kind of firepower that Quad will have.

""I should point out that other printers have long relied on RRD/LSC/Quad or companies they have recently acquired, like Fairrington or The Clark Group, for these distribution services,"" he added. ""Let's face it, Quad is not paying for the merger via synergies by combining Quad with LSC. They will pay for it by charging more for distribution of printed product. They can â and will â muscle their smaller competitors out of business to take the work that fits their platform.

""These are the conversations I have had with competitors in the printing business and partners in the publishing world. But because we all will rely on Quad for these services, we can only hope and pray the DOJ intercedes some how,"" he concluded.

For now, the wish of that printer appears to have been granted. And, one can only wonder about the amount of turmoil that must now be occurring internally within the Quad and LSC organizations, as well as among their respective customer bases. For some time now the companies undoubtedly have been preparing their internal operations and advising their external customer bases in preparation for the merger they assumed would happen. But now, with this latest development, everything remains up in the air as to whether or not the deal will ultimately be consummated.

In the end, that's not good for Quad nor LSC. Nor is that sense of uncertainty good for an industry as a whole that â at least from the perspective of Wall Street and Main Street â is already facing a large degree of uncertainty and upheaval."
"Trump EPA snubs carbon capture, an emissions reduction technique favored by environmentalists and Republicans",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trump-epa-snubs-carbon-capture-an-emissions-reduction-technique-favored-by-environmentalists-and-republicans,"The Trump Environmental Protection Agency is dismissing a technology that is favored by many Republicans and is widely considered to be among the most effective at slashing emissions from coal plants.

EPAâs Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, rule, finalized last week to replace President Barack Obama's signature climate change rule, the Clean Power Plan, does not include carbon capture and storage, also known as CCS, in a list of six technologies that utilities can consider to reduce carbon emissions and make their plants more efficient by burning less coal to produce the same amount of electricity.

The snub of carbon capture, critics say, shows the agency is not serious about combating climate change.

""Based on the rejection of CCS, it's hard to conclude the EPA leadership takes the job of regulating carbon pollution seriously,â said Julio Friedmann, a researcher who studies carbon capture at the Center for Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Friedmann was formerly principal deputy assistant of the Energy Departmentâs Office of Fossil Energy in the Obama administration.

Carbon capture technology removes carbon dioxide from a power plant's exhaust, so as to not release it into the atmosphere, and traps the emissions underground.

The EPA argues carbon capture has not been âadequately demonstratedâ on a commercial scale and is too expensive.

âOur view of the law is that when states develop emissions limits, it cannot be based on carbon capture,â an EPA senior official told reporters on a press call this week.

To be sure, carbon capture is not considered very energy efficient. It requires a chunk of the energy produced by the power plant to run the capture and storage process. So to include carbon capture as part of a rule that aims to bolster coal plant efficiency doesn't make sense.

âCCS could help continued participation of a coal unit, but not because it makes a unit more efficient,â said Christi Tezak, a managing director at ClearView, an energy research group.

But the problem, critics say, is that the EPA is wrong to only accept efficiency improvements at coal plants, because it's an insufficient way to reduce carbon emissions.

The administration explicitly rejected the more expansive approach of the Obama administrationâs Clean Power Plan that would have required utilities to move away from coal and switch to natural gas or renewables in order to meet a national emissions limit. The ACE rule does not set any federal emissions limit.

While carbon capture was not part of the Clean Power Plan, the United Nationsâ international climate panel considers the technology a crucial tool to fight climate change.

""Focusing solely on power plant efficiency as means of emissions reductions seems inadequate,â Friedmann said. âIn order to achieve the kind of profound emissions reductions we need, carbon capture should be considered.""

The Trump EPA has snubbed carbon capture in other ways.

It is the process of revising another Obama-era rule regulating new coal plants, as opposed to existing ones, that would have effectively required plants be built with CCS.

The Trump EPA prefers to not require carbon capture, with the agency using the same argument that carbon capture is not viable or cheap enough.

Friedmann disagrees with EPAâs contention.

Carbon capture costs have dropped by more than 50% over the past 10 years, he said.

Eighteen large facilities around the world, including two at coal power plants, currently capture and store 30 million tons of carbon each year.

For example, the Petra Nova coal plant outside Houston, Americaâs only successfully running carbon capture facility, sends the carbon dioxide via pipeline to nearby oil fields, where it is used to assist in the extraction of crude oil. The sale of carbon dioxide as a commodity for use in products such as cement, plastics, fuel, and carbon fiber helps to offset the added cost of the CCS technology.

There are more carbon capture projects coming, encouraged by expanded tax credits passed into law in bipartisan votes in Congress last year and signed by President Trump.

""CCS has certainly been adequately demonstrated,â Friedmann said. âMany people said renewables were not cost effective until they were. We've heard this before and it does not square with our experience.""

EPA officials say they do not mean to slight carbon capture. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told reporters this week that coal plant operators would not be banned from installing carbon capture as part of the ACE rule. States are also free to encourage the use of carbon capture as part of carbon-free electricity mandates.

âIt doesn't preclude CCS from taking place,â Wheeler said of the ACE rule.

But carbon capture cannot qualify toward fulfilling whatever emissions limit states decide to impose to meet the requirements of the ACE rule.

EPAâs air office chief Bill Wehrum, the main author of the ACE rule, said carbon capture could still succeed without his agency promoting it.

âOur job is to let the markets do what they do best to improve efficiency, develop technology, and reduce emissions,"" he said. ""We are seeing technologies like carbon capture being developed today and they will continue being developed. This rule doesnât get in the way of that.â"

"10-year Treasury yield drops as low as 1.97%, first time below 2% since November 2016",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"A chart showing the U.S. 10-year treasury yield below 2% as of 11:49 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate , that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016 on Wednesday â breaching a key psychological level â after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

At around 11:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, declined below 2% to 1.9821% â around its lowest levels since November 2016. The yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.7209%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.175%, as of 7:30 p.m. ET.

While stock investors and home buyers may initially cheer the drop in the benchmark for corporate bond and mortgage rates, the return to levels not seen in more than two years raises serious questions about the state of the economy.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report â which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions â and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities â bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices â show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Trump also said Tuesday he will be having an ""extended meeting"" next week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy in the coming months if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

House Republicans demand hearing after State Dept. cites 'multiple security incidents' under Clinton leadership,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-demand-hearing-after-state-dept-cites-multiple-security-incidents-under-clinton-leadership,"House Oversight Committee Republicans on Tuesday formally called for an immediate hearing on security breaches at the State Department during Hillary Clinton's leadership, after the department said Monday it had uncovered ""multiple security incidents"" involving more than a dozen employees.

In a letter to Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking committee Republicans Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows and Jody Hice said State Department officials conducting the ongoing security review into the matter should testify.

""We request a hearing to examine widespread security protocol breaches at the State Department concerning former Secretary Hillary Clintonâs private email server,"" the Republicans wrote. ""The unorthodox and unsecure arrangement she maintained exposed classified, national security and diplomatic-sensitive information to a myriad of risks and related issues.

'OMG': TOP HILLARY AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT EMAIL HACK ATTEMPT IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, FBI DOCS SHOW

""The wide-ranging fallout from these mishandling instances should not be minimized and obscured,"" they added.

On Monday, the State Department disclosed that it had identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's assistant secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and seven infractions. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said Tuesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should personally handle the probe into departmental misconduct.

""I love Mike Pompeo as the secretary of state,"" Chaffetz said. ""I have the greatest respect for him, he's got his very full plate, but he has to personally get involved with this. Some people should be fired, they should lose their security clearances and they should be in jail.""

The State Department, dubbing the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude its investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending, and that internal referrals have been made to State Department Human Resources and security officials, even where employees involved no longer work with the department.

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

Last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And this past March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said at the time, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""

The House Intelligence Committee has âvery little visibilityâ into the three Justice Department investigations into the intelligence officials who launched the Russia probe, the panelâs chairman Adam Schiff said on Wednesday.

Itâs a situation that has Schiff concerned, given his fears that the probes are politically motivated.

Story Continued Below

âItâs an effort to amplify the counter-narrative, and to ignore what the Russians did, and what they will do in the next election,â Schiff said at a National Press Club event on Wednesday. ""Weâve already seen a disturbing erosion of our checks and balancesâ with regard to the White Houseâs contact with DOJ, he added.

DOJâs Office of the Inspector General has been investigating the origins of the Russia probe since last year. Attorney General Bill Barr launched a parallel investigation in May, tapping John Durham to spearhead the inquiry around the time special counsel Robert Mueller was wrapping up the two-year probe, which concluded Trumpâs campaign did not criminally conspire with Russian intermediaries to disrupt the 2016 election. Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government âspyingâ on the Trump campaign that drove suspicions of a Kremlin link.

According to The New York Times, Durhamâs efforts have since zeroed in on the CIA analysts responsible for the conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the 2016 election specifically to help Trump win. The focus has alarmed some in the national security community who worry that Durhamâs probe will cast doubt on the apolitical nature of intelligence gathering and give credence to the presidentâs misleading claims that Obama-era officials tried to sabotage his campaign.

Those fears have been exacerbated by Trumpâs decision to give Barr sweeping declassification authority, a power usually delegated to intelligence leaders for their own evidence.

Schiff indicated that, despite asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department to keep him informed about any official declassification requests from Barr, the House Intelligence Committee â which oversees the intelligence community â remains largely in the dark about what the agencies are having to produce and whether their cooperation is voluntary or being compelled.

âI have discussed personally with the Director of National Intelligence [Dan] Coats my profound concern about what Bill Barr is doing in particular,â Schiff said. âNamely, his desire to provide cover to the president by investigating the investigators.â

Others are less anxious about Durhamâs probe, noting that the CIA has been investigated by Durham before and is accustomed to this kind of oversight. They point to 2008, when Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed Durham to conduct a criminal investigation into the destruction of torture tapes made by the CIA years earlier. That probe was expanded and later resulted in full criminal investigations into the deaths of two detainees, which ultimately wrapped in 2012 with no charges brought against anyone in the agency.

Itâs unclear, though, what mandate Durham is operating under and whether he is looking at the intelligence agencies with an eye to recommending criminal charges. He has not been appointed to lead a criminal investigation, and the Justice Department has formally described the inquiry as only as a âreview.â Durham also wonât be leaving his day job as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut.

Schiff, meanwhile, said he is still trying to get answers from the FBI about the counterintelligence findings of Muellerâs investigation, and whether the counterintelligence investigation launched in early 2017 into Trump himself was ever formally closed.

While the FBI has âstarted to provide some answersâ and increased briefings, Schiff said, theyâve been reluctant to go into any detail. âTheyâre just telling us about process,â Schiff said. âLike everything else, itâs like pulling teeth, and our patience is growing fatigued at this point.â"
"PolyMet, the EPA, and the accusations against the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, explained",https://www.minnpost.com,"['Walker Orenstein', 'About The Author']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.minnpost.com/environment/2019/06/polymet-the-epa-and-the-accusations-against-the-minnesota-pollution-control-agency-explained/,"In the last year, the company PolyMet has made large strides toward building Minnesotaâs first copper-nickel mine by securing the state and federal permits needed to move ahead on the $1 billion project.

But as PolyMet marches toward construction, a critical state water permit issued is facing new questions â and a federal investigation. A swirl of leaked emails and newly released documents have drawn accusations that the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency hid serious concerns from the public and that career staff at the Environmental Protection Agency were pressured by political leaders to go easy on PolyMet.

The MPCA has denied the allegations in a series of sworn statements from current and former staff. Yet environmental advocacy organizations are using the developments to bolster a legal challenge to the permit, which argues that PolyMet could dangerously pollute the St. Louis River watershed, which drains into Lake Superior.

If built, PolyMet would tap into reserves of copper, nickel and other precious metals like cobalt in an open-pit mine near Hoyt Lakes. The company, which is owned in part by Switzerlandâs Glencore, says the mine would create 360 direct jobs and another 1,000 indirect ones. PolyMet contends that new technology, water treatment and tough regulations can prevent environmental disasters that have occurred at copper mines around the globe.

Hereâs what you need to know about the allegations against the MPCA and what they could mean for the project going forward:

What are the accusations?

Last week, the EPA released a set of written comments that outlined major concerns with a draft of the MPCA permit, known as a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit (NPDES), that was issued to PolyMet in December 2018.

In part, federal regulators worried it would allow pollution, violate the Clean Water Act and hinder lawsuits against the mining company if problems do happen. While the permit requires PolyMet to treat water and has a form of water quality limits, the EPA wrote those regulations werenât enforceable by the federal government, the public and potentially by the MPCA.

On top of that, opponents of PolyMet argue that MPCA staff worked to ensure EPA comments were hidden from the public and court records. Paula Maccabee, counsel for WaterLegacy, an advocacy group suing to challenge PolyMetâs permit, says she learned the comments existed only after she requested records from the MPCA and through confidential sources in the federal government.

On April 5, the EPA read its comments over the phone to the MPCA staff, some of whom destroyed hand-written notes of the meeting. WaterLegacy obtained earlier notes from the MPCA that suggested EPA had concerns. Maccabee said she later learned through the EPA and sources about the official written comments.

Then, earlier this week, the union representing EPA employees in Minnesota released an email they say was obtained through an âanonymous leak.â The union contends the email shows former MPCA Assistant Commissioner Shannon Lotthammer pressuring EPA staff to suppress concerns by submitting them outside a public comment process.

In a May court statement, the MPCA said it âdid not receive written comments from EPA, did not take efforts to keep EPAâs written comments out of the administrative record, or fail to disclose the existence of EPA comments.â The union argued this was a lie.

The EPAâs Office of the Inspector General launched an âauditâ of the situation on June 12, says an announcement.

The MPCA maintains there is no scandal to the EPAâs comments and no cover up to suppress them. In filings to the Court of Appeals, the state agency says WaterLegacy is attacking âone aspectâ of a lengthy collaborative process between the MPCA and the EPA.

The MPCA says virtually all of the EPA concerns were raised by others during the public-comment period for the permits, and that it has responded to all those concerns.

Richard Clark, supervisor of the MPCAâs metallic mining sector unit, said in a court declaration that the EPA had raised identical questions âthroughout the permit-development process.â Those worries were recorded in other notes and submitted as part of the administrative record of the approval process, Clark said.

In other words, state regulators contend the April phone call with the EPA had no new information. As for the missing notes, Clark said the EPA âread their comments very quickly, and the concerns were all ones that we had heard before.â One staffer stopped taking notes throughout the call and said they werenât helpful. Another said notes he took were discarded after he incorporated them into legal work exempt from disclosure.

Darin Broton, an MPCA spokesman, said his agency adjusted the permit in many cases but said there were other instances in which they disagreed with EPA concerns.

In the end, the EPA did not object or veto the final permit, Broton said. In a statement to the court, Jeffry Fowley, a former longtime EPA staffer who specialized in Clean Water Act regulations and worked part time for the Environmental Integrity Project in 2018, has argued many problems EPA had were not resolved. That includes the discharge limits.

Maccabee and Aaron Klemz, a spokesman for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, said the Trump administrationâs business-friendly approach might be to blame. The MCEA is also suing over the water permit.

But Broton said he could assure the public PolyMet did not get let off easy.

âThere are really high stringent water quality standards incorporated into PolyMetâs permit at the end of the day,â Broton said. âThatâs part of the back and forth we had with the EPA is to make sure that there was tough enforceable language in the permit to make sure that the company is doing what it says itâs going to do. And if not we have a way to actually hold them accountable.â

So why did the MPCA ask the feds to wait until after the public comment process?

In a court filing, Lotthammer, the former MPCA assistant commissioner, said her agency was already planning to make changes to its draft permit after the public-comment period.

âRather than have EPA send us written comments on the version of the permit that we knew we were going to change, we believed that it would be more efficient â both for us and for EPA â if EPA waited to give us any written comments based on the next draft, in which we had the opportunity to address concerns shared by the public,â Lotthammer said in her statement. Lotthammer is now at the DNR.

MPCA staff said the EPA decides itself whether to submit written comments at any point in the permitting process.

Why is this important?

The MPCA has not promised to reevaluate its PolyMet permit in any way. But the developments could help bolster the legal argument of WaterLegacy and MCEA that the water quality permit is inadequate.

Copper-nickel mining comes with risks that iron ore mining does not, which has made PolyMet controversial. The extraction process can create an acidic runoff and leach heavy metals into water. On its website, PolyMet says they will be âmonitoring, collecting, controlling, recycling and eventually treating on-site water to meet water quality standards before it is discharged back into the environment.â

Environmental groups have had some success challenging controversial projects in court.

Recently, the Court of Appeals ruled an environmental review of a proposed oil pipeline known as Line 3 didnât consider an oil spill in Lake Superiorâs watershed. The MPCA and Department of Natural Resources said they wouldnât take final action on pending permits for the Enbridge pipeline until the Public Utilities Commission addressed the courtâs concern with the Environmental Impact Statement.

Klemz noted EPA comments have forced revisions from state regulators in the past and should be widely known.

Maccabee said the recent PolyMet revelations undermine the credibility of the MPCA and its permit, which could affect the court case. âMinnesotans tend to believe that we can trust our regulators, that theyâre operating openly and fairly â and if they say a permit is good, we should trust them,â she said. âThe way the permit was handled in this case benefits one party: And thatâs PolyMet.â

So what happens now?

Water Legacy has asked the appeals court to send its lawsuit back to district court for more fact-finding about the EPAâs comments. If granted, that process could be lengthy, said Klemz, who compared it to a trial. He speculated it could bring testimony from former MPCA chief John Linc Stine and others.

The court has not asked PolyMet to suspend its work toward building the mine, however. PolyMet says it is preparing the construction site, which includes renovations on a former LTV Steel taconite plant.

The MPCA has also promised to work on being more transparent in the future.

In a written statement, commissioner Laura Bishop said she was starting âan agency-wide assessmentâ to âimprove accessibilityâ for those following major permits.

âThis will include an openness for oral written comments from any person or organization during our permitting and rule-making processes as well as other times that stakeholders wish to engage with our agency,â Bishop said. âThe MPCA will also improve documentation of, and public access to, communications that form the record of agency actions.â"

Paul Manafort leaves the federal courthouse in Washington in 2017. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Contributing columnist

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafortâs legal troubles didnât end when he was convicted on bank and tax fraud charges in 2018. Heâs facing state-level mortgage fraud charges, and because his case is going to trial in New York City, he needed to be transferred between penitentiaries. That is a routine matter and regularly results in the defendantâs transfer to a state penitentiary, here Rikers Island.

But in this case, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen intervened, forwarding to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. a letter from Manafortâs attorney suggesting that it would not be safe for Manafort to be held on Rikers Island. The result? Manafort will be housed at a federal penitentiary rather than going to Rikers. Should we really care?

Yes we should. If the decision was motivated by politics â and it is very hard to formulate a plausible alternative explanation â itâs an injustice in itself and an indication of rotten goings-on at the Justice Department.

Consider first the magnitude of the favor that the department provided Manafort. Any prisoner would greatly prefer incarceration in either of the two institutions where Manafort will remain to Rikersâ Island, which is a notorious hellhole. (Why Rikers continues to operate at all in its current state is a subject for another column.) Manafort would surely be kept in isolation for his own protection in Rikers, but the difference in the overall conditions at these facilities is enormous.

Now consider how rare it is that Manafortâs request was granted and the role that Rosen, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, played in facilitating it. It is not simply unusual but unprecedented. I have canvassed colleagues with combined decades of service at the Justice Department, and to a person they aver that they have never heard of a similar situation.

That is not because prisoners donât ask. It is, in fact, routine to field requests for placement in certain institutions; I did so regularly as a U.S. attorney. The standard-issue response is to let the defendant know that, by law, the decision was for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to make, and that at most, a Justice Department representative could transmit a recommendation.

Finally, consider the reasoning: A spokesman for the Justice Department said the decision was justified by Manafortâs âunique health and safety needs.â

This is bunk of the first order. No doubt Manafort is ill, and no doubt he requires special protection. But are his circumstances unique? Absolutely not. Manafortâs situation is not meaningfully different from dozens of others who are routinely, in fact invariably, resolved many levels below the deputy attorney general and in favor of state incarceration pending state trial.

So we have a one-of-a-kind decision, made at an unprecedented level and justified by fanciful reasoning. Some special factor was obviously at play. It is entirely possible that there were political implications in doing a good deed for Manafort.

Itâs not hard to see what those implications might be. Manafort has been the closest thing to a stand-up wise guy in the Trump drama: He managed through squirrelly doublespeak to avoid giving special counsel Robert S. Mueller III the full book on President Trump, and he paid for it in added prison time.

In return, Manafortâs transfer makes it look as though Trump, or Attorney General William P. Barr channeling Trump, is showing him some love with a special favor nobody else ever gets. Thatâs good for Manafort in the immediate run, and at the same time, it would communicate even more strongly that the way to a pardon is continued noncooperation with federal authorities.

This is all very bad news coming from the Justice Department.

For starters, though we hardly remember this principle because it has been so thoroughly trammeled in the Trump years, it would be a serious breach of protocol if anyone at the White House even communicated with the Justice Department to urge special treatment for Manafort. Any such overture should have been immediately rebuffed.

If that didnât happen, it would almost be worse because it would mean that the department acted out of subservience to the presidentâs political goals on its own motion. It is the antithesis of doing justice without fear or favor â rewarding a political ally of the president because he resisted pressure from the Justice Department.

The overall turning of tables could not be more dramatic. Manafort did his best to wriggle out from under the lawful Justice Department investigation of him and the president. Now that same department is acting as his friend, as well as the presidentâs friend; and friends look out for one another.

That suggests a final lesson from Manafortâs relatively sweet accommodations: Rosen, who was Barrâs handpicked choice, likely comes to the department with a staff that is already integrated with Barrâs. That happens in the case of particularly strong attorneys general. Barr is that, by virtue of his own force of character and his preeminent standing in the Trump universe. As long as Trump is president, Barr enjoys total dominion at the Justice Department. The departmentâs special treatment of Manafort illustrates why that state of affairs is so worrisome.

Thompson and her husband had ties to Paul Erickson, a GOP operative and Butina's former boyfriend , that she did not disclose to her superiors or to Congress during her confirmation process, the Post reports.

Erickson officiated at the wedding of Thompson and her husband, David Gillian, a former senior Australian army officer, three administration officials and Erickson's lawyer confirmed to the Post.

At the time of the wedding, in June 2017, Thompson was serving as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, the Post reports.

Federal officials allege that Erickson stole $100,000 from Gillian four months before the wedding, the Post reports, citing FBI and court documents.

EXCLUSIVE: Justice Department concerned about conditions at South Fulton jail,https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/local/justice-department-concerned-about-conditions-south-fulton-jail/vv0W2rbvsgamQUX0rNxCSK/,"The U.S. Justice Department has weighed in on a lawsuit alleging deplorable conditions for mentally ill female inmates at a south Fulton County jail.

In a court filing on Thursday, U.S. Attorney BJay Pak and lawyers from the civil rights division in Washington alerted a federal judge in Atlanta to recent Justice Department positions concerning the constitutional requirements for housing prisoners with serious mental illness.

The motion â called a âstatement of interestâ â was filed in a case that demands improved conditions at the South Fulton Municipal Regional Jail in Union City. The suit, filed in April, said mentally ill women are being held in isolation under horrific conditions that increase their risk of serious psychological harm.

It was filed on behalf of two women, identified as M.J. and K.H., and the Georgia Advocacy Office, which protects the rights of people with disabilities.

The Justice Departmentâs filing alerted U.S. District Court Judge Billy Ray to the civil rights divisionâs lengthy investigation of the Hampton Roads Regional Jail in Portsmouth, Va. That probe, concluded in December, found the jail failed to provide adequate medical and mental health care to inmates and that prisoners were unconstitutionally held in restrictive conditions for prolonged periods of time.

Atlanta lawyer Joe Whitley, a former U.S. attorney here, called the Justice Departmentâs entry into the Atlanta case a potentially significant development.

âThis is not something they ordinarily would do,â Whitley said. âApparently theyâve seen things that caused them concern. The role of the civil rights division and the Department of Justice is often necessary to assure that people who are confined are treated in a manner consistent with the Constitution.â

Sarah Geraghty, a lawyer for the Southern Center for Human Rights, welcomed the Justice Departmentâs interest in the case.

âThe fact that it chose to weigh in shows the gravity of the human rights violations at issue,â said Geraghty, who represents the female inmates. âThe conditions being challenged in this case are strikingly similar to those found to violate federal law at the Hampton Roads jail.â

Some of the mentally ill women at the Union City jail have been found incompetent to stand trial for their alleged offenses. M.J., for example, was arrested in October for criminal trespass while proselytizing at The Mall West End. The 20-year-old woman has been unable to post $500 bond.

The lawsuit against the Union City jail included graphic photos of unsanitary jail cells and detailed grim conditions for the women detainees. The conditions âcan result in dramatic worsening of symptoms, decompensation, psychosis, self-mutilation and suicide,â the suit said.

Some inmates at the South Fulton Municipal Regional Jail use their issued bedding to soak up water that floods the cell floors, according to a federal lawsuit filed in April by the Georgia Advocacy Office and two women being held there. Inmates who use their bedding to clean up flooding are left with no sheets or blankets to sleep on, the lawsuit says. This image is included in the federal lawsuit. Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution

In recent court filings, Fulton County attorneys say plaintiffs M.J. and K.H. and other inmates âpresent unique security concerns as a result of their psychiatric disabilities.â

â(Their) disruptive, if not violent, behavior and their significant hygiene concerns dictate that their time outside their cells must be limited,â the county said. âThe penological interests of safety and security for M.J. and K.H. and their fellow inmates, the staff and the general public who visit the jail dictate the amount of time inmates spend in their cells.â

The county has asked Ray to dismiss the lawsuit and to deny an injunction sought by the plaintiffsâ lawyers that says the women inmates should be allowed to spend four hours a day outside their cells, including one hour of outdoor time.

In a recent court filing, the plaintiffsâ lawyers included a sworn statement by their forensic psychiatry expert, Jeffrey Metzner, a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

The south Fulton Jailâs so-called mental health pods are essentially solitary confinement units that warehouse the female detainees, he said. âSuch warehousing, in conditions of confinement that include very little out-of-cell time, results in many of these detaineesâ mental illnesses either deteriorating or not improving despite such illnesses being very treatable in an appropriate setting.â

Chaos within the EPA exposes Americans to toxins like asbestos,https://thehill.com,[],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/449756-chaos-within-the-epa-exposes-americans-to-toxins-like-asbestos,"Three years ago, there was bipartisan euphoria when President Obama signed the Frank L. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (LCSA) into law. The updated Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) finally gave the EPA regulatory authority to protect Americans from dangerous toxic substances like asbestos, a known human carcinogen. During the pen signing ceremony, Obama said the much-needed legislation was a crucial step forward, remarking, ""The [old] system was so complex, it was so burdensome that our country hasn't even been able to uphold a ban on asbestos.""

The ongoing battle for chemical safety reform continues.

For many, President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer Joint Chiefs chairman: 'The last thing in the world we need right now is a war with Iran' Pence: 'We're not convinced' downing of drone was 'authorized at the highest levels' Trump: Bolton would take on the whole world at one time MOREâs EPA has been problematic from the get-go.

MORE, former Oklahoma attorney general, was confirmed as the EPA Administrator.

Met with confrontation, Pruittâs regulatory rollbacks and ethics violations forced him to resign 12 months after his Senate confirmation. Pruitt wasnât alone. Many who formerly worked at American Chemistry Council (ACC) now hold high-level EPA positions. Most notably, Nancy Beck, was selected to head the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP). Overseeing the toxic chemical unit, Beck carried out Trumpâs seeming pro-industry agenda. The revolving doors continue as Beck now heads to the White House's National Economic Council.

The EPA attempted to ban asbestos in 1989, but was sued by Corrosion Proof Fittings, a company that used asbestos in their products. In 1991, an appeals court overturned the ban, resulting in a failure to ban the deadly chemical through TSCA.

Nearly 70 countries have already banned asbestos, but sadly, three years after Obama signed LCSA into law, U.S. asbestos imports, use, and deaths continue. Each year, nearly 40,000 Americans die from preventable asbestos-caused diseases such as lung cancer, mesothelioma, cancer of the larynx and ovary and asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs). For each life lost, a shattered family is left behind.

For more than a century, asbestos has been confirmed to cause suffering and deaths. The EPA has failed to protect public health and the environment by banning asbestos. Without a ban, asbestos remains lethal and legal today and can be found in consumer products, cosmetics, automotive products, and building materials.

The chlor-alkali industry is the primary asbestos importer and user of raw asbestos for the manufacturing of industrial chlorine and caustic soda. Knowing that there is no safe or controlled use, itâs incredulous that asbestos imports actually surged last year. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the chlor-alkali industry imported 750 metric tons of raw asbestos from Brazil and Russia.

The late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) fought hard for meaningful chemical reform, and TSCA is on track to fail, again. The EPAâs present asbestos evaluation excludes the risk of asbestos in millions of homes, schools, and offices. Furthermore, industry-friendly rules like the âsignificant new useâ rule (SNUR) is just another attempt to negate asbestos risk.

Trump has long been fascinated with asbestos, and said once on Twitter, âIf we didn't remove incredibly powerful fire retardant asbestos & replace it with junk that doesn't work, the World Trade Center would never have burned down.â

Last summer, ADAO discovered that Uralasbest, a Russian asbestos company, placed a seal with Trumpâs face on their product with the note ""Approved by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.""

An asbestos ban from Trumpâs EPA is at best, unreliable. Americans are tired of the fox guarding the hen house. Itâs time for Congress to pass the Alan Reinstein Ban Asbestos Now Act.

Paul J. Manafort, President Trumpâs former campaign chairman who is serving a federal prison sentence, had been expected to be transferred to the notorious Rikers Island jail complex this month to await trial on a separate state case.

But last week, Manhattan prosecutors were surprised to receive a letter from the second-highest law enforcement official in the country inquiring about Mr. Manafortâs case. The letter, from Jeffrey A. Rosen, Attorney General William P. Barrâs new top deputy, indicated that he was monitoring where Mr. Manafort would be held in New York.

And then, on Monday, federal prison officials weighed in, telling the Manhattan district attorneyâs office that Mr. Manafort, 70, would not be going to Rikers.

Instead, he will await his trial at a federal lockup in Manhattan or at the Pennsylvania federal prison where he is serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence for wide-ranging financial schemes, according to people with knowledge of the matter."
U.S. has no plans to cap H-1B work visa program: State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-india-visas/us-has-no-plans-to-cap-h-1b-work-visa-program-state-department-idUSKCN1TL2VL,"FILE PHOTO: A man holds flags of India and the U.S. while people take part in the 35th India Day Parade in New York, U.S. August 16, 2015.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has no plans to cap H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally, the State Department said on Thursday.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the United States had told India it was considering restricting the H-1B visa programs for countries with the data storage requirement. The H-1B program issues U.S. visas to skilled foreign workers.

âThe Trump Administration has no plans to place caps on H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally,â a State Department spokeswoman said in a statement in response to the Reuters article.

While an administrationâs âBuy American Hire Americanâ executive order calls for a broad review of U.S. worker visa programs, including the H-1B program, it was not targeted at a specific country, the spokeswoman said.

It is âcompletely separate from our ongoing discussions with India about the importance of ensuring the free flow of data across borders,â the spokeswoman added.

Earlier on Thursday, India said it was in talks with the United States on H-1B visas, but foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar told a news conference: âWe have not heard anything officially from the U.S. governmentâ on capping such permits for Indians.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to visit New Delhi next week for talks that will include areas of disagreement between the two countries over trade.

Two senior Indian officials told Reuters on Wednesday they had been briefed last week on a U.S. plan to cap the number of H-1B visas given annually to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the total number issued.

There is no country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas the United States issues every year, and an estimated 70% of them go to Indians."
Ginnie Mae removes loanDepot's VA loan restrictions,https://www.housingwire.com,"['Ben Lane Is The Editor For Housingwire. In This Role', 'He Helps Set A Leading Pace For News Coverage Spanning The Issues Driving The U.S. Housing Economy', ""Helps Guide Housingwire'S Overall Direction. Previously"", 'He Worked For Townsquarebuzz', 'A Hyper-Local News Service. He Is A Graduate Of University Of North Texas.']",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49393-ginnie-mae-removes-loandepots-va-loan-restrictions,"After nearly six months of being restricted from participating in some of Ginnie Maeâs mortgage bond programs as part of the agencyâs crackdown on lenders for Department of Veterans Affairs loan churning, loanDepot is back in the game.

Ginnie Mae announced Friday that it has removed the mortgage bond restrictions it placed on loanDepot earlier this year.

Back in January, Ginnie Mae limited loanDepot to Ginnie Mae II custom pools for VA single-family guaranteed loans after the agency found that loanDepotâs prepayment speeds on VA loans may have been out of sync with the rest of the industry.

The governmentâs investigation into VA loan churning began nearly two years ago when the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Ginnie Mae, and the VA began looking into whether certain lenders are aggressively targeting service members and military veterans for quick and potentially risky refinances of their mortgages.

The investigation led to some lenders being booted from Ginnie Maeâs primary mortgage securities platforms, and other lenders, like loanDepot, being restricted for questionable conduct.

Ginnie Mae, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is a mortgage bond issuer, but focuses specifically on securitizing pools of government-backed mortgages insured by the VA, the Federal Housing Administration, and other agencies, so issues related to refinancing VA loans would affect Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities.

But now, loanDepot has apparently addressed its practices and Ginnie Mae is satisfied that the lender has things under control.

Therefore, loanDepot is now allowed to participate in the Ginnie Mae I and Ginnie Mae II multi-issuer securities programs.

âThe removal of such a restriction is based on the Issuer having demonstrated to Ginnie Maeâs satisfaction that (a) its prepayment speeds are substantially in-line with those of equivalent multi-Issuer cohorts, and (b) such improved performance is sustainable,â the agency said in a statement.

According to the agency, loanDepot is eligible to participate in all bond programs for loans effective for July 1, 2019, issuance.

""While we were disappointed with Ginnieâs original decision, we have partnered with Ginnie Mae in an open and transparent fashion to be able to return to full participation in multiple issuer pools,"" loanDepot Chief Capital Markets Officer Jeff DerGurahian said in a statement. ""However, most importantly, despite the restrictions, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to serve the Veteran community and have never wavered in proudly serving United States Veterans fairly and responsibly.""

[Update: This article is updated with a statement from loanDepot.]"
