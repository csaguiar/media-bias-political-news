Senior military officers rebel against Trump plan to pardon troops accused of war crimes,https://www.latimes.com,['David S.

Mathew Golsteyn, who is charged with killing an unarmed Afghan in 2010; three Marine snipers prosecuted for urinating on the corpse of a dead Afghan fighter in 2011; and a former security guard for Blackwater Worldwide who was convicted of murder in December for killing unarmed Iraqis in 2007."
Opinion | China Deserves Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Thomas L. Friedman'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/opinion/china-trump-trade.html,"China kept insisting it was still “a poor developing country” that needed extra protection long after it had become the world’s largest manufacturer by far. Nevertheless, the relationship worked for enough U.S. companies enough of the time that the world’s biggest incumbent superpower, America, accommodated and effectively facilitated the rise of the world’s next largest superpower, China. And together they made globalization more pervasive and the world more prosperous.

And then some changes too big to ignore set in. First, China under Xi announced a “Made in China 2025” modernization plan, promising subsidies to make China’s private and state-owned companies the world leaders in supercomputing, A.I., new materials, 3-D printing, facial-recognition software, robotics, electric cars, autonomous vehicles, 5G wireless and advanced microchips.

This was a natural move for a China aiming to leap out of the middle-income ranks and to reduce its dependency on the West for high-tech. But all these new industries compete directly with America’s best companies.

As a result, all China’s subsidies, protectionism, cheating on trade rules, forced technology transfers and stealing of intellectual property since the 1970s became a much greater threat. If the U.S. and Europe allowed China to continue operating by the same formula that it had used to grow from poverty to compete for all the industries of the future, we’d be crazy. Trump is right about that.

Where he is wrong is that trade is not like war. Unlike war, it can be a win-win proposition. Alibaba, UnionPay, Baidu and Tencent and Google, Amazon, Facebook and Visa can all win at the same time — and they have been. I’m not sure Trump understands that.

But I’m not sure Xi does, either. We have to let China win fair and square where its companies are better, but it has to be ready to lose fair and square, too. Who can say how much more prosperous Google and Amazon would be today if they had been able to operate as freely in China as Alibaba and Tencent can operate in America?

And how much money did China save — to subsidize its own companies — when its military stole the plans for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 stealth fighter and then made its own carbon copy, avoiding all the R & D costs?"
"Trump's agenda hampered by troubling number of lower court injunctions, Barr says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Edmund Demarche', 'Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-agenda-hampered-by-troubling-number-of-lower-court-injuctions-barr-says,"Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday said he has noticed a troubling trend of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts that have taken their toll on President Trump’s agenda and threaten the political process for future administrations.

Barr, who has been accused by Democrats of protecting Trump after the release of the Mueller report, told the American Law Institute that there is a new trend of judicial ""willingness"" to review executive action, which injects courts into the political process.

He pointed to the district court in California that in January 2018 issued a temporary injunction to block the Trump administration from ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.

DACA has protected about 800,000 people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children or came with families who overstayed visas. The Obama-era program includes hundreds of thousands of college-age students.

U.S. District Judge William Alsup said at the time that lawyers in favor of DACA demonstrated that the immigrants “were likely to suffer serious, irreparable harm” without court action. The judge also said the lawyers have a strong chance of succeeding at trial.

The White House was swift to criticize these lower court injunctions and called this particular decision “outrageous.” Vice President Mike Pence recently said the administration will ask the Supreme Court to bar them.

""So what have these nationwide injunction wrought? Dreamers remain in limbo, the political process has been pre-empted, and we have had over a year of bitter political division that included a government shutdown of unprecedented length,"" Barr said.

ROGER FISK: BARR CAN'T SAVE TRUMP FROM HIMSELF

Barr said nationwide injunctions violate the separation of powers. He said that since Trump took office, there have been 37 nationwide injunctions — more than one a month -- against his office and he said there is likely no end in sight. He said, by comparison, there were two instances where district courts issued an injunction in President Obama’s first two years.

The Associated Press wrote that this is “the latest example of Barr moving to embrace Trump’s political talking points.” Its report pointed out the Trump criticized these rulings at a rally earlier this month, saying, “activist judges who issue nationwide injunctions based on their personal beliefs, which undermine democracy and threaten the rule of law.”

Barr has brushed aside criticism from Democrats that he is in the president’s pocket. He told the Wall Street Journal in a recent interview that he is defending the presidency, not Trump.

Americans feel good about economy and give Trump credit — CBS News poll,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-feel-good-about-economy-and-give-trump-credit-cbs-news-poll/,"By Fred Backus, Jennifer De Pinto, and Anthony Salvanto

Most Americans remain confident about the U.S. economy and in their own financial situation, and more now give President Trump's policies credit for a strong economy than did so last year.

Seven in 10 Americans say the economy is in good shape, including a quarter who say it is very good. Nearly all Republicans and most Democrats and independents share this view.

Americans increasingly give the president credit for the economy. Forty-one percent of those who say the economy is good say Mr. Trump's policies are mostly responsible, up from 32% at the beginning of 2018. Republicans give the president relatively more credit for the economy than Democrats do.

Forty-one percent of Americans approve of how Mr. Trump is handling his job as president. That is closer to where his rating was last summer than it was in this poll more recently, in January. Approval ratings have remained within a fairly narrow range throughout his presidency so far.

Across particular measures, the economy is the president's strongest: 50% of Americans approve of how he's handling the economy. In contrast, more Americans disapprove of his handling of immigration, foreign policy, and trade with other countries.

Amid congressional Democrats' attempts to investigate the president's finances, 40% of Americans think Mr. Trump has financially profited from his time in the presidency, more so than the 24% who think he has made financial sacrifices in order to serve as president. Another 33% don't think his finances have changed much either way from his being president. But partisans see this differently. Republicans are more apt to feel he has made sacrifices and Democrats more prone to think he has gained financially.

Looking ahead, Americans are more positive about the market than they were a few months ago, despite recent fluctuations. Fifty-six percent now say they are optimistic about the stock market over the next twelve months, up from 49% in January.

There is partisan division about where the economy goes from here. Thirty-seven percent of Americans think the economy is getting better, including 71% of Republicans, but just 11% of Democrats agree.

Looking at their own pocketbooks, most Americans are very or somewhat confident in their own financial situation, but their confidence is related to income. Those earning more express a lot more confidence than those earning less.

Despite the optimism, Americans are wary of a possible trade war with China and its potential impact on the economy. Few think the U.S. will emerge the clear cut winner in any such conflict.

Few think the tariffs on Chinese imports will be good for the U.S. economy in the short term. More think they will make it worse. Republicans are more optimistic than Democrats.





This poll was conducted by telephone May 17-20, 2019, among a random sample of 1,101 adults nationwide. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard landline and cellphones.

The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone.

Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.

The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

"Trump Administration Could Blacklist China’s Hikvision, a Surveillance Firm",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Ana Swanson', 'Edward Wong']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/us/politics/hikvision-trump.html,"“Taking this step would be a tangible signal to both U.S. and foreign companies that the U.S. government is looking carefully at what is happening in Xinjiang and is willing to take action in response,” said Jessica Batke, a former State Department official who has done research in Xinjiang and testified before Congress on the issue. “At the same time, however, the ongoing trade war perhaps undercuts the perception that this is coming from a place of purely human rights concerns.”

The Commerce Department and the White House declined to comment.

On Wednesday, the China’s foreign ministry urged countries to treat Chinese companies fairly.

“We have repeatedly stated that China opposes the United States’s practice of abusing state power and arbitrarily discrediting and suppressing foreign enterprises, including Chinese enterprises,” Lu Kang, a ministry spokesman, said at a regular briefing in Beijing in a response to a question about the possibility of blacklisting Hikvision.

Hikvision is little known in the United States, but the company supplies large parts of China’s extensive surveillance system. The company’s products include traffic cameras, thermal cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles, and they now allow Chinese security agencies to monitor railway stations, roads and other sites.

It is not immediately clear what effect a United States ban would have on Hikvision’s business. The company appears to source just a small portion of its components from the United States, and any such ban could speed its efforts to switch to Chinese suppliers.

But Hikvision does have a growing international presence, and its executives have warned in the past about the potential for rising anti-China sentiment in the United States to affect its operations. The company says it has more than 34,000 global employees and dozens of divisions worldwide, and it has supplied products to the Beijing Olympics, the Brazilian World Cup and the Linate Airport in Milan. It has tried to expand into North America in recent years, employing hundreds of workers in the United States and Canada, setting up offices in California and building a North American research and development team headquartered in Montreal.

In a letter published in English in April, Hikvision’s chief compliance officer said that the company was taking reports that video surveillance products had been involved in human rights violations seriously and had commissioned an internal review of its operations to enhance screening standards to better protect human rights. “We are taking a hard look at our products and business,” the officer, Huang Fanghong, wrote."
Rex Tillerson Secretly Meets With House Foreign Affairs Committee to Talk Trump,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Erin Banco'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/rex-tillerson-secretly-meets-with-house-foreign-affairs-committee-to-talk-trump,"Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke with the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs committee Tuesday in a lengthy session that, an aide said, touched on his time working in the Trump administration, the frictions he had with the president’s son-in-law, and efforts to tackle issues like Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Tillerson’s appearance, first reported by The Daily Beast, took place as virtually every other Trumpworld luminary has been stonewalling congressional oversight efforts. At the same time the former secretary of state was speaking before lawmakers, former White House counsel Don McGahn was ignoring a subpoena to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee.

Tillerson’s arrival at the Capitol was handled with extreme secrecy. No media advisories or press releases were sent out announcing his appearance. And he took a little-noticed route into the building in order to avoid being seen by members of the media.

Tillerson reached out to the committee and expressed a willingness to meet, a committee aide said. In a more than six-hour meeting, he told members and staffers that the Trump administration actively avoided confronting Russia about allegations of interference in the election in an effort to develop a solid relationship with the Kremlin, a committee aide told The Daily Beast.

Tillerson also told members and aides that he had tried to establish a formal and disciplined interagency process at the State Department whereby the president could receive informed briefings on sensitive foreign-policy matters, the aide said. That effort never manifested, Tillerson told the committee, in part because of the president’s management style, but also because of interference from other aides.

Tillerson told the committee that the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at times impeded his ability to communicate effectively and introduce to President Trump policy proposals developed by State Department experts on major foreign-affairs matters across the globe, not just in the Middle East. Kushner, a White House adviser, has publicly focused much of his international efforts on the Middle East and is set to unveil a peace plan in the coming weeks.

Tillerson had a notoriously prickly relationship with the president, reportedly calling him a “moron” in private. But he was present during critical moments of the administration, including Trump’s private 2017 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg, Germany.

Since leaving his post, Tillerson has rarely made public appearances, save for speaking at a panel in Houston in December. During that appearance, he said there was “no question” Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.

“So often, the president would say, ‘Here’s what I want to do and here’s how I want to do it,’ and I would have to say to him, ‘Mr. President, I understand what you want to do but you can’t do it that way. It violates the law,’” Tillerson said.

Tillerson’s interview by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) and ranking member Michael McCaul (R-TX) comes a month after Special Counsel Robert Mueller published his report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Since then, top Democrats on the Hill have demanded that Attorney General William Barr and Mueller answer questions related to the report and its publication. Barr has declined to testify before the House, citing the insistence of the committee that staff lawyers be allowed to conduct some of the questioning. Mueller is reportedly in negotiations to testify, though the Department of Justice had previously not agreed on a date for him to do so.

On Tuesday, CNN reported that Mueller’s team had expressed reluctance about the possibility of a testimony taking place in public for fear that it would appear political.

Clarification: In regard to the way the Trump administration handled allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Tillerson told the committee that he did raise the issue with Putin. However, he said, the administration generally avoided confronting Russia about the allegations."
DHS warns of 'strong concerns' that Chinese-made drones are stealing data,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/20/politics/dhs-chinese-drone-warning/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert issued Monday obtained by CNN.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" the alert says.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities,"" the alert adds.

"McGahn confirms he will skip House hearing, as DOJ asserts 'immunity' and Nadler fumes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-mcgahn-house-hearing,"President Trump has directed former White House Counsel Don McGahn to skip a House Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for Tuesday, citing a Justice Department opinion that he cannot be compelled to testify about his official duties -- and, through his legal team, McGahn confirmed Monday evening that he won't appear.

The development prompted an obstinate response late Monday from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.: “We are having the hearing tomorrow and we’re expecting Mr. McGahn to show pursuant to the subpoena.""

Earlier this month, House Democrats opted to question an empty chair -- and a bucket of fried chicken -- when Attorney General Bill Barr failed to appear, citing Democrats' unusual demands.

In a letter to Nadler, McGahn attorney William Burck said his client won't show up. Burck said current White House Counsel Pat Cipollone had communicated that Trump had instructed McGahn not to testify, and that Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel had said McGahn was immune from testifying.

""Mr. McGahn understands from your prior correspondence that the Committee would vote to hold him in contempt should he not appear tomorrow and the House of Representatives may follow suit,"" Burck wrote to Nadler. ""While we disagree with the Committee’s position and hope it will instead seek an accommodation with the White House, Mr. McGahn also must honor his ethical and legal obligations as a former senior lawyer and senior advisor to the President. In short, it is our view that the Committee’s dispute is not with Mr. McGahn but with the White House.""

Burck added: ""Mr. McGahn remains obligated to maintain the status quo and respect the President’s instruction. In the event an accommodation is agreed between the Committee and the White House, Mr. McGahn will of course comply with that accommodation.""

In a statement released Monday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders blasted Democrats for continuing to pursue Trump investigations, saying they want a ""wasteful and unnecessary do-over"" in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe -- and describing the subpoena for McGahn as part of that.

""The House Judiciary Committee has issued a subpoena to try and force Mr. McGahn to testify again. The Department of Justice has provided a legal opinion stating that, based on long-standing, bipartisan, and Constitutional precedent, the former Counsel to the President cannot be forced to give such testimony, and Mr. McGahn has been directed to act accordingly,"" Sanders said. ""This action has been taken in order to ensure that future Presidents can effectively execute the responsibilities of the Office of the Presidency.""

The related DOJ memo said McGahn, like other senior advisers to a president, has ""immunity"" from being compelled to testify about his official duties.

""This immunity applies to the former White House Counsel. Accordingly, Mr. McGahn is not legally required to appear and testify about matters related to his official duties as Counsel to the President,"" the memo said.

The New York Times first reported that the president would likely direct McGahn to skip the hearing.

HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN SUBPOENAS EX-WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON MCGAHN

The committee announced the hearing last week, but it was unclear whether McGahn would appear due to the ongoing battle between congressional Democrats and the White House over his testimony.

Earlier this month, Sanders said she did not “anticipate” that a hearing would take place. “We consider this to be a case closed and we’re moving forward to do the work of the American people,” Sanders said on ABC News’ “The Investigation” podcast.

The committee, led by Nadler, subpoenaed McGahn on April 22, days after the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which featured McGahn prominently in its section related to the obstruction of justice inquiry. This included a claim that McGahn disobeyed Trump’s call to have him seek Mueller’s removal.

“On June 17, 2017, the president called [White House Counsel Don] McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre,” the report stated, referencing the Watergate scandal.

The report also revealed that when the media reported on the president’s request, the president directed White House officials “to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.” He did not.

The House committee's subpoena, coming amid a fight over access to the unredacted Mueller report, called for McGahn to appear before the panel to testify and provide documents related to the Mueller investigation.

But earlier this month, Cipollone first notified the committee that McGahn would not be allowed to comply with the subpoena, saying requests for documents and materials must go to the White House.

“The White House provided these records to Mr. McGahn in connection with its cooperation with the Special Counsel’s investigation and with the clear understanding that the records remain subject to the control of the White House for all purposes,” Cipollone wrote. “The White House records remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles, because they implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege.”

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SCHEDULES HEARING FOR DON MCGAHN, DESPITE WHITE HOUSE MOVE TO BLOCK SUBPOENA

He added: “Because Mr. McGahn does not have the legal right to disclose these documents to third parties, I would ask the Committee to direct any request for such records to the White House, the appropriate legal custodian.”

Cipollone wrote that acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney “has directed Mr. McGahn not to produce these White House records,” adding that the Justice Department concurs with their legal position.

But Nadler has stressed the importance of McGahn’s testimony, saying it would “help shed further light on the president’s attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others to do the same.”

Trump, though, said he never told McGahn to fire Mueller, and tweeted last month that if he “wanted to fire Mueller, I didn’t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself.""

The battle over McGahn's testimony is just one front in the clash between the White House and congressional Democrats.

Earlier this month, the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena for Mueller's full and unredacted report, as well as underlying evidence and documents used in the investigation.

Trump, prior to the vote, asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect them from being turned over to the committee. The full House has yet to take a final vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.

E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Pollution Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama-era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted.

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter — the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream — is linked to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease."
U.S. eases curbs on Huawei; founder says clampdown underestimates Chinese firm,https://www.reuters.com,"['Brenda Goh', 'Min Read']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-usa-license-idUSKCN1SQ27T,"SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States has temporarily eased trade restrictions on China’s Huawei to minimize disruption for its customers, a move the founder of the world’s largest telecoms equipment maker said meant little because it was already prepared for U.S. action.

The U.S. Commerce Department blocked Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from buying U.S. goods last week, a major escalation in the trade war between the world’s two top economies, saying the firm was involved in activities contrary to national security.

The two countries increased import tariffs on each other’s goods over the past two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump said China had reneged on earlier commitments made during months of negotiations.

On Monday, the Commerce Department granted Huawei a license to buy U.S. goods until Aug. 19 to maintain existing telecoms networks and provide software updates to Huawei smartphones, a move intended to give telecom operators that rely on Huawei time to make other arrangements.

Shares of U.S. suppliers to Huawei including Qualcomm Inc, Intel Corp and Lumentum Holdings Inc rose, with the Philadelphia Chip Index up 2.1%.

Radio frequency chipmaker Qorvo was the latest U.S. supplier after mobile parts maker Lumentum to halt shipments to Huawei.

It is unclear what the U.S. government extension permits, but if it allows Huawei to keep purchasing components, the company will likely order more to build inventory, said Mark Kelleher, an analyst at D.A. Davidson.

Huawei is still prohibited from buying American-made hardware and software to make new products without further, hard-to-obtain licenses.

Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei on Tuesday told Chinese state media that the reprieve bore little meaning for the company as it had been making preparations for such a scenario.

“The U.S. government’s actions at the moment underestimate our capabilities,” Ren said in an interview with CCTV, according to a transcript published by the Chinese state broadcaster.

The temporary license suggests changes to Huawei’s supply chain may have immediate, far-reaching and unintended consequences for its customers.

The Commerce Department said it will evaluate whether to extend the license period beyond 90 days.

CURRENCY FIRMS

China’s yuan firmed versus the dollar on Tuesday as news of the reprieve eased some worries that trade tensions would be further inflamed and inflict deeper losses on the currency.

Beijing has struck an increasingly defiant tone as the trade war has escalated, saying it will take measures to safeguard the interests of its companies, but has not said whether or how it may retaliate over the U.S. action against Huawei.

President Xi Jinping’s Monday visit to a rare-earth company in southern China sparked speculation that the sector could be the next front in the trade war, driving up shares in Chinese rare-earth related firms on Tuesday.

China produced 80% of rare-earths, a group of 17 chemical elements used in electronics, imported by the United States in 2017.

“Given the Huawei decision, I feel they (China) have no choice but to retaliate, for face sake,” Cliff Tan, head of East Asian research at MUFG Bank in Hong Kong, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Tuesday.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, at a media briefing, rebuffed Trump’s claim that his tariffs were causing companies to move production away from China, saying foreign investors remain enthusiastic about the country.

GOOGLE SUSPENSION

Huawei is on the receiving end of a U.S. government accusation that it engaged in bank fraud to obtain embargoed U.S. goods and services in Iran and move money via the international banking system. Huawei has pleaded not guilty.

The trade blacklist has added to its woes, following which Alphabet Inc’s Google suspended some business with Huawei, Reuters reported on Sunday citing a person familiar with the matter, raising worries about the Chinese firm’s smartphones that run on Google’s Android operating system.

Monday’s temporary license is likely to allow companies such as Google to continue providing service and support, including software updates or patches, to Huawei smartphones that were available to the public on or before May 16.

“Keeping phones up to date and secure is in everyone’s best interests and this temporary license allows us to continue to provide software updates and security patches to existing models for the next 90 days,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email on Tuesday.

The license also allows Huawei to engage in the development of standards for fifth-generation (5G) telecom networks.

APPLE PRAISE

Ren put up a brave front on Tuesday, reiterating claims that the restrictions will not hurt Huawei’s prospects and that no other company will be able to catch up with Huawei in 5G technology in the next two to three years.

China was nevertheless still “far behind” the United States in technology, he said.

Chip experts have called out Huawei on its claims that it could ensure a steady supply chain without U.S. help, saying the technology it buys from American companies would be “hard to replace.”

Nearly 16% of Huawei’s spending on components in 2018 went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm, Intel and Micron Technology, analysts said.

Ren said Huawei was at odds with the U.S. government, not U.S. firms, and in a comment that trended on Chinese social media, he praised Apple Inc’s iPhones, saying he gifted the American firm’s devices to family members.

“Apple has a good business ecosystem. ... We cannot think narrow-mindedly that loving Huawei equals loving its phones.”

U.S. firms could lose up to $56.3 billion in export sales over five years from stringent export controls on technologies involving Huawei or otherwise, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation said in a report. Missed opportunities threatened as many as 74,000 jobs, the foundation said."

Drones - including those aimed at children and sold on Amazon and UK high streets - are feared to contain components that steal information and share it on severs accessible not just by the manufacturer but by third parties too.

Alamy 3 The US government has warned against operating Chinese-made drones

The alert from the department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was obtained by CNN.

China is the world’s largest manufacturer of commercial and military drones.

74 per cent of drones around the world are made by the company DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China.

In the UK, DJI drones can be purchased from Amazon UK, Drones Direct, John Lewis and a range of online stores, with prices starting at £99.

Many of them are aimed at children.

The US fears these drones are sending sensitive flight data back to the manufacturers in China, which can then be accessed by the Chinese government.

The data is collected through sensor fusion software, which combines information from multiple sensors on the device including, cameras and propeller and motor movements.

China imposes tough obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities including espionage and theft of proprietary information, the warning adds.

'UNDERESTIMATING ABILITIES'

Yesterday, Google announced Huawei will no longer be able to use its apps or access its security updates, in a massive blow for the Chinese company.

Last week, the US added the firm to a list companies it will not trade with unless it has a licence.

The warning reportedly continues: ""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities.""

The warning further urges individuals or companies to be “be cautious when purchasing” and “to take precautionary steps like turning off the device’s internet connection and removing secure digital cards”.

This isn’t the first time the US government has issued a warning about Chinese drones.

The US Army ordered all Chinese-made drone to be recalled and destroyed in 2017.

It comes as Huawei’s founder has said the US “underestimates” its abilities after Donald Trump escalated its efforts to block the Chinese firm.

"Democrats pound Treasury official over Deutsche Bank, Trump",https://www.politico.com,['Zachary Warmbrodt'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/21/democrats-deutsche-bank-trump-1461245,"Deutsche Bank has said there were ""numerous inaccuracies and misleading statements"" in the Times story but that legal restrictions prevented it from refuting them in detail. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images Finance & Tax Democrats pound Treasury official over Deutsche Bank, Trump

Senate Democrats on Tuesday hammered a top Treasury Department official over a bombshell report that Deutsche Bank resisted reporting suspicious financial activity tied to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose companies were clients of the German lender.

One after another, Democrats at a Senate Banking Committee hearing that focused on anonymous shell company abuse urged the director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Kenneth Blanco, to take action on the New York Times story.

Story Continued Below

Blanco's agency, known as FinCEN, is responsible for policing illegal money laundering and would have received any so-called suspicious activity reports filed by Deutsche Bank. According to the Times, bank employees prepared the reports but were blocked by executives.

""The alleged facts are in plain sight,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said. ""It's essential it seems to me to the public trust and the integrity of FinCEN that these be actively pursued.""

Despite the pummeling by Democrats — not a single Republican at the hearing brought up Deutsche Bank — Blanco said he was unable to comment on allegations made in the story, which he said he had been briefed on but had not read.

""You're a very smart man,"" Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), responded. ""It wouldn't take very long to read it, but it might be very informative to you.""

""Just because it's in the newspaper doesn't mean it’s true,"" Blanco said. ""I'm not saying it's false, either.""

Blanco suggested that the bank might have been comfortable with the risks it was taking with Trump.

""Everything is fact-specific,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, it could be quite appropriate.""

Before Tuesday's hearing, Van Hollen and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking him to confirm the accuracy of the Times story and to divulge how many suspicious activity reports were quashed.

Deutsche Bank has said there were ""numerous inaccuracies and misleading statements"" in the Times story but that legal restrictions prevented it from refuting them in detail."

"SoftBank scores coup as FCC chief backs T-Mobile, Sprint merger",https://asia.nikkei.com,[],,,,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/5G-networks/Softbank-scores-coup-as-FCC-chief-backs-T-Mobile-Sprint-merger,"NEW YORK/TOKYO -- The merger plans for American wireless carriers T-Mobile U.S. and SoftBank Group-owned Sprint took a major step forward with the head of the U.S. regulator expressing support for the tie-up.

The proposed $26 billion merger between the nation's third- and fourth-biggest carriers was widely seen to be in trouble as recently as last month when the U.S. Department of Justice reportedly told the two companies that the megadeal was unlikely to win approval as is.

But on Monday, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai cited the benefits the merger would bring in spreading fifth-generation wireless technology to rural areas of the U.S.

""I believe that this transaction is in the public interest and intend to recommend to my colleagues that the FCC approve it,"" he said in a statement.

""This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G"" throughout the U.S., Pai said, ""and bring much faster mobile broadband to rural Americans. We should seize this opportunity.""

For SoftBank, the deal is key to easing concerns over its massive 15.6 trillion yen ($141.5 billion) debt load.

Under the proposed merger, SoftBank's 84.7% ownership of Sprint will become a 27% stake in the combined company. That will let SoftBank break off Sprint's 4.4 trillion yen debt from its own balance sheet.

SoftBank has pitched to investors that its net debt is only 4.4 trillion yen -- a fraction of the value of its investments -- because it is not responsible for the debt of independently run subsidiaries like Sprint. But some investors are still skeptical of the company's ability to service its debt.

""A lot of investors still think of SoftBank as a telecommunications company, and look at the relatively high level of debt at the consolidated level compared to earnings,"" said David Gibson, analyst at Astris Advisory Japan. ""Deconsolidating Sprint will make the comparison much more simple.""

The FCC has been reviewing the merger plan since June last year. Pai's endorsement comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration looks increasingly worried about losing technological superiority in next-generation communications.

An FCC approval of the merger would solve a major concern for SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, who has sought ways to mitigate the risks of the $21 billion-plus purchase of the carrier completed in 2013.

Sprint shares shot up over 20% during Monday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while T-Mobile shares rose 7% at one point on the Nasdaq.

A smaller slice of a stronger company that can better compete with U.S. market leaders AT&T and Verizon may prove more valuable for SoftBank. But Sprint and T-Mobile made concessions to win the FCC chief's endorsement, which may hamper their growth strategy moving forward.

Sprint promised to sell off its prepaid-phone unit Boost Mobile, responding to FCC concerns that putting prepaid subsidiaries of both Sprint and T-Mobile under one roof may stifle competition. Prepaid phones are popular among low-income users, prompting worries that a merger could lead to higher prices.

The two carriers submitted commitments Monday that pledged to close the digital divide in the U.S. and advance American leadership in 5G, the FCC said in the statement.

""The companies have committed to deploying a 5G network that would cover 97% of our nation's population within three years of the closing of the merger and 99% of Americans within six years,"" the FCC said.

""Additionally, T-Mobile and Sprint have guaranteed that 90% of Americans would have access to mobile broadband service at speeds of at least 100 [megabits per second] and 99% would have access to speeds of at least 50 Mbps,"" the statement added.

Introducing 5G services requires a major investment, and the two carriers had sought a merger to save costs through eliminating overlap.

The FCC said that the companies would ""suffer serious consequences"" if they failed to follow through on their commitments.

""These consequences, which could include total payments to the U.S. Treasury of billions of dollars, create a powerful incentive for the companies to meet their commitments on time,"" it said.

Securing approval from the FCC, the key regulator on telecommunications, would be a major step toward the merger. But the deal also requires the consent of the Department of Justice, which is reviewing the proposal from an antitrust standpoint."

In modern times, presidents have rarely been church mice afraid of a little salty language. But President Donald Trump has grown increasingly willing in recent months to say in public what most of his predecessors tried to keep behind closed doors.

His is the profanity presidency, full of four-letter denunciations of his enemies and earthy dismissals of allegations lodged against him. At rallies and in interviews, on Twitter and in formal speeches, he relishes the bad-boy language of a shock jock, just one more way of gleefully provoking the political establishment bothered by his norm-shattering ways.

In a single speech on Friday alone, he managed to throw out a “hell,” an “ass” and a couple of “bullshits” for good measure. In the course of just one rally in Panama City Beach, Florida, earlier this month, he tossed out 10 “hells,” three “damns” and a “crap.” The audiences did not seem to mind. They cheered and whooped and applauded.

“I’d say swearing is part of his appeal,” said Melissa Mohr, the author of “Holy Sh*t: A Brief History of Swearing,” published in 2013. “It helps create the impression that he is saying what he thinks, ‘telling it like it is.’ We tend to believe people when they swear, because we interpret these words as a sign of strong emotions. In his case, the emotion is often powerful anger, which his supporters seem to love.”

While traditionalists may deem it unpresidential and a poor example for children, Martha Joynt Kumar, a longtime scholar of presidential communication, said gritty language was part of the show put on by Trump, the onetime reality television entertainer, for his fans.

“He knows they like him to use words that lie over the edge of the traditional boundary of presidential decorum,” she said. “His controversial word choices are an aspect of his role as the disrupter he promised his constituents he would be.”

But critics say the vulgarity comes at a cost. “No one has debased the civil discourse in this country more than President Trump, and the president really does set the tone in the country,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. “We see it reflected in our offices by the hateful, belligerent, obscene and violent calls that we get now that we didn’t used to get.”

Schiff has experienced it personally when Trump turned his name into a profanity last fall by nicknaming him “little Adam Schitt.” Schiff said, “The last time that happened, the person who did that had their mouth washed out with soap by his mother.”

An unscientific survey seems to suggest that if anything, Trump is growing more comfortable with crudeness. He used the word “bullshit” in public just once in his first two years in office, according to the Factba.se database that tracks his speeches, but on four occasions in the last three months.

He has either coarsened the public discourse or reflected it, or perhaps both, depending on your view of him, but he is not alone. Society in recent years has embraced what used to be considered profanity. Even The New York Times, the so-called Gray Lady with all the news that’s fit to print, found it fit to print the BS word just 14 times in the many years before Trump’s inauguration, according to a Nexis search, but has used it 26 times since — not all in stories covering the president.

Other presidents, of course, have engaged in common language and found a connection to everyday people. Harry S. Truman was told to “give ’em hell, Harry,” to which he famously replied: “I don’t give them hell. I just tell the truth about them and they think it’s hell.” But in general, it used to be something of a mini-scandal when a president was caught cursing in public.

During a campaign event in 2000, George W. Bush was heard over a live microphone talking with his running mate, Dick Cheney, calling a Times reporter he did not particularly like a “major-league asshole.” In 2004, as vice president, Cheney told a senator on the Senate floor to “go fuck yourself.” His successor, Joe Biden, was overheard in 2010 using a variation of that profanity to tell Barack Obama what a big deal passage of health care legislation was.

Never has any president pushed the boundaries of language as far as Trump. He had a foul mouth long before politics, of course, but he seemed to try, however fitfully, to clean it up for a while when he set his sights on the White House. Still, he could not resist at times. At one rally during his 2016 campaign, he quoted a supporter calling a Republican rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a “pussy.”

Once taking office, he tried, at least, to keep it private, but he was uninhibited when the cameras were not on. After the special counsel, Robert Mueller, was appointed, he told aides, “I’m fucked.” Speaking with lawmakers, he called African nations “shithole countries.”

Yet Trump feigned shock in January when the newly elected Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan said she and her fellow House Democrats were “going to impeach the motherfucker.” The president told reporters that “she dishonored herself” by “using language like that in front of her son and whoever else was there.”

Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, acknowledged a certain raw quality in Trump’s discourse but dismissed its significance. “The president does use coarse language in private a lot with us,” he told Jake Tapper on CNN after Tlaib’s comment. “Many people do.” But, he added, “I think there’s more important things as to who’s coarsening the language.”

Any restraint Trump may have sought to exhibit early in his term seems to have eroded in recent months. In a January interview with The Times, he boasted that he had “beat the shit out of” Republican rivals in 2016. A month later, he told the Conservative Political Action Conference that his enemies were trying to take him out “with bullshit.”

A few weeks later, he told a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, that Democrats were peddling “ridiculous bullshit” about him. In April, he said some statements in the special counsel report were “total bullshit.” Last week, he retweeted a post by his son Eric Trump saying that under Bill de Blasio, the New York mayor now running for president, “our great city has gone to shit.”

By the time the president took the stage before the National Association of Realtors in Washington on Friday, he was in a feisty mood.

He recalled that a consultant tried to make work for himself by identifying environmental concerns on a property Trump wanted to develop. “I fired his ass so fast,” the president recalled.

He told the Realtors that he used to refuse to pay brokers their traditional 6 percent commission and instead gave them just 1 percent. “I was famous for that,” he said. When they booed, he quickly retreated. “Don’t worry. Nobody accepted it. But I tried like hell.”

Then he went after one of his favorite targets — journalists — claiming that recent reports of infighting within his national security team were made up. “There is no source,” he said. “The person doesn’t exist. The person’s not alive. It’s bullshit, OK? It’s bullshit.”

DES MOINES, Iowa — U.S. corn farmers have the most corn acres left to plant, on this date, than they have ever had and remain behind the trade’s expectations, as well.

In its Crop Progress Report Monday, the USDA pegged U.S. corn planting at 49% complete, behind the 80% five-year average.

The trade expected a completion rating of 53%. On this week of the planting season, the most that U.S. farmers have ever had left was 47% of the crop. In 2019, that amount is 51%, with plenty of rain in the Midwest’s forecast.

As of Sunday, Iowa farmers had 70% of that state’s corn crop planted vs. a 89% five-year average. Illinois farmers have 24% of their corn seeded, behind a 89% five-year average. Indiana has 14% planted vs. a 73% five-year average. In the western Corn Belt, Nebraska farmers have 70% of their corn planted vs. a 86% five-year average.

Also, 19% of the U.S. corn has emerged vs. a 49% five-year average.

Biden would beat Trump in Pennsylvania despite president's 2016 win: Donna Brazile,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Julia Musto', ""Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S"", ""America'S Newsroom.""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-biden-would-beat-trump-in-pennsylvania-despite-presidents-2016-triumph-in-the-state-over-hillary-clinton-donna-brazile,"Former Vice President Joe Biden has what it takes to win back a key battleground state for the Democratic Party that President Trump took in 2016, according to ex-DNC Interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile.

Brazile, speaking during an interview on ""America's Newsroom"" Tuesday, said Biden would be able to make up the less than one percentage point Trump won by in Pennsylvania over Hillary Clinton in 2016.

“Look, I think it’s going to be a close election across the country. But, Donald Trump won the state of Pennsylvania by less than 50,000 votes,"" she said.

""Joe Biden will be able to make that up. But, not just Joe Biden—any one of the Democrats I think can be very competitive in the Keystone State.”

TRUMP, AT RAUCOUS PENNSYLVANIA RALLY, SLAMS SCRANTON-BORN BIDEN: 'HE DESERTED YOU'

Brazile’s comments follow a fiery rally in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, Monday night where the president hit hard at Biden.

As he was ending his speech, Trump told a packed crowd, “Don’t forget: Biden deserted you. He’s not from Pennsylvania. I guess he was born here, but he left you, folks. He left you for another state. Remember that, please.”

Biden served as a Senator from Delaware for over 30 years but was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

""This guy talks about 'I know Scranton,'"" Trump said. ""Well, I know the places better. He left you for another state and he didn't take care of you.""

JOE BIDEN TELLS YOUNG ACTIVISTS HE STARTED PUSH TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE IN 1987

Brazile countered, “He’s well known in Pennsylvania and he’s not the forgotten son. He is the forgotten hero.”

A Quinnipiac University poll released last week shows Biden beating Trump in a head-to-head matchup in Pennsylvania 53 to 42. Additionally, according to a report from Politico using what it said was the Trump campaign’s internal polling, Biden is also ahead in two more highly contested states: Wisconsin and Michigan.

However, both Biden and the president will face a packed field in 2020 with 22 other Democratic candidates now in the running and a long road still ahead.

“The one thing you can give Joe Biden credit [for] is he understands the electorate and he wants to win,” said Brazile. “But, again, he has to get through the Democratic primary...Joe Biden has got to not only maintain his lead, but he has to expand his appeal to voters who might not be familiar with his record as well as voters who might want to see a different face in the White House in 2020.”

Today, as anticipated, the Commerce Department loosened that restriction a bit with a temporary 90-day license. According to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, it ""will allow operations to continue for existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks.""

Because many operators, or owners of various handsets might not have any other way to get software updates or look into backups for necessary equipment, Huawei can continue to service those existing customers -- for now at least. For the long term, however, it's still looking at the loss of access to technology like Google's Android OS, not to mention any business deals in the US.

Update: Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei made a rare public statement, telling media in China that his company had already made preparations for a ban, and said that its 5G would not be affected by the restrictions. He also said the temporary license ""bears little meaning."""

On Monday, he said the two companies need to build up adequate capital before they can be privatized, which means that the sweeps of extra profits from Fannie and Freddie into the U.S. Treasury would have to end. He gave no time horizon for when that would happen.

He said that common shareholders are part of the discussions. Existing shareholders could see their stakes shrink if the GSEs issue and sell new shares to build up the capital needed.

A major part of the plan would be what happen to the warrants, representing about 80% of each of the two GSEs, that the government holds as part of their rescue during the financial crisis."
DOJ reveals name of ex-US attorney accused of sexual misconduct after BuzzFeed lawsuit,https://thehill.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/444620-doj-reveals-name-of-ex-us-attorney-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-after,"The Justice Department has revealed the name of a former U.S. attorney accused of misconduct after BuzzFeed News successfully sued for disclosure of his identity.

The Justice Department announced in May 2017 that the since-retired attorney had an affair with a subordinate, created a hostile work environment and possibly violated department policy on sexual harassment. A federal judge ruled in March that public interest superseded government officials’ right to privacy, forcing the Justice Department to disclose last week the attorney in question was Stephen Wigginton, who served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois from 2010 to 2015. Wigginton was also charged with driving under the influence and causing a car crash in 2017.

In the March ruling, U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick ruled the Justice Department omitted key details in arguing Wigginton’s case only involved an “improper consensual relationship.”

“Instead, the improper relationship was so open and obvious that it caused employees within the Office to feel powerless, embarrassed, and distracted, and resulted in a work environment that some described as unbearable and hostile,” Broderick wrote. “In addition to work environment issues, the conduct had an impact on the operations of the Office since it resulted in disparate treatment regarding bonuses and disciplinary actions, and led some to avoid the U.S. Attorney and Supervisory AUSA at all costs.”

“Following the OIG’s investigation into this matter, the Department took appropriate steps to assess and address the issues outlined in the OIG’s report,” a Justice Department spokesperson told BuzzFeed. “The department has complete confidence in the new leadership and overall professionalism of the [US attorney’s office] in the Southern District of Illinois.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill."
Deadline ends for Alabama to meet DOJ demands on prisons,https://www.al.com,"['Mike Cason', 'Mcason Al.Com']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/doj-notification-period-on-alabama-prisons-coming-to-end.html,"It’s been seven weeks since the U.S. Department of Justice notified Gov. Kay Ivey of allegations that conditions in Alabama’s men’s prisons violate the Constitution because of the level of violence, sexual abuse and other problems.

The notification said the DOJ could file a lawsuit at the end of a 49-day period if the state’s response to the allegations is inadequate.

The 49-day notification is required under the federal law called the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, CRIPA.

Jay Town, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, issued a statement today in response to a question about the notification period ending. The three U.S. attorneys in Alabama were involved in the two-year investigation of prisons that led to the allegations and Town is working with state officials on the response and remedies.

“We are encouraged with the current progress of our negotiations with the State,” Town said in the statement. ""It is too early in this process, however, to determine whether there will be a need for CRIPA litigation. The Department remains hopeful that such a step will be unnecessary.”

Sen. Cam Ward, R-Alabaster, who has been involved in the state’s response, had said earlier today he was not expecting a lawsuit, at least not immediately.

“We’ve had some very good conversations with DOJ and they know that we’re committed to working our way through this and trying to comply with some of their concerns,” Ward said. “I do not expect a lawsuit, at all. And they’ve been very reassuring on that. Now that’s not a guarantee.”

The DOJ could file a lawsuit later. The 49-day period was a minimum notification period before doing so.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers held a press conference last week about the prison issues.

They say the problems would be best addressed in a special session. Ivey has not said whether she will call a special session.

The governor issued a statement last week on the state’s longstanding problem with overcrowded, understaffed and dangerous prisons, saying, “This problem has been kicked down the road for the last time.”

“I am encouraged to know that the Legislature will continue to work on solutions during the remainder of this session, we will remain in constant communication with one another during the coming weeks and months to keep this issue on the front burner,"" Ivey said in the statement.

Legislators have nine meeting days left in the regular session, counting today. The session must end by June 17.

Bob Horton, spokesman for the Alabama Department of Corrections, issued a statement about the notification period coming to an end.

“There is no 49-day deadline for enacting changes, nor is there a requirement that DOJ file a lawsuit,” Horton said. ""Since issuance of the findings letter, the State and the DOJ have engaged in collaborative communications seeking to jointly address the issues outlined in the DOJ’s findings letter.

“Even before the DOJ released its report, ADOC recognized the magnitude and scope of the challenges facing our Department.

Trump administration will hire Cuccinelli for senior DHS border role,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Josh Dawsey', 'Reporter Covering The White House', 'Nick Miroff', 'Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement', 'Drug Trafficking', 'National Security', 'May At Pm']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-hired-cuccinelli-for-senior-dhs-border-role/2019/05/21/f9272ddc-7be1-11e9-a66c-d36e482aa873_story.html,"The Trump administration will hire conservative firebrand and former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli II to coordinate immigration policy at the Department of Homeland Security, three administration officials said Tuesday.

Cuccinelli will work at DHS in a senior role and will report to acting DHS secretary Kevin ­McAleenan, while also providing regular briefings to President Trump at the White House, according two officials briefed on the appointment.

The hiring is the latest DHS leadership shuffle by the White House, which is desperate to contain a record-breaking influx of Central American families that has pushed border crossings to the highest level in a dozen years. Frustrated with his administration’s inability to stem the crisis, Trump has sacked top Homeland Security officials and demanded a “tougher” response.

Cuccinelli, who has been hawkish on immigration policy during television appearances that also praise Trump, appears to fulfill the president’s desire to have a forceful personality and a loyalist at the highest levels of DHS. But his arrival risks new instability at the agency, coming six weeks after Trump ousted Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and replaced her with McAleenan, a long-serving official who was confirmed by the Senate last year as commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and who is one of the few administration figures who retains a favorable reputation with lawmakers from both parties.

Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank whose immigration-reduction agenda has had significant influence in the White House, called Cuccinelli “an unusual choice.”

“He doesn’t have any immigration experience, but he does have law enforcement experience,” said Krikorian, who said he was “cautiously optimistic” that the appointment would make a difference. The crucial factor, he predicted, would be access to the White House.

“If he does not answer directly to the president, he’s not likely to be able to get much done,” he said.

[Before Trump’s purge at DHS, top officials challenged plan for mass arrests]

Before leaving DHS, Nielsen had advocated for the designation of a policy coordinator at the White House who would streamline communications and planning among the various federal agencies responding to the situation at the border, including the Departments of Defense, Justice, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security.

The official said Nielsen wanted the coordinator to work out of the White House, not at DHS. “There is no one coordinating policy across the government,” the official said. “You have 10 people coordinating it.”

The White House offered the job to Cuccinelli after it was turned down by Tom Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to two officials. Trump also soured weeks ago on Kris Kobach, the Kansas Republican favored by immigration restrictionist groups, according to one senior administration official.

Cuccinelli will do the job from DHS, filling a role that would otherwise be McAleenan’s, which sets up potential conflicts.

“It is bad news for [McAleenan],” said one senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide candid views. “You have someone at the agency that the White House might have in mind to be the next DHS secretary.”

Another former department official predicted Cuccinelli’s lack of authority at the agency and distance from the White House would leave him in a weak position from the outset.

“Putting an immigration czar at DHS is a total waste,” the person said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to inquiries about Cuccinelli’s role. Cuccinelli, who was at the White House on Monday, could not be reached for comment. His expected hiring was first reported by the New York Times.

If the White House is grooming him as a possible replacement for McAleenan, he would face a difficult path to confirmation.

Cuccinelli is deeply disliked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has vowed to block Cuccinelli from any Senate-confirmed post for leading efforts in 2014 backing insurgent candidates that hurt the Senate GOP majority, McConnell advisers said.

Two years ago, Cuccinelli signed a letter drafted by GOP activists calling on McConnell to step down.

When Cuccinelli’s name surfaced last month as a potential Nielsen replacement, McConnell told reporters he’d conveyed his unease to the White House. “I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm for one of them . . . Ken Cuccinelli,” McConnell said.

The Virginia conservative, who has a long record of combative television appearances, is even less popular with Democrats. “This is absurd and outrageous,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) wrote on Twitter. “He doesn’t deserve a taxpayer-funded salary.”

Others more supportive of the move noted that the DHS secretary’s role is challenging enough when there isn’t a migration crisis — and with hurricane season approaching, McAleenan could benefit from a strong personality fully devoted to the border.

In April, more than 100,000 migrants were taken into custody along the U.S.-Mexico border for the second consecutive month, and the numbers in May are on pace to go even higher. McAleenan warned in late March that U.S. agents and infrastructure at the border had hit a “breaking point,” and since then the situation has worsened, leaving holding cells so overcrowded that DHS officials have been transferring migrants out of South Texas by aircraft simply to make room for ever-growing numbers of new arrivals.

[From the border, more frustrating immigration numbers for Trump]

Cuccinelli has been a vocal advocate for Trump’s proposed border wall and other measures popular with hard-liners. He has backed constitutional changes to restrict birthright citizenship, urged lawsuits against employers who hire undocumented immigrants and at one point supported denying immigrant workers — including those in the country lawfully — from collecting unemployment benefits if they are fired for not speaking English on the job.

His appointment to DHS has others in the administration worried there will be too many players fighting to establish control over an immigration agenda, with White House adviser Stephen Miller already chafing officials at DHS.

One White House adviser said Cuccinelli would advocate for the White House’s aggressive position at the agency. Miller has argued to Trump that others within DHS are trying to stall him.

[Acting Secretary blocked Stephen Miller’s bid for new DHS shake-up]

McAleenan last week pushed back at an attempt by Miller to have Trump’s pick to lead ICE installed at CBP instead. In a tense White House meeting Thursday, McAleenan said he needed control over DHS to remain in his job, administration officials said.

The animus between Cuccinelli and Senate Republicans stems from his leadership of the Senate Conservatives Fund, which organized anti-incumbent efforts, and from his role at the 2016 Republican convention, when he derided “petty, tyrannical rules” and threw his ID badge on the floor in protest of Trump’s nomination. He was a strong supporter of the presidential bid by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who has since become one of Trump’s most ardent defenders.

Another senior administration official who welcomed the appointment said there was an acute need for someone to be an immigration policy field marshal.

“The president’s frustration is not directed at DHS alone,” the official said. “It’s DOJ, DOD, State. So this job will ensure closer coordination at a senior level, and it’s an effort to acknowledge you need someone who can have conversations with department heads about policies and drive them to the same place.”

But the official also acknowledged that Cuccinelli’s appointment risked undercutting ­McAleenan at a time when the acting secretary has been making inroads with lawmakers, including Democrats who see him as a neutral law enforcement official rather than a White House political operative.

“I don’t see how this appointment makes things better on the Hill,” the official said."

U.S. eases curbs on Huawei; founder says clampdown underestimates Chinese firm,https://www.reuters.com,"['Brenda Goh', 'Min Read']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-usa-license-idUSKCN1SQ27T,"SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States has temporarily eased trade restrictions on China’s Huawei to minimize disruption for its customers, a move the founder of the world’s largest telecoms equipment maker said meant little because it was already prepared for U.S. action.

The U.S. Commerce Department blocked Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from buying U.S. goods last week, a major escalation in the trade war between the world’s two top economies, saying the firm was involved in activities contrary to national security.

The two countries increased import tariffs on each other’s goods over the past two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump said China had reneged on earlier commitments made during months of negotiations.

On Monday, the Commerce Department granted Huawei a license to buy U.S. goods until Aug. 19 to maintain existing telecoms networks and provide software updates to Huawei smartphones, a move intended to give telecom operators that rely on Huawei time to make other arrangements.

Shares of U.S. suppliers to Huawei including Qualcomm Inc, Intel Corp and Lumentum Holdings Inc rose, with the Philadelphia Chip Index up 2.1%.

Radio frequency chipmaker Qorvo was the latest U.S. supplier after mobile parts maker Lumentum to halt shipments to Huawei.

It is unclear what the U.S. government extension permits, but if it allows Huawei to keep purchasing components, the company will likely order more to build inventory, said Mark Kelleher, an analyst at D.A. Davidson.

Huawei is still prohibited from buying American-made hardware and software to make new products without further, hard-to-obtain licenses.

Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei on Tuesday told Chinese state media that the reprieve bore little meaning for the company as it had been making preparations for such a scenario.

“The U.S. government’s actions at the moment underestimate our capabilities,” Ren said in an interview with CCTV, according to a transcript published by the Chinese state broadcaster.

The temporary license suggests changes to Huawei’s supply chain may have immediate, far-reaching and unintended consequences for its customers.

The Commerce Department said it will evaluate whether to extend the license period beyond 90 days.

CURRENCY FIRMS

China’s yuan firmed versus the dollar on Tuesday as news of the reprieve eased some worries that trade tensions would be further inflamed and inflict deeper losses on the currency.

Beijing has struck an increasingly defiant tone as the trade war has escalated, saying it will take measures to safeguard the interests of its companies, but has not said whether or how it may retaliate over the U.S. action against Huawei.

President Xi Jinping’s Monday visit to a rare-earth company in southern China sparked speculation that the sector could be the next front in the trade war, driving up shares in Chinese rare-earth related firms on Tuesday.

China produced 80% of rare-earths, a group of 17 chemical elements used in electronics, imported by the United States in 2017.

“Given the Huawei decision, I feel they (China) have no choice but to retaliate, for face sake,” Cliff Tan, head of East Asian research at MUFG Bank in Hong Kong, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Tuesday.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, at a media briefing, rebuffed Trump’s claim that his tariffs were causing companies to move production away from China, saying foreign investors remain enthusiastic about the country.

GOOGLE SUSPENSION

Huawei is on the receiving end of a U.S. government accusation that it engaged in bank fraud to obtain embargoed U.S. goods and services in Iran and move money via the international banking system. Huawei has pleaded not guilty.

The trade blacklist has added to its woes, following which Alphabet Inc’s Google suspended some business with Huawei, Reuters reported on Sunday citing a person familiar with the matter, raising worries about the Chinese firm’s smartphones that run on Google’s Android operating system.

Monday’s temporary license is likely to allow companies such as Google to continue providing service and support, including software updates or patches, to Huawei smartphones that were available to the public on or before May 16.

“Keeping phones up to date and secure is in everyone’s best interests and this temporary license allows us to continue to provide software updates and security patches to existing models for the next 90 days,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email on Tuesday.

The license also allows Huawei to engage in the development of standards for fifth-generation (5G) telecom networks.

APPLE PRAISE

Ren put up a brave front on Tuesday, reiterating claims that the restrictions will not hurt Huawei’s prospects and that no other company will be able to catch up with Huawei in 5G technology in the next two to three years.

China was nevertheless still “far behind” the United States in technology, he said.

Chip experts have called out Huawei on its claims that it could ensure a steady supply chain without U.S. help, saying the technology it buys from American companies would be “hard to replace.”

Nearly 16% of Huawei’s spending on components in 2018 went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm, Intel and Micron Technology, analysts said.

Ren said Huawei was at odds with the U.S. government, not U.S. firms, and in a comment that trended on Chinese social media, he praised Apple Inc’s iPhones, saying he gifted the American firm’s devices to family members.

“Apple has a good business ecosystem. ... We cannot think narrow-mindedly that loving Huawei equals loving its phones.”

U.S. firms could lose up to $56.3 billion in export sales over five years from stringent export controls on technologies involving Huawei or otherwise, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation said in a report. Missed opportunities threatened as many as 74,000 jobs, the foundation said."

"Suit led by Gov. Justice's son claims OSM broke settlement deal, preempts another federal lawsuit",https://www.wsaz.com,[],,,,https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/Suit-led-by-Gov-Justices-son-claims-OSM-broke-settlement-deal-preempts-another-federal-lawsuit-510252501.html,"Companies owned by the family of Gov. Jim Justice have filed a lawsuit against the federal Office of Surface Mining, apparently preempting another impending lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The lawsuit by Justice companies contends the agency acted in bad faith by reversing course on a settlement deal. Lawyers for the Justice companies also insinuate the federal government may be acting out a political vendetta.

This is the second legal showdown this month between Justice companies and an agency of the federal government over defaulting penalties.

A separate lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Mine Safety and Health Administration was filed on May 7. That one contended Justice companies owe $4.7 million for 2,297 citations over five years.

That action is an aspect of why Justice companies contend they are being treated unfairly.

Governor Justice described unnamed political forces on May 8 when reporters asked for his reaction to the MSHA lawsuit.

“You know, we’re getting ready to go into an election year. You don’t really know where stuff comes from,” the governor said. “But at the end of the day, we’ll take care of our obligations. We always have and we always will.”

The lawsuit filed May 17 by Justice companies against the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement also makes reference to possible political motives.

The lawsuit contends the two parties had agreed to settle fines, reclamation fees and penalties when that agency suddenly started playing hardball.

“The abrupt turnaround by the government in its attitude toward this matter is inexplicable and raises the question whether untoward political or other pressure from sources presently unknown has been brought to bear on OSMRE, perhaps from other federal agencies or political adversaries of the Justice family,” the lawsuit states.

The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Senior Judge Glen Conrad was assigned.

Documents within the filing allude to a possible impending lawsuit against Justice companies by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of OSM. If so, that would mirror the earlier lawsuit on behalf of MSHA.

An attached May 13 letter by Mike Carey, a lawyer for Justice and his companies, is addressed to the U.S. Department of Interior.

“I understand from discussions with your office last week that the filing of one or more complaints is imminent,” Carey wrote. “This is of grave concern and bewilderment to my clients. We believe it is unecessary, as we have now met every term your requested to settle this matter.

“If a file has been forwarded to the Department of Justice, I request that this correspondence be immediately provided to the individuals working on this matter and that they be notified we have agreed to all of the OSM’s settlement demands.”

Carey also represents the Justice companies on the MSHA lawsuit. And he represents the Governor’s Office on the lawsuit over whether Justice violates the state Constitution’s requirement to reside at the seat of government. Plus the Governor’s Office used Carey’s firm last year to investigate its own Department of Commerce.

A response to Carey by the Department of the Interior on May 15 also alludes to an impending federal lawsuit.

“Yesterday afternoon, a letter authorizing DOJ to file suit against the Justice Companies on behalf of the Department of Interior was signed and sent (the end of a process that has taken months to accomplish — the MSHA lawsuit plays no part in DOI’s referral to DOJ),” wrote John Austin of the Interior department.

“If your clients want to settle these cases before suit is filed, please make an offer that we can discuss with DOJ.”

The lawsuit filed by Justice companies contends another federal lawsuit would further damage the companies’ reputation.

“Any suit filed by the government in contravention of the Settlement Agreement would create a false impression and arguably be defamatory in that it would cause harm to the business and personal reputations of the Plaintiffs,” lawyers for the Justice companies wrote.

This has resulted from dozens of violations by several Justice companies recorded by OSM in recent years. A spreadsheet in the filing lists 114, but does not indicate their nature or a dollar value.

Eleven of the violations name Jay Justice, the governor’s son who runs the coal operation.

“For what is believed to be the first time ever, the OSMRE also wrongfully assessed a series of individual assessments against Jay Justice personally, allegedly relating to the activities of the Justice Mining Entities,” according to the lawsuit by Justice companies.

Negotiations by Justice company representatives, including Jay, and officials with OSM picked up in early April, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit says Jay Justice and Tom Lusk, chief operating officer of Justice Mining Entities, met with Michael Castle, the field office director for OSM in Knoxville and Lexington, plus Mark Snyder, also with OSM.

The lawsuit indicates they meet several times April 8, sometimes with counsel and sometimes without.

Much of the conversation focused on Justice companies completing reclamation work in lieu of financial penalties. Part of the negotiation focused on whether the companies would need to provide additional financial information or collateral.

By late that month, according to Justice companies, significant expense had been expended to move equipment and start the reclamation work.

This month, according to Justice companies, the attitude of the federal government seemed to change.

“In the week of May 6, 2019, the government’s attitude toward the Justice Mining Entities noticeably soured,” lawyers for the company stated, noting the lawsuit that was filed by MSHA and the Department of Justice.

That filing prompted Austin of the Department of Interior to question whether Justice companies would be able to perform their duties under the settlement agreement, according to the Justice lawsuit.

In the May 15 letter, Austin stated that there had not been an authorized agreement to settle the penalties with OSM.

“I need to reiterate what you and your clients have been told: Neither OSMRe nor any of its employees nor the attorneys representing the Secretary of the Interior have authority to settle a debt owed to the United States that exceeds $100,000 without the approval of the U.S. Department of Justice.”

The Justice companies contended that playing hardball will mean the loss of mining jobs.

“As the plaintiffs previously made OMSRE and its attorneys aware, preceding litigiously instead of in accordance with the Settlement Agreement harms the operations of a dozen or so mining companies and risks the jobs of hundred of workers on the pending reclamation projects,” Justice company lawyers wrote.

The Department of Interior would like proof. It wants financial statements and any other information the company can provide to demonstrate a settlement is in the best interest of citizens.

“We will also need documentation of your belief that a settlement will preserve 450 jobs.”"

PORTSMOUTH, Va. (WAVY) -- The Hampton Roads Regional Jail needs 113 additional officers and a full-time psychiatrist to comply with the findings of a Department of Justice investigation.

This is to satisfy a U.S. Department of Justice investigation that said staffing was needed for the jail to meet DOJ standards.

The two-year investigation by the Justice Department concluded that conditions at the jail violate inmates' basic constitutional rights and protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The department's Civil Rights Division said the jail fails to provide adequate medical and mental health care for inmates. Officials have given the jail written notice and ways to fix conditions, all with the goal of ensuring the rights of prisoners.

It will come at a cost, and Portsmouth Sheriff Michael Moore says the regional jail plan to raise the money to pay for new officers will cost Portsmouth an estimated $1.46 million.

Moore says it is a terrible idea, it will cost Portsmouth taxpayers over a million dollars a year, it further works towards shutting down the Portsmouth Jail, and Portsmouth deputies could lose their jobs.

""I think that is even outrageous to be a consideration,"" Moore said.

Sheriff Moore says if the Hampton Roads Regional Jail raises fees to cities per inmate by $20, it'll cost Portsmouth an extra $1.46 million a year.

That $20 includes $2 that Portsmouth is already scheduled to pay in July. Sheriff Moore says it appears City Manager Lydia Pettis Patton supports the regional jail efforts.

""The statement our City Manager made in that meeting that Portsmouth can not afford two jails, and that the regional jail is the better jail.""

We called Patton for comment and response, but as is often the case in recent weeks, she has refused to return our calls.

She sits on the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Board that is considering the fee increase to pay for the 113 additional officers and a full time psychiatrist required by the Department of Justice. The cost for that is an estimated $7 million a year.

The Hampton Roads Jail Superintendent would not comment on the Board meeting on the fee increase, but emailed us a statement:

Last Thursday, the Hampton Roads Regional Jail Authority held a special called meeting. The meeting consisted of approving minutes from the previous regularly scheduled Board Meeting and a closed session to discuss potential legal matters. As a criminal justice professional, I believe integrity is of the upmost importance and as such, I do not feel that it is appropriate to comment on the matters discussed in a closed session. It is my understanding that Sheriff Michael Moore stopped sending incarcerated individuals from his facility to the Hampton Roads Regional Jail at the beginning of this year due to the report issued by the United States Department of Justice in December, however there are currently over 80 individuals in the facility from the City of Portsmouth. I think it is important to note that since taking the position of Superintendent, I have never been contacted by Sheriff Moore, his Undersheriff (Colonel Marvin Waters, Jr.), or any other Portsmouth Sheriff’s Office staff member regarding the Department of Justice report or any concerns they have regarding the care and treatment of those incarcerated here at the regional jail. Additionally, to my knowledge, any concerns or issues they may have, have not been brought up with any other Board Member or at any board meeting by Sheriff Moore or Colonel Waters, as neither has been in attendance at a board meeting since June of 2018. It is important to know that I am regularly contacted by the other member jurisdictions’ Sheriffs and/or their staff whenever there is a concern or issue that they feel needs to be addressed.

As for Patton, the sheriff told us, ""She wants our jail completely closed down, and then to move everyone to the regional jail, and what they do not understand is you would still have to build a structure to house inmates leaving Portsmouth City Jail and going to the regional jail.""

The constant battle is the Portsmouth City Jail is located on the Elizabeth River, and sits on valuable property rich for development.

Sheriff Moore Agrees with moving the Portsmouth CIty Jail. ""We are for relocation, but not closing. If we do that we have 100-plus deputies who could lose their jobs, and the community will lose critical services that we help provide.""

Sheriff Moore says he has proposed to City Manager Lydia Pettis Patton taking Portsmouth inmates out of the Regional Jail and putting them back in the Portsmouth jail to save the city money. He claims, ""even before I finished the thought, she said, 'It can't be done.'""

The sheriff also says, ""We are not at full capacity in the Portsmouth jail, and we could be of assistance to the Regional Jail. We have capacity of 288, but we only have 244 inmates. We could take back 44 from the Regional Jail and save tens of thousands over the course of a year.""

It should also be noted that Portsmouth is billed for 250 inmates, but only has 84 inmates at the Regional Jail."
"Governor, Energy Secretary call for accelerated nuclear contamination testing in Piketon",https://www.nbc4i.com,['Dan Pearlman'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/governor-energy-secretary-call-for-accelerated-nuclear-contamination-testing-in-piketon/2017602153,"Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

PIKETON, Ohio (WCMH) -- More than a week after a Pike County school was closed due to the discovery of enriched uranium in the building, concern over the extent of the radioactive contamination continues to grow.

In addition to the discovery in the school by an outside researcher, the United States Department of Energy says neptunium and americium were also detected by nearby air monitors. Additionally, a scientist from Northern Arizona University says his tests reveal contamination in area homes, waterways and the soil.

Many in Pike County are concerned that the chemicals may be coming from the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, which once produced enriched uranium and is now an environmental clean-up site.

Dave Mills lives about 1,200 feet from the plant.

He tells NBC4 that he hears work at the plant for several hours a day, and he’s worried about inhaling the possible contaminants that may be coming from it.

“We come out to mow and weed, and get our butts back in the house where we’re hoping that our micro-filter, our air-conditioner and furnace will take some of the contaminants out of the air,” Mills said.

The DOE has pledged to pay for additional third party testing of the area.

On Tuesday, Governor Mike DeWine released the following statement regarding his correspondence with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry:

I thank Secretary Perry for his prompt response and his pledge for the third party study to be completed as quickly as possible. I concur with with Secretary Perry's plan for an accelerated testing schedule for the school, and I welcome the Department of Energy and others to begin this process as soon as is feasible. I am asking that Pike County officials engage their chosen independent entity by the end of May. I am pledging to provide any staff resources from Ohio EPA and the Ohio Department of Health that Pike County officials need to engage their selection.

New DOJ Investigation Has Haunted FBI for Months,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/18/new_doj_investigation_has_haunted_fbi_for_months.html,"John Durham, the prosecutor tapped by Attorney General William Barr to investigate how Trump-Russia allegations emerged and spread within federal law enforcement, has already been looking into whether the FBI’s former top lawyer, James Baker, illegally leaked to reporters.

In fact, the U.S. attorney from Connecticut appears to have begun that work more than seven months ago, to judge from an underreported transcript of an October congressional interview with Baker. The Baker interview, at which Durham was not present, suggests that the prosecutor nevertheless has some people very worried.

Baker testified about the Trump-Russia affair on Oct. 3 before the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

In that session, the former FBI general counsel admitted that versions and variations of Christopher Steele’s dossier were being turned in to the bureau from the strangest of places. Baker said he had even heard about it from David Corn, Washington bureau chief of left-leaning Mother Jones, who wrote one of the first pieces on the dossier, in October 2016. But in one of those company-town connections that happen frequently in Washington, Baker said he was not just a contact or source for Corn; they were also old pals.

“Tell me about your relationship with David Corn,” said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan.

“David is a friend of mine,” Baker said.

“Tell me about that. A close friend? Long-time friend?”

“Long-time friend.”

Jordan asked, “When did you first meet Mr. Corn?”

“I don't specifically remember,” Baker testified. “A long time ago, though.”

“Years ago? “

“Years and years and years ago, yeah,” Baker allowed. “Our kids carpooled together. We carpooled with them when our kids were little.”

So one of the most divisive scandals in Washington history was facilitated by an unexpected friendship, an odd couple brought together by a shared interest in getting their kids dropped off at school.

The congressman from Ohio wanted to know more about the Baker-Corn relationship: “Prior to the election of – Presidential election of 2016,” Jordan asked, “how many times did you talk with David Corn in the weeks and months prior to election day?”

“I don't remember,” Baker said, providing an answer that suggests it was more than a few.

“Is it fair to say you did” talk with Corn, Jordan asked?

“Yes, I did, but I just don't remember how many [times].”

“So did you talk to Mr. Corn about anything that the FBI was working on,” Jordan asked, “specifically the now infamous Steele dossier?”

Suddenly, Baker’s lawyer, Dan Levin, jumped in: “One second,” he said before he and his client had a conversation off the record.

When the microphones were back on, Levin declared he would “not let [Baker] answer these questions right now. You may or may not know, he's been the subject of a leak investigation which is still – a criminal leak investigation that's still active at the Justice Department.” And so Levin concluded, “I’m sorry. I'm cutting off any discussion about conversations with reporters.”

North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows wanted to make clear what Baker’s lawyer was claiming: “You're saying he's under criminal investigation? That's why you're not letting him answer?”

“Yes.”

Levin and the lawmakers sparred a bit over whether Baker was invoking his Fifth Amendment rights, and the congressmen finally got around to asking who was leading this criminal probe:

“There is an ongoing investigation by whom?” Jordan said.

“The Justice Department,” Levin responded.

“I mean, is the inspector general looking at this or is this—”

“No,” said Levin, “it's Mr. John Durham, a prosecutor.”

The specter of Durham haunts the rest of the interview. Baker can’t talk about what he told his old friend David Corn in their conversations about the dossier because it would put Baker in legal jeopardy.

Time and again, when Baker was asked questions about reporters – even hypothetical questions about FBI policy regarding contacts with the press, Levin said, “I'm not going to allow him to answer that question” or “I am not going let him answer any questions about leaks.”

“I don't want him talking about conversations he's had with reporters because I don't know what the questions are and I don't know what the answers are right now,” Levin said. “Given that there is an ongoing investigation of him for leaks which the Department has not closed, I'm not comfortable letting him answer questions.” Durham’s inquiry was serious enough to limit significantly what Baker was willing to talk about with lawmakers.

That Baker’s lawyer advised him not to talk about leaks is, of course, not proof that Baker leaked. ""Baker's lawyer was obviously being prudent and saying his client could not talk about anything related to any leaks of any kind,"" David Corn tells RealClearInvestigations. Corn emphasizes that the ""Durham inquiry did not involve Russia or the Steele memos; it had nothing to do with me or my limited interaction with Baker.""

And one former federal official who said he has been interviewed by Durham in connection with the Baker probe, Robert Litt, has written that the inquiry has nothing to do with the Steele dossier.

Contacted by RealClearInvestigations, Levin said, “Mr. Baker did not make an unauthorized disclosure of classified information and we are confident the investigation will conclude that.”

US Treasury yields tick higher ahead of Fed minutes,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/us-bonds-treasury-yields-move-lower-ahead-of-economic-data-auctions.html,"At around 3:29 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was higher at around 2.43%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also up at around 2.845%.

Market participants are likely to closely monitor speeches from policymakers at the U.S. central bank. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren are both set to comment on the world's largest economy at separate events on Tuesday.

The speeches come after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Monday that rising levels of corporate debt did not pose an immediate threat to the financial system.

""Business debt does not present the kind of elevated risks to the stability of the financial system that would lead to broad harm to households and businesses should conditions deteriorate,"" Powell said in prepared remarks. ""At the same time, the level of debt certainly could stress borrowers if the economy weakens.""

Minutes from the Fed's latest meeting are set for release Wednesday.

The central bank said earlier this month that it would keep interest rates unchanged, though Powell added in a press conference that officials saw a decline in inflation in the first quarter as temporary.

""We think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment and we don't see a strong case for moving in either direction,"" Powell said on May 1. ""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%."""
Experts call out Trump's EPA for redefining environmental standards to allow for more air pollution,https://www.salon.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.salon.com/2019/05/20/experts-call-out-trumps-epa-for-redefining-environmental-standards-to-allow-for-more-air-pollution/,"President Donald Trump is planning on making it easier for air polluters to conceal the lives lost due to their actions — and a top climatologist and geophysicist is calling for him to be held accountable.

The Trump administration has instructed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use a new method for projecting the future health risks of air pollution, which would significantly reduce last year's estimate that up to 1,400 additional premature deaths will occur every year due to a proposed new rule on coal plant emissions, according to The New York Times. The plan is controversial, in part, because experts claim it has not been peer-reviewed and is not scientifically sound, breaking precedent in terms of how the EPA attempts to handle environmental regulations.

Its immediate effect, however, would be to make it easier for the Trump administration to implement its Affordable Clean Energy rule. In spite of its name, exists to reduce the environmental safeguards established by President Barack Obama's original Clean Power Plan, which it replaced.

""This is a logical next step in the effort by Trump and the polluting interests that dictate his environmental policies to dismantle the environmental protections of the past half century put in place by past both Republican and Democratic presidents,"" Michael E. Mann, a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, told Salon by email.

""Let me be blunt: Trump is choosing to kill people in order to increase the profits of the polluting interests to which he is beholden,"" Mann added. ""I cannot think of a more craven act than this, and we’re talking about a president who is known for craven acts. There is a reason I warned back in October 2016 that Trump is a threat to the planet.""

When asked if he believes the scientific community has a responsibility to break out of its usual apolitical stance in order to speak out against Trump's positions, Mann argued emphatically that this is indeed the case.

""I’ve been advocating that for years, but better late than never,"" Mann explained. ""The short answer is: Yes, our planet is under attack by polluting interests and the politicians doing their bidding. The stakes couldn’t be greater. We scientists cannot stand on the sidelines. We must be on the frontlines, doing everything we can to inform the public discourse concerning policy-relevant science.""

""Elections to have consequences. If a tiny fraction of voters who sat out the last presidential election under the misguided notion that there was no difference between the two candidates had voted, we wouldn’t be in the predicament we are now in,"" he continued. ""That having been said, there are many ways we can influence policy. We must use our voice. Speak out, encourage others to do so and provide support for our children, who are now literally marching in the streets because they recognize what the stakes are. We must find our voice and use it, we must demand that policymakers represent our interests rather than the polluting interests and we must vote out those who won’t.""

Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist in the climate analysis section of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, echoed these thoughts, telling Salon by email that ""there are a number of responsible businesses that clean-up after their activities, but it is often easy for others to undercut them by dumping their waste and pollution into the environment at a cost to all. A key role of government is to ensure that this does not happen, with rules and regulations to protect the innocent, including many animals and ecosystems. The current U.S. administration has abdicated its responsibility. Instead we all ultimately pay a much higher price in many ways. Let's Make America Clean Again!""

Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Department of Global Ecology was more blunt, telling Salon by email that ""it is one thing for the Trump administration to decide that more people should be killed from particulate air pollution, because their lives are worth less than the money to be made from loosened regulations. It is another thing entirely to enter an Orwellian world, in which we pretend that the loosening of regulations will not result in more people dying. Trump complains about fake news, but then to justify his policies, his minions create fake science and then use it to create real policy."""
USDA: Don’t add foodborne illness to summer menu,https://www.masslive.com,"['Anne-Gerard Flynn', 'Special To The Republican']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/05/usda-dont-add-foodborne-illness-to-summer-menu.html,"Rates of foodborne illnesses increase during the summer.

According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the season’s hot and humid weather causes environmental bacteria to grow faster and, of course, food is more exposed to possible contamination with summer’s many outdoor activities.

“We receive thousands of different questions from consumers regarding food safety during the summer,"" said Adam Ghering of FSIS’ Office of Public Affairs and Consumer Education.

“Many of those questions are linked to the weather. Severe storms and power outages routinely impact food safety during the summer.”

He added, “In general, perishable foods will stay safe in a refrigerator for four hours when the door remains closed.”

“If the power is out for longer, you can transfer foods to a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs. Foods in the freezer will be safe for approximately 48 hours, 24 hours if the fridge is half full,” said Ghering, adding further information on what food is still considered save to consume after a power outage is available online or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-674-6854.

Ghering said that the “other topic that we receive many questions about is cooking outdoors.”

“Cooking away from the kitchen can be fun but it also requires a good deal of preparation to ensure everything goes smoothly,” he said.

“Bringing water for washing hands, utensils and other equipment is something that can be easily overlooked. Moist towelettes can be a good ‘touch-up’ when your hands get dirty but the most effective method is soap and water.”

He also recommended a cooler will “to keep your food cold, just remember to keep replenishing ice as it melts” and “any type of food thermometer will provide you with the internal temperature of your meat and thereby help you prevent foodborne illness.”

“Any type of improper handling of your food can cause illness but not properly cooking and cooling meat and poultry is vital during summer months,” Ghering said.

“Meat and poultry can quickly brown when grilled but that doesn’t mean they are safe to eat.”

He called probe food thermometers “which you can keep in meat and poultry while cooking” a “great addition to your grilling equipment” in particular.

USDA tips to avoid food poisoning that is estimated to cause some 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths in the United States annually include:

Perishable food should not sit out for more than two hours at room temperature and no more than an hour when the temperature is above 90 degrees.

Pack beverages in one cooler and perishable food in another cooler and place cooler in shade when possible, even in car.

If grilling away from home, bring your own water for preparation and cleaning if unsure of availability of clean water supply.

Use a meat thermometer to ensure harmful bacteria are destroyed. Cook beef, pork, lamb and veal to internal minimum safe temperatures of 145 degrees; ground meats, 160 degrees; whole poultry, poultry breasts and ground poultry, 165 degrees.

Keep cooked meats at 140 degrees or warmer by setting them to the side of the grill rack, not directly over the coals where they could overcook. They may also be kept hot in an oven set at approximately 200 degrees in a chafing dish, slow cooker or warming tray.

Leftovers should be stored within two hours of cooking. Divide them into smaller portions and refrigerate or freeze in covered shallow containers for quicker cooling."

I'm Ellen Mitchell, and here's your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter.

THE TOPLINE: Top Trump administration officials worked Tuesday to lower the temperature after weeks of escalating tension with Iran, arguing the decision to deploy U.S. military assets to the Persian Gulf has worked.

""We have deterred attacks based on our reposturing of assets, deterred attacks against American forces,"" acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan Patrick Michael ShanahanThe Hill's Morning Report - Pelosi remains firm despite new impeachment push Iraq War looms over Trump battle with Iran Overnight Defense: Trump officials say efforts to deter Iran are working | Trump taps new Air Force secretary | House panel passes defense bill that limits border wall funds MORE said. ""Our biggest focus at this point is to prevent Iranian miscalculation. We do not want the situation to escalate. This is about deterrence, not about war.""

Joseph Dunford briefed the House and the Senate on intelligence that led the administration to deploy additional forces to the Middle East and warn of threats to U.S. personnel emanating from Iran.

Democrats still worried: While congressional leaders from both parties and some individual lawmakers were previously briefed, Tuesday's all-members briefings provided the first opportunity for many on Capitol Hill to question the administration on intelligence and policy toward Iran.

And while the Trump administration's messaging Tuesday appeared designed to assuage concerns, Democrats emerged from the briefings continuing to voice concerns about President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump rips Dems' demands, impeachment talk: 'Witch Hunt continues!'

""When you do that, you're talking about a war that will go on and on and on.""

A refresher: Tuesday's briefing followed an outcry from lawmakers that the administration had not provided enough information to Congress on its decision to deployment military assets to the Persian Gulf and pull non-emergency personnel from diplomatic missions in Iraq in response to alleged Iranian threats.

The State Department then pulled non-emergency personnel from Iraq last week over the threats.

For his part, Trump spent days repeatedly pushing back on reports of disagreement among top aides over his administration's Iran strategy and said last week he hoped there would not be war with Tehran. On Monday evening, in a change in message, Trump said he had ""no indication"" Iran will act.

""With Iran, we'll see what happens. But they've been very hostile,"" Trump said. ""We have no indication that anything has happened or will happen. But if it does, it will be met, obviously, with great force. We'll have no choice.""

Shanahan says threat 'on hold': In addition to his comments at the Capitol, Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon ahead of the briefing Tuesday that any threat from Iran is ""on hold"" after the arrival of U.S. military assets to the region.

""That doesn't mean that the threats that we've previously identified have gone away,"" Shanahan continued. ""Our prudent response, I think, has given the Iranians time to recalculate.""

Iran not open to talks: Iran on Tuesday dismissed the idea of talks with the United States, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani saying that ""today's situation is not suitable for talks and our choice is resistance only.""

Trump had said Monday that if Iran called, ""we would certainly negotiate,"" but added that ""if they're not ready, they don't have to bother.""

The mood on Capitol Hill: The Hill's Rebecca Kheel also took a look at the tensions around Iran ahead of the congressional briefings.

HOUSE APPROPS PASSES DEFENSE BILL THAT WOULD LIMIT FUNDS FOR BORDER WALL, PULL US SUPPORT FROM YEMEN: The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday passed its version of the fiscal year 2020 defense spending bill, voting along party lines for legislation that falls $8 billion below what the Trump administration requested, curtails the use of defense dollars to build a border wall and ends U.S. military support for the Saudi-led conflict in Yemen.

The panel voted 30 to 22 to move ahead the bill that funds the Defense Department at $690.2 billion in fiscal 2020, $15.8 billion above what was allocated the previous year but $8 billion below the White House's request.

Broken down, it includes $622.1 billion in base funding and $68.1 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) war fund.

""The Defense subcommittee has put forward a responsible spending bill that increases funds by $1 billion to address readiness requirements and ensure the well-being of our service members and their families,"" said House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey Nita Sue LoweyOvernight Defense: Trump officials say efforts to deter Iran are working | Trump taps new Air Force secretary | House panel passes defense bill that limits border wall funds House Appropriations passes defense bill that would limit funds for border wall, pull US support from Yemen war Ending AIDS requires US investment MORE (D-N.Y.).

""This bill also would prohibit the use of funds for President Trump's wasteful border wall, reserving DOD resources to protect the United States from actual threats, rather than those imagined by our President. This reflects a commitment to our national security for which we can all be proud.""

The AUMF fight: The bill reflects House Democrats' desire to curtail Trump's recent moves in foreign policy and along the border, most notably through Rep. Barbara Lee Barbara Jean LeeOvernight Defense: Trump officials say efforts to deter Iran are working | Trump taps new Air Force secretary | House panel passes defense bill that limits border wall funds House Appropriations passes defense bill that would limit funds for border wall, pull US support from Yemen war House panel approves language revoking 2001 war authority as Iran tensions spike MORE's (D-Calif.) amendment to retire the 2001 authorization for the use of military force (AUMF). The provision would sunset the AUMF – used as legal justification for military operations against terrorist groups 41 times in 18 countries since it was passed – eight months after the bill is enacted, giving Congress time to debate and vote on a new AUMF.

The AUMF debate comes as Trump has threatened Iran with military force.

But GOP lawmakers argued ending the current war authorization without a new one already approved could hamper military operations.

""I can think of few things more dangerous and ill-conceived than removing a fundamental underpinning for US military operations without having consensus agreement on what is to replace it,"" said the Defense subcommittee's ranking member, Rep. Kay Granger Norvell (Kay) Kay GrangerOvernight Defense: Trump officials say efforts to deter Iran are working | Trump taps new Air Force secretary | House panel passes defense bill that limits border wall funds House panel advances billion energy bill, defying Trump House Appropriations passes defense bill that would limit funds for border wall, pull US support from Yemen war MORE (R-Texas).

The reprogramming issue: The legislation's passage also sets up a fight over the bill's language to restrict the Pentagon's reprogram authority – or the amount of money it is allowed to move from the purpose for which the funds were designated into another area – to $1.5 billion. The move was a response to Trump's use of reprogram authority to move defense dollars to the construction of his promised border wall.

""It is unfortunate that the historical and unprecedented comity that has existed between the Committee and the Department of Defense no longer exists, and as a result, the bill reduces the amount of money the Department can move between accounts,"" said House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense Chairman Pete Visclosky.

Other problematic areas: In addition, the bill is likely to rankle the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House over its $690.2 billion defense top-line, which GOP lawmakers said would exceed budget caps and force budget cuts under sequestration.

The administration had instead sought to inflate its OCO request to $164.3 billion to stay under the caps, but Democrats accused the White House of attempting to set up a slush fund.

The bill also only allocated $15 million for the Pentagon to research setting up Trump's desired Space Force, far below the $72 million the department requested to build a Space Force headquarters.

Democrats have not been pleased with the administration's sparsely detailed plans for a separate space branch, and Visclosky said the Pentagon's Space Force proposal was ""incredibly lacking in detail.""

TRUMP TAPS NEW AIR FORCE SECRETARY: President Trump on Tuesday announced plans to nominate Barbara Barrett as the next Air Force secretary.

The president shared his choice via Twitter, adding that he believes Barrett ""will be an outstanding Secretary!""

""I am pleased to announce my nomination of Barbara Barrett of Arizona, and former Chairman of the Aerospace Corporation, to be the next Secretary of the Air Force. She will be an outstanding Secretary! #FlyFightWin,"" he wrote.

Who is Barrett? Barrett is the former chairwoman of The Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research center for national security and military space systems.

She previously served in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, first as the deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and later as the U.S. ambassador to Finland.

If confirmed by the Senate, she will replace outgoing Secretary Heather Wilson, who will step down at the end of the month.

""Ambassador Barrett is a force to be reckoned with and who has the leadership, experience, and knowledge to lead our Air Force into the future during a time of increased global threats,"" McSally, a veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.

What about Wilson?: Wilson has served in the role since May 2017. An Air Force veteran and former Republican congresswoman from New Mexico, she announced in March that she would leave to become president of the University of Texas at El Paso.

Her departure followed reports that her relationship with President Trump had soured amid the debate over his desire to establish a standalone ""Space Force.""

Air Force Under Secretary Matt Donovan will take over as the service's acting secretary beginning June 1 while a full-time replacement is confirmed.

The DHS reportedly wants to take $232 million from the Transportation Security Administration in order to fund its work at the border, if Congress doesn’t agree to $1.1 billion of its funding request. The millions would reportedly include $50 million set aside by the TSA to buy advanced airport screening equipment and $64 million from a worker’s compensation fund set aside for injured employees. Bizarrely, it would also include $3 million of loose change left in trays at airports. Money for Transportation Security Officers, who run security screening lines in airports, is also “in play,” according to leaked internal docs, which could cause significant disruption over the summer if reallocated. The Daily Beast reported late Monday that Secret Service officers are being sent to the border, joining Air Marshal agents and National Park Service police."
"Dagen McDowell: Obama-era FBI, DOJ officials 'worried' what Barr's review into Russia probe could find",https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dagen-mcdowell-obama-era-fbi-doj-officials-worried-what-barrs-review-into-russia-probe-could-find,"Are Obama-era intelligence officials worried about what Attorney General William Barr's investigation Ito the origins of the Russia probe will find?

Fox Business' Dagen McDowell believes they are, and said that is why some Democrats are questioning Barr's motives.

""They are trying to discredit him because they are worried, people who worked in the Obama administration, in the FBI and in the CIA and the intelligence community, they are worried. Whether it's Brennan or Comey or even subordinates of both of them. They are worried about what Bill Barr and John Durham and the Inspector General Michael Horowitz are going to find,"" McDowell said while co-hosting ""The Five.""

US ATTORNEY JOHN DURHAM HAS BEEN REVIEWING ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE 'FOR WEEKS:' SOURCE

On Monday, multiple outlets reported that Barr had appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine the origins of the Russia investigation

A person familiar with the process told Fox News Tuesday that Durham has been working on his review “for weeks,” to probe ""all intelligence collection activities"" related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Russia investigation and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report continue to be debated by Republicans and Democrats since its release last month.

In an interview that aired on Fox News Thursday, Barr explained that he is trying to get to the bottom of whether or not “government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale” during the early stages of the Russia probe.

McDowell also said Americans deserve to know the truth.

""[According to a Fox News poll released Thursday] a majority, 58 percent think it's at least somewhat likely the FBI broke the law when it started investigating the Trump campaign,"" McDowell said.

""They deserve answers. There is nothing wrong with a thorough look at it.""

State Department condemns killing of American citizen in Nicaraguan prison,https://www.cnn.com,['Kevin Bohn'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/18/politics/state-department-nicaragua-prison/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department condemned the killing of an American citizen being held in Nicaragua after a prison uprising, according to Nicaraguan and US officials.

However, they disagreed whether the killing of Eddy Antonio Montes Praslín was a justified homicide as the US ambassador and a lawyer representing Nicaraguan political prisoners maintain, or if it was justified because he was attacking guards as the Nicaraguans maintain.

Montes was killed during an incident at La Modelo prison on Thursday, according to Nicaraguan officials.

""We vehemently condemn the killing of Mr. Montes. His death, the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians at the hands of (Nicaraguan President Daniel) Ortega's security and parapolice forces, and the continued detention of hundreds more political prisoners demonstrate the regime's utter disregard for human life and democratic freedoms,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""We call for an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation of Montes's death. We reiterate our call for the unconditional release of all political prisoners.

"As Trade War Hits, China Looks Unsteady as $1.1 Trillion Treasury Investor",https://www.thestreet.com,['Bradley Keoun'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.thestreet.com/markets/as-trade-war-hits-china-looks-unsteady-as-trillion-dollar-treasury-bond-investor-14965285,"As President Donald Trump escalates his administration's trade war against China, a growing number of investors worry that the Asian country might fight back by liquidating its biggest-in-the-world stash of U.S. Treasury bonds.

Such a move is seen by most observers as unlikely. For China, it would be the economic version of the nuclear option.

But a new report suggested that China's central bank might have to start selling down its $1.12 trillion of Treasuries anyway -- to meet growing demand for the American currency from Chinese importers and tourists.

China has been one of the biggest buyers of Treasuries since it won entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, so a shift to draw-down mode could reduce global demand for the U.S. government bonds -- putting downward pressure on prices for the securities, and consequently pushing up yields.

It couldn't come at a worse time for the Trump administration, which is confronting China over allegedly unfair trade practices even as the U.S. Treasury Department needs international investors to help finance U.S. government budget deficits, currently pushing $1 trillion a year.

""As China stops being a large buyer of U.S. Treasuries, America's budget deficit is ballooning,"" according to the report from Dubai-based deVere Group, a $12 billion wealth-management firm. ""The combination is negative for U.S. Treasuries.""

Yields on 10-year Treasuries could jump to 2.8% by the end of 2019 from about 2.4% currently, said Tom Elliott, deVere's London-based chief international strategist. And even that level would still be low by historical standards, at roughly half the 30-year average. Last October, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicted that Treasury yields could jump to 4% or higher.

The Treasury market is critical because it's the U.S. government's primary means of financing the $22 trillion-and-growing national debt. Treasuries are a staple in most investors' portfolios, and they're a core asset of U.S. banks, since the bonds theoretically could be liquidated to free up cash if depositors suddenly demanded their money back.

China's massive trade surplus over the past two decades has allowed the nation to build up roughly $3 trillion of foreign reserves, including the U.S. Treasury bonds.

But that surplus is shrinking now, partly driven by a big increase in the nation's imports from Japan and South Korea as well as a surge in domestic consumption.

More Chinese tourists are going abroad, and they need to exchange their yuan for dollars. As of 2017, for example, the London department store Harrod's was reportedly taking in more sales from Chinese tourists than from British nationals.

A selldown by China of its Treasuries could open a new front in its ongoing trade war with the Trump administration, increasingly seen as a historic standoff among the world's two biggest economic superpowers.

""Some kind of trade conflict was present rather consistently throughout the history of conflict between ruling powers and rising powers,"" according to a Bank of America analysis published Monday.

Higher Treasury yields would likely exacerbate U.S. federal budget deficits, since payments would rise on the national debt.

And given the dollar's role as the world's dominant reserve currency, interest rates would likely also increase in other countries.

""Investors around the world may see higher global borrowing rates, from car loans to mortgages, because of the end of the Chinese savings glut,"" Elliott wrote. ""This could trigger a global economic downturn,"" Elliott wrote."
Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers,https://www.npr.org,['Frank Morris'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/18/724433714/critics-say-usda-plan-to-move-federal-agencies-could-hurt-research-vital-for-far,"Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers

A couple of federal agencies you probably haven't heard of keep track of what farmers grow, what Americans eat and how the country's entire food system operates. And the Trump administration wants them out of Washington, D.C.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would relocate somewhere that's closer to farmers and public universities doing agricultural research. But critics, including many scientists, balked, saying the agencies won't be as effective.

ERS collects and crunches numbers on everything from how much corn syrup Americans consume to how tariffs affect farmers, while NIFA funds research that does things like closely track climate change.

USDA has yet to announce a new home for the agencies, but recently narrowed the list to three: the greater Kansas City metro area, the Research Triangle Park area near Raleigh, N.C., and various sites in Indiana — Vice President Mike Pence's home state.

Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran recalled when he heard of Perdue's proposal.

""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" said the Republican, who, along with other Missouri and Kansas members of Congress, supports the move.

""Not every job in government needs to be in Washington D.C."" Moran said, noting that about 9 out of 10 USDA employees already work outside of Washington.

He added that ERS and NIFA would boost budding research clusters like the Kansas City area's animal health corridor and give bright kids from the region a chance to stay put and still pursue a research career. The move would also fall in line with the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Moran said office rent and the cost of living is cheaper away from the coasts.

Skepticism about what is driving the move

But many in the research community said efficiency isn't driving the move. It's hostility toward science.

""I think that moving the agencies out of D.C. is going to significantly dilute their effectiveness as well as their relevance,"" says Ricardo Salvador, who is the Director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The agency's effectiveness already is under attack, according to a former ERS employee who was granted anonymity due to fear of losing his current position.

""Efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale,"" the ex-ERS employee said.

He said he enjoyed working at the agency until about a year and a half ago, when researchers began to fear tackling politically sensitive topics. Then, Purdue pushed to take the agency out from under nonpartisan oversight and place it under his control.

Finally, the ex-employee said, the surprise announcement to move most of ERS and NIFA out of Washington triggered a cascade of resignations, including his own.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee said.

Employees remaining at ERS and NIFA are fighting back. ERS researchers recently voted to join the American Federation of Government Employees, and NIFA employees plan to take a vote, too. The union will negotiate to give ERS and NIFA employees longer to decide if they want to move, and is backing legislation that would withhold funds USDA would need to make the move.

The Trump administration wanted staff reductions years ago. And all three Trump budgets, none of which have been accepted by Congress, have proposed deep cuts to the agencies.

Salvador argued that's because objective research often clashes with political ideology. ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.

""So the secretary is clearly dealing with inconvenient facts by going to the source and eliminating them,"" Salvador said.

Sen. Jerry Moran said he believes the research agencies can be relocated and well supported, and he's played a key role in fighting off earlier efforts to cut funding for agricultural research.

Moran said farmers, ranchers and policymakers can't make sound decisions without reliable USDA data.

But that's exactly the problem critics have with the proposal to move ERS and NIFA: They say the USDA hasn't produced data that support the move."
Research on Children's Health Risks in Doubt Over EPA funds,https://www.voanews.com,['Associated Press'],,,,https://www.voanews.com/a/epa-children-health-research/4927475.html,"Long-running research projects credited with pivotal discoveries about the harm that pesticides, air pollution and other hazards pose to children are in jeopardy or shutting down because the Environmental Protection Agency will not commit to their continued funding, researchers say.

The projects being targeted make up a more than $300 million, federally funded program that over the past two decades has exposed dangers to fetuses and children. Those findings have often led to increased pressure on the EPA for tighter regulations.

Children's health researchers and environmental groups accuse the EPA of trying to squelch scientific studies that the agency views as running counter to the Trump administration's mission of easing regulations and promoting business.

""A lot of the centers, including mine, have identified a lot of chemicals that are associated with diseases in children,'' said Catherine Metayer, an epidemiologist who directs research into children's leukemia at University of California at Berkeley through the federal program.

The EPA awarded smaller than average funding for the research grants for this year, asked Congress to cut funding for it from its budget, and has refused to commit to future funding for the program.

""The EPA anticipates future funding opportunities that support EPA's high priority research topics, including children's health research,'' spokesman James Hewitt said, while declining to answer questions on the future for the national research projects.

Children's centers at universities around the country typically get joint funding from the EPA and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in three- and five-year packages, with most packages running out in 2018 and 2019. With no word on future funding, researchers overall ""have been kind of scrambling to find a way to continue that work which is so important,'' said Tracey Woodruff, director of the children's center at the University of California at San Francisco.

Woodruff's federally funded work includes looking at how flame-retardant chemicals and PFAS compounds - a kind of stain-resistant, nonstick industrial compound - affect the placenta during pregnancy. The Trump EPA has come under increasing pressure from states to regulate PFAS as it shows up in more water supplies around the country.

With no news from the EPA on any more funding in the future, ""we've been winding down for about a year'' on work funded through those grants, Woodruff said.

On Tuesday, a banner across a website home page for the overall children's research declared ""EPA will no longer fund children's health research.''

The EPA and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences have jointly funded the children's environmental health research since 1997, through grants to at least two dozen children's environmental research centers around the country. The annual grants averaged $15 million through 2017. In the current fiscal year, the EPA contributed $1.6 million, agency spokeswoman Maggie Sauerhage said.

​The research often involves enrolling women while they are still pregnant and then following their children for years, to study environmental exposures and their effects as children grow, said Barbara Morrissey, a toxicologist and chairwoman of the EPA's Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee.

The long-term projects often produce much stronger results overall than one-off studies do, Morrissey said.

Each children's center funded by the grants also works to spread information about environmental threats to local health workers and to families.

The institute is under the National Institutes of Health, which has numerous other children's environmental research studies underway but said with the EPA joint program left hanging, it was considering a new program to put lessons learned about pediatric risks into practice in communities.

EPA's funding for the grants comes from the agency's Science To Achieve Results, or STAR, program for research into environmental threats.

The Trump administration 2020 budget request sought to eliminate funding for the STAR grants, and sought a nearly one-third cut in the EPA's budget overall.

A House Appropriations subcommittee released its own budget proposal Tuesday to restore funding for the STAR grants and boost the agency's overall budget from last year by 8%, rejecting the administration's requests for cuts.

EPA spokespeople did not respond when asked why the EPA had asked Congress to end funding for the grant program, and whether the agency would commit to continuing the children's health research if Congress overrides the EPA and restores funding for the grants, as expected.

The science journal Nature first reported funding concerns for the program.

In a statement Tuesday, Ken Cook of the Environmental Working Group said ""crippling research to protect children's health, while bowing to the agenda of the chemical industry, is the calling card of the EPA in the Trump administration.''

Even if the administration restores funding to previous levels, for one year or several years, the time span of grant cycles and grant-funded work means that uncertainty over continued federal support is making the intended multiyear research untenable, researchers and program supporters said.

""The whole point of these children's centers is to be following children over time,'' Morrissey, the chairwoman of the advisory committee to the EPA, said. ""That's why it's so high-quality.''"
Devin Nunes 'likely' sending obstruction criminal referral over Steele-State Department meeting,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-19-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-likely-sending-obstruction-criminal-referral-over-steele-state-department-meeting,"Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said on Sunday that he may send another criminal referral to the Justice Department.

During an interview on Fox News, Nunes said notes about a meeting between Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and a State Department official were withheld from the House Intelligence Committee during its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election that wrapped up last year.

""It's likely now, as we do our investigation as to why we didn't get this information that we've just been discussing from the State Department two years ago when we should have received it, there could be another referral coming on obstruction a congressional investigation,"" he said.

Newly released notes from an Oct. 11, 2016, meeting between Steele and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec cast doubt on the reliability of his dossier and called into question the information provided to the court in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application that was submitted later that month against onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The notes, which Kavalec is believed to have emailed to the FBI in mid-October, indicate that Steele knew he had been hired by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee and had been told they wanted his findings made public prior to the 2016 election on Nov. 8.

The Daily Caller reported the notes show Steele identified Russian sources, including former Russian foreign intelligence director Vyacheslav Trubnikov and Vladislav Surkov, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Nunes said Clinton's campaign and the DNC ""plainly colluded"" with the Russians to receive and disseminate false information about Trump.

Last month, Nunes notified the Justice Department of ""several potential violations of the law"" in eight criminal referrals as part of an investigation into origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department citing concerns that Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, ""knowingly provided false testimony"" to lawmakers. Both Ohrs remain under intense scrutiny for their ties to Steele and the opposition research firm who hired him, Fusion GPS.

The notes from the Steele-Kavalec meeting came out after special counsel Robert Mueller found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The House Intelligence Committee found no Trump-Russia collusion in its assessment.

Attorney General William Barr has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham from Connecticut with reviewing the origins of the federal Russia investigation."
