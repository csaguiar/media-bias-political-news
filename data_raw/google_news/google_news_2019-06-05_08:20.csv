Trump opens up on reported 'nasty' comment about Meghan Markle,https://www.foxnews.com,['Vandana Rambaran'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-meghan-markle-nasty-piers-morgan-interview,"President Trump sat down with Piers Morgan for ITV's ""Good Morning Britain"" and clarified controversial comments last week about Meghan Markle.

Trump said he wasn't calling Markle nasty, but rather was just surprised to hear her comments about him, including her assertion that if he became president it would force Americans to relocate to Canada.

""I wasn’t referring to 'she’s nasty.' I said she was nasty about me. And essentially I didn’t know she was nasty about me,"" Trump told Morgan in the interview, set to air on Wednesday.

DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE NEVER CALLED MEGHAN MARKLE 'NASTY,' CALLS COMMENTS ABOUT DUCHESS 'FAKE NEWS'

In an interview published Friday, The Sun, a British tabloid, read aloud comments to Trump from a 2016 interview in which Markle, 37, accused him of being “misogynistic” and “divisive” during his 2016 presidential campaign.

“I’m voting for Hillary Clinton, not because she is a woman, but because Trump has made it easy to see that you don’t really want that kind of world that he’s painting,” Markle said in an interview on ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore"" while promoting her television series, ""Suits.""

“I didn’t know that,"" Trump said of her comments when asked about them, The Sun reported Friday. ""What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty.""

Markle skipped the initial reception attended by Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles and Prince Harry on Monday at Buckingham Palace. She is on maternity leave with her 3-week old son.

The president and first lady have been visiting Britain on a three-day trip. Queen Elizabeth hosted the two at Buckingham Palace Monday night. Trump and Melania toured the Churchill War Rooms on Tuesday and hosted Prince Charles and Duchess of Camilla at dinner.

Despite Markle's absence, Trump insisted that there was no tension between him and her husband, Prince Harry.

""I congratulated him and I think he’s a terrific guy,"" Trump told ITV. ""The royal family is really nice.""

""In fact, he spent a lot of time talking to Ivanka and talking to my family. I went up -- he couldn’t have been nicer.""

Trump went on to praise Markle, saying: “You know what? She’s doing a good job, I hope she enjoys her life. ... I think she’s very nice.”"
Senate Republicans Warn White House Against Mexico Tariffs,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Catie Edmondson', 'Maggie Haberman']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/us/politics/republicans-mexico-tariffs.html,"WASHINGTON — Republican senators sent the White House a sharp message on Tuesday, warning that they were almost uniformly opposed to President Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on Mexican imports, just hours after the president said lawmakers would be “foolish” to try to stop him.

Mr. Trump’s latest threat to impose 5 percent tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico, rising to as high as 25 percent until the Mexican government stems the flow of migrants, has prompted some of the most serious defiance in the Republican ranks since the president took office.

Republican senators emerged from a closed-door lunch at the Capitol angered by the briefing they received from a deputy White House counsel and an assistant attorney general on the legal basis for Mr. Trump to impose new tariffs by declaring a national emergency at the southern border.

“I want you to take a message back” to the White House, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, told the lawyers, according to people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Cruz warned that “you didn’t hear a single yes” from the Republican conference. He called the proposed tariffs a $30 billion tax increase on Texans."
Trump slams 'washed-up psycho' Bette Midler as the two clash via social media,https://www.foxnews.com,['Vandana Rambaran'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/trump-slams-washed-up-psycho-bette-midler-as-the-two-clash-via-social-media,"Performer Bette Midler has apologized for circulating a fake quote on Sunday that she alleged President Trump gave to People magazine in 1998 about a potential presidential run. But it appeared to be less than a full-throated mea culpa.

“If I were to run, I’d run as a Republican. They’re the dumbest group of voters in the country. They believe anything on Fox News. I could lie and they’d still eat it up. I bet my numbers would be terrific,” read the quote she shared.

BETTE MIDLER BLASTED FOR TWEETING FAKE TRUMP QUOTE BASHING REPUBLICANS, FOX NEWS

Midler's followers were quick to point out the quote was fake. Indeed, the fact-checking site Snopes had done a review of the quote in 2015, debunking its authenticity when Trump's White House campaign first started to gain steam.

""I apologize; turns out to be a fake from way back in '15-16,"" Midler tweeted on Monday. ""Don't know how I missed it, but it sounds SO much like him that I believed it was true!""

Trump appeared less than impressed, though. He lashed back at Midler on Twitter, calling her a ""washed-up psycho"" who ""was forced to apologize for a statement she attributed to me that turned out to be totally fabricated by her in order to make 'your great president' look really bad. She got caught, just like the Fake News Media gets caught. A sick scammer!"" Trump said on Tuesday.

Midler followed her apology with another tweet blaming Trump for her misquote.

""Yes, one must always check the quotes,"" she tweeted on Monday. ""That should take up, oh, maybe 23 of the 24 hours in the day? Because there are SO MANY LIES, most of them generated by Trump himself, that the task of separating the truth from the lies is impossible. Which is just how he likes it. #CHAOS.""

Midler also kept up her criticisms of the president on social media. She poked fun at his white waistcoat, worn to a state banquet hosted by Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace, saying, ""What a figure he cuts!""

She also called Trump out on his effort to downplay the protesters who crowded the streets of London to oppose his visit.

""Trump said he was greeted by thousands in the UK, but they were actually thousands of protesters. How does he always hear the opposite of the truth?"" she tweeted on Tuesday.

"“Marla Was Under Duress”: Revealed in His Marla Maples Prenup, Donald Trump’s Draconian Art of the Marriage Deal",https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Gabriel Sherman', 'Vanity Fair', 'Bruce Handy', 'Joe Pompeo']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/06/marla-maple-prenup-donald-trump-marriage,"In the fall of 1993, Donald Trump was clawing out of the rubble of a cratering business career. Three of his Atlantic City casinos had gone bankrupt. He’d nearly defaulted on $3.4 billion in debt, and, humiliatingly, his creditors had put him on a living allowance: $450,000 a month. Bankers forced him to sell his 282-foot yacht, the Trump Princess, as well as the Trump Shuttle airline and stake in the Plaza hotel, which Trump had once called “the ultimate trophy in the world.” His relationship with Marla Maples had begun in Trumpian glory, with the words “Best Sex I’ve Ever Had” on the front page of the New York Post, but Maples had just given birth to their daughter, Tiffany, and was eager to get married. “I’m going to have to make a decision about Marla...what should I do?” Trump asked his mother around this time. He was 47 years old. Many people in the city believed he was finished.

A source recently passed me a revealing document from this era: Trump’s prenuptial agreement with Maples. Its draconian terms suggest a penuriousness at odds with his public image as a free-spending billionaire in his gilded triplex penthouse. And its confidential financial statements included in the agreement is a sketch of Trump’s immense privilege and the wealth he squandered, telling in both what it illuminates and what is obfuscates.

With Trump fighting House Democrats over the release of his tax returns, what we know about his opaque financial life has largely come from a paper trail unearthed by investigative reporters. Journalists at The New York Times have blazed much of this difficult terrain with bombshells such as the revelation that his father, Fred, bequeathed Trump more than $400 million in today’s dollars, and that IRS tax receipts indicate Trump lost more than more than $1 billion between 1985 and 1994. Dogged reporting by the Times and others revealed Trump’s core argument for being president—he’s a self-made billionaire who alone can solve the world’s most intractable problems—to be as credible as a degree from Trump University. But the deal he made with his second wife was, as a business proposition, a raging success, even though as a personal matter, it was as ugly as could be.

Even Donald Trump realized that, when it comes to romance, a prenup is a buzzkill. “A prenuptial is a horrible document,” he once told a reporter, “because it says, ‘When we get divorced, this is the way we’ll split things up.’ And when you’re a believer in positive thinking, it isn’t good. But it’s a modern-day necessity.”

Raoul Felder, the legendary divorce lawyer whose clients have included Trump’s own lawyer Rudy Giuliani, agreed. “A prenup sucks romance out of the relationship,” he told me. “It’s a prior agreement as to the disposition of money, assets, payments. You basically plan the divorce before you get married.”

Prenup negotiations require both parties to disclose to the other how much money they have. In the document, Trump stated he was worth $1.17 billion; Maples had $100,000 in the bank. But while Trump presented himself as a Master of the Universe, back and bigger than ever, he was, in all likelihood, not an actual billionaire when he signed the agreement. (He didn’t appear on the Forbes list between 1990 and 1995.) And Trump had financial incentive to inflate his wealth: if he understated his fortune, Maples could later claim in a divorce that Trump hid money from her at the time, which could void the prenup’s terms. “When you’re doing a prenup, the worry is you understate your assets. If you overstate it, then you’re protected,” a high-profile Manhattan divorce lawyer told me.

To keep himself in the nine-figure club, Trump provided extremely optimistic values for his real estate assets. For instance, he stated the Taj Mahal was worth $1.25 billion, even though it had trouble making debt payments virtually from the moment it opened. (In 2017 it sold for 4 cents on the dollar.) He valued the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza casinos $450 million and $650 million, respectively. (Both went bankrupt in 1992.) Trump’s accountants at Spahr, Lacher & Sperber didn’t vouch for his fuzzy math. “We have not audited or reviewed” the numbers Trump provided, they stated in a note attached to the financial report. They added: “Assets are presented at current values estimated by Trump using various valuation methods.”

The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Trump, of course, overstated his net worth and business acumen since his first forays into Manhattan real estate in the 1970s. In a 1976 interview with the Times, he claimed to be worth “more than $200 million” when, in fact, he reportedly had taxable income of only about $75,000 in 1975. In subsequent years, he posed as a Trump Organization official to mislead Forbes editors, so they would include him on the magazine’s annual list of billionaires.

More than anything, the prenup shows how fiercely Trump wanted to protect the money he did have. Maples reportedly wanted $25 million, but Trump agreed to pay her only $1 million if they separated within five years, plus another $1 million to buy a house. Trump also would stop making $100,000 child support payments for Tiffany when she turned 21. The agreement states that Trump’s payments would cease earlier if Tiffany got a full-time job, enlisted in the military, or joined the Peace Corps. “The way it was drawn up is ironclad and shows how wary he was,” Felder told me after reviewing the prenup. “He was leaving nothing to chance.”

Maples agreed to these terms with the hope that Trump would renegotiate a better deal in five years. “We basically came to an agreement that for the first few years we would agree on something and then tear it up,” she told a journalist. “She was telling people it was love,” said a source who knew the couple well. Ultimately, Maples didn’t have much of a choice if she wanted to get married—which she desperately did. When she traveled, she brought along her wedding dress, so that she would be ready at a moment’s notice if Trump said he wanted to get married, said the source. Maples declined to comment."
CNN guest questions why Trump 'picked on' UK's 'two most famous people of color' in Meghan Markle and Sadiq Khan,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnn-trump-meghan-markle-sadiq-khan,"CNN commentator Paul Begala questioned why President Trump ""picked on"" two of the United Kingdom's most prominent ""people of color"" in the days before his state visit.

Ahead of his transatlantic trip, Trump made headlines with comments about both London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle. The president responded to a blistering op-ed Khan wrote slamming the president by calling the mayor a 'stone cold loser' and compared him to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

He also -- during an interview with ""The Sun"" newspaper -- said he did not know Markle had made ""nasty"" comments about him after being presented with negatives remarks she previously made. In the same interview, Trump expressed well wishes to her as one of the newest members of the Royal family.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE WAS SHOCKED BY MEGHAN MARKLE'S 'NASTY' COMMENT ABOUT HIM

During a CNN panel, Begala began by calling Trump's ""obsession"" with Khan a ""great mystery,"" only to then suggest something else was potentially at play.

""There's 67 million people in Great Britain, one of our very closest allies in the whole world,"" Begala said. ""Not only did he pick Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, he picked on the Duchess of Sussex, who is an American... They are the two most famous people of color in Great Britain. It's very interesting to me when he picks his fights and his enemies.""

The former Clinton advisor also called it ""interesting"" that Trump hasn't attacked former London mayor Boris Johnson, the British conservative leader who may become the next prime minister, but was previously very critical of Trump before he was president, arguing that the criticism from the ""Muslim mayor of London"" is ""nothing"" compared to Johnson.

Pro-Trump panelist Steve Cortes slammed Begala, calling it ""totally irresponsible"" for suggesting there was a ""racial component"" to Trump's attacks, but the liberal pundit doubled down.

""Boris Johnson has insulted the president worse and today snubbed Donald Trump,"" Begala continued.

""President Trump said 'I think Johnson would be a good prime minister,' he wanted to meet with Boris Johnson. Johnson snubbed President Trump -- much worse than anything Sadiq Khan is doing. Again, one of these things is not like the other. Why do you pick with a fight with the Muslim mayor but you don't say anything about the rightwing white guy?"""
"DOJ reveals Dems acknowledged Barr subpoena was 'overbroad'; Nadler fires back, offers to meet 'without conditions'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-fires-back-after-house-dems-announce-barr-contempt-vote-dubs-subpoena-unworkably-overbroad,"Hours after the Department of Justice (DOJ) slammed House Democrats for planning a contempt vote against Attorney General Bill Barr -- and charged that Democrats had privately admitted their subpoena requests were ""overbroad"" -- House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler announced late Tuesday that he is open to negotiating with the DOJ ""without conditions.""

The remarkable turn of events reopened the possibility that Barr's contempt vote may be postponed or canceled, if both sides return to the negotiating table. Nadler, however, pointedly refused to cancel the planned contempt vote prior to beginning any new negotiations, as the DOJ had demanded.

At the same time, Nadler criticized what he called DOJ ""brinksmanship,"" and blamed the Justice Department for purportedly cutting off negotiations on May 7.

The brouhaha began Tuesday morning with a DOJ letter, written by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, that blasted House Democrats and Nadler, D-N.Y., for announcing they would vote next week on whether to hold Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SCHOLAR: CONGRESS HEADING INTO 'WORLD OF HURT' WITH BARR CONTEMPT VOTE

In its letter to Nadler, the DOJ publicly revealed that Democrats had acknowledged in a May 24 letter they were open to ""further negotiations"" regarding concerns that their subpoena demands were ""unworkably overbroad."" Nevertheless, Democrats announced just days later their plans to hold Barr in contempt for allegedly failing to comply with those demands.

The DOJ said it was ""prepared to resume negotiations with the committee regarding accommodation of its narrowed Subpoena"" -- as long as Democrats removed the ""threat of an imminent vote by the House of Representatives to hold the attorney general in contempt.""

""The department was disappointed by the committee's abrupt termination of ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching a reasonable accommodation that respects both sides' legitimate interests regarding the materials sought,"" Boyd wrote to Nadler. ""Further, the department is disappointed by news reports indicating that Democratic leaders have scheduled a contempt vote in the House of Representatives for June 11, 2019.""

In his response late Tuesday, Nadler took issue with the DOJ's characterization of Democrats' May 24 letter, and insisted that Democrats had ""always remained open to continuing negotiations. ... We are here and ready to negotiate as early as tomorrow morning.""

""I ... take exception to your characterization of how our prior accommodation efforts ended,"" Nadler wrote back to Boyd. ""Contrary to the account in your letter, the Committee has always remained open to continuing negotiations. We had an offer on the table late on the evening of May 7 when the Department suddenly declared an end to the accommodation process. My staff was still in their offices after the close of business hours awaiting a counteroffer when the Department broke off negotiations with a letter demanding that the contempt vote—scheduled to begin the next day— be cancelled if we wished to proceed with the accommodations process.""

Nadler continued: ""At any rate, we are ready to proceed without conditions—as shown by the initiative we took with our detailed May 24 offer. I should add that, contrary to your argument that the Committee’s continuing accommodation efforts somehow suggest that our prior requests were overbroad, our offer to compromise was intended to respond to your prior objections by seeking a middle ground. We urge the Department to do the same.""

The DOJ's letter, meanwhile, had called on the House Judiciary Committee to ""moot"" its May 8 vote to hold Barr in contempt, which the DOJ called ""premature and unnecessary."" That vote came after congressional Democrats subpoenaed Mueller's full and unredacted report on his probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.

WHY DID MUELLER EDIT TRANSCRIPT OF VOICEMAIL WITH FLYNN LAWYER TO ELIMINATE KEY DISCLAIMERS?

Republicans have countered that federal law protecting secretive grand-jury information would prevent Barr from turning over the entirety of the report. The DOJ has offered Democrats the opportunity to review the report, minus those grand jury-related redactions, in a secure setting -- but those offers have been rebuffed. (In a rare public statement last week, Mueller specifically remarked, ""I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith"" in deciding to make the report ""largely public."")

""It would hardly make sense for the full House of Representatives to act upon the committee's prior recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt for not complying with a subpoena that even the committee now appears to acknowledge was overbroad in seeking immediate disclosure of the entirety of the special counsel's investigative files,” Boyd wrote.

That was a conspicuous reference to the previously unreported May 24 letter to the DOJ, in which the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wrote to privately emphasize ""the Committee's willingness to engage in further negotiations to resolve this dispute"" -- only to resort to public political posturing, the DOJ charged.

The Democrat-led committee also offered to ""identify specific materials that if produced would be deemed to satisfy the subpoena"" in an effort to make the subpoena more workable, according to the DOJ, which quoted the Committee's letter verbatim.

""In your May 24, 2019, letter, the committee appears to recognize that the subpoena is unworkably overbroad and offers -- for the first time -- to narrow the subpoena's scope to cover a much more limited set of documents,"" the DOJ wrote. ""The department believes that the committee's new offer reflects a more reasonable request and could mitigate some of the legal barriers to disclosure that we have discussed.""

ANALYSIS: BARR DETERMINED TO FIND TRUTH BEHIND ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE -- AND DEMS ARE WORRIED

The letter continued: ""The committee held its contempt vote only 19 days after issuing the subpoena. Traditionally, congressional committees have only proceeded with contempt votes after lengthy periods of negotiations have failed to reach an accommodation. For example, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee negotiated with the department over the Operation Fast and Furious subpoena for months, and only voted to cite Attorney General [Eric] Holder for contempt 252 days after issuing its subpoena.""

Since 1975, according to the DOJ, ""committees and subcommittees have averaged 103 days between issuing a subpoena to an executive branch official and holding a contempt vote. By any measure, the committee rushed its decision and bears responsibility for the termination of the accommodation process.”

But in his letter, Nadler took issues with those characterizations.

""We cannot agree that the House’s sense of urgency here is 'premature and unnecessary,'"" Nadler wrote. ""It has been over 100 days since we first initiated the accommodations process on February 22, 2019. The pace with which we are proceeding is consistent with the exceptional urgency of this matter: an attack on our elections that was welcomed by our President and benefitted his campaign, followed by acts of obstruction by the President designed to interfere with the investigation of that attack. All of this misconduct was documented by the Special Counsel in the documents we now seek.""

In a statement, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., highlighted the DOJ's revelation that Nadler apparently signaled a willingness to work with the DOJ.

“After racing to hold Attorney General Barr in contempt, Chairman Nadler finally seems ready to join the Justice Department at the negotiating table,"" Collins said. ""When Judiciary Democrats wield subpoena power like a sword instead of a plow, their investigations bear little fruit. The House Intelligence Committee has shown us that working with the Justice Department in good faith yields documents. Abusing subpoena and contempt authority, however, has left the Judiciary Committee with little to show for its obsessively unreasonable demands.""

As for McGahn, the White House has instructed its former top lawyer not to testify, saying he is legally immune from being compelled to testify about privileged discussions occurring in the course of his official duties. Democrats have responded that McGahn waived that privilege by agreeing to speak to Mueller.

Trump did not assert executive privilege to shield any aspect of the Mueller report itself, and has derided Democrats' efforts as politically motivated attempts to keep what he's called the ""Russia collusion hoax"" alive -- and to distract from or derail -- Barr's own ongoing probes into Justice Department and FBI misconduct.

News of the planned contempt vote came days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation. Last month, Barr appointed the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, John Durham, to lead the investigation, which is to focus on the use of FBI informants and the alleged improper issuance of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to monitor a variety of individuals, including former Trump aide Carter Page.

A Barr contempt vote would be historic, but not unprecedented. In 2012, the GOP-controlled House's vote to hold the attorney general at that time, Holder, in contempt for failing to comply with investigations into the Obama administration's failed gun-running sting operation, ""Fast and Furious."" Holder became the first-ever sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress in that manner.

The resolution scheduled for a June 11 floor vote would allow the Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement of its subpoenas in federal court.

Such an approach would rule out so-called ""inherent contempt,"" a process in which Congress technically can enforce contempt citations on its own -- whether by arrest or fine. In May, Barr reportedly joked about that possibility with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, asking, ""Did you bring your handcuffs?""

"DOJ doesn't need to provide transcript of key Flynn phone call after all, judge rules",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-doesnt-need-to-provide-transcript-of-key-flynn-phone-call-after-all-judge-rules,"A federal judge said Tuesday that the Department of Justice no longer has to publicly file a transcript of a fateful phone call between former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the United States, an abrupt and unexplained reversal from his previous order last month

The development comes as Republicans allege that a separate court-ordered transcript release in the case showed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report contained a conspicuously -- and allegedly deceptive -- edited version of a voicemail message from former Trump lawyer John Dowd to Flynn's lawyer, Rob Kelner.

U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan had previously directed prosecutors to release details of a December 2016 call in which Flynn discussed sanctions with Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian envoy to Washington.

EX-TRUMP LAWYER SLAMS MUELLER REPORT AS 'FRAUD,' CITES MISLEADING QUOTE

Sullivan had also given government attorneys until May 31 to produce redacted portions of Mueller's report that relate to Flynn as well as a transcript of a phone message a lawyer for Trump left for Flynn's attorney after Flynn had decided to start cooperating with prosecutors.

On Friday, prosecutors publicly filed the transcript of the call between the lawyers and said all of the information in the report that Flynn had provided had been unredacted. But they declined to produce a transcript of Flynn's call with Kislyak, saying they were not relying on that conversation to establish his guilt or to determine his sentence.

In a brief written order Tuesday, Sullivan said that ""upon consideration of the government's submissions in response to those orders, the government is not required to file any additional materials or information on the public docket."" He did not elaborate on why he had changed his mind, and apparently left open the possibility he might order the documents to be produced under seal in the future.

Flynn is awaiting sentencing before Sullivan after pleading guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contact with Kislyak. He was supposed to be sentenced in December, but midway through the hearing, took the judge up on his offer to postpone it so that he could continue cooperating with prosecutors and earn credit toward a lighter sentence.

MUELLER REPORT REVEALS FLYNN WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION FAR EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED

Meanwhile, Republicans have focused renewed attention on the transcript that was released Friday. Dowd, Trump's ex-lawyer, left the voicemail message for Kelner after Flynn exited a joint-defense agreement and agreed to cooperate with Mueller. Mueller's team analyzed the message as part of their inquiry into whether President Trump obstructed justice.

According to the Mueller report, Dowd said: ""I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms ... [I]t wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with ... the government ... [I]f ... there's information that implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue ... so, you know ... we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can ... [R]emember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.""

But the full transcript revealed Dowd made clear he was not seeking confidential information -- and raised questions as to why Mueller would have omitted apparently exculpatory information. The transcript excerpt in the Mueller report attracted substantial press attention at the time.

The full quote reads, with emphasis added: ""Hey, Rob, uhm, this is John again. Uh, maybe, I-I-I-‘m-I’m sympathetic; I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t … state it in … starker terms. If you have … and it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with, and, uh, work with the government, uh … I understand that you can’t join the joint defense; so that’s one thing. If, on the other hand, we have, there’s information that … implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security issue, or maybe a national security issue, I don’t know … some issue, we got to-we got to deal with, not only for the President, but for the country. So … uh … you know, then-then, you know, we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of … protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any … confidential information. So, uhm, and if it’s the former, then, you know, remember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains, but — Well, in any event, uhm, let me know, and, uh, I appreciate your listening and taking the time. Thanks, Pal.""

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called for the release of “all backup and source information” for the Mueller report on Friday following the revelation of the edited transcript, and Dowd told Fox News the Mueller report was a ""fraud.""

Former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, meanwhile, asserted on Fox News' ""Hannity"" Monday night that the quotation was ""distorted.""

""This is a very, very serious issue,"" he said. ""The distortion of the Dowd quote is very serious. Especially since, remember, that a report by a special counsel is always going to be one-sided. Therefore, you have to trust it.""

Talks Between Democrats and Justice Dept. in Doubt Over Barr Contempt Vote,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/us/politics/trump-hope-hicks-annie-donaldson.html,"Under subpoenas issued by the Judiciary Committee, the two witnesses had been instructed to deliver on Tuesday a range of documents related to their work in the White House, including notes and records related to some of Mr. Trump’s attempts to thwart federal investigators — attempts documented by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in the report he completed in March.

Mr. Nadler said that Ms. Hicks, who also served as a top aide on Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, did produce some documents related to her work before the election. He called it a “show of good faith,” though a copy of a letter from Ms. Hicks’s lawyer obtained by The New York Times says she handed over only four documents containing email chains.

In addition to documents, the subpoenas call for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson to testify publicly this month — and there was no indication on Tuesday whether they would comply. Mr. Nadler made clear his position that both were still expected to show up before the panel. Ms. Hicks has been subpoenaed to appear on June 19 and Ms. Donaldson on June 24.

[Read the Judiciary Committee subpoenas for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson.]

But there appears to be little chance either former aide will testify, bolstering the case made by a growing number of House Democrats that the president is actively obstructing another branch of government from doing its constitutionally sanctioned oversight function, and that impeachment proceedings are the only proportional response.

The White House issued similar instructions not to cooperate last month to Mr. McGahn, who had served as one of the most important witnesses in Mr. Mueller’s investigation into obstruction of justice. He ultimately did not produce a single document or appear for a hearing. If it does not alter course for the Justice Department, the House is poised to hold Mr. McGahn in contempt of Congress next week, as well, and take the dispute to court to try to enforce its subpoena — steps that could soon follow for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson if they do not show up to the Judiciary Committee’s hearings.

With potential star witnesses off limits and Mr. Mueller reluctant to testify, Democrats have for now been left to try to figure out other ways to bring Mr. Mueller’s 448-page report to life. On Monday, Mr. Nadler announced that his committee would hold a series of hearings on the report with former federal prosecutors, legal experts and John W. Dean, who went to jail for his role in the Watergate affair.

Republicans, who remain closely aligned with the president, have repeatedly accused Democrats of being less interested in the truth than in manufacturing a conflict with the White House that could provide a pretext for impeachment. They painted the possibility of new talks between the two sides on Tuesday as further evidence Democrats had been acting irresponsibly."

Apple antitrust woes could worsen with possible DOJ probe,https://9to5mac.com,['Apple Watch Series'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/04/apple-antitrust/,"Apple antitrust concerns are growing as the US government is now considering a major investigation into possible anticompetitive behaviors by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. It follows an earlier report which suggested only Google was at risk.

If the probe does go ahead, Apple and Google are likely to be investigated by the Justice Department rather than the FTC …

Reuters reports.

The U.S. government is gearing up to investigate whether Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google misuse their massive market power, sources told Reuters on Monday, setting up what could be an unprecedented, wide-ranging probe of some of the world’s largest companies. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, which enforce antitrust laws in the United States, have divided oversight over the four companies, two sources said, with Amazon and Facebook under the watch of the FTC, and Apple and Google under the Justice Department.

Tech giants may even face two parallel investigations.

Separately, the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee opened its own investigation into competition in digital markets, with both Republicans and Democrats expressing concern about the power exercised by tech giants.

The potential scope of any investigations is as yet unknown, but Apple has come under fire for alleged anticompetitive practices in respect of the App Store. It currently faces a formal antitrust investigation in Europe in connection with a complaint by Spotify, and a lawsuit in the US after a recent Supreme Court ruling.

Spotify complaint

Spotify complained to the European Commission that it faced unfair competition from Apple Music as Spotify cannot offer in-app subscriptions without paying 30% to Apple. Apple responded by saying that Spotify cannot have it both ways – either it can be a free app, and pay nothing, or it can be a paid service and pay the same commission as anyone else. Spotify hit back, claiming that Apple was behaving like a monopolist.

The European Commission said yesterday that it is awaiting a response from Apple before deciding what action to take.

The investigation potentially poses three threats to Apple.

Apple antitrust lawsuit

Lawyers acting on behalf of iPhone users have been trying to sue Apple since 2011. Their argument is that because developers have to pay 30% to Apple, they are forced to add the cost of this commission to their prices, and therefore users pay more for apps.

Apple rejected the claim on a technicality, claiming that as developers pay the fee, only they, not end users, could bring a lawsuit. That one went all the way to the US Supreme Court, and Apple lost the argument, permitting the lawsuit to finally proceed.

The arguments are quite nuanced, and it seems possible that Apple might be better advised to settle the case rather than allow its business model to be questioned in court.

As the two claims are related, it seems likely that both could form part of any DoJ investigation into Apple.

Google , Facebook and Amazon

Reuters says that Google faces a fresh look at practices which have previously attracted attention from the FTC, as well as multiple fines in Europe.

Google has faced accusations that its web search service, which has become so dominant that it is now a verb, leads consumers to its own products at the cost of competitors. The FTC settled an investigation of Google in 2013 with a reprimand. The company has been fined multiple times by the European Union’s competition regulator, most recently in March for 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) in a case focused on illegal practices in search advertising brokering from 2006 to 2016.

Facebook faces claims of failing to properly address fake news on its platform, with its privacy practices also likely to be a focus, while Amazon has been accused of abusing its dominant position to hurt smaller companies which cannot compete, and to force third-party sellers on its platform to buy ads to ensure visibility against the company’s own offers.

"The full House vote on contempt of Congress and what it means for William Barr, explained",https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/4/18652183/house-vote-contempt-of-congress-barr-mcgahn,"House Democrats are upping the ante in their attempt to get special counsel Robert Mueller’s full, unredacted report by threatening to hold at least two Trump administration officials in contempt of Congress.

The full House will hold a vote next Tuesday on whether to hold both Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced Monday night. And more Trump officials could still be added, he said.

“I see every name who has refused to respond to congressional subpoenas or documents, or has been instructed by the president not to respond, [being] subject to being on that list,” Hoyer told reporters Tuesday. “I’m not going to try to name all of them.”

Frustrated by months of missed subpoena deadlines and pushback from the Trump administration, the House Judiciary Committee first passed a contempt resolution along party lines last month, at the end of a lengthy and contentious hearing. The vote came after Barr failed to deliver Mueller’s complete, unredacted report by a Monday deadline.

As a small but growing number of House Democrats call for an impeachment inquiry, the contempt resolution is a shift back to focusing Democratic ire on both Barr and McGahn.

Democrats are feeling the pressure to make a big statement against the Trump administration, especially after the president asserted executive privilege last month to block the House from accessing the entire Mueller report and its underlying documents — the first time Trump has used his executive powers to protect portions of Mueller’s findings.

“I am concerned the department is heading in the wrong direction,” House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said at the time, calling it a “clear escalation” from Trump’s DOJ.

Barr’s main objection to releasing the full report is regulations that prohibit releasing grand jury material to members of Congress. The attorney general has offered Democrats a less redacted version of Mueller’s report, but they’ve so far rejected the offer. They want the full thing.

Contempt is another way for Congress to get subpoenaed documents, by asking the US attorney for the District of Columbia or the Department of Justice to charge Barr with criminal contempt for not complying with a congressional subpoena. In theory, a charge of contempt could result in a fine or jail time for the attorney general (though in reality, that likely won’t happen).

As serious as contempt sounds, the vote itself realistically won’t amount to more than Congress sending a powerful message — unless Democrats pass a different resolution to authorize suing Barr and the Trump administration to try to get the Mueller report. They plan to do that as well, continuing to battle the Trump administration in the court.

Democrats will now try to start the process of charging Barr and McGahn with a crime. They may wind up stuck in a long, drawn-out court battle.

Here’s how contempt of Congress works

A House vote on a contempt of Congress citation isn’t coming out of nowhere; the Trump administration has blocked the Judiciary Committee’s subpoena for the Mueller report, as well as many other House subpoena requests.

Contempt of Congress citations are a tool the House or Senate can use in cases where their subpoena requests are repeatedly denied. Congress is essentially arguing that the executive branch is stonewalling and getting in the way of its ability to conduct its constitutionally obligated oversight.

But it’s crucial to remember Congress is just making another a request here, albeit a more strongly worded one. Actually getting the executive branch to comply can be difficult, precisely because the executive branch is the one with the power to prosecute the individual who isn’t complying with the subpoena request.

Here’s how Congressional Research Services legislative attorney Todd Garvey explains it in a recent summary:

First, the criminal contempt statute permits a single house of Congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena. Once the contempt citation is received, any prosecution lies within the control of the executive branch.

How this will work on a practical level: If the full House passes the contempt resolution, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will issue the citation for Barr to be held in contempt. She’ll pass that citation along to the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia or the Department of Justice. Either the US attorney or the DOJ will likely say they don’t plan to move forward with prosecuting Barr.

That would be the end of the matter, unless Democrats pass a separate resolution to authorize going to court with Barr and the Trump administration over the Mueller report, and getting the courts to decide their subpoena request and contempt citation.

Democrats plan to take that next step, which they would likely do before using their own power of inherent contempt to fine or jail the attorney general.

“We need to do the contempt parts before House counsel goes to litigate in court,” Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) told reporters last month. “The first option would be to win in court; we have a very strong case.”

Democrats are feeling confident because the Trump administration has moved to block or deny every single subpoena request of theirs, not just the one for the Mueller report. At least one former Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration thinks Trump’s broad refusal could potentially hurt his legal argument.

“The thing that’s unusual is the blanket refusal,” John Yoo, the former deputy assistant US attorney general in the Bush DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel, told the New York Times. “It would be extraordinary if the president actually were to try to stop all congressional testimony on subpoenaed issues. That would actually be unprecedented if it were a complete ban.”

That itself is risky. If a judge rules against Congress and in favor of the Trump administration, it could set new legal precedent that could make it easier for future presidential administrations to withhold information from future congressional committees.

But if the court rules in Democrats’ favor, it could strengthen Congress’s legal standing and could compel the Trump administration to comply with the subpoenas, with more serious consequences for noncompliant officials. For instance, a judge could hold administration officials in contempt of court, rather than contempt of Congress.

Democrats have already had some success in the courts; two federal judges have upheld their subpoenas of Trump’s financial information in the House Oversight and Financial Services committees. Feeling emboldened by these early wins, Pelosi wants Democrats to keep pushing forward on investigations.

Congress’s inherent contempt power, explained

Congress technically has another option that gives it much more power to prosecute noncompliant individuals, called inherent contempt power. But the lawmakers probably won’t use it.

The contempt of Congress citation the House will vote on next week is very different from inherent contempt power: Congress’s ability to arrest or jail people who don’t comply with subpoena requests.

As Garvey explained in his summary, this is how Congress used to make sure people complied with its subpoena requests if they refused, beginning in the 1850s and ending in the 1930s. Congress can do this (the Supreme Court has upheld its ability to do so), but it hasn’t since the 1930s because, well, throwing people in jail is a bit harsh:

Upon adopting a House or Senate resolution authorizing the execution of an arrest warrant by that chamber’s Sergeant-at-Arms, the individual alleged to have engaged in contemptuous conduct is taken into custody and brought before the House or Senate. A hearing or “trial” follows in which allegations are heard and defenses raised. If judged guilty, the House or Senate may then direct that the witness be detained or imprisoned until the obstruction to the exercise of legislative power is removed.

As Garvey writes, Congress detaining these people isn’t meant to be a punishment so much as an added incentive to produce the information more quickly.

Lately, some Democrats have been talking about it as a way to put some more teeth into their subpoena requests.

“We have the power to detain and incarcerate,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), a member of the House Oversight Committee, told reporters last month. “We don’t use it. ... Doesn’t mean we can’t, and I’m all for reviving it.”

When asked where Congress would put members of the Trump administration, Connolly pointed to DC’s jail.

“We have, as you know, jurisdiction over the District of Columbia,” he said. “And they have a beautiful jail with plenty of room. So I think that would be just perfect for some of these people to contemplate their actions and judgment.”

To be clear, there’s no real indication that Democrats are ready to revive their inherent contempt power for Barr and McGahn, and it likely would be a tool of last resort. The attorney general is likely not headed to jail, especially if the department he oversees is in charge of deciding whether to prosecute him. What matters now is Democrats deciding to pursue a court case against the attorney general and former White House counsel, and if a judge holds them in contempt of court instead.

Passing a contempt of Congress citation is just the first step."
Judge Now Says US Doesn’t Have to File Flynn Call Transcript,https://www.snopes.com,['Associated Press'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/06/04/judge-now-says-us-doesnt-have-to-file-flynn-call-transcript/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge said Tuesday that prosecutors no longer have to publicly file a transcript of the call between former adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the United States, reversing course from an order last month.

U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan had earlier directed prosecutors to make public details of a December 2016 call in which Flynn, President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, discussed sanctions with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.

He also ordered them to produce redacted portions of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report that relate to Flynn as well as a transcript of a phone message a lawyer for Trump left for Flynn’s attorney after Flynn had decided to start cooperating with prosecutors.

On Friday, the deadline set by the judge, prosecutors publicly filed the transcript of the call between the lawyers and said all of the information in the report that Flynn had provided had been unredacted. But they declined to produce a transcript of Flynn’s call with Kislyak, saying they were not relying on that conversation to establish his guilt or to determine his sentence.

In a brief written order Tuesday, Sullivan said that “upon consideration of the government’s submissions in response to those orders, the government is not required to file any additional materials or information on the public docket.” He did not elaborate on why he had changed his mind.

Flynn is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contact with Kislyak. He was supposed to be sentenced in December, but midway through the hearing, took the judge up on his offer to postpone it so that he could continue cooperating and earn credit toward a lighter sentence."

Amazon may soon face an antitrust probe. Here are 3 questions the FTC is asking about it.,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/4/18651694/amazon-ftc-antitrust-investigation-prime,"Uncovering and explaining how our digital world is changing — and changing us.

Over the past few days, news reports have made it clear that Amazon and its fellow tech giants will soon find themselves the focus of increased antitrust scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department, and Congress.

On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that the FTC would take on oversight of Amazon, after a reported agreement between the agency and the Department of Justice to divide responsibilities for supervision of the largest tech giants.

In recent months, the FTC has already started questioning some of Amazon’s competitors about the e-commerce giant’s business practices, according to one source briefed on discussions.

The timing makes sense. The FTC’s Bureau of Competition announced in February that it was creating a new task force dedicated to “monitoring competition in U.S. technology markets, investigating any potential anticompetitive conduct in those markets, and taking enforcement actions when warranted.”

The increased regulatory attention comes as activists, legal scholars, and US presidential candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren have accused Amazon of anticompetitive behavior. Amazon controls around half of all online retail in the US, is the biggest cloud computing provider in the world, and even its side business — online advertising — is large enough to make it the third biggest ad platform in the US, only trailing Google and Facebook.

Now the FTC is gathering intel from Amazon competitors. To be clear: The FTC queries Recode has learned of do not mean that the commission has launched a formal investigation of Amazon. Nor do they mean that these topics would be a focus area if the FTC eventually does launch an investigation of Amazon.

But here are three lines of questioning related to Amazon that the FTC has been pursuing, according to the source. A Federal Trade Commission spokesman declined to comment. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the record about the potential investigation.

1) Fulfillment by Amazon’s pricing structure

This is an Amazon logistics service known more commonly in the retail industry as FBA. The service lets Amazon sellers store their goods in Amazon warehouses and have Amazon handle the packing, shipping, and customer service for these orders.

But Amazon sellers can also use FBA to have Amazon store, fulfill, and ship items that the seller has sold outside of Amazon — whether on their own website or on other shopping marketplaces like Etsy and eBay.

The FTC’s queries about FBA have revolved around the service’s pricing structure. Amazon charges their sellers more for FBA services when they are used for an order placed on a competing website instead of on Amazon.com.

For example, Amazon charges sellers $4.76 to pick, pack, ship and handle customer service for an FBA item sold on Amazon, that weighs between one and two pounds.

That same item, though, would cost 75 percent more — or $8.35 in FBA fees — if Amazon had to ship it out to a customer who bought the product on competing platforms like Etsy, eBay or the seller’s own online store.

This discrepancy has caught the FTC’s attention, Recode’s source says.

2) Amazon competing against its own sellers

Amazon competing against its own sellers is perhaps the most popular topic among the company’s critics, including Elizabeth Warren.

Amazon invites small and mid-sized businesses to sell directly to Amazon customers on Amazon.com through a platform known as the Amazon Marketplace. But Amazon has created more than 100 of its own brands that often compete directly against Amazon’s third-party sellers.

One question is whether Amazon unfairly uses sales and other data from its sellers to undercut or otherwise beat out these same small and midsize merchants. An Amazon spokesperson said the company prohibits Amazon’s own brands from using an individual seller’s data to compete against the seller. (But Amazon doesn’t say whether its own brands can use aggregated data from a bunch of sellers selling the same product.)

Amazon has also sometimes aggressively promoted its own brands on the Amazon website in real estate not available to its sellers.

If you consider Amazon a retailer, you could argue that many other retailers — including Walmart and Target — do a similar thing: Analyze sales trends in their stores to inform the creation of their own brands that they sell alongside their vendors.

But if you consider the Amazon Marketplace as more of a “platform utility” — an argument made by Warren in her recent antitrust manifesto and originally put forth by the antitrust expert Lina Khan — you might question whether Amazon should be allowed to compete against its own business customers.

3) Amazon Prime bundling of services

If you’re a frequent Amazon shopper, the $119 you spend a year on Prime to get the long list of Prime perks — unlimited one-day shipping; access to a huge online library of TV shows, movies, and songs; free online photo storage; and more — seems like a deal. As of 2018, Amazon boasts more than 100 million Prime members worldwide.

But the FTC has shown interest in the question of whether this bundling of services allows Amazon to unfairly undercut competitors. One line of thinking: If Amazon doesn’t need to profit directly from the annual Prime membership fee — and it’s not clear that it does — how are competitors who do have to make money from an individual service supposed to compete on price?

Considering Amazon’s size, it’s likely that the FTC is gathering info about other tentacles of Amazon, beyond the three outlined above. There are have been some calls for Amazon to separate Amazon Web Services from its core business, for example. Others are concerned about Alexa’s early dominance in the “smart home” space, and that Amazon is already competing against manufacturers that integrate Alexa into their devices, and other companies that make voice apps — or “Skills” — for Alexa.

The only sure thing for Amazon right now is that intense regulatory scrutiny has arrived, and it won’t dissipate soon.

Global Opinions writer

Even after spending a year and a half in prison in Tehran, I knew that if I wanted to go on writing about Iran, I would be a target for plenty of public attacks despite the abuse I had suffered at the hands of the Islamic Republic. And so it has been.

But I never imagined the U.S. State Department would be funding my attackers.

Last week, several astute Iran watchers drew attention to a series of inflammatory tweets associated with the Iran Disinformation Project, a State Department-funded initiative that its website claims “brings to light disinformation emanating from the Islamic Republic of Iran via official rhetoric, state propaganda outlets, social media manipulation and more.”

So the @StateDept uses taxpayer money to fund online attacks on @HRW because the organization is researching the human cost of US sanctions in #Iran.



Is this even legal? https://t.co/PGVuizRq93 — Negar Mortazavi (@NegarMortazavi) May 30, 2019

What other @StateDept funded organizations claiming to promote democracy in #Iran are using taxpayer money to harass, intimidate, threaten and slander American journalists & academics?

Follow the money folks. — Farnaz Fassihi (@farnazfassihi) May 31, 2019

On Friday, in response to the complaints, the State Department suspended the initiative’s funding “until the implementer takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work,” a department official said.

One of the “steps” thus far has been to delete many of the tweets in question. But that is hardly sufficient.

Ironically, the Iran Disinformation Project was funded by the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which was begun to combat online extremism and propaganda.

The targets of the tweets included think-tank analysts, human rights activists and journalists (including me). The common thread is that we are all perceived by regime change proponents and supporters of the Trump administration’s so-called maximum pressure policy to be soft on Iran because we are critical of crushing economic sanctions and the threat of the use of military force against it.

For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran’s “mouthpieces,” “apologists,” “collaborators,” and “lobbyists” in the West.

I won’t speak for others who have been attacked, and my own views are irrelevant to this situation. From what I can see, though, we all appear to share the view that Iran should be secular and democratic. The main difference between us and those spreading these falsehoods against us is how we envision that change in Iranian politics coming about.

As a matter of principle, I try to avoid impeding anyone else’s right to free expression — even when it’s used to attack me. If a claim against me is demonstrably false, I will state it clearly and openly. Yet, I believe it’s important to allow others — even faceless ones hiding behind anonymous social media accounts — the opportunity to criticize me, my work and my credentials. It’s part of what you sign up for when you take this job.

I also openly acknowledge that others who have been abused by Iran (such as me) have the right to hold whatever political positions they choose and the right to defend and promote them passionately. Yes, even if it means they advocate war or sanctions directed at the people of that country. They have their views and I have mine.

Slander and libel are a different story, however, and @IranDisinfo may have crossed the line.

What Bahman Kalbasi, one of the #IranDisinfo mouthpieces in @BBC doesn't tell you, is that the number of Jews in #Iran before the Islamic Revolution was around 100K. After the mass executions, assassinations, and confiscation of properties, now the number is less than 10K. https://t.co/rfhb6kwFk1 — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) May 28, 2019

In the past 16 months, thousands of protestors have been arrested in #Iran, and most are anonymous. @sepehrifar of @hrw, a supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime, instead of documenting+proving these human rights violations, is working hard to prove @JZarif's claims. https://t.co/CvWzqULihT — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) April 25, 2019

So we’re faced with the irony that an initiative aimed at combating Tehran’s disinformation campaigns is resorting to disinformation campaigns of its own, using taxpayer funds to spread lies about U.S. citizens. We need programs that fight the spread of falsehoods and propaganda, but such efforts shouldn’t combat lies with other lies — and certainly not with public funding.

This is just one more small incident in the long moment of reckoning our democracy is facing. It will pass quickly, but it’s an important stress test.

How can individuals who are not willing to adhere to the norms of American civil society be entrusted with resources to promote civil society in other countries?

The State Department can easily fix the problem. It needs to perform a transparent assessment of who received the funding and why. Once the facts are clear, the grant should be terminated.

Transparency and accountability are fundamental to the rule of law. Anyone who claims otherwise cannot be entrusted with taxpayer money to promote American ideals — at home or abroad.

At the heart of the matter lies a fundamental question: Do we support our long-cherished ideals of democratic fair play or the “by any means necessary” approach that is becoming more prevalent in the current political climate?

Put personal politics aside for a moment and look back through history. Do peddlers of disinformation contribute or detract from our health as a society? The answer is obvious, and the State Department should take a clear stance on the side of honest and responsible discourse.

If the State Department declines to address the issue, Congress should investigate.

The Justice Department’s internal watchdog is investigating aspects of the Mueller probe, including whether officials abused their power when they ordered surveillance of a former campaign aide partially based on information from Steele’s dossier.

The source told The Times that while Steele was initially reluctant to be questioned as part of the Justice Department’s inquiry, he reconsidered after reports said the investigation could ultimately criticize him and throw his credibility into question.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.

Steele will hire a top American attorney if the interview does take place, costing the former British agent over $38,000, according to The Times. He reportedly told the Justice Department that he was only willing to discuss his dealings with the FBI and that he wanted officials to obtain the approval of the British government before the interview.

“As far as we are aware, no request has been made to HMG [Her Majesty’s government] on this matter. Any decision to co-operate would be a matter for Mr Steele as this relates to issues arising many years after he left government employment,” a senior source told The Times.

Warren calls for replacing Commerce Department in jobs plan,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-commerce-department-in-latest-policy-proposal,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Tuesday called for doing away with the Department of Commerce and several other smaller agencies, and replacing them with a new department responsible for creating new jobs.

Warren, who currently sits in the middle of the pack in a crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders, wrote in a post on Medium that this new department would have “the sole responsibility to create and defend quality, sustainable American job.”

“The new Department — the Department of Economic Development — will replace the Commerce Department, subsume other agencies like the Small Business Administration and the Patent and Trademark Office, and include research and development programs, worker training programs, and export and trade authorities like the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,” Warren wrote.

She added: “The new Department will have a single goal: creating and defending good American jobs.”

2020 DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT BIDEN AT CALIFORNIA CONVENTION

Warren’s new proposal is part of her ""economic patriotism"" agenda – one of a series of ambitious policy proposals that have become a trademark of her campaign – and comes ahead of her first campaign tour of Michigan. The state, which was once a Democratic stronghold, went to President Trump in the 2016 presidential election – largely thanks to Trump’s appeal with blue-collar workers in the state’s manufacturing base.

Warren’s visit to Detroit and Lansing, and her economic proposal, are both aimed squarely at Midwesterners who have watched millions of manufacturing jobs disappear in recent decades.

“My Administration will pursue fundamental, structural changes in our government’s approach to the economy, finally putting American workers and middle-class prosperity ahead of multinational profits and Wall Street bonuses,” she wrote on Medium.

The Trump campaign mocked Warren's call for ""economic patriotism"" as a recycled Obama idea.

But it's also unclear how Warren would turn some of her most costly policies into reality, especially if Democrats don't win back control of the Senate in next year's elections. The last time Congress approved a significant new Cabinet-level department was 2002, when the Department of Homeland Security was created. And the $2 trillion price tag of Warren's clean energy manufacturing plan would prompt plenty of Republican critics.

That plank of her agenda is directly tied to the Green New Deal, a framework for dramatically cutting the nation's dependence on fossil fuels that's championed by rising liberal star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

WARREN THE LATEST 2020 DEMOCRAT TO LAND ON TIME MAGAZINE COVER

As outlined in her Green Manufacturing Plan for America – another policy proposal she released on Tuesday – Warren would pay for her program with proceeds from her proposed new tax on corporate profits and by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies and rolling back some provisions of the GOP's 2017 tax law.

“According to the independent Moody’s analysis of my plan, nearly its entire cost is covered by my Real Corporate Profits Tax — a tax that ensures that the very largest and most profitable American corporations don’t pay zero corporate income tax — ending federal oil and gas subsidies, and closing corporate tax loopholes that promote moving good jobs overseas,” Warren wrote.

Warren is betting that her campaign pledges will power her forward with Midwestern swing voters who are open to deserting Trump. Her clean manufacturing plan comes hours after another Democratic contender, former Vice President Joe Biden, released his own Green New Deal-linked agenda, which would spend $1.7 trillion over 10 years.

Biden is perceived as a threat to Trump in the Midwest, but Michigan Democrats see ample room for Warren to break through in a state that's twice elected women to its highest office. And although Warren burnished her reputation as an advocate for the working class by criticizing the bailout of Wall Street banks while serving as a watchdog of the government's 2008 financial rescue, she spoke more favorably at that time of the agreement that spent billions of dollars to keep U.S. automakers afloat, a position she is sure to highlight in Michigan.

""Wages have not grown, and people look at layoffs being imminent or threatened, not just in the auto industry,"" said former Michigan Democratic Party chairman, Mark Brewer. ""They're looking for somebody on their side, who understands their problems. Why Trump had such appeal in 2016 was that he tapped into that economic anxiety.""

EPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees,https://thehill.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/446897-epa-sued-for-keeping-scientists-off-of-advisory-committees,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was reportedly sued on Monday by a nonprofit over a directive keeping many scientists off of agency advisory panels, according to Reuters.

The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), alleges that an Oct. 31, 2017, directive from former EPA chief Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOvernight Energy: EPA head accuses media of not reporting agency's achievements | Leaked FDA study finds cancer-linked chemicals in food supply | Wheeler calls Flint water 'safe to drink' EPA head says media 'does a disservice' by not promoting agency's achievements Overnight Energy: Trump allows use of ethanol gas in summer | Move to benefit farmers | Britain goes two weeks without using coal | EPA watchdog hands Pruitt probe findings to Congress MORE overturned decades of EPA practices “for no good reason” and without required public comment.

The NRDC claimed that the directive has been used to remove qualified scientists from the agency's roughly 23 advisory committees, allowing EPA to replace scientific advisers with industry representatives, Reuters reported.

The nonprofit environmental advocacy group seeks to set aside the directive and all decisions that have been based on it.

A spokesperson for the EPA told The Hill it does not comment on pending litigation.

Pruitt's 2017 directive bars anyone who receives EPA grant money from serving on advisory panels, citing a need for the committees to be more independent.

The former EPA chief, who resigned in July 2018 amid a growing number of ethics and spending scandals, argued that serving on a committee like the Science Advisory Board would be a conflict of interest for someone receiving agency money to conduct scientific research.

“We want to ensure that there’s integrity in the process, and that the scientists who are advising us are doing so with not any type of appearance of conflict,"" Pruitt said at the time. ""And when you receive that much money … there’s a question that arises about independence.""

Opponents countered that Pruitt wanted to increase representation from the fossil fuel industry and other Trump administration allies on the influential committees.

Since the directive took effect, representation for regulated industries and their allies has grown on the committees, at the expense of academics and researchers, The Hill reported in February.

A legal challenge to the directive fell short that month.

Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee to the District Court for the District of Columbia, dismissed the lawsuit from public health groups, saying it does not dictate who can be appointed to advisory boards.

The laws and regulations at issue “do not dictate whom administrators must, or even should, appoint to federal advisory committees,” McFadden wrote in a ruling dismissing the case.

“To say that certain individuals may not serve is very different than saying that the rest must serve,"" he wrote. ""Agency heads retain substantial discretion to determine membership on federal advisory committees.”"

But to a select few fans of the British royal family, Linton is better known Vanessa Rose Bellows, Kate Middleton's fictionalized bestie in William & Kate, a TV movie about the royals' courtship, which aired on Lifetime right before the Cambridges' wedding in 2011.

This particular royal-related line on Linton's resume makes it all the more interesting that Mnuchin was paired up with the Duchess of Cambridge last night during the procession into the ballroom of Buckingham Palace.

Undoubtedly, the walk gave Kate and the Treasury Secretary plenty of time to talk at length about the film's key plot points and how they line up with the true timeline of Will and Kate's love story.

I know—it's almost too much.

But this encounter gets even better. Linton was at the banquet as well, and Kate even shared a moment with her fictionalized TV movie BFF.

According to Hello, before Kate took her seat at the table, ""[the Duchess] stopped to greet one guest and shook hands with her.""

That one singular guest was Louise Linton.

""The mystery woman who drew Kate's attention has now been revealed as Louise Linton, Mr Mnuchin's wife,"" Hello reports. It's almost as if they were drawn to one other by the Lifetime cosmic universe. (I refused to entertain the only slightly more rational idea that Kate perhaps just wanted to say hi to the partner of the man who accompanied her.)

Louise has yet to comment on the matter, though she did post a picture of her striking burgundy dress on Instagram, along with a caption about the ""beautiful evening.""

""Wonderful to be home in Britain!"" she wrote. ""An honour to attend the State Dinner at Buckingham Palace. It was a beautiful evening. #statedinner #buckinghampalace.""

Justice Department says allegations that it hid true motives for census citizenship question are ‘frivolous’,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tara Bahrampour', 'Reporter Focusing On Aging', 'Generations', 'June At Pm']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/justice-department-says-allegations-that-it-hid-true-motives-for-census-citizenship-question-are-frivoulous/2019/06/03/9624871a-865a-11e9-a491-25df61c78dc4_story.html,"The Justice Department on Monday responded to allegations that it had hidden the government’s true motives for adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, saying they border on “frivolous.”

In a filing to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of New York’s Southern District, Justice Department attorneys accused lawyers challenging the question of trying to “derail” a Supreme Court ruling on the case, which is expected by the end of this month.

The letter came four days after new evidence emerged linking the citizenship question to Thomas Hofeller, who was a Republican redistricting strategist, and two days before a court hearing scheduled by Furman, one of three federal judges who ruled against the question earlier this year.

Plaintiffs’ lawyers challenging the question wrote to Furman on Thursday morning requesting that he impose sanctions on the defendants.

[Despite Trump administration denials, new evidence suggests census citizenship question was crafted to benefit white Republicans]

Files found in Hofeller’s affairs after his death in August revealed that he “played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, ‘Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,’ ” plaintiffs’ lawyers said.

The lawyers said administration officials had relied on a 2015 study by Hofeller concluding that adding it “would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats” and benefit white Republicans in redistricting. The lawyers said Hofeller then pushed the idea with the Trump administration in 2017, contradicting sworn testimony by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s expert adviser A. Mark Neuman and senior Justice Department official John Gore, as well as other testimony by defendants. The lawyers also wrote that the Trump administration used a rationale suggested by Hofeller — enforcement of the Voting Rights Act — to justify the question, that a 2017 Justice Department letter requesting it used Hofeller’s words almost verbatim, and that officials purposely obscured Hofeller’s role in court proceedings.

[House committee to vote on holding Barr and Ross in contempt for failing to provide documents related to 2020 Census citizenship question]

In a six-page letter filed to Furman, Justice Department lawyers denied those claims. “Plaintiffs provide no evidence that Gore ever read, received, or was even aware of the existence of that unpublished study,” the Justice Department attorneys wrote. “There is no smoking gun here, only smoke and mirrors.”

It called any link between Hofeller’s study and the 2017 Justice Department letter “imagined.”

The letter filed on Monday also argued that it is “too late to reopen the evidence in this already-closed case,” adding, “Plaintiffs are not entitled to a do-over.”

Opponents of the question have argued it will suppress response to the survey among immigrant communities, resulting in an undercount in the areas where they live.

The population count from the decennial census is used to allocate $800 billion a year in federal funding and determine congressional representation and redistricting.

A key issue in the challenges to the citizenship question is how it came to be added. Ross originally told Congress his decision to add it came solely in response to the December 2017 Justice Department request, but lawsuits later produced emails showing that Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, had been pushing for the question for months before that.

The letter also said the plaintiffs’ lawyers had misrepresented Hofeller’s study. Rather than analyzing the effects of adding a citizenship question, it said Hofeller had analyzed the effects of switching representation from all residents to citizens of voting age. It also questioned why plaintiffs’ lawyers had waited until last week to present the evidence, when they had apparently had it since February.

The Supreme Court heard the case April 23. Evidence in the case concluded with oral arguments that day, and it appeared that the conservative majority seemed inclined to agree with the government that the decision to add the question was within the authority of the commerce secretary.

If the court followed normal procedure, it voted that week on the outcome of the case, and the justices are in the process of writing the opinion.

Cal Thomas: After Mueller’s ‘last word’ many voters are going to think Trump is being persecuted. Are they wrong?,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Cal Thomas', ""Cal Thomas Is America'S Most Widely Syndicated Op-Ed Columnist. His Latest Book Is""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/cal-thomas-robert-mueller-report-russia-investigation-trump,"It’s a familiar quote from Charles Dickens’ classic ""Oliver Twist,"" but with special contemporary relevance in light of a statement last week by Special Counsel Robert Mueller: ""‘If the law supposes that,’ said Mr. Bumble … ‘the law is a ass — a idiot.’""

But it isn’t so much that the law is fractured, rather it is practitioners who sometimes do it an injustice.

In a statement at the Justice Department during which he resigned and announced the closing of his office, Mueller said this about indicted Russian hackers who attempted to influence the outcome of the 2016 election: “These indictments contain allegations and we are not commenting on the guilt or the innocence of any specific defendant. Every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.”

ADAM SCHIFF: ROBERT MUELLER SHOULD STILL TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS ON RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

Moments later, Mueller said about President Trump and allegations (mostly by Democrats and the media) that he obstructed justice: ""If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.""

At some point, many voters are going to look at this as persecution of the president, which can only add to his prospects in 2020.

So it’s innocent until proven guilty for the Russians, who are never going to be tried in the United States, and an insinuation of guilt until he proves himself innocent for the president of the United States? This is standing justice on its head.

In an interview with CBS News, Attorney General William Barr said he believes Mueller could have come to a conclusion as to whether the president obstructed justice. When he didn’t, Barr said he concluded he did not, based on the evidence.

That Mueller had nothing to say about what Trump dismisses as the ""phony"" Steele Dossier, which led to a FISA warrant allowing the FBI to spy (Barr’s word) on the Trump campaign, or the role of Hillary Clinton and Democratic Party in paying for the dossier, further corrupts the law and establishes a double standard as the only standard by which some politicians and members of the establishment live.

It should also be remembered that, though Mueller himself is a registered Republican, most of the attorneys on his team were registered Democrats. A handful donated money to Clinton’s 2016 campaign. Just how much confidence should be placed in a report put together by such people can be answered by asking about the confidence one might place in a report about a Democratic president and a team of Republican lawyers.

Thankfully, the Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, may offer more information as soon as this week, which could incriminate the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party for alleged corrupt activities in the last election. Additional information is likely to be forthcoming from U.S. Attorney John Durham, named by Barr to investigate the origins of surveillance of the Trump campaign.

This is likely what the left and the media fear most. While they are unable to counter the good economic news, their only hope to keep Trump from being re-elected is to remove him from office on charges of obstruction and corruption, or drive down his approval numbers in hopes of defeating him. Some polls show that strategy isn’t working.

In his farewell remarks, Mueller said his more than 400-page report is the last word. Some in Congress from both parties want him to testify. Mueller said he has nothing to add to the report, but there is more to say and Mueller should be required to say it.

House Democrats may not want to have Mueller appear because Republicans will ask tough questions. Could this be why they are desperately trying to change the subject by seeking Trump’s taxes and bank records dating back to before he became president?

At some point, many voters are going to look at this as persecution of the president, which can only add to his prospects in 2020.

‘Trump Baby’ and the Trump robot headline London protests over U.S. president’s visit,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Karla Adam', 'London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom', 'June At Pm']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/baby-trump-and-the-trump-robot-headline-london-protests-against-us-presidents-visit/2019/06/04/93764614-8634-11e9-9d73-e2ba6bbf1b9b_story.html,"A giant blimp of a diaper-clad “Trump Baby” and a talking Trump robot sitting on a toilet were among the most vivid props Tuesday as tens of thousands of protesters descended on central London to register their disapproval of President Trump, who was in the British capital for a three-day state visit.

After a day of pomp and pageantry involving the British royals, Tuesday was a day for politics and protests. Trump had meetings at Downing Street, and protesters were hoping that they were close enough — and loud enough — to be heard.

The road outside 10 Downing Street was sealed off with steel barricades, and there was a heavy police presence.

But nearby, the “Carnival of Resistance” was in full swing in on-off rain.

In a news conference Tuesday with outgoing prime minister Theresa May, Trump dismissed the protests. “Even coming over today, there were thousands of people cheering,” he asserted. “A lot of it is fake news, I have to say.”

He added: “I didn’t see the protesters until just a little while ago. And it was a very, very small group of people put in for political reasons. So it was fake news.”

Activists estimated 75,000 people hit the streets Tuesday — fewer than those at the anti-Trump rally in 2018, which organizers said drew more than 100,000.

But the protesters were vocal, their chants — including “Say it loud, say it clear! Donald Trump’s not welcome here!” and “Donald Trump, shame on you!” — ringing in the air as reporters headed to the news conference.

“We come today because we don’t like the tide of right-wing populism that’s going across the Western world, especially in America and Europe,” said Cat Thorneycroft, 35, an illustrator. “I don’t even necessarily mind that he’s had a state visit, but if he’s going to come, then this is what’s going to happen,” she said, referring to the protesters behind her in Parliament Square.

Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, was among those who addressed the crowds. He condemned Trump’s tweets calling London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a longtime Trump foe on Twitter, a “stone cold loser.” Corbyn said he was “proud that our city has a Muslim mayor.”

Trump also denounced Corbyn, calling him a “negative force.”

The Labour leader also said he would resist any attempts to allow private American companies to take over “our precious, wonderful National Health Service. . . . We will not stand for that.”

Trump tweeted Monday that he had not “seen any protests yet, but I’m sure the Fake News will be working hard to find them.” The main protests were planned for Tuesday.

The world’s most famous helium-filled balloon — the 20-foot-tall blimp depicting a baby Trump holding a cellphone — was back, hovering above the scene in Parliament Square.

Kevin Smith, one of the organizers and “Trump babysitters,” said it was a “very effective way to prick the pomposity and ego of Donald Trump.”

[As Trump’s state visit looms, Britain seems a reluctant host]

Asked whether it wasn’t a rather juvenile form of protest, he said it was “part of a long tradition in Britain of political caricature. It’s not unlike cartoons in a newspaper — it just so happens to be 3-D and floats in the air.”

The organizers of the balloon crowdfunded more than 36,00 pounds ($46,000), which they are giving to groups they describe as “pushing back against the politics of hate and division that are represented by Trump.”

There was also a talking Trump robot that sat on a toilet, saying: “You’re fake news! I’m a very stable genius!”

The British tradition of creating witty — and sometimes rude — placards was on full display. One protester held aloft a sign that read: “British Humour: the gift of a book to an illiterate man — well played Your Majesty.” As part of a customary gift exchange at the start of the visit, Queen Elizabeth II gave Trump a book by Winston Churchill on World War II.

Another man was pushing a shopping cart filled with toilet paper featuring Trump’s face on it. “Come on down to Trafalgar and get your Donald Trump toilet paper,” he said.

Footage posted on social media showed supporters and critics clashing at the rally. In one video, a Trump supporter was surrounded by people angrily shouting “Nazi scum!” before he was pelted with a milkshake.

The protests come a day after a lavish state banquet hosted by the queen at Buckingham Palace.

Bryony Doyle, 23, an illustrator and a nanny protesting in Trafalgar Square, said she was “very pleased” that Trump did not “get the red-carpet treatment when he arrived. I know he went for dinner at Buckingham Palace, but he didn’t stay there,” she said.

[The long and bitter feud between Trump and London Mayor Sadiq Khan]

The Trumps are staying at Winfield House, the residence of the U.S. ambassador in London, but not Buckingham Palace, which would normally be the case. The palace is reportedly undergoing renovations.

“I think with us and our culture there’s only so much we can do without feeling impolite,” Doyle said. “I don’t think the queen could actually say no. I think there’s a limit to what the royals can do without causing too much controversy. But that’s not the case with the public, which is why we are here all day!”

Some wondered whether the protests would have any effect.

Mark Davis, 64, a lawyer from California on vacation, said: “Trump could come here and do virtually anything and there are people back in the States who will support him. They’d think he’s being picked on, or this and that. I don’t think this changes anything. In the States, you’re either for him or against him.”

His wife, Monica Richards, 65, a retired employee of Orange County Superior Court in California, said they were nonetheless excited to be among a throng of “like people who have a great hate for Trump. It’s an opportunity to show our support for the forces who are against him.”

She then unrolled a homemade pink sign that read, “Impeach now.”

Cleveland to participate in Justice Department crime-fighting program,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Eric Heisig', 'Eheisig Cleveland.Com']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.cleveland.com/crime/2019/06/cleveland-to-participate-in-justice-department-crime-fighting-program.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio — The Justice Department selected the city of Cleveland to participate in a program that will provide law enforcement more resources to combat violent and drug crimes.

The department announced Monday that the city will join the National Public Safety Partnership initiative. Attorney General William Barr said in a news release that the resources help police find where crime is highest and to find and prosecute offenders. He claimed several cities participating in the program have seen “dramatic” reductions in violent crime since the program started two years ago.

The designation will give Cleveland police additional training and technical support to combat violent crime, U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman said in the release.

The U.S. attorney said the program will improve the ability analyze crime trends and direct resources where needed. It will go toward ongoing efforts to crack down on carjackings, armed robberies, firearms crimes and other violent crime, he said.

Cities selected to participate in the program have higher violent crime rates than the national average and must be willing to commit to reducing that rate. The release says cities must also adhere to all federal immigration laws.

In addition to Cleveland, the Justice Department announced nine other sites nationwide that were joining the program.

The cities of Cincinnati and Toledo were selected for the program in 2017. Their participation elicited pushback from the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, which said the program is a rehashing of tactics seen during the War on Drugs in the 1980s and 1990s.

Don't give up on Venezuela,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/dont-give-up-on-venezuela,"A series of failed attempts to catalyze an uprising against Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro has both the opposition and the United States out on a limb. Within hours of interim President Juan Guaidó announcing a rebellion on April 30, defection by key regime insiders failed to materialize. In the aftermath of a failed uprising and Guaidó's endorsement of negotiations with the Maduro regime, it has become painfully obvious that both the opposition and Washington policymakers do not understand what motivates the Venezuelan military.

So far, the opposition and the U.S. have been unable to convince the Venezuelan officer corps to defect, even as the broader strategy of international pressure and the U.S. commitment to sanctions has succeeded in rattling the Maduro regime. Yet, repeated attempts at ill-conceived and poorly executed plots sap critical energy from the opposition and make it look desperate. Worse, it has convinced the Maduro regime that it can outlast the opposition, possibly by using the negotiations starting in Norway to stall for time.

Stung by the public debacle, insiders spun the fizzled uprising as, ""We almost succeeded, if only the Russians had not interfered."" One version of events placed Maduro on a plane on the tarmac, ready to flee had he not been convinced to stay by his Russian advisers. Another chimerical tale blamed the failure on Supreme Court Chief Justice Mikael Moreno, who supposedly didn't stick to a secret arrangement, got cold feet, and refused to recognize Guaidó. The involvement of a shady Venezuelan billionaire, indicted by the U.S. for money laundering, laid bare the plan's obvious shortcomings.

These fanciful excuses, as well as the negotiations between the opposition and the Maduro regime, demonstrate that both the U.S. and the opposition are ignoring what motivates the Venezuelan generals. The botched uprising did nothing to shift the allegiance of the Venezuelan officer corps or change the reality that several principal elements still could give rise to high-level military defections.

First, credible threats of military force with strategic offers of amnesty are critical to induce key insiders to abandon Maduro's sinking ship. Defections occur in waves, but the officer corps remains highly uncomfortable with Guaidó as a political leader. For one, Guaidó appeared with recently released opposition figure Leopoldo López. A victim of brutal torture at the hands of the regime, López inspires suspicion in large segments of the military who believe he is interested only in seeking revenge.

Second, the officer corps must recognize Guaidó's leadership — not in the narrow constitutional sense, but by acknowledging the attractiveness of his influence and message. While Guaidó's calls for a restoration of democracy have succeeded in mobilizing the Venezuelan people, the idea of democracy is too amorphous, and the Venezuelan officer corps has yet to envision its future under a post-Maduro presidency. While the opposition speaks of a beautiful new government, members of the corrupt officer corps have more existential concerns: whether they will be imprisoned or targeted for assassination. For them, discarding Maduro is tantamount to a surrender of their freedom and their fortunes, given their involvement in highly lucrative activities such as narcotrafficking and illicit gold mining. Worse, the opposition's sudden willingness to make deals with corrupt insiders muddies any principled distinction between them and the Maduro regime in the eyes of Venezuelan generals.

Third, Guaidó has failed to trigger a sense of inevitability about the restoration of democracy. Venezuelan generals should feel as though they must join the movement before it is too late. Guaidó's use of social media has not affected hardened generals accustomed to implementing the orders of Cuban intelligence on a daily basis. Social media might even seem like a plaything to them. Because Guaidó is not getting this message through to them, and although it would be considerably more difficult, he must aim for a takeover of pro-Maduro media outlets to reach the regime's trusted circle.

Despite this failure to communicate with the military, neither the opposition nor the U.S. should give up. Certainly, negotiation with Maduro should not be on the table when the conditions are still ripe for military defections. The bulk of the Venezuelan military — a depleted force increasingly estranged from the corrupt officer corps — has long understood why Maduro is the problem. He has presided over the worst peacetime economic collapse of any country in modern times, second only to war-torn Syria. While it is perhaps forgivable that the opposition and the U.S. did not study the dynamics of defection before embarking on a campaign of sanctions, the failure to learn from these mistakes is inexcusable, as is the inability to motivate and mobilize some of the few remaining honest officers.

U.S. EPA is sued for ousting scientists from advisory committees,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Stempel', 'Min Read']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-epa-lawsuit/us-epa-is-sued-for-ousting-scientists-from-advisory-committees-idUSKCN1T42H8,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was sued on Monday by a nonprofit over a recent directive banning many scientists from panels that advise the agency on scientific matters.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court by the Natural Resources Defense Council.

The NRDC said the Oct. 31, 2017 directive from Wheeler’s predecessor Scott Pruitt upended decades of EPA practices “for no good reason” and without required public comment.

It said the agency has since used the directive to remove qualified scientists from its roughly 23 advisory committees, freeing it to replace them with industry representatives.

Monday’s complaint seeks to set aside the directive and all decisions based on it.

The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Pruitt’s directive barred anyone receiving EPA grant money from serving on the advisory panels, citing a need for the panels to be more independent.

“Whatever science comes out of EPA, shouldn’t be political science,” Pruitt said at the time.

The directive was welcomed at the time by conservatives opposed to excessive regulation and condemned by Democrats and environmental groups.

U.S. President Donald Trump has tried to roll back what he considers burdensome environmental regulations to make the government more friendly to drilling, manufacturing and mining businesses.

The NRDC said it had legal standing to sue because some of its members include scientists who would have to forgo grants or professional opportunities under the directive.

The case is Natural Resources Defense Council Inc v. EPA et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-05174."

“This includes upholding the rights and dignity of migrants, protecting against attempts by the Trump administration to steal funds from measures that actually keep us safe for a vanity border wall, and providing no funding for additional Border Patrol agents and checkpoints or border barriers,” Lowey said.



The bill is the opening salvo in a fight that could lead to another government shutdown over border security.

Earlier this year, Trump shut down the government for a record 35 days after Democrats refused to comply with his demands for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

In the end, Trump acquiesced to a compromise of $1.35 billion for barriers, on par with what was offered before the shutdown, and well below the amount he demanded.



Trump went on to declare a state of emergency at the border, which would allow him to circumvent Congress and use military funds to build the barrier.



House Democrats have included provisions in their 2020 spending bills that would block such attempts to reprogram funds to build a wall.

For example, a military construction spending bill blocked funds from being reprogrammed for building a wall, and the financial services spending bill included provisions preventing forfeited funds for that purpose.

Democrats are also seeking to block Trump’s emergency moves in court.



The $63.8 billion DHS bill increases spending by $2.2 billion over current levels, but comes in $1.9 billion below Trump's request.

The DHS bill is the last of 12 spending bills the House Democrats have released for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Combined, the bills represented a broad rejection of Trump's agenda and budget requests. Trump had proposed slashing domestic spending by as much 10 percent, including deep cuts to the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency, National Institutes of Health and Department of Transportation, among other programs.

The House bills flouted his proposals, adding $34 billion to domestic spending and $17 billion to defense.

"Two years after skipping over Baltimore, DOJ offers us a spot in crime-fighting program",https://baltimorefishbowl.com,['Please Enter Your Name Here'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/two-years-after-skipping-over-baltimore-doj-offers-us-a-spot-in-crime-fighting-program/,"Share the News









After withholding crime-fighting assistance from Baltimore in 2017 due to its sanctuary protections for undocumented immigrants, the U.S. Department of Justice today added the city to a roster of places receiving help investigating gangs, drug trafficking and other sources of violent crime.

Baltimore is on a list of 10 cities the DOJ is adding to its National Public Safety Partnership initiative, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland announced today. Abbreviated as PSP, the program stewards federal resources toward U.S. cities with “sustained levels of violence that far exceed the national average,” according to a release.

Eligible localities must also “demonstrate a commitment to reducing crime” and “display compliance with federal immigration requirements.”

That last bit was a sticking point when the Jeff Sessions-led DOJ omitted Baltimore from its first batch of announced PSP cities. Former Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis expressed surprise at being left off at the time, which Sessions said weeks later was due to Baltimore’s sanctuary protections for undocumented immigrants. Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Stockton and San Bernardino, California, each received the same treatment.

Sessions, who resigned last November at President Donald Trump’s request, asked that Davis change departmental policy and begin contacting U.S. Homeland Security if police had an undocumented inmate detained in the city jail. What Sessions missed was that the State of Maryland has operated Baltimore’s jail since 1991, meaning the responsibility to call U.S. Immigration Enforcement about undocumented detainees would fall to the state corrections department—not BPD.

Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh at the time advised all of Maryland’s local law enforcement agencies to tread carefully when considering whether to detain immigrants without a warrant, or for extended periods of time. Frosh issued guidance in May 2017 warning that doing so may violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

Baltimore was also skipped over for the PSP initiative in 2018, when the DOJ added five more cities.

But here we are now, with William Barr having since replaced Sessions as attorney general. We’ll note that even since the funding conflict with Sessions, Baltimore hasn’t adopted any new policies–at least publicly–that would deny promised sanctuary protections to undocumented immigrants, or agreed to help ICE deport immigrant inmates.

Barr said several participating PSP cities “have already seen dramatic reductions in violent crime over the past two years,” and the federal government hopes to “replicate that success” with the new additions.

“Commissioner [Michael] Harrison is very pleased by this announcement,” BPD spokesman Matt Jablow said via email. He noted Harrison “has a lot of experience with the National Public Safety Partnership from his time in New Orleans,” which was among the initial pilot sites for the program, “and he thinks it will be a significant benefit for BPD in our efforts to make Baltimore a safer city.”

Robert K. Hur, U.S. Attorney for Maryland, said in a statement that “all hands are on deck to make Baltimore safer, and the technical assistance available to Baltimore as part of the Justice Department’s Public Safety Partnerships will be crucial to our efforts.”

Joining Baltimore in the list of new recipients for PSP funds are Anniston and Oxford, both in Alabama; Anchorage, Baton Rouge, Cleveland, Davenport, Iowa; Amarillo and Harris County, both in Texas, and Wichita, Kansas.

The full list of PSP cities is available here.

State Department says it is now requiring social media info from 'most' visa applicants,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/02/politics/state-department-social-media-visa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The State Department has begun requesting ""most"" US visa applicants provide information on their social media accounts, a department official said in a statement.

The move was expected following an announcement in March of last year that outlined plans to require nearly all US visa applicants to submit their social media handles and other information.

The State Department statement over the weekend said the forms for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants had been updated ""to request additional information, including social media identifiers.""

According to the official's statement, the move is a result of a memorandum issued by President Donald Trump in 2017 on ""vetting"" for people coming to the US and a provision of an executive order from around the same time that sought to block entry to the US for people from several majority-Muslim countries, which included a provision on vetting standards.

CNN previously reported that the change was expected to affect around 15 million people.

U.S. Justice Department preparing antitrust probe of Google,https://www.japantimes.co.jp,['No Author'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/06/02/business/tech/u-s-justice-department-preparing-antitrust-probe-google/,"The U.S. Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google’s business practices and whether they violate antitrust law — the Trump administration’s first major step to scrutinize the potentially anti-competitive conduct of a giant technology firm.

The search giant was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.

Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the company’s search and other businesses.

Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., has faced mounting scrutiny as regulators around the world have focused on tech companies’ business practices over the past year.

In addition to the 2017 record fine, European regulators also slapped a $1.7 billion penalty on the company in March for barring websites from selling ads from rivals alongside some Google-served ads near search results.

Google says it has now ended that practice.

The company made changes voluntarily when the FTC shut down its investigation, including letting advertisers use information from their Google ad campaigns to create campaigns with rivals.

But an FTC staff report that was released years later showed that the agency staff had urged the presidentially appointed commissioners to bring a lawsuit against Google. That never happened.

The Justice Department inquiry would be run by Makan Delrahim, the head of the antitrust division.

In a speech delivered earlier this year at a technology conference, Delrahim cheered the success of large technology platforms. Without mentioning Google, he said the companies have grown because of “innovative and disruptive services.”

“In my view, it’s no accident, and a point of pride, that a majority of these leading platforms are American companies,” he said at the time.

American antitrust officials are under increasing pressure from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers and advocates of tougher enforcement to step up scrutiny of technology giants.

The federal government’s hands-off approach may be changing amid continuing criticism that lax enforcement in the U.S. has allowed tech platforms to dominate their markets.

The FTC earlier this year set up a task force to examine the conduct of tech companies and their past mergers. President Donald Trump and many Republicans have complained that Facebook, Google and Twitter suppress conservative views.

Last year, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with state officials about technology companies.

His replacement, William Barr, said at his Senate confirmation hearing that he wanted to learn more about how “huge behemoths” in Silicon Valley “have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers.”

Google commands the lead in revenue for digital advertising by a wide margin, controlling 31.1 percent of global digital ad dollars, according to eMarketer’s estimates this year.

Facebook is a distant second with 20.2 percent.

Politicians and outside antitrust analysts have expressed concern in recent years that Google controls too much of the digital ad process.

It makes the technology, hosts the largest search site where ads appear and collects data from all ad campaigns that it runs. Its middleman role has long been a source of complaint for publishers, including News Corp., which publishes the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers.

Oracle Corp., which competes with Google in the digital advertising market, has also called on American enforcers to examine Google’s conduct.

“Google is very clearly dominant in that market,’ Ken Glueck, an executive vice president at Oracle, said in an interview in April. “There is conduct that is exclusionary in the market and there are harms in that market.”

Another longtime foe is Yelp Inc., which says Google unfairly promotes its own products, such as business listings, over other companies’ services.

Google, known universally for its search engine, also has fingers in a number of other pies, like online advertising, email messaging and video. That gives U.S. antitrust enforcers lots to look at.

Governments around the world are becoming increasingly unnerved by the power amassed by major technology companies — with the dominance of Google in search, Facebook in social networking and Amazon in e-commerce raising the sharpest concerns.

In the most dramatic scenario, a case might be made for breaking the companies into smaller pieces.

Here are some possible areas U.S. antitrust cops might poke into:

Ads

Google commands the lead in digital ad revenue by a wide margin. But the latest penalty from European regulators isn’t likely to have much effect on the firm’s business. The amount is just a fraction of the $31 billion in profit that its parent conglomerate made last year.

Search results

Google’s search engine handles 2 out of every 3 queries in the United States. European regulators have found that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the lucrative e-commerce market, fining the company nearly $2.8 billion. Google disputes those findings and is still appealing that 2017 decision.

The FTC staff report released after the agency’s investigation showed that the staff legal recommendations rejected by the commissioners involved allegations of Google tinkering with its search results in a way that stifled competition.

Lawmakers from both parties appear determined to examine whether Google rigs its search results to also promote its own political agenda.

Android

Another huge antitrust fine from the European overseers, $5 billion, came against Google in July 2018 for a finding that it abused the dominance of its Android operating system by forcing handset and tablet makers to install Google apps, reducing consumer choice.

The company appealed the ruling and also made changes to avoid additional fines.

It started this spring giving European Union smartphone users a choice of browsers and search apps on Android.

Following an Android update, users will be shown two new screens giving them the new options.

Android users who open the Google Play store after the update will be given the option to install as many as five search apps and five browsers. Apps are included based on their popularity and are shown in random order."

Meghan Markle isn't Trump's victim and the media are lying,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/meghan-markle-isnt-trumps-victim-and-the-media-are-lying,"Whenever the national media put forth a new victim to rally behind in the name of the #Resistance, you should suspect you’re being lied to.

The latest is Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. President Trump said in a recent interview that he was unaware Meghan had spoken negatively about him during the 2016 campaign.

A journalist for the British Sun tabloid asked Trump on Sunday ahead of his trip to the U.K., “Are you sorry not to see her? Because she wasn’t so nice during the campaign, I don’t know if you saw that.”

Trump, informed Meghan, originally of Los Angeles, would be on maternity leave, replied, “I didn’t know that. No, I hope she’s OK. I did not know that.”

The journalist goaded Trump, telling him, “She said she’d move to Canada if you got elected; turned out she moved to Britain.”

“That will be good,” Trump said. “A lot of people moving here, so what can I say? No, I didn’t know that she was nasty.”

This was boiled down to: Trump calls princess 'nasty'!

Trump had actually added in the interview that “it’s nice” that the United Kingdom now has a princess of American descent and that “she’ll be very good.”

The term “nasty” was used by Trump as a stand-in for the reporter’s original characterization of “wasn’t so nice.”

But you wouldn't know the real story by glancing at the news coverage. Washington Post blogger Eugene Scott said Trump’s “attacks” on Meghan were “familiar and unsurprising,” because his use of the word “nasty” reinforced the belief that Trump “is sexist and misogynistic.” (For the record, here's Trump using the word ""nasty"" to describe Donny Deutsch, David Gregory, Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Charles Krauthammer, to name a few men.)

See, if you just put forth a claim, whether merited or not, and assert, like Scott, that it’s “rooted” in some belief — any belief! — it becomes true!

Charles Blow, always good for a laugh, acknowledged Sunday in his New York Times column that the question by the Sun journalist was a “set up” for Trump. But Blow knew in his heart that it was a ""set up"" that ""both parties wanted.”

Blow lectured that, “A better journalist, if he or she wanted to have Trump weigh in on [Meghan’s 2016] comments, would simply read Meghan’s response and ask for the president’s response."" These are lessons in journalism coming from Blow, who proudly skipped a face-to-face meeting with Trump in 2017.

And outside of journalism, it’s stupidity not limited to Blow.

ABC analyst Matthew Dowd tweeted that Trump “used the word nasty … in reference to her.”

CBS News correspondent Bill Rehkopf tweeted, “He called her ‘nasty.’”

Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty tweeted, “He actually calls her ‘nasty’ in this audio. That is the exact word he uses.”

Ben White of Politico tweeted, “This is literally exactly what he says. ‘I didn’t know that she was nasty.’”

Well, yes. This is “literally exactly” what Trump said the same way this morning I “literally exactly” said “I’ll kill you.” It turns out I didn’t mean I’d literally kill my editor. I only meant that I didn’t agree with his decision to remove my use of the word “teats” from a piece about Michael Avenatti.

The media do this type of thing freely whenever they need a new victim to post up against Trump. They’ll lie about Trump calling immigrants “animals” (he was explicitly referring to MS-13 gang members). They’ll lie about Trump calling European allies “foes” (It was CBS’s Jeff Glor who used the word). And they’ll lie about him mocking a reporter who happens to be disabled.

Meghan isn’t a victim and she wasn’t attacked. She’s a critic of the White House and just like all of them, the media are helping her play dead when she gets a response."
Jason Chaffetz: Lawbreaking FBI leaker must be prosecuted – Justice Department fails to do so,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jason Chaffetz', 'Jason Chaffetz Is A Fox News Contributor Who Was The Chairman Of The U.S. House Oversight Committee When He Served As A Representative Utah. He Is The Author Of']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jason-chaffetz-justice-department-leakers,"While the predictable news conference with Special Counsel Robert Mueller made headlines this week for repeating what we already knew, a bigger story from the Department of Justice broke that got far too little attention.

In a Wednesday report released by the Inspector General for the Department of Justice, we learned that the OIG was able to identify a former deputy assistant director at the FBI who violated the law by leaking sealed court documents to the media, engaging in repeated unauthorized contacts with journalists, and accepting a gift from the media.

BARR SAYS DOJ HAS 'MULTIPLE LEAK' PROBES UNDERWAY

We already knew leaking and unauthorized media contacts were a cultural and systemic problem at the FBI. A June 2018 OIG Report revealed the extent of the practice and provided a graphic illustration:

Although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed. We identified numerous FBI employees, at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media, who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters. The large number of FBI employees who were in contact with journalists during this time period impacted our ability to identify the sources of leaks.

But this week, we learned the OIG actually has identified one of the sources and suggested the allegations were supported by ""a preponderance of evidence."" Though that is certainly newsworthy, the real news was the Justice Department response. Officials mysteriously, though not surprisingly, declined to prosecute one of their own.

Creating new laws for theJustice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

These are serious allegations against a very senior FBI official. How can the department not take action when there is direct evidence in hand? This is someone who deliberately and illegally disclosed sensitive information from sealed court filings. If the Justice Department looks the other way, what message does that send to the rest of the FBI? What better way to signal to the entire federal law enforcement apparatus that laws and rules are optional?

Unfortunately, we routinely have people at DOJ who put their thumb on the scale to impact politics. It's obviously part of the culture fostered by the two previous FBI directors, Robert Mueller and James Comey. They have both shown political animus and bias toward President Trump.

Comey himself released sealed information, likely for a political purposes. Mueller this week left no doubt of his own animus toward the president. No wonder the American people have lost faith in our federal law enforcement.

Not only is there no penalty for violating the law, there may actually be an incentive for doing so. For leakers with partisan motivations, the chance to impact an election may outweigh the risk of an unlikely prosecution.

If we want to instill confidence in the system, we need to be able to demonstrate that when somebody violates rules and laws within the FBI, they, too, will be prosecuted and held accountable.

There is little Congress can do legislatively. Leaking is already against the law. Creating new laws for the Justice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., should call on the Justice Department to answer to the American people for this failure to prosecute. Members of the Judiciary Committee in the House and Senate should question Inspector General Michael Horowitz about his findings and demand answers from the DOJ about the failure to prosecute. There may be no better way to get the answers the American people deserve.

“While Congress has pursued comprehensive, bipartisan legislation, the State Department has plowed ahead in its plan to create a bureau with a much narrower mission focused only on cybersecurity,” Engel told The Hill in a statement. “This move flies in the face of repeated warnings from Congress and outside experts that our approach to cyber issues needs to elevate engagement on economic interests and internet freedoms together with security.”

Engel was likely referring to the Cyber Diplomacy Act, a bill he co-sponsored along with House Foreign Affairs Ranking Member Michael McCaul Michael Thomas McCaulFurious lawmakers aim to block Trump's Saudi arms sales Tillerson meets with House Foreign Affairs Committee Overnight Defense: Congressional leaders receive classified briefing on Iran | Trump on war: 'I hope not' | Key Republican calls threats credible | Warren plan targets corporate influence at Pentagon MORE (R-Texas) that would establish an Office of International Cyberspace Policy at the State Department.

Engel added that the hold on the notification would stand until “the Secretary of State directs his staff to work constructively with Congress to establish a bureau that ensures the Department is able to advance the full range of U.S. interests.”

A spokesperson for the State Department confirmed the agency had “notified Congress regarding its plans to establish the new CSET bureau” but did not comment further.

McCaul, meanwhile, expressed a more positive view of the State Department's move. A committee spokesperson for McCaul told The Hill that he ""looks forward to working with the Administration and his colleagues in the House and Senate to legislate the best possible cyber structure and mission set.""

The State Department’s notification to Congress of its intent to establish CSET, obtained by The Hill on Tuesday, lays out the key staffing and coordination plan for the proposed bureau.

The agency wrote that CSET will “consolidate resources focused on cyberspace security and the security-related aspects of emerging technologies.”

In addition, the State Department’s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs’ focus on “privacy aspects” of cybersecurity and emerging technologies will be increased.

“In considering the growing national security challenge presented by cyber space and emerging technologies, the Department has determined that its efforts in these areas are not appropriately aligned or resourced,” the State Department wrote in justifying these developments.

As part of the establishment of CSET, a “coordinator and ambassador-at-large” would be appointed to lead U.S. international efforts on cyberspace.

Christopher Painter, the State Department coordinator for cyber issues from 2011 through 2017, tweeted Tuesday that while he thinks the agency’s move to prioritize cybersecurity is positive, he's unsure about the approach.

“Great that State is finally re-elevating cyber,” Painter tweeted. “Its a critical issue & needs US leadership. Not so great that they have chosen stove-piping over a coordinated approach.”"
The Trump Administration Might Be Too Incompetent to Undermine Environmental Regulations,https://slate.com,['Richard L. Revesz'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/trump-administration-cant-actually-undermine-environmental-regulation-too-incompetent.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Nivellen77/iStock / Getty Images Plus and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

The Trump administration appears to be entering an alarming new stage of its attack on environmental protection. For the past two-plus years, it has used a retail approach, targeting Obama-era environmental rules one by one, trying to suspend compliance deadlines. This strategy has been met with limited success—more than 90 percent of the administration’s deregulatory efforts are being defeated in court, mostly due to sloppy agency actions. But the Environmental Protection Agency has recently decided it will undertake a new approach in its effort to launch a wholesale attack on environmental regulation—it will change the way it collects and processes data, to provide better justification to dismantle the analytical foundation of its rules. These moves fly in the face of established economics and health sciences, and are inconsistent with the practices of administrations of both parties over four decades. The consequences for the environment and public health could be disastrous. But even as this approach might be more deliberate, these actions are unlikely to survive court challenges as well.

The EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards.

In the coming weeks, the EPA plans to finalize vastly weakened versions of two important climate rules: a regulation controlling greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and standards to limit emissions from vehicles. The draft proposals for the Trump administration’s revisions to each of these rules were rife with analytical problems. In the power plant rule revision, the agency exercised its discretion in a manner that imposed billions of dollars’ worth of net harm on the American public. And the vehicle rule analysis is justified by claims about improved safety that rest on a wholly implausible and discredited economic analysis: It assumes that people will buy more—as opposed to fewer—vehicles as they become more expensive. These failures are likely to reappear in the final rules as well, because the administration would be unable to justify its chosen actions without mangling the underlying analysis. As a result of these analytical failures, the rollbacks will be highly vulnerable to legal challenges and could add to the administration’s string of court losses.

Perhaps sensing urgency as these losses mount and the president’s term slips away, the EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards. The agency has taken steps to begin an assault on the core foundations of environmental rulemaking, signaling that it plans to alter the building blocks of the economic analysis that underlies its rules. This new EPA attack features three dirty tricks that would erase the bulk of the benefits of critical environmental policies. These benefits—tens of thousands of averted deaths and hundreds of thousands of averted hospitalizations for strokes, heart attacks, and respiratory ailments—would, of course, still be there. The administration’s analysis would just pretend otherwise.

One EPA method involves calling into question the benefit of reducing pollution below the level of the national ambient air quality standards. Since the late 1970s, every administration—Republican and Democratic—has acknowledged that more stringent standards would provide greater health benefits. But earlier this month, William Wehrum, who oversees air quality for the EPA, brazenly cast doubt on this long-established, science-based approach, telling the New York Times that counting these benefits in regulatory analyses “doesn’t make any sense” because the standards are set at “safe” levels, thereby implying that there can be no benefits at concentrations below the ones that the EPA deems to be “safe.”

The problem with this understanding is that the Supreme Court has made clear that “the word ‘safe’ does not mean ‘risk-free.’ ” And, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which hears all the challenges to national ambient air quality standards, explained that in setting these standards, EPA must “ ‘select … standard levels that … reduce risks sufficiently to protect public health’ ” even while recognizing that “ ‘a zero-risk standard is [not] possible.’ ”

Wehrum should know better, or at least, he did not too long ago. He had previously served under President George W. Bush in senior positions in EPA’s air office between 2001 and 2007. During that time, in setting national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and for ozone, the EPA acknowledged that significantly higher benefits would accrue to the American people if the agency set the standards at levels more stringent that the ones it ultimately chose. The significant concern with this approach is that it will pave the way for the EPA to support laxer standards without having to acknowledge that there is a cost to human life in doing so.

A second EPA trick involves concealing “co-benefits”—the indirect (and often enormous) benefits that result when a regulation reduces pollutants besides the ones being directly targeted by a particular regulation. EPA has launched an attack on co-benefits most directly as part of a revision to a finding related to a major mercury pollution rule—it’s trying to argue that the $37 billion to $90 billion in health co-benefits resulting from reductions in harmful particulate matter pollution don’t exist. If the administration’s goal is to obscure the value of environmental rules, undermining co-benefits will certainly help.

Co-benefits are so universally accepted as a worthwhile thing to consider that even the Trump EPA’s own handpicked Science Advisory Board recently highlighted the importance of considering them. Furthermore, a landmark guidance document on regulatory analysis issued by the Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush explicitly requires the consideration of indirect benefits, though the EPA has consistently taken co-benefits into account since the Reagan administration. Courts have also ruled that the indirect costs of regulations must be considered, so ignoring indirect benefits would create a lopsided and unjustifiable analysis. Indeed, counting indirect effects when they are negative but ignoring them when they are positive is the embodiment of the type of arbitrary and capricious conduct that the law categorically prohibits. But the Trump EPA now wants to make this the norm.

The EPA’s final dirty trick involves questioning foundational scientific studies on the harmful health impacts of particulate pollution. The detrimental health effects of particulate matter emissions are exceptionally well-documented. Two foundational studies performed in the 1990s found that people in cities with the highest levels of these pollutants were dying two years earlier than those in the least-polluted cities. The results were independently verified by two groups of outside researchers, and these studies have helped inform several major air pollution regulations. But an EPA rule proposed last year would bar the consideration of studies like these, even though they are widely regarded as state-of-the-art, because their individual patient health data cannot be shared publicly, because of patient confidentiality rules. The administration’s approach would make it virtually impossible for regulatory policy to rely on epidemiological studies, a science-denying approach that is unlikely to find a receptive ear in the courts.

During the retail phase of the Trump administration’s attack on environmental rules, the EPA cut corners, which led to most of its actions being overturned in court. This new wholesale attack on environmental rulemaking is far more pernicious than the last. The Trump administration is actively trying to undermine and minimize science that has served as a universal baseline for decades. But once again, it’s pursuing its case sloppily, which means the courts are likely to still see through these dirty tricks and stop them before they have a massively negative impact on public health."

Happy 8th Birthday to MyPlate!

Happy Birthday, MyPlate! Eight years ago, MyPlate was introduced as a symbol of the five food groups that serve as the building blocks for healthy eating. This year, we are encouraged to Start Simple with MyPlate, which provides healthy inspiration and tips that are easily incorporated into busy lives and fit personal preferences, health goals, style, and budget. Learn more and join in the #MyPlateChallenge at: ChooseMyPlate.gov/StartSimple.

In honor of MyPlate’s 8th birthday, we are excited to celebrate with nutrition education gifts for you. The staff here at the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) have come together to provide 8 ways we Start Simple with MyPlate. We hope you enjoy these real-life ideas from our CNPP family:

Making dinner after long workdays can seem like a chore. As a time saver, I always wash and cut my vegetables, as well as marinate my favorite protein foods right when I get home from the grocery store. That way, I’m one-step ahead. (Erica, Nutritionist) With 3 young kids and a variety of activities, snacks have become a necessity when we leave the house. I portion healthy foods into small containers the night before so that they're ready to grab–n–go when we need them. (Corey, Nutritionist) I’m a huge sports fan and enjoy fresh veggies when I watch games. Grape tomatoes, mini sweet peppers, sugar snap peas, and baby carrots are virtually prep-free and help me meet my vegetable goals, even on game day. (Lisa, Nutritionist) Sometimes making balanced meals with all food groups for one person is not easy. To help, I make large batches of dinners such as protein foods (pork loin), grains (wild rice), vegetables (roasted zucchini) and fruit (baked apples). Then, I portion my own “meal kits” for easy “planned over” dinners served with a glass of milk. (Barb, Nutritionist) Now that my kids are grown, I no longer have a grocery list of “favorites” but still like to have a variety of produce. This is easy as ABC -- Apples, Bananas, and Carrots. I always have these on hand for quick and easy snacks. (Janie, Graphic Information Specialist) As an avid traveler, I pack a cooler of sandwiches, water, and healthy snacks for road trips. This avoids the need (or temptation) to stop on the road which helps make sure I eat something healthy and saves money. (Dave, Nutritionist) My boyfriend and I love trying new restaurants on the weekends. We focus on ordering heathy foods cooked in new ways. This gets us inspired with different ideas when eating in. (Hannah, Visual Designer) Every Wednesday, after work I ride my bike to the farmers market down the street. In addition to picking up tasty, local produce I get to fit in some physical activity too. (Melissa, Nutritionist)

Senior official at Treasury agency investigated for employee bullying,https://www.politico.com,['Victoria Guida'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/04/employee-bullying-treasury-1492846,"The top human resources official at a Treasury Department agency allegedly created a hostile work environment in which employees feel belittled and afraid to speak up. | Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images finance & tax Senior official at Treasury agency investigated for employee bullying

The top human resources official at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is under an internal investigation over claims of bullying and harassment, allegations that echo complaints against her in a previous government position, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.

Cassandra Cuffee-Graves, hired as deputy comptroller for human capital at the bank regulator in April 2018, has created a hostile work environment in which employees feel belittled and afraid to speak up, five OCC staff members said in interviews. Multiple employees argued that Cuffee-Graves was not properly vetted before being given the job, raising broader questions about hiring practices at the agency, which oversees national banks.

Story Continued Below

Cuffee-Graves and her deputy, Bianca Green, are the subject of an administrative inquiry by the OCC’s legal office, according to the employees, who said they were informed of the probe in March. The employees asked to remain anonymous.

OCC spokesperson Joseph Adamoli said the agency, which is an independent bureau within the Treasury Department, does not comment on personnel matters. Cuffee-Graves and Green did not respond to requests for comment.

Similar allegations were made about the two women when they were top HR officials at the Department of Education. A July 8, 2016, letter to then-Education Secretary John King, signed by human resources staff, claimed a “hostile work environment, fear of retaliation from leadership, verbal abuse, violation of the merit system principles, and collusion against employees.” A signatory of the letter told POLITICO that 19 employees were involved in drafting it.

“Several employees with years of service and no prior suspensions have been suspended for submission of work products that were performed under limited direction by management with the sole intent of using the disciplinary process against the employees,” the letter alleged.

In one instance, an employee was suspended by Green without pay for 30 days for failing to complete certain tasks. A case report published in September 2018 by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that hears appeals from government employees, reversed that decision. The board found that whistleblowing by the employee related to hiring practices at the agency was a “contributing factor” in the suspension.

The employee, Christine Reese, had previously alleged “violations of merit principles and prohibited personnel practices” by several management officials, including Cuffee-Graves, in complaints to the department’s inspector-general and the Office of Special Counsel.

In one of those complaints, she claimed Green was wrongly placed in her position because the department did not follow proper procedures to ensure a competitive hiring process, a claim also lodged by human resources staff in their 2016 letter.

MSPB did not rule on the merits of Reese’s claims but decided in her favor upon finding she was a whistleblower.

The MSPB investigation also found that Cuffee-Graves had imposed an “unreasonable” deadline on the suspended employee, less than 24 hours for a project, which was not completed on time -- one reason for the punishment.

Reese was suspended on April 1, 2018, just a few weeks before Cuffee-Graves started her new position at the OCC. Cuffee-Graves hired Green for a newly created deputy position at the OCC that October, shortly after the case report was finalized.

Cuffee-Graves and Green first worked together in 2012, when both were at Customs and Border Protection.

According to court records, Cuffee-Graves was in bankruptcy proceedings when she was hired by the agency, which the OCC employees believe should have raised questions about her suitability for a management position at a key financial regulator.

According to a review of documents from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland, Cuffee-Graves filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in August 2017 and her plan was confirmed in June 2018.

When applying for a job at the OCC, candidates are asked whether they are delinquent on any federal debt, such as taxes or federally insured student loans or mortgages.

Rich Delmar, an official with the Treasury Department’s IG, asked whether the watchdog had any open investigations into the OCC’s office of human capital, said the office “can’t discuss investigative matters.”

The Education Department IG in its annual plan for fiscal year 2018 said it intended to conduct an audit of the department’s hiring practices, but IG spokesperson Catherine Grant said that audit has been put on hold.

“We do not comment on whether we have received an allegation or complaint, nor do we generally confirm whether we are conducting an investigation,” she said."
Oracle Accuses Amazon Of Courting Former Employee Involved In A $10 Billion DOD Program,https://dailycaller.com,"['Chris White', 'Energy Reporter']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/03/amazon-department-of-defense/,"Amazon made a highly lucrative job offer to a former employee while the man was leading a $10 billion winner-take-all cloud computing contract with the government, according to court documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Computing giant Oracle alleged in the May 31 complaint that former Department of Defense official Deap Ubhi was offered shares in Amazon and a salary with the big tech giant while he was finding a company to help build out the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract.

“AWS (during JEDI and with full knowledge made a hidden job offer to Ubhi, to include a massive [redacted] immediate signing bonus payment, a second [redacted] bonus payment after year one, [redacted} shares of Amazon stock (roughly $950-$960 per share in the relevant period), and a [redacted] salary,” the court document notes, referring to Amazon Web Services, one of the companies vying for the contract.

The document added: “AWS offered a former Amazon employee actively running DoD’s $10 billion JEDI procurement nearly [redacted] dollars in cash and stock during a live procurement, not to mention a substantial salary.” (RELATED: Trump’s Acting DOD Secretary Weighs In On A Cloud Contract Conservatives Loathe)

Ubhi never recused himself, according to the document. Instead, “he spent weeks as a DoD official, downloading the JEDI Google drive to his laptop, meeting with AWS competitors as a DoD official, requesting and participating cloud meetings … and obtaining submissions from JEDI competitors,” Oracle notes in its document.

The filing comes several months after Oracle file a similar lawsuit in December 2018 noting Ubhi’s past employment with Amazon, which stands to be one of two potential winners of JEDI, a cloud computing infrastructure for the U.S. military. Oracle’s lawsuit is an attempt to block the contract until further investigation.

Ubhi openly praised Amazon on Twitter while he was working with the DOD, media reports show. “Once an Amazonian, always an Amazonian. Proud today. Thank you, @JeffBezos,” Ubhi tweeted in January 2017, referencing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’s opposition to President Donald Trump’s border wall.

The former DOD official left the government in late 2017. He now works with AWS.

Oracle and IBM have tried to overturn the single-award approach even. They argue that such a contract would force the Pentagon to pay billions of dollars to one company, while losing out on innovations from other companies down the supply chain. Conservatives have made similar arguments in the past.

“A contract of this magnitude should not be awarded as a sole source contract,” conservative groups wrote in a May 16 letter to Russell Vought, the acting director for the Office of Management and Budget. Citizens Against Government Waste and The American Conservative Union were among several groups that signed the letter.

It has become controversial among Republican lawmakers as well.

Reps. Steve Womack of Arkansas and Tom Cole of Oklahoma, for instance, requested a probe in October 2018 into the Pentagon’s handling of the deal. This came after TheDCNF reported that an adviser to former Secretary of Defense James Mattis once consulted for Amazon Web Services through her firm.

Both Amazon and DOJ refused to provide a comment to TheDCNF, citing ongoing litigation.

State Department now requires U.S. visa applicants to share social media accounts,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-now-requires-us-visa-applicants-to-share-social-media-accounts-2019-06-01/,"The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers. It's a vast expansion of the Trump administration's enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors.

In a move that's just taken effect after approval of the revised application forms, the department says it has updated its immigrant and nonimmigrant visa forms to request the additional information, including ""social media identifiers,"" from almost all U.S. applicants.

The change, which was proposed in March 2018, is expected to affect about 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States each year.

Social media, email and phone number histories had only been sought in the past from applicants who were identified for extra scrutiny, such as people who'd traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations. An estimated 65,000 applicants per year had fallen into that category.

The department says collecting the additional information from more applicants ""will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.""

The new rules apply to virtually all applicants for immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. The department estimated it would affect 710,000 immigrant visa applicants and 14 million nonimmigrant visa applicants, including those who want to come to the U.S. for business or education, according to an initial notice.

The new visa application forms list a number of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and require the applicant to provide any account names they may have had on them over the previous five years. They also give applicants the option to volunteer information about social media accounts on platforms not listed on the form.

In addition to their social media histories, visa applicants are now asked for five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, international travel and deportation status, as well as whether any family members have been involved in terrorist activities.

Only applicants for certain diplomatic and official visa types are exempted from the requirements."
Sonny Perdue in Raleigh says USDA relocation decision soon,https://www.kansascity.com,['The Associated Press'],,,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article231152068.html,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue talks about relocating two USDA offices Sonny Perdue, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture talked about North Carolina's chances to land two USDA office relocations during a visit to Raleigh on Tuesday, June 4, 2019. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK Sonny Perdue, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture talked about North Carolina's chances to land two USDA office relocations during a visit to Raleigh on Tuesday, June 4, 2019.

Sonny Perdue, the U.S. secretary of agriculture, said his department plans to choose a landing spot for two U.S. Department of Agriculture offices within “days and weeks,” a decision that could have ramifications for the Triangle.

The Research Triangle region is one of the final contenders to land the offices of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture — two agencies that could net the area around 700 jobs.

The USDA named the “Research Triangle” region last month as one of four potential locations for the offices. The other contenders are Indiana (the Indianapolis region) as well as either Kansas or Missouri (the greater Kansas City area).

“I have tried to distance myself from that” decision, Perdue told reporters during a tour of the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle in Raleigh. We’re “looking for recommendations obviously. But I don’t want to put my thumb on the scale in those kind of things.”

Perdue — who worked in Wake County as a veterinarian in the 1970s — confirmed that USDA has taken a site visit to the Triangle, though he didn’t say where the site visit was or when it took place.

While making a joke about North Carolina basketball, Perdue added that he thought the Triangle had a lot of qualities the USDA is looking for.

“Carolina being in the final four — that has never happened before, right?” he said. “Obviously, you all who live here know what makes this area attractive. You have a great quality of life; you’ve got the laborshed from the Research Triangle Park; you’ve got the universities and academics here and it is just a great place to live. Those are the qualities we are looking for.”

He also noted that the area’s high-tech industry was a plus for the potential relocation.

Concerns about a relocation

The decision to relocate the two offices, which conduct research on farms and agriculture and provide grant funding, has proven to be controversial since Perdue made it last year.

Critics of the move are worried about the ability of the offices to retain talent, keep their research independent and remain relevant to policy makers in Washington, D.C., if they are located hundreds of miles away.

Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said she is concerned that the move would “do more harm than good.”

“We are concerned that physically moving staffers away from key policy makers across the government would limit the impact of their work,” she told The News & Observer in a phone interview.

She noted that the Trump administration has also suggested budget cuts to the offices and worried that if it is moved those budget cuts might be easier to pass through Congress.

She added, “This seemed like an attack on science, and we have seen the Trump administration do that in other parts of the government.”

There’s also concern among current employees that if the relocation goes through, the two offices could lose many experienced workers who have lived in the D.C. area for decades and don’t want to uproot their lives.

“As soon as we are in a new location, that is when the institutional knowledge will go down,” Laura Dodson, an economist at the ERS, told The N&O in a phone interview. “We have so many economists that have worked on these (topics) for years.”

She said on one team at the ERS, five of the eight members have quit in the past four months. A report from political news site Politico noted last month that “non-retirement departures” from the organization have more than doubled so far this year and that six economists left in April “out of frustration with the relocation process,” according to unnamed co-workers at the organization.





Dodson said morale is low and the office is like a “graveyard.”

“Within the agency, 99% say that this is terrible,” she said. “It is going to destroy the agency, destroy science, wreck families and wreck homes.”

Perdue admitted that there has been some concern about the move from staffers.

“There has been some concern all along, I don’t know about a backlash,” he said in response to a question about concerned ERS workers. “They have been very vocal obviously. But anytime you make change and you move people’s cheese, there’s always anxiety. We believe when people are in these locations, whether it is here in the RTP area or it’s in the Indianapolis area, (or) Kansas City, Missouri ... people are going to discover a great quality of life, just like you know here.”

In North Carolina, government workers have expressed similar concerns about the state Division of Motor Vehicles’ plans to move out of Raleigh and into Rocky Mount. That move is happening partly because of decisions in the legislature, and the state Senate’s budget proposal would move the Department of Health and Human Services out of Raleigh as well.

In the case of the DMV relocation, more than half of workers at the agency’s Raleigh headquarters who responded to a question about their plans if the agency moves to Rocky Mount said they would look for another job, The News & Observer previously reported.

Reaction in Congress

U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said last month he is a supporter of the USDA’s relocation efforts and applauded the agency for considering his home state.





“It’s a testament to North Carolina’s agriculture industry and our public university system that the Research Triangle is among the three finalists for the relocation of ERS and NIFA,” Tillis said in a letter to the USDA. “Since it was first announced, I have supported USDA’s plans to bring federal resources closer to stakeholders. I applaud USDA for considering North Carolina and I will continue to support USDA as it makes a final decision.”

But there has also been some push back from the U.S. House about the USDA relocations.

The House Agriculture Committee is holding a hearing this week to discuss the potential relocation of the offices. Additionally, an appropriations bill allocated $87.8 million for the ERS’s budget, but that bill also included language that would forbid those funds from being used to relocate the ERS, The New York Times reported.

This is the second government office that North Carolina has publicly competed for in the past year. Last year, Raleigh attempted to land the new U.S. Army Futures Command Center, an Army headquarters assigned the development of new missiles, cannons, tanks and aircraft for modern warfare. That would’ve brought about 500 staffers, but Raleigh narrowly lost out to Austin, Texas, for the expansion.

North Carolina put incentives on the table, specifically an offer of three years’ worth of free rent for office space on N.C. State University’s Centennial Campus, in its unsuccessful bid for the Army office. It’s unclear at the moment whether incentives will play a part in the USDA relocation, and the state’s Commerce Department has declined to comment about the recruitment of the USDA offices.

Around 136 locations across 35 states expressed interest in the USDA offices after the original request for qualification was put out by the USDA."
Justice Department does not comply with court order to release transcripts of Michael Flynn’s conversations with Russian ambassador,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol D.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Federal prosecutors on Friday declined to make public transcripts of recorded conversations between Michael Flynn and Russia’s ambassador to the United States in December 2016, despite a judge’s order.

In a court filing Friday, the Justice Department wrote that it did not rely on such recordings to establish Flynn’s guilt or determine a recommendation for his sentencing.

Prosecutors also failed to release an unredacted version of portions of the Mueller report related to Flynn that the judge had ordered be made public.

Flynn, who served briefly as President Trump’s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and he cooperated with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. He is awaiting sentencing.

The government’s unusual response came after U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in Washington ordered earlier in May that the Justice Department make public various materials related to the case, including transcripts of any audio recordings of Flynn, such as his conversations with Russian officials.

[Judge orders public release of what Michael Flynn said in call to Russian ambassador]

Prosecutors provided one item that Sullivan ordered be released: a transcript of a voice mail left by an attorney for Trump, much of which had already appeared in Mueller’s report. It is unclear how the judge will react to the government’s noncompliance with other elements of his order. Late last year, Sullivan postponed Flynn’s sentencing after angrily lambasting the former national security adviser for his actions, saying, “Arguably, you sold your country out.”

While Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak were described in Mueller’s report and in court documents, the exact words the two men used have not been revealed. U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the existence of recordings, which are classified.

Sullivan made clear he wanted the full transcript of Flynn’s calls to be shared with the public, although he did not provide his reasoning. The Justice Department’s response appeared to duck that order.

Prosecutors Brandon L. Van Grack of the Justice Department’s national security division, who was formerly on Mueller’s team, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Curtis of Washington provided little explanation as to why they were not turning over the transcripts but indicated that the judge had asked for material that was not relevant to Flynn’s eventual sentencing.

In a single line addressing Sullivan’s order, prosecutors wrote that the government “is not relying on any other recordings, of any person, for purposes of establishing the defendant’s guilt or determining his sentence, nor are there any other recordings that are part of the sentencing record.”

Sullivan’s request was atypical, some legal experts said, in that he demanded the release of classified records that prosecutors did not use to prove Flynn’s guilt.

Still, some former prosecutors said the government’s response was also notably spare.

“I’m sure they spent a ton of time thinking about how to do this — to protect intelligence equities, to protect their case, to try not to annoy the judge, to balance all those interests,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney in Michigan.

She noted that although there was no public indication that prosecutors had filed additional material under seal, it was possible that they did.

“If they’re simply trying to avoid the order by sidestepping it and saying ‘it’s not necessary to your sentencing decision,’ judges tend not to be satisfied with such a response,” she added.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington declined to comment.

The transcripts of the Flynn-Kisylak calls would provide a rare glimpse into the power of American surveillance to capture the private discussions of foreign emissaries — and an intimate look at a budding relationship between a top Russian official and one of the president-elect’s most trusted lieutenants in the weeks before Trump took office.

Flynn’s lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador made him the shortest-serving national security adviser in U.S. history: He spent just 24 days in the prestigious White House job.

Sullivan ordered the transcripts of Flynn’s conversations released two weeks ago after The Washington Post filed a motion seeking the release of redacted and sealed documents in the case. The Post argued that the public deserved to know more about the Trump adviser’s role in key events and the information he shared with investigators.

As part of his order, Sullivan had also given the government until Friday to release an unredacted version of portions of Mueller’s report dealing with Flynn.

In declining to release that, prosecutors wrote that the “limited remaining redactions pertain to sourcing of information, such as references to grand jury subpoenas.”

They provided no explanation other than to say that “all of the information in the Report that the defendant provided to the Special Counsel’s Office has been unredacted, as has all of the information in the Report that others provided about the defendant.”

The one item that the Justice Department made public on Sullivan’s order was a full transcript of a voice mail that John Dowd, a private attorney for Trump, left for Flynn lawyer Robert Kelner in November 2017.

Most of the voice mail was quoted in Mueller’s report, which described a message left by a personal counsel to Trump for a Flynn attorney after the former national security adviser began to cooperate with investigators. The special counsel scrutinized the message as part of his investigation into whether Trump sought to obstruct the Russia investigation.

The Trump counsel was Dowd, according to people familiar with the episode.

In the voice mail to Kelner, Dowd described himself as “sympathetic.”

“I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms,” he said, adding that if “there’s information that implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security issue.”

“So you know, ...we need some kind of heads up,” he added. “Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can, without you having to give up any...confidential information....remember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.”

In a statement Friday, Dowd said there was never anything improper about his contact with Flynn’s lawyer and that he had never tried to discourage Flynn’s cooperation with the government.

“This is clearly a baseless, political document designed to smear and damage the reputation of counsel and innocent people,” Dowd said of the special counsel report.

"Schiff says impeachment 'is destined for failure,' calls GOP 'cult of the president's personality'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-calls-gop-the-cult-of-the-presidents-personality-hints-potential-impeachment-could-fail-without-their-support,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""is destined for failure"" without Republican support, while blasting the party as “the cult of the president’s personality"" and stating that he is actually against ""putting the country"" through impeachment proceedings.

Schiff, on ABC News’ “This Week,” said that while he believes House Democrats could impeach the president, the move would likely fail, due to a lack of support from Republicans in the House and Senate.

NADLER: THERE 'CERTAINLY IS' JUSTIFICATION TO IMPEACH TRUMP

""I think we're going to do what is right for the country, and at this point, the speaker has not reached the conclusion, and I haven't either that it's the best for the country to put us through an impeachment proceeding that we know will, is, destined for failure in the Senate,"" Schiff said.

Schiff added that the president's ""conduct qualifies"" as ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" but said: ""at the same time, we have to recognize that the reality — that one party, the Republican Party, has turned itself into the cult of the president’s personality and is not likely to act consistent with its constitutional obligations.""

Schiff added, however, that if Trump ""continues to stonewall"" Congress, and ""demonstrate his unfitness for office,"" congressional Democrats could move forward.

""There may be little additional cost to going through that process, even if unsuccessful in the Senate,"" Schiff said. ""But we're not there yet and I think if it is a close call, close calls go against putting the country through that.""

Schiff’s comments come as rank-and-file congressional Democrats have ramped up their calls for impeachment, following a rare public statement by Special Counsel Robert Mueller last week, who announced it was “not an option” for his team of prosecutors to charge the president with a crime due to longstanding Justice Department policy.

Mueller detailed the findings in his probe, maintaining that there was “not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” with regard to whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.

But Mueller did not mince words on his inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice.

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”

Mueller explained the longstanding Justice Department policy, which states that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, and thus said “charging the president was not an option we could consider.”

Mueller added that “it would be unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”

TRUMP BLASTS MUELLER AS 'HIGHLY CONFLICTED,' CALLS IMPEACHMENT A 'DIRTY, FILTHY, DISGUSTING WORD'

But Mueller said that while the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion blocks a president from indictment while in office, “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing.”

Some on the left took that comment as a green light to ramp up talks about impeachment proceedings against the president.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also compared Mueller's remarks to an ""impeachment referral,"" and said, ""We need to start impeachment proceedings. It's our constitutional obligation.""

Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who is also running for president, said now that Mueller's job is done, ""Impeachment hearings should begin tomorrow.""



House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose committee would oversee impeachment proceedings, said that there ""certainly is"" justification to begin impeachment, but said it was critical to first gain the support fo the American people.

“Impeachment is a political act, and you cannot impeach a president if the American people will not support it,” said Nadler, D-N.Y. “The American people, right now, do not support it because they do not know the story. They don’t know the facts.”

Nadler added: “We have to get the facts out. We have to hold a series of hearings, we have to hold the investigations.”

But despite growing calls from rank-and-file Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has tread lightly on the topic, vowing to investigate allegations against the president, but stopping short of calling to begin impeachment proceedings.

Pelosi, this week, also said that Democrats “want to do what’s right and what gets results.”

“We’re legislating, we’re investigating and we’re litigating,” Pelosi said. “Everybody wants justice, everybody wants the president to be held accountable.”

But House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., despite Pelosi’s resistance to the idea, said Sunday he feels Democrats have “already begun” impeachment proceedings.

“We’ve got all these committees doing their work, we’re having hearings, we’ve already won two court cases and there are other cases that are still to be determined, so why should we get out in front of this process?” Clyburn said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“It’s kind of interesting to me when you talk to people and ask them what they think we ought to do,” he added. “They agree with what we’re doing, it’s just that, emotionally, they would like to see something done and see it done quicker.”

Trump, though, blasted the idea as a “scam.”

“I don’t see how they can,” Trump said Thursday. “It’s a dirty, filthy, disgusting word, impeach. It’s high crimes – there was no high crime. So how do you impeach?”

The White House also has ignored the discussion, and seized only on Mueller's move to announce the official conclusion of the Russia probe. Mueller, last week, said the investigation was officially complete, his office would close, and said he was resigning from the Justice Department to return to private life.

But even without launching official impeachment proceedings, congressional Democrats are leading several high-profile Trump-focused investigations. The House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee potential impeachment proceedings, is investigating the administration’s handling of Mueller’s report, and even voted to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena requiring that he turn over an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, and its underlying evidence and documents. The president, in turn, asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee, Oversight Committee, Ways and Means Committee and Financial Services Committee are all investigating the president and have aggressively sought his financial statements and documents for their probes, as well as testimony from high-profile Trump administration officials.

Thus far, the White House has directed the officials to defy their subpoenas to appear before Congress, and the president has vowed to block “all” subpoenas.

But Republicans, like House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., are shifting their focus to Barr’s review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Barr appointed U.S. attorney from Connecticut John Durham to lead an investigation into the FBI’s original Russia probe, and alleged misconduct related to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, as well as the FBI’s use of informants against the Trump campaign in 2016.

“It’s time for us to find out how this started and go from there,” Collins said on “Fox News Sunday.”"

"Local business to pay more than $38,000 after Department of Labor investigation",https://www.wjhg.com,[],,,,https://www.wjhg.com/content/news/Local-business-to-pay-more-than-38000-after-Department-of-Labor-investigation-510780171.html,"A local company will have to pay more than $38,000 in back wages to 78 people after investigation by the United States Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division.

WHD said By The Sea Resorts Inc., based in Panama City Beach, violated overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act and labor provisions of the H-2B visa program.

WHD said $7,304 in back wages were found as a result of FLSA violations, while $31,209 in back wages were found for H-2B violations. They say By The Sea Resorts Inc. also had to pay a penalty of $12,695.

WHD said By The Sea Resorts Inc. manages resorts and restaurants in the Panama City Beach area including Beachbreak, Legacy, Shalimar Retreat Center, Sugar Sands, Chateau, and Ocean Breeze.

Investigators found By The Sea Resorts Inc. hired 117 Jamaican employees to work as housekeepers under the H-2B visa program. WHD said the business violated the H-2B provisions by putting those employees in jobs not listed on the temporary employment certification they submitted, such as front desk personnel, dishwashers, and bartenders, but paying them as housekeepers.

WHD also said By The Sea Resorts Inc. also automatically took time away from the workers' time cards for meals even if they didn't take a break.

""Employers seeking H-2B workers must abide by all of the program's requirements, including placing those workers only in occupations listed in their employment certifications,"" Wage and Hour District Director Daniel White said. ""The U.S. Department of Labor will continue to safeguard American jobs and level the playing field for law-abiding employers. We encourage employers to contact the Wage and Hour Division by phone, online, or to attend any of our many outreach events for assistance and to learn more about their responsibilities.""
