Trump says it would be ‚Äòappropriate‚Äô to talk to Barr about possible Biden probe,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-it-would-be-appropriate-to-talk-to-barr-about-possible-biden-probe,"President Trump said Friday that it would be ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù for him to talk to Attorney General William Barr about opening an investigation into former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

‚ÄúCertainly it would be an appropriate thing to speak to him about, but I have not done that as of yet. ... It could be a very big situation,‚Äù Trump told Politico.

GIULIANI CANCELS UKRAINE TRIP, SAYS HE'D BE 'WALKING INTO A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ENEMIES OF THE US'

Trump made his remarks after his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said he would be traveling to Ukraine to urge the incoming Ukrainian government to look into several probes that may prove ""very, very helpful"" to the Trump White House as it looks to prove it was Democrats who improperly conspired with foreign governments, not the Trump campaign.

One of those investigations pertains to allegations that Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in order to take the heat off the prosecutor's probe into a company that employed his son, Hunter, as a board member.

Another such investigation concerns evidence that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton campaign may have worked with Ukrainians to illegally help Clinton by revealing damaging information about then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

However, Giuliani said Friday evening on ""Fox News @ Night"" that he will not be traveling as planned, saying he believed he would be ""walking into a group of people that are enemies of the president, and in some cases, enemies of the United States and in one case, an already convicted person who has been found to be involved in assisting the Democrats with the 2016 investigation.‚Äù

Giuliani said his decisions had nothing to do with the 2020 election, but Giuliani had faced fierce pushback from Democrats, who accused the president of ""asking a foreign government to investigate his political rival.""

On Friday, Trump told Politico that the only reason the Biden controversy wasn‚Äôt a full-blown scandal yet is that Biden is a Democrat.

‚ÄúBecause he‚Äôs a Democrat,‚Äù Trump said, the revelations had about ‚Äúone-hundredth‚Äù the impact as it would have if Biden ‚Äúwere a Republican.‚Äù

CLINTON-UKRAINE COLLUSION ALLEGATIONS 'BIG' AND 'INCREDIBLE,' WILL BE REVIEWED, TRUMP SAYS

It isn‚Äôt the first time Trump has weighed in on the controversies linking Democrats to Ukraine. Asked last month by Fox News host Sean Hannity whether Americans need to see the results of Ukraine's ongoing investigation into whether officials in that country worked with the Clinton team, Trump replied, ""I think we do.""

""It sounds like big stuff, very interesting with Ukraine,‚Äù he said.

But any push from Trump to get the Justice Department to investigate political opponents is likely to face intense resistance from Democrats.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., last week sent a letter to the Department of Justice‚Äôs inspector general demanding he investigates whether the White House had urged Barr to investigate President Trump‚Äôs political opponents -- after Barr appeared to demur on the question somewhat in congressional testimony.

‚ÄúIn response to my questions during the [Senate Judiciary] hearing, Attorney General Barr proved unable or unwilling to state whether he had been directed to open investigations at the request or suggestion of the President or other White House officials -- an alarming response that strikes at the very heart of the rule of law and threatens to undermine the longstanding independence of the Justice Department,‚Äù she said in a letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

But Buttigieg came back with his own zinger, slying dinging the 72-year-old president‚Äôs age, saying the outdated reference was a ‚Äúgenerational thing.‚Äù

Trump told Politico Friday that ‚ÄúAlfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States,‚Äù when he was asked in a phone interview what he thought of the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.

Asked later about his new moniker, Buttigieg, 37, said he had ‚Äúto Google‚Äù the reference to the mascot of a humor magazine launched in 1952.

‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs just a generational thing. I didn‚Äôt get the reference. It‚Äôs kind of funny, I guess,‚Äù said Buttigieg.

Trump administration moves to crack down on illegal immigrants in public housing,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-pushes-to-crack-down-on-illegal-immigrants-in-public-housing,"The Trump administration on Friday moved forward with a proposed rule to make it harder for illegal immigrants to access federally subsidized housing -- the latest crackdown by the administration on immigrants who use public assistance.

The rule, proposed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and posted in the Federal Register, would require that those seeking public housing would be subject to verification of their immigration status. Only families in which every member is either a citizen or a legal resident would qualify for federally subsidized housing. Currently families where at least one person is either a citizen or green card holder can get federal assistance, even if other family members are not.

BIDEN BACKS HEALTH CARE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, SAYS 'WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION' TO PROVIDE IT

The administration says that regulations ‚Äúpresently excuse individuals from submitting documentation if they do not contend to having eligible immigration status. This results in no actual determination of immigration status being made.‚Äù The rule would also require current participants who have not previously proven their eligibility to do so at their next evaluation of their need for public assistance.

An agency analysis, reported by The Washington Post, found that approximately 25,000 households, representing about 108,000 people, now live in subsidized housing with at least one person who would be ineligible.

Among those ‚Äúmixed-status‚Äù households, 70 percent are legally eligible for benefits -- approximately 76,000 people including 55,000 children. The majority live in California, Texas and New York, the Post reported.

‚ÄúHUD expects that fear of the family being separated would lead to prompt evacuation by most mixed households,‚Äù the agency‚Äôs analysis said. ‚ÄúTemporary homelessness could arise for a household, if they are unable to find alternative housing.‚Äù

BORDER PATROL APPREHENDS 'LARGEST GROUP' OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NEAR US BORDER YET

HUD Secretary Ben Carson defended the proposal this week, telling Fox Business‚Äô Stuart Varney that illegal immigrants are limiting assistance that could go to ‚Äúlegitimate American citizens.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have a long list of people we can only serve right now one in four of the people who are looking for assistance from the government,"" he said. ‚ÄúSo obviously we want to get those people taken care of. And we also want to abide by the laws.‚Äù

An administration official told The Daily Caller, which first reported the proposal last month, that ""we need to take care of our citizens.""

‚ÄúBecause of past loopholes in HUD guidance, illegal aliens were able to live in free public housing desperately needed by so many of our own citizens. As illegal aliens attempt to swarm our borders, we‚Äôre sending the message that you can‚Äôt live off of American welfare on the taxpayers‚Äô dime,"" the official said.

However, the HUD analysis reportedly found that that the rule could cost up to an additional $227 million a year because mixed-status families would then receive higher subsidies.

The proposal is likely to face fierce opposition from Democrats. On Friday, 13 Democratic members of Congress from New York said in a letter to Carson that it would ‚Äúneedlessly inflict hardship‚Äù on families.

‚ÄúYour approach represents a major shift from current HUD policy and by design makes it more difficult for families to have access to assistance for which they would otherwise be eligible,"" the letter says.

It is the latest proposed crackdown by the administration on the use of public assistance by immigrants. Reuters reported last week that the administration is considering making it easier to deport legal permanent residents who have used public benefits.

A draft regulation, which is still subject to change, would reportedly allow for the deportation of some permanent residents who have used certain public benefits within five years of admission into the U.S. Those benefits include Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), Section 8 housing vouchers, certain Medicaid benefits; and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).

Trump backers applaud Warren in heart of MAGA country,https://www.politico.com,"['Alex Thompson', 'Marc Caputo', 'Burgess Everett']",05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/11/warren-west-virginia-2020-1317611,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks at the Kermit Fire & Rescue Headquarters Station on Friday in Kermit, West Virginia. | Craig Hudson/Charleston Gazette-Mail via AP 2020 elections Trump backers applaud Warren in heart of MAGA country The liberal firebrand draws nods and even a few cheers on a trip through rural West Virginia.

KERMIT, W. Va. ‚Äî It was a startling spectacle in the heart of Trump country: At least a dozen supporters of the president ‚Äî some wearing MAGA stickers ‚Äî nodding their heads, at times even clapping, for liberal firebrand Elizabeth Warren.

The sighting alone of a Democratic presidential candidate in this town of fewer than 400 people ‚Äî in a county where more than four in five voters cast their ballot for Trump in 2016 ‚Äî was unusual. Warren‚Äôs team was apprehensive about how she‚Äôd be received.

Story Continued Below

About 150 people gathered at the Kermit Fire & Rescue Headquarters Station to hear the Massachusetts senator and former Harvard professor talk about what she wants to do to fight the opioid epidemic. Trump-supporting college students in baggy t-shirts, housewives in pearls, and the fire chief dressed in uniform joined liberal retirees wearing rainbow ‚ÄúPersist‚Äù shirts and teachers with six-figure student loan debt.

COUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.

Kermit is one of the epicenters of the opioid addiction epidemic. The toll is visible. The community center is shuttered. Fire trucks are decades old. When Warren asked people at the beginning of the event to raise their hands if they knew somebody who‚Äôs been ‚Äúcaught in the grips of addiction,‚Äù most hands went up.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here today,‚Äù she said.

Warren entered the room from behind a large American flag draped in the station. Roving around a circle of people seated in fold-out chairs, she tried to strike a tone equal parts empathy and fury, while avoiding pity. She went full prarie populist, telling people their pain and suffering was caused by predatory pharmaceutical barons.

The 63-year-old fire chief, Wilburn ‚ÄúTommy‚Äù Preece, warned Warren and her team beforehand that the area was ‚ÄúTrump country‚Äù and to not necessarily expect a friendly reception. But he also told her that the town would welcome anyone, of any party, who wanted to address the opioid crisis. Preece was the first responder to a reported overdose two years ago only to discover that the victim was his younger brother Timmy, who died.

Preece said after the event that he voted for Trump and that the president has revitalized the area economically. But he gave Warren props for showing up.

‚ÄúShe done good,‚Äù he said.

Others agreed.

LeeAnn Blankenship, a 38-year-old coach and supervisor at a home visitation company who grew up in Kermit and wore a sharp pink suit, said she may now support Warren in 2020 after voting for Trump in 2016.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a good ol‚Äô country girl like anyone else,‚Äù she said of Warren, who grew up in Oklahoma. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs earned where she is, it wasn‚Äôt given to her. I respect that.‚Äù

But Warren didn‚Äôt come to rural West Virginia primarily in search of votes. The tiny state likely won‚Äôt decide the nomination, and is all but certain to back Trump in the general election.

Instead, Warren was here to try to send a message that she‚Äôs serious about tackling the problems of remote communities like this one.

The ‚Äúopioid war‚Äù is a medical problem rather than a behavioral or law enforcement one, Warren argued. Her plan is modeled on the government‚Äôs response in 1990 to the HIV/AIDS crisis, as she explained in a Medium post earlier this week.

‚ÄúBut we got a second problem in this country and it‚Äôs greed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPeople didn‚Äôt get addicted all on their own, they got a lot of corporate help. They got a lot of help from corporations that made big money off getting people addicted and keeping them addicted.‚Äù

Kermit was a subject of a Pulitzer Prize winning series in 2016 that found drug wholesalers provided a single pharmacy in the 392-person town with 9 million hydrocodone pills over just two years. Warren's plan would dole out $100 billion over the next decade to states, cities, and nonprofits, with extra money going to cities and counties with the highest levels of overdoses.

‚ÄúRight here in Mingo County, people are on the front lines of this opioid epidemic and this is a way to draw attention to the urgency of the moment,‚Äù she told reporters after the town hall.

Warren‚Äôs four-stop tour Friday and Saturday took her from the small towns of Kermit and Chillicothe, Ohio to Columbus, Ohio and Cincinnati. The latter's narcotics problem is so bad that the local paper assigned a reporter to the heroin beat.

Warren‚Äôs approach to the opioid crisis ‚Äî which calls for treating victims and punishing perpetrators ‚Äî largely mirrors her response to the financial crisis, when she called for jailing bankers and providing mass assistance for homeowners.

Her trip is the latest iteration of her campaign strategy to distinguish as the most substantive and well-prepared candidate in the sprawling Democratic field. Each time Warren rolls out a policy proposal ‚Äî almost invariably with the theme of curbing corporate power and Washington corruption ‚Äî her team schedules on-the-ground events to draw further attention.

When she announced her plan to break up big technology companies, Warren went to the South by Southwest tech conference and then to Long Island City, New York where Amazon had planned to build a headquarters. She whistle-stopped through Tennessee, Alabama, and the Mississippi delta after she unveiled a housing proposal aimed at closing the racial wealth gap.

A Republican protest ‚Äî or ‚ÄúTrump support rally‚Äù ‚Äî was organized a few hundred yards away from Warren's event in Kermit. But inside the fire station was remarkably devoid of partisanship, even if the topic was political.

Asked late Friday what stuck with her from the visit, Warren said it was the moment when she asked who had been personally affected by the opioid crisis and almost everyone‚Äôs hands went up.

‚ÄúI was in the town where the pain of that decision by the government to not interfere was felt hard,‚Äù she said.

As Warren posed for selfies after the town hall, several people pressed notes into her hand that she read later in the car. ""Help our town of Kermit, West Virginia any way you can to help us be able to reduce the drug abuse,"" read one letter.

‚ÄúA lot of people told me,‚ÄòYou‚Äôre in the reddest of the red here,'‚Äù Warren said. But ""I like being here."""
Trump increased his tariffs on China‚Äîhere's what they are and how they work,https://www.cnbc.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/11/what-trumps-tariffs-on-china-are-and-how-they-work.html,"President Donald Trump speaks during a press conference with China's President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on November 9, 2017.

President Donald Trump has heightened tensions with China by escalating his tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10% to 25%.

As a tool of national policy, tariffs had long been fading into history, a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts came to see as harmful to all nations involved. Yet more than any other modern president, Trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool ‚Äî against Europe, Canada and other key trading partners but especially against China, the second-largest economy after the U.S.

The Trump administration asserts, and many independent analysts agree, that Beijing has deployed predatory tactics to try to give Chinese companies an edge in such advanced technologies as artificial intelligence, robotics and electric vehicles. Beijing's tactics, the U.S. contends, include hacking into U.S. companies' computers to steal trade secrets, forcing foreign companies to turn over sensitive technology in exchange for access to China's markets and unfairly subsidizing Chinese companies.

Trump has also complained angrily about America's gaping trade deficit with China for which he blames weak and naive negotiating by previous U.S. administrations.

Last July, Trump began gradually imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. After Friday's increase, the administration is now imposing 25% tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods. Beijing has counterpunched by taxing $110 billion of American products, focusing on agricultural goods, notably soybeans, in a calculated effort to inflict pain on Trump supporters in the farm belt.

Here's a look at what tariffs are and how they work:"
Trump hits retweet button 60 times in massive Twitter spree,https://nypost.com,['May'],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://nypost.com/2019/05/11/trump-hits-retweet-button-60-times-in-massive-twitter-spree/,"President Trump went on a retweeting spree Saturday morning, sharing other conservative voices more than 60 times.

The tweets covered many of the president‚Äôs passions, ranging from border security to criticism of Democrats. Trump retweeted media figures like Geraldo Rivera and pols including Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).

The president also retweeted a few of his own previous tweets, including a Friday statement urging, ‚ÄúBuild your products in the United States and there are NO TARIFFS!‚Äù

The spree appeared to conclude just before 10 a.m., when Trump penned a fresh post. ‚ÄúSuch an easy way to avoid Tariffs? Make or produce your goods and products in the good old USA. It‚Äôs very simple!‚Äù

The statement came after US and Chinese officials on Friday ended trade negotiations without making a deal and as a 25 percent import tax on $200 billion in Chinese goods went into effect."
"DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-found-carter-page-fisa-extensions-were-illegally-obtained-joe-digenova-says,"The Justice Department inspector general has determined the three Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained, attorney Joe diGenova said on Thursday.

In an investigation that began last year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into Trump's campaign.

The inspector general inquiry is expected to be completed in either late May or June, and diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Democrats on Capitol Hill are working overtime to investigate and discredit President Trump.

""They are doing that as a diversionary tactic away from the inevitable conclusions of the DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who, by the way, we have learned has concluded that the final three FISA extensions were illegally obtained,"" diGenova said on Fox Business. ""The only question now is whether or not the first FISA was illegally obtained.""

He pointed to memos, obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation, that suggest the FBI might have misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the first warrant application about an unverified dossier.

Horowitz ""apparently, as a result of those disclosures ... which he was unaware of ‚Äî the bureau hid those memos from Horowitz ‚Äî as a result of that they're doing additional work on the first FISA. It may be that all four FISAs will have been obtained illegally,"" diGenova said.

The dossier, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

The memos obtained by Citizens United, and shared with the Washington Examiner, show Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11 and admitted he was encouraged by a client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

Senate and House investigators told The Hill they too were unaware of the documents, which were given to and redacted by the FBI, and one member of Congress referred the memos to the Justice Department inspector general. ""They tried to hide a lot of documents from us during our investigation, and it usually turns out there‚Äôs a reason for it,"" House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

A memo from the House Intelligence Committee in February 2018 alleged Steele was paid over $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS to ""obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia."" The memo also said the FBI never informed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of the dossier's Democratic benefactors or Steele's anti-Trump bias when it applied to spy on Page, who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller over his interactions with Russians but was never charged.

In a rebuttal to the House Intelligence GOP memo, Democrats argued the Justice Department and FBI ""met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement.""

In recent days top former officials at the FBI have defended their handling of the warrant applications. Former FBI Director James Comey said during a CNN town hall on Thursday that ‚Äúthe most important part‚Äù of the dossier was on ‚ÄúRussians coming for the American election,‚Äù which he asserted was ‚Äúconsistent with our other intelligence‚Äù and ‚Äútrue.‚Äù Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who acknowledged he ""wanted the burden on me to a significant degree"" in preparing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application paperwork, said it would have been ""gratuitous"" to name the U.S. persons ‚Äî the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC ‚Äî in the documents.

Both Comey and Baker said they are confident the bureau did nothing wrong in obtaining the warrants, although Baker admitted the inspector general makes him ""nervous.""

DiGenova appeared on Fox Business with his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing. She accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""hiding"" Comey's ""sins.""

DiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days.

He had been highly critical of Mueller's Russia investigation, claiming that Trump had been ""framed"" by the Justice Department and the FBI."
House Judiciary Committee Democrats introduce bill to hold presidents accountable for alleged crimes,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-judiciary-committee-dems-introduce-bill-to-pause-statute-of-limitations-hold-sitting-presidents-accountable-for-alleged-crimes,"House Judiciary Committee Democrats on Friday introduced a bill that would ensure presidents can be held accountable for alleged criminal conduct -- a direct swipe at the White House amid the heated battle over Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs report.

The legislation, introduced by committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. and committee members Reps. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., and Ted Deutch, D-Fla., would pause the statute of limitations for any alleged federal offenses committed by a sitting president, whether it was committed before or during the president‚Äôs term in office.

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO HOLD BARR IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER MUELLER FILES

""No person can be permitted to evade accountability for their actions just because they happen to be president,"" Nadler said in a statement on Friday. ""I have concerns with the Justice Department interpretation that a sitting president cannot be indicted, but if that is the policy, a president who commits a crime before or during their term in office, could exploit this loophole and avoid prosecution just because the statute of limitations has run out. This is unacceptable. The presidency is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.""

The Justice Department has a longstanding policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Swalwell said he disagreed with that legal opinion, and said Congress ‚Äúcan step up right now and change the law‚Äù to make sure ‚Äúno president can evade punishment just by running out the clock.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúPresident Trump is living proof of the urgent need to close this loophole.‚Äù

Most federal criminal offenses carry a five-year statute of limitations, according to the committee. The legislation would pause that limit to ensure a president who's not prosecuted while in office for an alleged crime can still be ‚Äúheld accountable.‚Äù

The introduction of the bill comes days after the committee voted to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena to provide the full and unredacted Mueller report and all underlying documents and evidence.

Barr released a version of the report last month, with limited redactions for sources and methods and grand jury material. Democrats in Congress are fighting for the release of the full report. Last month, Barr made a minimally-redacted version of the report available to certain members of Congress, including Nadler. Nadler, though, has not reviewed that version of the report.

MUELLER'S OPEN-ENDED REPORT COMPARED TO COMEY'S CLINTON SLAM: 'EQUALLY PROBLEMATIC'

Mueller's nearly two-year investigation found no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election. Mueller also led an inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice, but did not come to a conclusion on the matter. Barr, after reviewing the report, said the investigation did not find evidence sufficient to charge the president with an obstruction of justice offense.

Some congressional Democrats, though, argue that the report contained evidence of obstruction by Trump.

Amid the battle between the White House and the committee on Wednesday to obtain those documents responsive to the subpoena, the president asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect them from release.

It is unclear when the full House could vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt."

House Democrats issued subpoenas on Friday to force Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to release six years of President Trump's tax returns.

Democrats say the returns include information about Trump and his business dealings that is critical to their constitutional oversight duties. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., issued the subpoena after Mnuchin failed to comply with a request from House Democrats that he voluntarily turn over the returns.

""While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material. I sincerely hope that the Treasury Department will furnish the requested material in the next week so the committee can quickly begin its work,"" Neal said in a written statement.

Administration officials, including Mnuchin, insist the request is unreasonable and illegal. Democrats argue that Neal, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is legally allowed to request the tax returns of any private citizen ‚Äî citing a section of the tax code that states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" that information.

But Mnuchin rejected the request this week, telling Neal that he was relying on Department of Justice advice that the request ""lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.""

Trump has refused to comply with requests for his taxes since before he was elected, arguing that he is under audit and he does not believe he is legally required to disclose the information. ""There is no law,"" Trump said in April. ""While I'm under audit I won't do it.""

The IRS's Rettig told the House Appropriations Committee in April that there is no rule barring the release of tax returns if an individual is under audit.

Democrats say they are prepared for a lengthy court battle over the returns.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats have the legal authority to request Trump's taxes and must do so as part of their ongoing investigations.

This week, Pelosi cited a recent New York Times report that Trump reported more than $1 billion in losses between 1984 and 1993 as further reason to request his returns.

""It would be useful to see his tax returns,"" Pelosi said at an event sponsored by The Washington Post. ""The law says the administration 'shall' give the ‚Äî 'shall.' It doesn't say 'may, should, could, under certain circumstances.' It says 'shall' give those tax returns to the Ways and Means chairman."""
Secretary Pompeo to Meet With Putin as President Trump Seeks Better Russia Ties -- Again,http://time.com,"['Nick Wadhams', 'Ilya Arkhipov']",,,,http://time.com/5587644/pompeo-putin-trump-russia/,"U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo leaves for Moscow on Sunday, with President Donald Trump again calling for improved ties now that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has finished his investigation.

Pompeo will meet U.S. diplomats at the American Embassy in Moscow on Monday before continuing to Sochi for talks with President Vladimir Putin and other senior officials. The secretary has 48 hours ‚Äî the entire length of the trip ‚Äî to cram in discussions of disputes between the two nations, involving Ukraine, Venezuela and Syria and other issues, along with continued accusations of election interference.

With the Mueller inquiry wrapped up, Trump has returned to signaling his interest in improving U.S.-Russia ties, speaking with Putin for more than an hour last week and tweeting that there is ‚Äútremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia.‚Äù The two leaders had kept their distance as Mueller‚Äôs probe into the 2016 U.S. election and allegations of collusion between Trump‚Äôs campaign and Russia heated up.

‚ÄúClearly since the Mueller report came out, Trump is feeling unconstrained about what he‚Äôs wanted all along ‚Äî a new relationship with Moscow where all the bad issues get swept aside and the two leaders ‚Äòget down to business,‚Äù‚Äô said Andrew Weiss, the former director for Russian, Ukrainian, and Eurasian Affairs on the National Security Council who‚Äôs now a vice president at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

‚ÄúWhat that means in practice is really fuzzy because the agenda largely consists of issues where the U.S. and Russia are at loggerheads,‚Äù Weiss said.

Trump spoke with Putin briefly on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in Argentina in December. That meeting rekindled criticism of their summit last July in Helsinki, where the American president appeared to take Putin‚Äôs side over the conclusions of his own intelligence agencies when asked about evidence Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

Pompeo could use his trip to start laying the groundwork for a meeting between Trump and Putin on the sidelines of a Group of 20 forum in Japan set for late June. Such an encounter would still be fraught, especially since Trump has appeared reluctant to confront Putin on the meddling accusations, which the Mueller report reaffirmed.

‚ÄúThe Mueller report confirmed accusations of Russian meddling,‚Äù said Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a Kremlin-founded think tank. ‚ÄúThe report to some extent rehabilitates Trump but doesn‚Äôt rehabilitate Moscow at all. For Russia, nothing has really changed.‚Äù

A senior State Department official, speaking to reporters on Friday, said Pompeo would raise a range of topics, including continuing concerns about Russian election meddling, Moscow‚Äôs role in propping up Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the American desire for more sweeping arms control agreements that include countries like China, not just Russia and the U.S.

The official argued that U.S. policy is to seek a better relationship with Moscow while also acknowledging that Russia has been responsible for several acts of aggression on the world stage.

One challenge, as it‚Äôs been throughout Trump‚Äôs presidency, is that while he may want better ties with Russia, relations between the two countries have seldom been worse and show little prospect of improving.

Besides contesting support for Maduro, there is the issue of the U.S. withdrawal from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in February. The administration is also angry at Russia over its detention of 24 Ukrainian sailors in the Sea of Azov last November and the poisoning of a former spy in the U.K. last year. In addition, American businessman Michael Calvey remains under house arrest in Moscow over allegations of fraud, a charge he rejects.

The president‚Äôs latest tweet on Russia also highlighted the dissonant tone the Trump administration has struck toward the country. While Pompeo blamed Russia for Maduro‚Äôs refusal to leave power despite pressure from the U.S., Trump said after his call with Putin that the Russian leader wasn‚Äôt looking to ‚Äúget involved‚Äù in the crisis in Venezuela.

Trump‚Äôs calls will find a receptive audience. After the Mueller report came out, Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachyov urged the president to ‚Äútake the risk‚Äù and seize the opportunity to reset relations.

‚ÄúPutin has always bet personally on Trump, with whom he has a way of bonding to the point of manipulation,‚Äù said Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat and foreign policy analyst in Moscow. ‚ÄúPutin knows Trump likes him, while his administration does not. In Trump he trusts.‚Äù

"After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‚Äòpreliminary‚Äô",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/05/10/after-outcry-usda-will-no-longer-require-scientists-label-research-preliminary/,"

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has dropped a requirement that peer-reviewed studies by staff scientists include a disclaimer that findings are ‚Äúpreliminary.‚Äù (Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images)

The Agriculture Department has dropped its demand that staff scientists label peer-reviewed research as ‚Äúpreliminary,‚Äù after angry protests followed a Washington Post story disclosing the policy.

But the latest guidelines, released on Wednesday, for internally reviewing science within the department raise additional questions about scientific integrity, said non-USDA researchers who inspected the guide.

Since July, the department required peer-reviewed studies to include a disclaimer, The Post reported last month. Some finalized reports came with a caveat ‚Äî these findings and conclusions are ‚Äúpreliminary‚Äù and have ‚Äúnot been formally disseminated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.‚Äù

USDA employees, editors of scientific journals and science advocates worried the disclaimer might be used to undercut scientists whose research was at odds with Trump administration policies. They also were concerned the language was confusing and potentially misleading.

The scientific community, generally speaking, does not expect peer-reviewed journals to publish preliminary results. The disclaimer, though enacted only as a temporary policy, appeared in several published articles, including a report on the best practices for capturing wild pigs.

This week, acting USDA chief scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young released a memo that replaced the July policy. It requires the following language when disclaimers are necessary: ‚ÄúThe findings and conclusions in this [publication/presentation/blog/report] are those of the author(s) and should not be construed to represent any official USDA or U.S. Government determination or policy.‚Äù

Brooks Hanson, vice president of science at the American Geophysical Union, an organization that includes soil and agricultural researchers, said the updated disclaimer is a ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù change.

‚ÄúThe previous wording that required scientists to label their research submitted for publication as ‚Äòpreliminary‚Äô would downplay the significance and importance of their work and cause confusion among readers,‚Äù Hanson said. The new language is closer to other disclaimers required by federal departments. ‚ÄúIt is a positive development that USDA seemed to listen to the criticism and feedback.‚Äù

Still, he added, even this language may not be needed: ‚ÄúMany journals have this statement on their mastheads. This expectation, that an article represents the views of the authors only, is indeed the standard.‚Äù

Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a D.C.-based organization that advocates for scientists, said that ‚Äúremoving ‚Äòpreliminary‚Äô from the disclaimer is a step in the right direction, but there still may be unnecessary obstacles preventing agency researchers from publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals.‚Äù

Not every study published by a USDA scientist is required to have this disclaimer. Some research agencies at USDA, including the Agricultural Research Service, the Economic Research Service, the National Agricultural Statistics Service and the Forest Service have ‚Äúagency-specific policies‚Äù that determine when a disclaimer is appropriate, said William Trenkle, the USDA scientific integrity officer.

Others, such as the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have been encouraged to follow the new guidelines.

Those outline when disclaimers are needed and also describe the department‚Äôs internal review process before scientists can publish results in journals. It lists several ‚Äúflags‚Äù that may trigger additional scrutiny. Some flags, under the umbrella of ‚Äúprominent issues,‚Äù include ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù scientific advancements, the potential to attract media attention, and results that could influence trade or change USDA policy.

Members of other USDA agencies, including the office of the chief scientist, the communications office and the office of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, can request ‚Äúcorrections‚Äù and ‚Äúchanges,‚Äù if the scientific publication falls under the category of ‚Äúprominent issues‚Äù or policy implications.

‚ÄúIt is the responsibility of reviewers at all management levels to identify whether the manuscript contains prominent issues,‚Äù Trenkle said.

If USDA or other federal ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù request alterations based on these issues, then study authors should return ‚Äúthe REVISED PUBLICATION‚Äù for ‚ÄúACCEPTANCE of the CHANGES and/or RESPONSE to comments,‚Äù the guideline says [capitalization is in the original].

Trenkle said the policy conforms with the USDA‚Äôs scientific integrity rules and ‚Äúhelps to ensure that USDA scientists communicate their scientific findings objectively without political interference or inappropriate influence.‚Äù

But Susan Offutt, who was the administrator of the Economic Research Service under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the guide twists internal review ‚Äúinto a process by which policy officials get the final say on content.‚Äù Because researchers at the Economic Research Service publish statistics to aid policymakers, ‚Äújust about any output‚Äù from that agency could be flagged, she said.

USDA‚Äôs ‚Äúinterests apparently concern consistency with prevailing policy,‚Äù Offutt said, ‚Äúnot the public‚Äôs access to the best, unbiased science and analysis.‚Äù

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Taking the stage in Rovaniemi, Finland, Monday afternoon, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a stern warning to Russia and China: respect American interests in the Arctic, or face the consequences.

Speaking at the opening session of this week's Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting, an intergovernmental forum for the eight nations with territory in the Arctic, Pompeo's speech marked a stark departure from the traditional conciliatory remarks of past secretaries on environmental protection and cultural collaborations.

""We're entering a new age of strategic engagement in the Arctic,"" Pompeo cautioned to an audience of diplomats, ""complete with new threats to the Arctic and its real estate, and to all of our interests in the region."" He went on to detail the dangers of Chinese investment and Russian military mobilization to US national interest in the region.

There's just one problem. Russia and China aren't Arctic enemy No. 1 -- we are.

For the first time since the Arctic Council was established in 1996, the ministerial meeting of the eight Arctic states ended without an official joint declaration . The apparent culprit? American climate-change denial. Despite a reported last-minute effort to negotiate a compromise, the Trump administration refused to sign any declaration that made mention of climate change or the Paris Agreement, according to a report in Arctic Today . (The administration denied that was the case, though foreign diplomats alluded to an inability to reach a compromise.)

As each foreign minister from the eight Arctic countries rose to deliver their final statements in Finland, they made their disappointment in America clear.

Canada highlighted a "" terrifying "" report released last month on climate impacts in Canada; Finland praised the millions of children calling for world leaders to address the climate emergency, noting that each country present at the ministerial meeting has an undeniable responsibility to address climate change; and the Sami Council, an Indigenous Permanent Participant of the forum, lamented that climate change was like Lord Voldemort (from Harry Potter) -- it exists whether you mention it or not.

Secretary Pompeo was the only leader to not reference climate change, instead asserting that the Trump administration shares a deep commitment to environmental stewardship. The statement was met with eye rolls in Finland and jeering amongst Arctic researchers, according to colleagues who were in the room.

Such aggressive behavior by the US is not only a national embarrassment in an international forum known for its steadfast cooperation; it also puts the Arctic Council on a course of dangerous uncertainty, without a mandate for addressing the region's most perilous challenge.

The Arctic is warming at more than twice the rate of the global average , inflicting irreplaceable cultural loss, and putting the livelihoods of America's northernmost citizens in jeopardy. With projected costs to Alaska ranging from $3.3 to $6.7 billion between 2008 and 2030, according to the Alaska chapter of the fourth US National Climate Assessment (of which I was the review editor), the US cannot afford the deliberate scientific ignorance it has adopted.

This past December, the annual US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Arctic Report Card delivered a stark finding. Climate change is forcing an unprecedented transition on the Arctic region; as air and sea temperatures warm at record-breaking speeds, the Arctic has lost 95% of its oldest documented sea ice. Following the 2018 UN Special Report and the fourth US National Climate Assessment , the Arctic Report Card was only the latest installment in a protracted series of dire scientific warnings.

These trends have real and life-threatening consequences for the 4 million people that call the Arctic home -- including American citizens living in Alaska.

The Alaska Native villages of Shishmaref, Newtok, Kivalina, and Shaktoolik are all being forced to move because of flooding and erosion, leaving homes, histories, and hope for the future behind. Disappearing sea ice is making hunting and fishing more difficult for coastal villages across Alaska, causing fears of food insecurity during the Arctic's long winter months. And ice roads that carry freight, food, and equipment in the winter to Alaska's extractive industries in the high north are beginning to thaw.

The Trump administration's willful negligence of climate change, and its impact on the lives of America's northernmost citizens, is a far greater threat to our national interests than Chinese and Russian ambitions in the region combined.

Ultimately, the seven other Arctic countries will move forward to act on climate change without the US. Canada, Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and even Russia will commit resources for resilient infrastructure and adaptation to ensure the safety of their Arctic residents from the impacts we can no longer avoid.

Americans, alone, will be left out in the cold."
Justice Department seeks removal of Huawei‚Äôs lead defense lawyer,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ellen Nakashima', 'National Security Reporter', 'May At Pm']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-seeks-removal-of-huaweis-lead-defense-lawyer/2019/05/10/a3232d5a-6da4-11e9-be3a-33217240a539_story.html,"A Huawei store is seen May 10, 2019, in Shanghai.

(Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images)

Federal prosecutors are seeking the removal of the lead defense lawyer for a Chinese firm charged with bank fraud and sanctions violations, alleging he has a conflict of interest arising from his supervision of a ‚Äúsubstantially related‚Äù case while he served in a prior position as the Justice Department‚Äôs second-highest-ranking official.

James Cole, who was deputy attorney general from 2010 to 2015 in the Obama administration, heads the defense team for Huawei Technologies. The major Chinese telecom equipment-maker was indicted in January on charges of bank fraud, wire fraud, violations of Iran sanctions, and conspiracy to launder money and to obstruct justice.

[Justice Dept. charges Huawei with fraud, ratcheting up U.S.-China tensions]

The high-profile case has drawn much publicity as it is taking place against the backdrop of President Trump‚Äôs efforts to seal a trade deal with China and an attempt by his administration to keep Huawei out of the global 5G wireless networks on national security grounds.

In a redacted motion filed Friday in the Eastern District of New York, prosecutors argued that while Cole is defending Huawei, his work in the related investigation, which they did not disclose, ‚Äúcreates the real risk that he will breach his duty of confidentiality to the [Department of Justice] by relying on information he obtained while representing the department.‚Äù

Moreover, they said, ‚Äúthere is a risk that Cole will breach his duty of loyalty to the department by making arguments on behalf of the defendants that contradict positions he previously took while representing the DOJ.‚Äù

Neither Cole nor his attorney responded to a request for comment.

The move to disqualify is fairly unusual, but analysts note that if the government thinks there is a conflict of interest, prosecutors have an obligation to bring this concern to the court‚Äôs attention.

Cole, a partner at the Sidley Austin law firm, informed the Justice Department in January that he was representing Huawei. Later that month, the department informed Cole that he had a conflict of interest in the case, according to the motion.

In a follow-up meeting, Cole and representatives of the Justice Department and the FBI discussed the issue, and after giving Cole a one-day clearance, the government provided him with ‚Äúprivileged and classified‚Äù information ‚Äúin order to have a fulsome discussion,‚Äù prosecutors said.

In March, Cole declined to recuse himself, writing to the government that after carefully considering the material, he and his counsel ‚Äúwere unable to determine that I need to be disqualified.‚Äù

Later that month, he filed a motion to appear in court for Huawei. And at the first status conference, on April 4, the government said it would not oppose Cole‚Äôs motion for the time being. Last week, prosecutors asked the court to remove him.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a considerable decision to seek to disqualify not just any counsel in a major prosecution like this, but someone of Jim Cole‚Äôs pedigree as a former deputy attorney general who clearly has refused to recuse himself,‚Äù said David Laufman, a former senior Justice Department official who is now a partner at the law firm of Wiggin and Dana. ‚ÄúBut the government clearly feels strongly about its motion and is prepared to litigate its merits.‚Äù

While the deputy attorney general oversees a broad range of the department‚Äôs most significant cases, he or she does not typically get involved in the day-to-day running of investigations.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to determine whether the government has a valid argument because of the classified nature of the underlying matter,‚Äù said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan who teaches law at the University of Michigan. ‚ÄúThe court will have to review his response and the underlying documents to make a determination.‚Äù"
Industry group tied to EPA air chief dissolves,https://www.politico.com,['Zack Colman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/10/epa-air-chief-3238271,"The connections between Hunton, UARG, its member companies and UARG raised ethical concerns over whether a powerful regulator was able to steer business to former friends and colleagues. ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT Industry group tied to EPA air chief dissolves

A secretive utility industry coalition formerly represented by a top official at the Environmental Protection Agency is dissolving amid investigations into whether its members received special treatment from the Trump administration.

The Utility Air Regulatory Group has been under scrutiny from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which was seeking information on the relationship between power companies, EPA air chief Bill Wehrum and the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, which represented the group.

Story Continued Below

UARG has frequently argued against tighter air pollution and climate regulations; Wehrum is undoing many of the policies at EPA that the group targeted when he represented it at Hunton.

The group released a statement Friday saying its ""membership has decided to disband the organization following a wind down period."" The statement said a committee would be formed to handle ""the completion/fulfillment of UARG's existing obligations and support of members as they continue to cooperate with the Congressional inquiry.""

In a separate statement, Hunton said it was ""proud to have been part of"" UARG's efforts to shape federal air pollution rules through public comments and other participation in the regulatory process.

Wehrum represented UARG until 2017, when he was nominated by President Donald Trump to be EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, a position that has allowed him to oversee many of his former clients' top regulatory priorities.

Membership in UARG was first reported by POLITICO, which obtained internal organization documents showing Hunton billed power companies $8.2 million in dues for 2017. Several utilities had already fled the organization before it was terminated Friday.

The connections between Hunton, UARG, its member companies and UARG raised ethical concerns over whether a powerful regulator was able to steer business to former friends and colleagues.

Wehrum he has stayed in frequent contact with former colleagues at Hunton and other companies affiliated with the group. But he said he did not violate his ethics agreement, as he recused himself for dealing with ‚Äúparticular matters‚Äù related to UARG.

The House committee is investigating how power companies paid for UARG dues and whether the group's members had undue influence over EPA policy. Consumer advocates allege utility customers often foot the bill, which some power companies have confirmed; American Electric Power told Inside EPA that ratepayers financed membership.

Committee Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), as well as Reps. Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), welcomed the group's dissolution, but said it wouldn't affect their investigation.

""Important questions remain about whether EPA officials William Wehrum and David Harlow continue to advance their former coal industry clients‚Äô agenda at EPA, and we intend to see those questions through,‚Äù the three lawmakers said in a statement Friday evening.

UARG had existed since the 1970s but became aggressively litigious during the Obama administration.

One of its major achievements was a 2014 Supreme Court ruling, UARG v. EPA, in which Justice Antonin Scalia scolded EPA for seeking an ‚Äúenormous and transformative expansion‚Äù of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

UARG challenged many other major EPA regulations from the Obama era, including carbon rules for existing and future coal plants, a mercury rule for coal plants, the updated ozone standard, haze cleanup plans and safety rules for industrial chemical facilities. Most of those lawsuits hadn't been settled before the Trump administration took power. EPA is now revising or repealing most of those rules.

And UARG is helping defend EPA in at least six ongoing lawsuits, including over several changes to air permitting policies and the agency's rejection of pollution complaints from downwind states.

It is unclear how UARG‚Äôs dissolution will affect those cases.

"Exclusive: Documents Detail Meetings Of Russians With Treasury, Federal Reserve",https://www.npr.org,['Tim Mak'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/10/721763041/exclusive-documents-detail-meetings-of-russians-with-treasury-federal-reserve,"Exclusive: Documents Detail Meetings Of Russians With Treasury, Federal Reserve

Enlarge this image toggle caption Pavel Ptitsin/AP Pavel Ptitsin/AP

Newly obtained documents describe what happened when two now-infamous Russians took their outreach campaign into the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve in 2015.

Alexander Torshin, then a Russian central banker, brought his prot√©g√©e, Maria Butina, for meetings with senior officials and even sought another with the then-chair of the Fed, the documents confirm.

Agency officials described what happened before and since in internal materials obtained by NPR under the Freedom of Information Act. The fact of the meetings has previously been reported, but their contents have not been fully described until now.

Torshin has since been sanctioned by the Treasury Department and cannot return to the United States.

Butina, meanwhile, has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to serve as a Russian agent and has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.

In an interview with NPR on Thursday, Butina called her meetings with government officials, politicians and the National Rifle Association ""civil diplomacy, this unofficial channel of diplomacy"" and said it was meant to build relationships between the U.S. and Russian governments ‚Äî and ultimately to promote peace.

The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department declined to comment for this story.

The 'gun fanatic'

Torshin and Butina sought to build bridges between the Russian government and influential Americans via their enthusiasm for gun rights. Both had life memberships in the National Rifle Association.

At the same time, Russia was stepping up its broader campaign of influence against the United States.

So in 2015, after the chill in relations between Washington and Moscow following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Torshin sought to take advantage of his connection to Russia's central bank.

Paul Saunders, who was then the executive director of a D.C.-based think tank called the Center for the National Interest, reached out to officials with the Treasury and the Fed to help organize meetings.

""Because we were about a year into U.S. sanctions on Russia following their annexation of Crimea, we thought it would be interesting for Americans to hear from a Russian central bank official about the status of the Russian financial system,"" Saunders told NPR. ""We were certainly not at that time aware of any derogatory information about Torshin.""

Saunders helped broker a meeting for Torshin and Butina with Nathan Sheets, then the undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs.

Treasury aide Erik Woodhouse consulted with a number of officials inside its Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence and the White House's National Security Council, but no red flags were raised about the meeting, which ultimately took place on April 7, 2015.

A few years later, after Butina was arrested, a Treasury Department staffer wrote about what took place.

According to that newly revealed account, the discussion wasn't so much about banking as about denying Russia's involvement in the shoot-down of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner and amplifying Torshin's support for guns.

""The meeting was supposed to be about economics, but the guy just went on and on about how the Russians didn't shoot down MH17 for an hour or so,"" the Treasury Department official wrote, referring to the Malaysia Airlines flight.

""The guy was also a gun fanatic and said he was a 'life member of the NRA.' In fact I think he was even in town for personal business tied to the NRA.""

Saunders also reached out to request a meeting between then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Torshin in March 2015.

Yellen's office passed on the meeting and suggested that Torshin instead meet with Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer. Following the approval of an adviser, Fischer took the meeting on April 8, 2015, without further investigation into Torshin's background.

""They are in the United States to attend the NRA's annual meeting,"" the meeting's official notes read. Both Russians pointed out, as part of their introduction, that they were ""life members"" of the NRA.

This meeting did turn to economic issues, including discussions about Russian credit and inflation.

Butina, now in custody at a detention center in Alexandria, Va., said the meetings were unremarkable.

Of her meeting with Fischer, she said: ""Torshin put it straight: that he is here as an NRA member and he's just interested in meeting similar-minded people. ... I don't remember, even, the details of this conversation, because it wasn't significant at all.""

The sanctions

After months of investigations and headlines about Russia's influence campaign against the United States, Torshin was placed under sanction by the U.S. government in 2018.

In the evidentiary package that designated Torshin as a target for U.S. sanctions ‚Äî also obtained by NPR ‚Äî the Treasury Department established that Torshin was a Russian government official who could be targeted under existing sanctions authorities.

But the package also highlighted Torshin's alleged links with Russian organized crime.

Citing public sources such as Crime Russia, a news website focusing on Russian corruption, and El Pa√≠s, a Spanish newspaper, the document noted that Torshin was in ""frequent contact"" with Alexander Romanov, who heads the Taganskaya organized crime group, between August 2012 to May 2013.

""Torshin may have personally given instructions to members of the Taganskaya on money laundering methods using Spanish bank accounts and real estate,"" the evidentiary package reads.

The package cites no classified or governmental sources, but experts say the inclusion of references to Torshin's alleged organized crime links suggests the U.S. government had reason to believe the allegation was truthful.

""There's a whole process that is used for determining what is included in an evidentiary package. By including it, they view it as credible and relevant to designating him with sanctions,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg, who formerly served as a senior adviser to the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

""This information is strictly ancillary to the legal authorities needed to sanction Torshin, but they want to put it out there for government officials to be aware of.""

US DoJ Charges Group of Individuals Who Stole $2.5 Mln in Crypto Via SIM Swapping,https://cointelegraph.com,['Ana Berman'],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-doj-charges-group-of-individuals-who-stole-25-mln-in-crypto-via-sim-swapping,"The United States Department of Justice released a fifteen-count indictment on May 9 that charges a hacking group labeled ‚ÄúThe Community‚Äù with SIM swapping in order to steal cryptocurrencies.

U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider and his colleague from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Angie Salazar announced the charges in the Eastern District of Michigan. Per Salazar, the investigation was led by Homeland Security Investigations on two continents.

According to the indictment, five Americans and an Irishman are charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Another three, who reportedly are the former employees of mobile phone providers, are charged in a criminal complaint with the wire fraud related to ‚ÄúThe Community.‚Äù

As described in the document, the hacking group used SIM swapping ‚Äî a type of identity theft attack that generally targets a weakness in two-factor authentication. The perpetrator usually gains control of a target's mobile phone by convincing or bribing the employee of the mobile provider to swap the phone number to a SIM card controlled by the hackers.

After successfully swapping the numbers of their victims, ‚ÄúThe Community‚Äù managed to gain access to their various online accounts, including cryptocurrency exchange accounts and wallets. As a result of fraud, approximately $2.5 million worth of cryptocurrency was sent to wallets controlled by the hacking group. Attorney Schneider clarified that in this case, three mobile phone service provider employees purportedly helped swappers to steal money.

The charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison each. Meanwhile, a conviction of aggravated identity theft could add up to two years in prison for the defendants .

According to Irish news website The Journal, a 20-year-old man from Dublin was arrested in Ireland upon the request of the U.S. authorities and is currently awaiting extradition.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, in November 2018, a law enforcement group dedicated to fighting cybercrime released a report on SIM swapping, stating that it had become increasingly popular in California.

Meanwhile, in January, a 21-year old American was accused of stealing almost $24 million in crypto via SIM swapping. And in February, a New York resident was indicted in what constituted the jurisdiction‚Äôs first SIM-swapping prosecution."
"London‚Äôs mayor says Trump ‚Äònot in same class‚Äô as Obama and Bush, not worthy of state visit to Britain",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Adam Taylor', 'Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects', 'May At Pm']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/10/londons-mayor-says-trump-not-same-class-obama-bush-not-worthy-uk-state-visit/,"

London Mayor Sadiq Khan. (Jack Taylor/Getty Images)

Ahead of President Trump‚Äôs state visit to Britain on June 3, London Mayor Sadiq Khan says he believes the U.S. leader is not ‚Äúin the same class‚Äù as his predecessors and is not worthy of the honor.

‚ÄúOf course we should have a close relationship with the president of the United States, but we shouldn‚Äôt be rolling out the red carpet; we shouldn‚Äôt have a state banquet,‚Äù Khan said Friday, during an interview with LBC, a British talk-radio station.

‚ÄúHistory tells us only two presidents have had a state visit,‚Äù Khan said. ‚ÄúPresident Trump is not in the same class as those two.‚Äù

Trump visited Britain last July, but that trip was not considered a state visit, even though he did visit the queen at Windsor Castle.

[Trump finally gets his British state visit ‚Äî but tensions that led to delay remain]

Khan‚Äôs comments reflected widespread skepticism about the Trump administration in the British capital ahead of a long-delayed state trip next month. They also raised the possibility that Trump, who has criticized and insulted the mayor of London before, may retaliate, reigniting a war of words that would likely make his visit to the city more contentious.

British Prime Minister Theresa May extended an invite for a state visit to Trump during a visit to Washington in January 2017, just days after the president had taken office. ‚ÄúI am delighted that the president has accepted that invitation,‚Äù she told a White House news conference.

The only two state visits to Britain by U.S. presidents in the past were in 2011, when President Barack Obama visited, and in 2003, when President George W. Bush visited. State visits are formal trips to Britain by heads of state from countries overseas, with considerable pomp and circumstance that is not afforded to less formal visits by world leaders.

However, as relations between Trump and May grew difficult, Trump‚Äôs state visit to Britain was repeatedly delayed. When Trump finally made a brief visit to London in July 2018 ‚Äî a working visit, rather than a state visit ‚Äî he was greeted by protests and a giant blimp that depicted Trump as a screaming baby in a diaper.

Though a state visit was finally announced last month, most indications suggest that Trump remains unpopular in Britain. Polling data from the firm YouGov suggested only 1 in 5 people had a positive view of the U.S. president, while 67 percent had a negative opinion.

A spat between Trump and Khan, London‚Äôs mayor since May 2016, may not have helped the U.S. leader‚Äôs reputation in the British capital. Even before Trump was elected, Khan, a Labour Party member, had criticized him, telling Time magazine that because he is a Muslim, he would be stopped from going to the United States under Trump‚Äôs proposed Muslim travel ban.

Trump later responded by calling Khan ‚Äúrude‚Äù and ‚Äúignorant‚Äù on ‚ÄúGood Morning Britain.‚Äù

After Trump‚Äôs inauguration, the president criticized the London mayor‚Äôs response to a number of terrorist attacks in the British capital. In November 2017, Trump shared anti-Muslim videos on Twitter posted by a far-right British activist, prompting a rare rebuke from May.

Khan has called for Trump‚Äôs state visit invitation to be rescinded. In his interview with LBC this week, he stated that the visit was not necessary. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible to have a working relationship without the need to have a state banquet and roll out the red carpet,‚Äù Khan said.

Though Khan is not invited to the state banquet, he said he agrees with the sentiment of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has said he will refuse to attend the dinner. In a statement released in April, Labour‚Äôs Corbyn said that Trump ‚Äúrips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric.‚Äù

Khan also told LBC that one issue he had with Trump was the coarse language he used about women, which he felt emboldened others to target women and particularly female politicians.

‚ÄúThe impression is being given that you can get away from it ‚Äî that you get a get-out-of-jail card. But it‚Äôs worse than that,‚Äù Khan said, referring to Trump‚Äôs comments about women who had accused him of sexual assault. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a boasting and bragging, it‚Äôs almost like a green light for others to behave badly.‚Äù

Khan said that he hoped that May would raise some of these issues when Trump visits, though not necessarily in ‚ÄúHugh Grant-type, public scene,‚Äù referencing a fictional faceoff between a U.S. president and prime minister during a news conference in the movie ‚ÄúLove Actually.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre their closest mates, we have a special relationship. That gives us a responsibility to call people out who we otherwise wouldn‚Äôt do so,‚Äù Khan said. ‚ÄúYour relationship with your best mate is different with your relationship with a mate or an acquaintance. Your standards that you expect from them are higher.‚Äù"
Trump To Nominate Patrick Shanahan As Defense Secretary,https://www.npr.org,['Tom Bowman'],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/09/703454156/trump-to-nominate-patrick-shanahan-as-defense-secretary,"Trump To Nominate Patrick Shanahan As Defense Secretary

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP

President Trump will nominate acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan as secretary of defense, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted Thursday.

""Acting Secretary Shanahan has proven over the last several months that he is beyond qualified to lead the Department of Defense, and he will continue to do an excellent job,"" Sanders tweeted.

Shanahan, 56, spent virtually his entire adult life working at Boeing Co., where he helped shepherd the 787 Dreamliner aircraft.

He joined the Trump administration as deputy defense secretary in 2017. When Defense Secretary Jim Mattis abruptly resigned last year over Syria policy, Shanahan was immediately thrust into the top job.

""I spent the better part of 18 months, if you will, sitting in the right seat of the cockpit with Secretary Mattis in the left seat,"" Shanahan said in January at his first ‚Äî and so far only ‚Äî meeting with the press in the Pentagon briefing room, appropriately using an aircraft metaphor when asked how he was doing in his new job.

""So most of the material, the subject matter and the interactions are with people and subjects that are very, very familiar,"" he said.

Shanahan brings less government experience to the position than any defense secretary since the department's creation in 1947, with the exception of Neil McElroy, who served on the White House Conference on Education during the Eisenhower administration after a career at Procter & Gamble.

A congressional aide told NPR that Shanahan, during an office visit earlier this year, seemed overwhelmed by his new job of acting secretary.

The White House reached out to others for the top defense post, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, and retired Army Gen. Jack Keane. Both turned it down.

But recently, says a source close to the White House, Trump ""got used to [Shanahan].""

Some Pentagon officials have said Shanahan is neither a forceful presence nor well-versed in foreign or defense policy. Shanahan himself suggested as much during his Senate confirmation hearing as deputy defense secretary in 2017.

""I believe my skill set strongly complements that of Secretary Mattis,"" Shanahan said. ""He's a master strategist with deep military and foreign policy experience. ... I bring strong execution skills with a background in technology, development and business management.""

As acting secretary, Shanahan has been a contrast to Mattis, who challenged the White House on policy decisions ranging from the use of torture to allowing transgender service members to remain on duty to keeping U.S. troops in Syria.

Trump used to note approvingly that Mattis' nickname was ""Mad Dog."" But over time their relationship cooled. In a 2018 interview, Trump even said Mattis was ""sort of a Democrat.""

Shanahan is very much in charge when it comes to program management, such as creation of the Space Force. More complex military issues, like North Korea, Syria and Afghanistan could fall to others, principally Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton.

During his time as deputy defense secretary, Shanahan had a hard time finding his footing and needed a lot of direction from Mattis, senior Pentagon aides say. They add that Shanahan was more involved in weapons systems and projects, almost like a project manager rather than a No. 2 Pentagon official who must step back and see the big picture.

At a recent hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee to discuss the administration's proposed Pentagon budget, Shanahan seemed most comfortable talking about the way ahead for military programs, focusing on how the Pentagon will counter the growing military power of China and Russia.

""China's defense spending approaches that of the United States, when we take into account purchasing power and the portion of our budget going to military pay and benefits,"" Shanahan told senators.

""That, coupled with China's organized approach to steal foreign technology, has allowed China to modernize its missile, space and cyber capabilities, as well as project power far beyond its borders,"" he said. ""Russia, for its part, continues to compete asymmetrically with the United States, modernizing and developing its own missile, space and cyber capabilities.""

Shanahan went on to talk about the need for a space force, a pet project of the president's.

He told senators about the ""vulnerability of space"" and how the U.S. must be prepared to respond to any kind of attack. And he went on to talk like the engineer he is about the need for ""large scale systems engineering"" and an ""architecture"" to make sure the U.S. is dominant in the space realm.

""There will be a double-digit increase,"" Shanahan said, to Pentagon ""investments in both space and cyber, modernization of our nuclear triad and missile defense capabilities.""

Pentagon officials familiar with the internal debate say Shanahan clashed with Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson ‚Äî who was also mentioned as a potential defense secretary candidate ‚Äî over the Space Force, believing she was undermining the plan or was pushing to keep it within the Air Force as opposed to creating a separate military service.

Wilson recently announced her resignation to become president of the University of Texas, El Paso.

One potential hurdle for Shanahan at a Senate confirmation hearing could revolve around his previous job at Boeing and questions about whether as a defense official he was promoting Boeing products over rival Lockheed Martin. Some Republicans on the committee are reportedly concerned about his strong corporate ties.

The government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has asked the Pentagon's inspector general to investigate the issue. It involves a Pentagon decision to buy more Boeing-made F-15X aircraft, even though the Air Force did not request them.

The complaint alleges that Shanahan ""made numerous statements promoting his former employer Boeing and has disparaged the company's competitors before subordinates at the agency.""

Shanahan's spokesman, Army Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino, brushed aside any concerns.

""Secretary Shanahan has at all times remained committed to complying with his ethics agreement, which screens Boeing matters to other DOD officials and ensures no conflict of interest."""
Indictment in biggest known health care hack in U.S. history involving Indy-based Anthem,https://www.wthr.com,[],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.wthr.com/article/indictment-biggest-known-health-care-hack-us-history-involving-indy-based-anthem,"INDIANAPOLIS (WTHR / AP) ‚Äî A federal grand jury has indicted a Chinese hacking group for the data breach of Indianapolis-based health insurer Anthem.

‚ÄúThe allegations in the indictment unsealed today outline the activities of a brazen China-based computer hacking group that committed one of the worst data breaches in history,‚Äù said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.

The personal information of nearly 79 million people ‚Äî including names, birthdates, Social Security numbers and medical IDs ‚Äî was exposed in the cyberattack, discovered by the company in 2015.

‚ÄúThe cyber attack of Anthem not only caused harm to Anthem, but also impacted tens of millions of Americans,‚Äù said U.S. Attorney Minkler.

Security experts said at the time that the size and scope of the attack indicated potential involvement by a foreign government.

Hackers used a common email technique called spear-phishing in which unwitting company insiders are tricked into revealing usernames and passwords. The Anthem attackers gained the credentials of system administrators, allowing them to probe deeply into the insurer's systems.

The hackers are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud and related activity in relation to computers and identity theft, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and two substantive counts of intentional damage to a protected computer.

In 2018, the nation's second-largest health insurer agreed to pay the government a record $16 million to settle the potential privacy violations."

Interior secretary mum on whether Utah will be new home to BLM headquarters,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900070016/interior-secretary-mum-on-whether-utah-will-be-new-home-to-blm-headquarters.html,"SALT LAKE CITY ‚Äî A decision on where in the West ‚Äî possibly Utah ‚Äî to relocate the Bureau of Land Management headquarters will be made this summer, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said Friday.

""I'm pretty confident it‚Äôs moving. I can‚Äôt tell you where it‚Äôs going, but it‚Äôs moving,"" the newly appointed secretary told the Deseret News.

The Interior Department is finishing up an analysis on relocating the BLM from Washington, D.C., to the West and has included money for the move in its budget proposal, Bernhardt said.

Accompanied by Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, Bernhardt is in the state to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the driving of the golden spike that marked the completion of the transcontinental railroad at Promontory Summit.

Bernhardt, who replaced former Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke as Interior secretary last month, and Bishop sat down for an interview on a variety of public lands issues before taking a helicopter to Golden Spike National Historical Park for the festivities.

Last summer, Susan Combs, Interior's assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, sized up Ogden as a possible site for the BLM. Cedar City and St. George also are in the mix.

Bishop said it makes economic sense to have the office in the West instead of flying people back and forth from Washington. Almost all of the land BLM manages is west of Denver.

""I think our employees will have a wonderful quality of life. Their salaries go so much farther out here. I think they‚Äôll be very excited,"" Bernhardt said.

Republican Utah lawmakers have long sought state control of some 31 million acres of federal land. But Bernhardt doesn't see that happening.

""That‚Äôs an area where the president has drawn a pretty clear line,"" he said. ""I'm sure we're not in the position of thinking that large-scale transfers at this time are the right thing to do.""

Federal land managers are trying to be ""wonderful"" neighbors,"" Bernhardt said.

""We can work on managing land together. We can work to be good neighbors. We can work on effectively managing on our land in a way that‚Äôs consistent and harmonious with the state lands,"" he said.

As deputy Interior secretary, Bernhardt came to Utah with President Donald Trump in December 2017 when the president significantly reduced the sizes of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. Several environmental groups and Native American tribes sued Trump over the decision.

Critics say it will open areas packed with ancient cultural relics and delicate landscapes the monuments once encompassed to mining and oil and gas exploration.

""If somebody says you‚Äôre only doing it to get oil and gas, they clearly don‚Äôt know what the hell they're talking about. There is no oil and gas in either of those,"" Bishop said.

""That‚Äôs why we were willing to ban any kind of mining in the Bears Ears area because it ain‚Äôt there in the first place,"" he said. ""There‚Äôs coal at Grand Staircase but oil and gas, it doesn‚Äôt exist.""

Bernhardt, a former oil industry lobbyist, said even though the monument designation went away, wilderness and wilderness study areas remain as do other underlying laws. Much of BLM land, he said, has a conservation priority imposed on it.

""We‚Äôre going through a big planning process right now on the monuments and our planning process will decide what we can do within the boundaries of our discretion,"" Bernhardt said.

Bernhardt and Bishop say there's room on vast public lands for recreation, conservation and economic activity.

""If you don‚Äôt have the access for both recreational opportunities and economic opportunities on that land, on that public land, you know what you don‚Äôt have? You don‚Äôt have a community,"" Bernhardt said.

Utah GOP leaders have long decried President Bill Clinton's creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante in 1996 and more recently President Barack Obama's designation of Bear Ears in 2016 as an abuse of the Antiquities Act. In both instances, they have sought ways to roll back the presidents' actions.

Bishop introduced a bill in March to limit a president's power to designate and reshape national monuments under the act. Utah's two GOP senators proposed legislation to prohibit presidents from creating or expanding national monuments in Utah without the consent of Congress and the state Legislature.

Bernhardt didn't state a position on the legislation when asked about it Friday.

""I think the president I worked with has used it really, really well,"" he said. ""I think the Congress has to worry about future presidents.""

The Interior Department's approach is to ensure local input, community support and congressional support before moving ahead with any designation, Bernhardt said.

He also addressed park maintenance.

The National Park Service current has a nearly $13 billion maintenance backlog that impacts popular Zion and Arches national parks.

Bernhardt said the Interior Department has a budget proposal that would address the problem in a ""significant"" way. He said he's also about to issue an order that would allow a broader range of parks to use fee revenue to hire staff to make sure parks are safe, clean and well-managed.

""We‚Äôre trying to make that visitor experience exceptional,"" he said.

Bernhardt said the order would include parks in Utah, but he wasn't sure which ones."

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff issued a subpoena to the Justice Department on Wednesday for the unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs report, in addition to all of the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information collected during the 22-month investigation.

The subpoena comes after Schiff (D-Calif.) and his Republican counterpart, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, made a rare joint request for the documents. Schiff said the Justice Department had yet to respond to the committee‚Äôs request, prompting him to issue a subpoena.

‚ÄúThe department has repeatedly failed to respond, refused to schedule any testimony, and provided no documents responsive to our legitimate and duly authorized oversight activities,‚Äù Schiff said in a statement.

‚ÄúThe department repeatedly pays lip service to the importance of a meaningful accommodation process, but it has only responded to our efforts with silence or outright defiance,‚Äù Schiff added. ‚ÄúToday, we have no choice but to issue a subpoena to compel their compliance.‚Äù

The committee‚Äôs subpoena requires the Justice Department to turn over the documents by May 15.

Schiff and Nunes penned joint letters to Barr ‚Äî one on March 27 and another on April 25 ‚Äî demanding the full Mueller report and its supporting materials. In the second letter, the lawmakers threatened a subpoena ‚Äúabsent meaningful compliance‚Äù by the end of last week.

In his letter to Barr informing the attorney general of the subpoena, Schiff said the Intelligence Committee required the information in order to ‚Äúdischarge its unique constitutional and statutory responsibilities,‚Äù including conducting oversight, examining potential national security issues and drawing up legislation to address vulnerabilities.

Schiff said the Justice Department claimed that it was accommodating his and Nunes‚Äô request by allowing the lawmakers ‚Äî in addition to 10 other senior members of Congress ‚Äî to view a less-redacted version of the report.

‚ÄúNeither of these responses amounted to a good faith effort to negotiate an accommodation of the committee‚Äôs request,‚Äù Schiff wrote, adding that his staff reminded the Justice Department of its ‚Äúexpansive and voluminous‚Äù production of documents related to the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email server.

‚ÄúThese materials were of the precise type the department now claims it is prohibited from giving to the full committee, including classified and law enforcement sensitive information, documents related to third parties, and those pertaining to ongoing investigations,‚Äù Schiff wrote.

The committee‚Äôs announcement comes the same day the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for defying that panel‚Äôs subpoena for the unredacted Mueller report and all of its underlying evidence.

Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege over the full report and its underlying materials ‚Äî at Barr‚Äôs urging ‚Äî in order to prevent the Justice Department from complying with the committee‚Äôs subpoena.

Schiff‚Äôs and Nunes‚Äô numerous requests for the full Mueller report come despite efforts by Republicans on the Judiciary panel to back the Justice Department‚Äôs position that Congress does not have a right to the materials ‚Äî in particular, the grand-jury information.

"Facing Democratic resistance, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt promotes oil and gas drilling",https://www.sltrib.com,"['Juliet Eilperin', 'The Washington Post']",05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2019/05/10/facing-democratic/,"Washington ‚Ä¢ The Trump administration will calculate the climate effects of its oil, gas and coal leasing decisions, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview Wednesday, but will not make those impacts the key factor in its final decisions.

Bernhardt, who took office a month ago, said he was committed to carrying out President Donald Trump‚Äôs plans to expand fossil-fuel production on public lands. In March, a federal judge ruled that the federal government illegally approved two gas drilling plans in western Colorado; on Monday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that Interior‚Äôs Bureau of Land Management failed to account for the effect of fracking as many as 4,000 oil and gas wells in New Mexico‚Äôs Greater Chaco region.

Bernhardt, who noted that the leases in both decisions had been issued under the Obama administration, said he was confident the department could address these concerns.

""So that says to me that we have to do a better job in articulating certain things to the courts,"" he said during a wide-ranging conversation in his office. ""What I hope is, as an organization we learn from any error we make.""

Congressional Democrats have been pressing Bernhardt, who appeared before a House spending panel Tuesday and will testify before the House Natural Resources Committee next week, to factor climate change into the department's decisions about energy development on public lands and in federal waters.

But he emphasized that Interior was not legally obligated to curb the nation's carbon output, even if it had to assess the environmental effects of its leasing programs.

""The law requires us to analyze those things,"" he said, referring to the greenhouse gas emissions stemming from a leasing decision. ""It doesn't say if there is an additional contribution, you should not go forward at all.""

The Trump administration has placed a hold on one of its most ambitious leasing proposals, a five-year plan for offshore drilling, after a federal judge ruled in March that the president's order revoking a sweeping ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans was illegal. Bernhardt said the White House would make the ultimate decision on whether to appeal, and that he could not predict when the offshore leasing plan would be finalized.

Bernhardt is prepared to forge ahead on other deregulation efforts. He said that he expected to get a briefing on this week's U.N. scientific report that an eighth of the world's plants and animals are at risk of extinction, but added that Interior and the Commerce Department still planned to finalize an overhaul of endangered species regulations this year.

""We didn't start doing them to not do them,"" he said.

As he pursues the administration's agenda, Bernhardt is likely to encounter resistance on Capitol Hill. In a phone interview Wednesday, Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on interior, environment and related agencies, said that any spending bill passing the House this year would impose certain requirements on Interior.

Article continues below

""We will not be funding irreparable harm to the environment,"" McCollum said. ""Any bill we pass will include requirements for the Department of Interior to use real science, to use best practices, to protect the environment and to not to go to industry and ask them what they want, and what's the bare minimum.""

In contrast to his predecessor, Ryan Zinke, who insulted one of the top Democrats overseeing Interior on Twitter, Bernhardt has made an effort to contact key lawmakers in recent weeks. He met privately on Tuesday with House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Ra√∫l Grijalva, D-Ariz., and said he plans to meet with members of both parties in the months to come.

""You know, my own view is that everyone who is engaged in public service is trying to serve the public interest in the best way that they can,"" he said.

Bernhardt, who started running the department in January but did not move into the secretary's office until he was sworn in April 11, has made several changes to its decor. A stuffed polar bear stands as a sentry outside, and the skull of a moose Bernhardt shot in Alaska's Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve sits atop the fireplace.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not somebody who would put somebody else‚Äôs stuff up,‚Äù Bernhardt said, noting that he and a friend had to carry the moose‚Äôs entire body themselves to ship it out on a small plane. ‚ÄúHis neck meat alone was 135 pounds.‚Äù"

Trump told Politico in an interview Friday that he hasn‚Äôt talked with Barr about investigating Biden and his family's business dealings but said ""certainly it would be an appropriate thing"" to bring up with the attorney general.

""Certainly it is a very big issue and we‚Äôll see what happens. I have not spoken to him about it. Would I speak to him about it? I haven‚Äôt thought of that. I mean, you‚Äôre asking me a question I just haven‚Äôt thought of,"" he told the outlet.

The president noted that it could be ""a very big situation"" for Biden, who has led the Democratic presidential primary field in polling since he launched his campaign last month.

""Because he‚Äôs a Democrat it‚Äôs about 1/100 the size of the fact that if he were a Republican, it would be a lot bigger,"" Trump alleged.

Trump‚Äôs personal attorney Rudy Giuliani last week called for an investigation into Biden for his previous ties to Ukraine after The New York Times reported that while Biden was vice president in 2016, he allegedly threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless the country removed a top prosecutor. The prosecutor, who had been accused of ignoring corruption in his own office, was later voted out.

Biden‚Äôs son Hunter was a board member of an energy company that the prosecutor had been looking into, according to the newspaper.

Giuliani initially planned to travel to Ukraine to encourage Ukraine's president-elect to launch investigations into Biden and the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE's Russia investigation.

However, Giuliani changed course late Friday, announcing that he had canceled his trip. The reversal came after Democrats on Capitol Hill accused him of seeking aid from a foreign government.

Biden, the front-runner among a crowded field of Democrats vying for the White House in 2020, had a 32-point lead over his competitors in a Hill-HarrisX poll released earlier this week.

Biden also surpassed Trump by six points in the first poll published after the former vice president officially announced his candidacy in April."

The current economic miracle is closely related to the massive rate decreases that the Fed used to pull up from the crisis of 2008. When the threat of a currency decline became apparent, the Fed rushed to prop up the dollar and with it, the US economy.

Pot and Kettle

In an ironic turn, however, the US Treasury has now threatened to turn up the heat on foreign governments for manipulating currencies. The scrutiny includes the twelve largest trading partners with the US, plus a host of other nations with trading surpluses.

While the vast majority of these nations have passed the so-called test, Vietnam stands to be the first nation accused. The country is apparently using external means to hold down the dong ‚Äî the national currency of Vietnam. Obviously, the name has led to a host of snide comments regarding the country‚Äôs actions.

Passive Aggressive

The twist comes with a perusal of other US trading partners. Nearly every country on the list is using some means of currency manipulation.

For example, the Japanese government has been buying up massive amounts of ETFs in the country in order to keep the yen down, and Switzerland has been hoarding Apple stock to devalue the franc. China, too, recently buoyed its stock market by pumping money into oil and finance companies to stabilize values.

The difference, according to the Treasury, is the passive nature of these manipulations compared to Vietnam‚Äôs active suppression. Apparently, the active vs. passive nature creates a distinction that the Treasury is unwilling to countenance.

Decentralized Answer

Though the news of US scrutiny is not surprising, the relative hypocrisy could be. With nearly every national bank in the world manipulating its currency through some means, Vietnam‚Äôs tiny economy is an odd choice to single out.

The entire issue draws attention to the need for greater levels of economic decentralization. While such market manipulations can, and have, produced some level of stability in various places, they also produce economies that are wholly political.

On the contrary, Bitcoin (BTC) and other decentralized cryptocurrencies provide payment methodologies that free the consumer from the constraints of centralized government. By connecting peer-to-peer in a ‚Äòtrustless‚Äô environment, Bitcoin allows markets to move independently, without such manipulations.

Do you think Bitcoin is the currency of the future because it promotes financial independence, or is currency manipulation part and parcel with a stable economy? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

"Border apprehensions to surpass last 13 year totals in 122 days, DHS heightens funding plea",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/border-crossings-to-surpass-last-13-year-totals-in-122-days-dhs-heightens-funding-plea,"The Department of Homeland Security is forecasting that border apprehensions of illegal immigrants will surpass the totals of the last 13 years in just 122 days, prompting a new push for President Trump‚Äôs $4.5 billion in emergency funding to handle the crisis.

To add an exclamation point on the administration's plea for Congress to pitch in, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is leading a weekend trip with acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to the Texas-Mexico border to oversee Homeland Security-Pentagon operations at the increasingly dangerous and populated border, according to law enforcement officials.

The trip by the nation‚Äôs two top border security officials comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection released shocking new April border arrest numbers. The agency said it apprehended 109,144 in April, up from 103,719 in March.

Officials said the surge will surpass the totals of the last 13 fiscal years in early September. Arrests topped the fiscal 2014 totals last weekend.

An average of 3,891 illegal immigrants are apprehended every day, according to officials.

McAleenan and Shanahan are set to arrive in McAllen, Texas, Saturday. They plan to oversee Homeland Security and Defense Department joint missions, meet with officers and first responders, and inspect the humanitarian operations, according to officials. It is McAleenan‚Äôs third trip to the border as acting secretary and Shanahan‚Äôs second.

Some of those humanitarian operations are running short of congressionally approved funding. Trump has asked for an emergency appropriation of $4.5 billion and border lawmakers, like Arizona Sen. Martha McSally, have urged Senate leaders to act on the request.

At a House hearing last month, McAleenan listed what is needed to end the surge, adding, ‚ÄúGiven the scale of the crisis, we will exhaust our resources before the end of this fiscal year, which is why the administration will be seeking supplemental funding to support ongoing surge operations, and provide critical humanitarian assistance for migrants.‚Äù

Homeland Security would get about $1.2 billion of the $4.5 billion:



$391 million for humanitarian assistance that will fund processing centers at the border, transportation requirements, feeding and care of those in custody, and other needs

$530 million for operations support on the border, such as personnel expenses, detention beds, transportation, and investigatory resources to counter human smuggling and trafficking

$178 million for information technology system upgrades and law enforcement pay adjustments to manage the ongoing surge

‚ÄúThe problem we face is huge, short-term fixes will not cut it, and we need sustained investment and additional emergency support at the southwest border to overcome the humanitarian and security crisis. The president‚Äôs budget will do that,‚Äù said McAleenan, a longtime border official.

Democrats have started to express support for more spending at the border, but action has been slow on the president‚Äôs request."

WASHINGTON ‚Äî Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also a known carcinogen. Last month‚Äôs rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.‚Äôs own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

‚ÄúRather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit ‚Äî and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,‚Äù staff members wrote."
"Trump declares 'invasion' at border after DHS says 1 percent of Honduras, Guatemala entered US",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-invasion-border-dhs-one-percent-honduras-guatemala,"A day after the acting Homeland Security secretary estimated that more than 1 percent of the populations of Guatemala and Honduras had entered the U.S. since September, President Trump declared an ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, his administration expects record numbers of migrants to arrive from Central America in the coming months.

""When you see these caravans starting out with 20,000 people, that's an invasion,‚Äù Trump said at his Wednesday evening ‚ÄúMake American Great Again‚Äù rally in Panama City, Fla., defending his declaration of a national emergency at the border earlier this year. ‚ÄúNo nation can tolerate a massive organized violation of its immigration laws. And no one should run for office without an ironclad pledge to protect and defend America's borders.""

TRUMP DEFENDS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION AT MEXICO BORDER, SAYS DEMS 'DON'T MIND CRIME'

The White House recently proposed charging asylum-seekers a fee to process their applications in an effort to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants trying to cross into the U.S.

In a speech Tuesday to the 49th Washington Conference of the Americas, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan described why most migrants arriving at the U.S. border come from Guatemala, Honduras or El Salvador.

‚ÄúGuatemala and Honduras have seen over 1 percent of their total population migrate to the U.S. in the first seven months of this fiscal year,‚Äù McAleenan said, citing government-funded research completed by Vanderbilt University. He said most migrants come to escape extreme poverty and stay because of a flawed U.S. immigration system.

‚ÄúOne department of Guatemala, Huehuetenango, has seen almost 35,000 of its residents ‚Äî close to 3 percent of the population ‚Äî migrate to the U.S. in that time frame,‚Äù McAleenan added.

The flawed U.S. immigration system often permits families and unaccompanied minors to live in the United States for months or years as their asylum claims are processed, even though most will never obtain legal status. Central Americans notice family or neighbors leave and successfully make it into the U.S., so they too choose to embark on the journey, the DHS chief explained.

‚ÄúIn March, we had over 103,000 irregular arrivals of undocumented migrants ‚Äî 90 percent crossing the U.S. border unlawfully and unsafely in the hands of human smugglers. We will see similar numbers in April,‚Äù McAleenan continued, explaining that he expects current trends to continue in the upcoming months.

According to the study carried out by Vanderbilt‚Äôs Latin American Public Opinion Project in Guatemala earlier this year, 1 in 4 Guatemalans intend to migrate from Guatemala, with 85 percent of them indicating the U.S. as their preferred destination.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs over 4 million Guatemalans who intend to migrate to the United States,‚Äù McAleenan said. The DHS head is working with Jared Kushner, the president‚Äôs son-in-law and senior adviser, on an immigration bill designed to overhaul the legal immigration system, the Washington Post reported.

The proposed legislation will include ‚Äúan aggressive and holistic strategy‚Äù to work together with Central America officials in order to identify ‚Äúpushes‚Äù that drive migrants out of Central America.

‚ÄúWe want to work closely with all three countries' customs administrations to help increase the efficiency of cross-border trade by reducing supply chain barriers and support exports and job creation,"" McAleenan said Tuesday, according to the Washington Examiner. ""From an infrastructure, technology, automation, and legal perspective, DHS‚Äôs Customs and Border Protection is pursuing broad support for the region‚Äôs customs administrations to modernize practices in all of these areas.‚Äù

St. Paul, Minn. ‚Äî On average, about 20 veterans a day die by suicide. Since 2017, 25 veterans have taken their lives on the grounds of Veterans Affairs hospitals, including seven this year and at least four last month.

In February of last year, Justin Miller died by suicide in the parking lot of a Veterans Administration hospital in Minneapolis. The Marine veteran was 33. Justin, a trumpet player, made the band, but the Marines saw he could make another contribution as a marksman in Iraq manning a checkpoint with bomb-sniffing dogs.

""If the dog sat down, pull the trigger. Those were his orders. And he said he did that for weeks, day in, day out,"" said Gregory Miller, Justin's father.

When he left the Marines in 2007, his family said he changed. While he still volunteered to play his trumpet at various occasions, he was increasingly depressed and even suicidal. Eventually he sought help at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

""We said we loved each other. I kissed him, and that was the last time I saw my son,"" Miller said.

After three days at the VA, he died.

""He went out to his car. He looked at his phone. He saw the text from my dad, saying 'I love you. Come home.' And at some point he took his own life,"" said Alissa Harrington, Justin's sister.

Justin Miller Miller family

Experts in this field say veterans who kill themselves on VA grounds are making a statement about their treatment. A federal investigation of Miller's death said the Minneapolis VA made multiple mistakes, from not scheduling a follow-up to overlooking his access to firearms.

""They have people, but they're not trained the way they're supposed to be,"" Miller said.

Some 6,000 veterans kill themselves every year. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, whose department serves 9.5 million people, said in the last year, they have had 240 interventions where they stopped veterans from taking their lives. Since October, the VA has screened 900,000 veterans for mental health issues.

""Of that 900,000 we culled it down to 3,000. Three thousands veterans our medical professionals say might be at risk and we are monitoring them as closely as we can,"" Wilkie said. ""That means calls, that means visits ‚Äî bringing them into our centers.""

In Miller's case, antidepressants came in the mail from the VA two days after he died. ""The worst part of his funeral was that they didn't have a live trumpet player. There was no one there to play for him,"" Harrington said.

The silent trumpet at his grave was a gift from his dad."
Settlement in Fast and Furious executive privilege lawsuit between DOJ and the House,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/politics/fast-and-furious-settlement-doj-house/index.html,"(CNN) Amid the contempt and privilege fight over the Mueller report in Congress on Wednesday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Justice Department are trying to end another major battle over executive privilege that has lasted years.

The Democrat-led House and the Justice Department announced to a federal appeals court in Washington on Wednesday that they had reached a settlement in the Operation Fast and Furious court case, which began as an Obama-era privilege standoff over a subpoena from Congress.

It led to the then-Republican-controlled House holding then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012, yet the litigation dragged on. A previous attempt last year to end the court fight was stopped by a trial-court judge, after the two sides sought to throw out her opinions in the case because of how they could play into future privilege fights.

The long-running case was a persistent reminder in recent years of how long a court fight over privilege can take -- especially on the same day a congressional committee voted to approve holding now-Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failing to turn over the full unredacted Mueller report, and the White House asserted executive privilege over the report's entirety to stymie Congress. The Mueller report clash appears to be headed for court.

In the Fast and Furious case, the House was seeking documents in response to a subpoena regarding an ill-fated program that sought to track guns that federal agents allowed into Mexico. The Justice Department initially asserted privilege over all the documents, and even after years of litigation still refused to give Congress some information about the program.

WASDE Analysis: Bears Overrun the Grain Markets,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/wasde-analysis-bears-overrun-the-grain-markets/,"On the bearish-to-bullish scale (with 1 being bearish and 10 being bullish), Ted Seifried would give the today‚Äôs round of USDA reports a 2 or 3.

The May 2019 World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report from USDA provided additional negative news for the corn and soybean markets, which are already being dragged lower by negative trade news and planting delays.

Corn: Huge Ending Stocks Push Prices Lower

USDA says the U.S. feed-grain outlook for 2019/20 is for larger production and domestic use, lower exports and greater ending stocks.

The corn crop is projected at 15.0 billion bu., up from last year and the second largest on record behind 2016/17.

The yield projection of 176.0 bu. per acre is based on a weather-adjusted trend assuming normal planting progress and summer growing season weather, estimated using the 1988-2018 time period.

Total corn supplies are forecast record high at 17.2 billion bushels.

The season-average farm price is projected at $3.30 per bushel, down 20 cents from 2018/19 and the lowest since 2006/07.

Soybeans: High Supplies Sink Prices

USDA says the 2019/20 outlook for U.S. soybeans is for higher supplies, crush, exports and slightly lower ending stocks compared to 2018/19.

The soybean crop is projected at 4,150 million bu., down 394 million from last year‚Äôs record crop.

With sharply higher beginning stocks, soybean supplies are projected at 5,165 million bu., up 3% from 2018/19.

The season-average soybean price is projected at $8.10 per bushel, down 45 cents from the 2018/19 forecast.

‚ÄúAt face value, when you look at the numbers, they are quite a bit larger than what the trade was expecting, especially for new-crop corn carryover,‚Äù says Seifried, chief market strategist and vice president with Zaner Ag Hedge Group. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where the real bearishness is coming from.‚Äù

The trade was hoping to see stronger domestic demand numbers and maybe even a better export number for corn, he explains.

‚ÄúCorn was supposed to be the bullish story in the grains,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThis report really says ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô to that.‚Äù

Seifried says farmers need to pay attention to the asterisks USDA included in the reports. For corn, USDA points out that the acreage and yield projections are based on a weather-adjusted trend assuming normal mid-May planting progress and summer growing season weather.

‚ÄúThat mid-May planting progress is very much in question,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhile we have a bit of sticker shock on the demand side of the corn balance sheet because of the sheer size of ending stocks, the asterisk is fairly important because we are very concerned about whether we're going to get planting done.‚Äù

The disappointing part of the report, Seifried points out, is that the starting point for production is so high.

‚ÄúSo even if I‚Äôm going to chop off 1.5 million acres of corn that may not get planted due to the weather and if cut the yield down just a little bit, the downside mobility in the corn carryover is fairly limited unless we find some new demand,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHow do we do that? We have a big South American corn crop and strong U.S. dollar. Where do we find more corn demand? I don't know what how we could get much more bearish than where we are right now, unless ASF comes to North America.‚Äù

With the May USDA reports, Seifried encourages farmers to rethink their price targets for corn and soybeans.

‚ÄúWith this report, we have to lower our expectations,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe're hoping to see some price recovery to sell. If we do, we need to be fairly aggressive on selling.‚Äù

As for the monthly Crop Production report, USDA forecast winter wheat production at 1.27 billion bu., which is up 7% from 2018. As of May 1, the United States yield is forecast at 50.3 bu. per acre, up 2.4 bu. from last year's average yield of 47.9 bu. per acre.

Seifried says the wheat numbers were close to trade expectations, with no surprises."
James Comey on DOJ inspector general's Trump-Russia investigation: 'Let's hear it',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/james-comey-on-doj-inspector-generals-trump-russia-probe-lets-hear-it,"Former FBI Director James Comey said on Thursday he is confident that Justice Department's Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation will not find that he or others around him at the FBI did anything wrong, but ""if the truth was there was something concerning, then let's hear it.""

At a CNN town hall Thursday night, exactly two years after he was fired by President Trump on May 9, 2017, Comey said no matter what is found by Horowitz's probe or by the investigation being conducted by Attorney General William Barr, ""they should be transparent about it.""

Comey and the FBI have come under scrutiny for the handling of the Trump-Russia investigation, with allegations of politicization, improper surveillance, spying, and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse.

CNN‚Äôs Anderson Cooper told Comey that ‚Äúthe inspector general, the attorney general, they're now obviously looking into the origins of the investigation into the president and his campaign.‚Äù He asked Comey: ‚ÄúAre you confident you did everything by the book, and that the FBI, the people around you did everything by the book?‚Äù

[ Related: DOJ inspector general 'homing in on' FBI‚Äôs use of unverified Steele dossier]

Comey said he was confident that he, and the FBI more broadly, had done nothing wrong, replying, ‚ÄúYes. No doubt in my mind. But that doesn't mean I'm against review of it. That's totally fine.‚Äù

Cooper then pressed him further, asking, ‚ÄúSo you think the inspector general will find nothing inappropriate?‚Äù

Comey said, ‚ÄúI don't think so. At least not that I know of. But if they do, they do. And they should be transparent about it.‚Äù

The Justice Department inspector general is looking into alleged FISA abuse related to surveillance of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. The watchdog is also investigating the FBI‚Äôs reliance on British ex-spy Christopher Steele‚Äôs dossier. That research was compiled at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was itself being paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. The dossier was a key part of FISA applications and renewals; Comey signed off on three of them.

[ Also read: Barr says 'multiple criminal leak investigations underway']

Cooper told Comey that ‚ÄúCNN has spoken to people within the FBI that say they have concerns that the inspector general could find something, and that they are bracing for what may be uncovered.‚Äù

Comey emphasized he looked forward to the results of the investigation and stressed that he was unaware of any wrongdoing by himself or by the FBI. ‚ÄúAgain, I'm a big believer in the truth. If the truth was there was something concerning, then let's hear it. I don't know of anything like that,"" he said.

Barr told Congress that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the Justice Department and the FBI handled the Trump-Russia investigation, and he said that ‚Äúthe people helping me with my review will be working very closely with‚Äù Horowitz.

Comey's handling of the Clinton email investigation during 2016 was criticized in a voluminous report released by Horowitz in June 2018, which Cooper reminded Comey of by saying that the Justice Department inspector general ‚Äúcalled your decision not to inform the bosses about the Clinton press conference, they called it extraordinary, insubordinate.‚Äù Cooper further reminded him that ‚Äúthey also said your letter to Congress about reopening the Clinton emails investigation to the emails was based on your personal views even if it meant rejecting long-standing department policy or practice.‚Äù

Comey replied, ‚ÄúYeah, that's fair criticism.‚Äù

Cooper then asked, ‚ÄúIs it true? Extraordinary and insubordinate and that it rejected long-standing policy practices?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, except for the insubordinate part,‚Äù Comey contended.

Barr has said Horowitz‚Äôs Trump-Russia investigation into the actions of the Justice Department and FBI should be completed in either May or June."

Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., initially requested ""all materials ... obtained or produced by the Special Counsel's Office in the course of the investigation"" in a March 27 letter to Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. After receiving no response, Schiff and Nunes repeated their request in a second letter dated April 25, one week after Barr released a redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress and the public.

""[A]s the report makes clear, the Department of Justice and the FBI failed to keep the Committee 'fully and currently informed' of this important foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information, as required by law,"" Schiff and Nunes wrote in the April letter. ""The Department and the Bureau did not keep the Committee apprised of this information ... contrary to long-standing practice regarding significant counterintelligence matters.""

DEMS WHO FUMED AT NUNES FOR JEOPARDIZING 'SOURCES AND METHODS' NOW DEMAND MUELLER REPORT IN FULL

The second letter from Nunes and Schiff gave the Justice Department until May 2 to cooperate with their requests or ""the Committee will have no choice but to resort to compulsory process on Friday, May 3 to compel production of documents responsive to the Committee's request.""

A committee aide told Fox News on Tuesday that ""the [Justice] Department has not produced any documents responsive to our requests and has not agreed to schedule any testimony,"" even after Schiff and Nunes sent their second letter.

""An accommodations process must go both ways, and the Committee will soon start the compulsory process since the Department has not even begun to comply,"" the aide said.

The letters mark a rare showing of bipartisan agreement between Schiff and Nunes, who have repeatedly been at loggerheads over the Russia investigation. On March 28, the committee's nine Republican members -- including Nunes -- requested that Schiff step down as chairman over his repeated claims in the media that there was ""more than circumstantial evidence‚Äù of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Last week, Schiff called for Barr to resign as attorney general over his handling of the Mueller report, writing in a USA Today op-ed that Barr ""misled the country about an investigation implicating the president.

""Then he lied to Congress,"" Schiff wrote in the piece published last Friday. ""Then he did something worse: He effectively said that the president of the United States is above the law.""

"Amazon Gave Jobs to DOD Staff Working on Cloud Bid, Lawsuit Claims",http://fortune.com,['Naomi Nix'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://fortune.com/2019/05/08/amazon-oracle-pentagon-cloud-lawsuit/,"At least two Pentagon employees were offered jobs at Amazon.com Inc. while working on the Defense Department‚Äôs $10 billion cloud contract, a lawsuit filed by Oracle Corp. alleges.

The amended complaint, made public on Tuesday, claims Deap Ubhi, a former employee at a high-level Defense Department technology unit, helped design the cloud contract in a way that was favorable to Amazon after receiving ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù job and bonus offers from the e-commerce giant.

Oracle‚Äôs latest court action comes weeks after the Pentagon announced it had eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the bidding because they didn‚Äôt meet the minimum criteria, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp. as the last remaining competitors.

The Pentagon, which announced the so-called JEDI competition in March of last year, doesn‚Äôt expect to award the contract before July 19.

Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, helped craft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from Amazon Web Services, the company‚Äôs cloud unit, according to the lawsuit. Ubhi then made up an ‚Äúelaborate lie‚Äù about an Amazon offer to buy his startup company, Tablehero, when he ‚Äúbelatedly‚Äù recused himself from working on the contract, the lawsuit alleges.

JEDI Contracting Process

The lawsuit also contends that an unnamed former official connected with the Navy participated in the JEDI contracting process even after accepting a position with Amazon Web Services.

Ubhi is still employed by Amazon Web Services, according to his Twitter account.

An Amazon representative didn‚Äôt immediately respond to requests for comment. The Defense Department declined to comment. Efforts to reach Ubhi through multiple emails and by telephone were unsuccessful.

Oracle first filed its lawsuit in December in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging the Pentagon crafted overly narrow contract requirements and failed to investigate relationships between former Defense Department employees and Amazon.

The newest allegations may bolster Oracle‚Äôs argument that terms for the cloud project violate federal procurement standards. The cloud project involves transitioning massive amount of Defense Department data to a commercially-operated cloud system.

Oracle‚Äôs lawsuit also made conflict-of-interest allegations about Anthony DeMartino, former deputy chief of staff in the secretary of defense‚Äôs office. DeMartino had previously consulted for Amazon Web Services before assuming his role at the Pentagon.

In February, a judge paused court proceedings in the case to allow the Pentagon to review new information about potential conflicts of interests. The Pentagon said it determined that the acquisition process for the contract wasn‚Äôt tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.

In November, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also rejected Oracle‚Äôs conflict-of-interest allegations in a separate protest. The watchdog agency said the evidence it reviewed indicated that neither DeMartino nor Ubhi had substantive input into the contract‚Äôs terms or the procurement process.

Tech companies including Oracle banded together in an informal coalition last year to urge the Defense Department to split the contract among several suppliers.

Earlier: New Amazon Bias Charge Likely to Delay Pentagon‚Äôs Cloud Contract

They said the winner-take-all approach would lock the Pentagon into a single vendor and would heighten security risks. The department has said that making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that could prevent it from quickly delivering new capabilities.

The JEDI contract could threaten the growth of a longstanding business that IBM and Oracle have with the Defense Department as it seeks to move its legacy technologies into a commercially-operated cloud system. Both companies were late entrants into the cloud market and have struggled to catch up to Amazon in the private and public sectors.

Amazon was widely seen as the frontrunner for the cloud contract because it previously won a $600 million deal cloud deal from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and obtained higher levels of federal security authorizations than its peers.

Challenge Requirements

Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck, who leads the company‚Äôs Washington lobbying operation, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News that the company will continue to challenge requirements for the contract in conversations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

‚ÄúYou read the RFP, and it just screams Amazon,‚Äù Glueck said in an interview April 26, referring to the Defense Department‚Äôs request for proposals. ‚ÄúThe RFP emphasizes all the things Amazon is very good at‚Äù and ‚Äúcompletely de-emphasizes the things they‚Äôre not very good at.‚Äù"

However, a former USDA secretary, Tom Vilsack, told CNBC that the administration has ""very limited options"" although it could some funds by tapping into the Commodity Credit Corp., a federal agency given authority during the Great Depression. ""The secretary's options are limited given the size of the challenge,"" said Vilsack, currently president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, a trade group. Vilsack also suggested the program may require congressional approval, although a trade mitigation plan the USDA unveiled last year for American farmers impacted by retaliatory tariffs didn't require it. Vilsack added, ""They could do something. Whether they could do it to the extent that he's [Trump] suggested I think would require some congressional authorization and direction. I don't think there's enough flexibility in the USDA budget to be able to carve up and be able to identify $15 billion.""

Last July, Perdue unveiled a $12 billion trade aid program for American farmers that included trade promotion, food purchases, and direct payments to producers of soybeans, pork, corn, cotton, dairy and several other commodities. That earlier program utilized the CCC for so-called market facilitation payments to farmers, with the top five commodities being soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton and sorghum. ""I think what the president was talking about was buying a bunch of soybeans,"" said Vilsack, a former Iowa governor who served in the USDA during the Obama administration. ""And even if the secretary can identify the resources to purchase crops and products, getting them to countries requires a second step by USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development] and the State Department."" Soybeans have been hard hit by Chinese tariffs, falling near 10-year lows on Monday amid the threat of an escalated trade war with China. Before the trade war, China was buying more than $12 billion worth of U.S. soybeans annually, or roughly 1 in 3 rows of soybeans grown on the nation's farms. Last year, China bought about $3.2 billion worth of U.S. soybeans, according to USDA data. But China last year imposed 25% tariffs on a variety of agricultural products including soybeans ‚Äî a top commodity in many states where Trump received strong support during the 2016 presidential election. Trump's suggestion that the U.S. government buy $15 billion worth of agricultural products comes as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are targeting the Midwest states for support. Meantime, Vilsack said it may be difficult for the administration to move quickly on the plan for other reasons. For one, he said some countries might not want to take the food commodities because it could have negative repercussions domestically. ""They would prefer to take cash because they don't want to disrupt their own agricultural economy by having foreign crops come in and displace domestically produced crops,"" he said.

DOJ inspector general 'homing in on' FBI‚Äôs use of unverified Steele dossier,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-homing-in-on-fbis-use-of-unverified-steele-dossier,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is investigating the FBI‚Äôs reliance on the unverified dossier produced by British ex-spy Christopher Steele in the surveillance of a Trump campaign associate ‚Äúdespite questions about [Steele‚Äôs] credibility.""

Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reports Horowitz ‚Äúis homing in on‚Äù and ‚Äúhas been asking witnesses about‚Äù the FBI‚Äôs ‚Äútreatment of information‚Äù provided by Steele, described as a ‚Äúkey source‚Äù, who was used to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants against former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page.

This is part of Horowitz‚Äôs broad investigation into alleged FISA abuse and more.

Steele‚Äôs dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS, which had reached out to and contracted Steele.

The new Wall Street Journal report says the inspector general‚Äôs office ‚Äúhas been asking why the FBI continued to cite Steele as a credible source in the renewal applications.‚Äù And a specific focus of Horowitz‚Äôs team is apparently ‚Äúa news report cited extensively in the [FISA] applications that appeared to bolster Steele‚Äôs credibility‚Ä¶ [which] said U.S. intelligence officials were investigating allegations similar to those Steele had raised.‚Äù

The ‚Äúnews report‚Äù was written by Yahoo News journalist Michael Isikoff, who said he was stunned when he learned that his September 2016 article for Yahoo News was used in the FISA applications targeting Carter Page to bolster Steele‚Äôs credibility, despite his source being Steele himself. Iskoff said ‚Äúit‚Äôs self-referential‚Äù and ‚Äúit seems a little odd that they would cite the Yahoo News story about the matter they are investigating themselves based on the same material that had been separately presented to the FBI.‚Äù

Isikoff personally met with Steele in person in September 2016. Also at the meeting was Isikoff‚Äôs ‚Äúold friend‚Äù Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS. The three of them talked about Trump and Russia and Steele provided him with some of his research.

Isikoff now admits that everyone should have been more cautious about Steele‚Äôs information. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs fair to say that all of us should have approached this, in retrospect, with more skepticism, particularly when we didn‚Äôt know where it was coming from,‚Äù Isikoff said. ‚ÄúWe knew that Steele compiled it, but that Steele did not hear these allegations himself. Somebody else heard them from others and then passed them along. That‚Äôs thirdhand stuff, which is not usually the kind you want for publishing.‚Äù

In the FISA renewal applications, which spanned until June 2017, the FBI continued to insist that it didn‚Äôt think Steele was Isikoff‚Äôs source even though Steele himself had said that he was by the spring of 2017.

The Wall Street Journal report says ‚Äúinvestigators have also asked about an internal FBI evaluation of Steele‚Äôs credibility that found his reporting had been ‚Äòminimally corroborated‚Äô even as it also said he had provided information ‚Äòof value‚Äô to the U.S. intelligence community.‚Äù The report says ‚Äúthe evaluation was reflected in a ‚Äòhuman source validation report‚Äô written by a unit of the FBI after the bureau cut off its relationship with Steele in October 2016‚Ä¶ because of his disclosures to the media about his work for the FBI.‚Äù

Heavily redacted FBI records unearthed through Freedom of Information Act litigation in 2018 show that Steele was cut off as a confidential human source because of his improper disclosures to third parties and that his ‚Äúhandling agent advised [Steele] that [Confidential Human Source] was not to operate to obtain any intelligence whatsoever on behalf of the FBI.‚Äù

According to a New York Times report from April, the FBI reached out to some of Steele‚Äôs foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier‚Äôs contents may have been based upon ‚Äúrumors and hearsay‚Äù which were ‚Äúpassed from source to source.‚Äù The agents believed that some of Steele‚Äôs information may have even been based upon ‚ÄúRussian disinformation.‚Äù

For its part, Fusion GPS told the Washington Examiner that it stands by Steele‚Äôs dossier, claiming that ‚Äúto our knowledge, nothing in the Steele memoranda has been disproven.‚Äù

Journalist Bob Woodward has been calling Steele‚Äôs dossier ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù for more than two years. And former CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman said: ‚ÄúI called what bullshit the dossier was a year and a half ago‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs likely FSB [the successor agency to the KGB] disinformation.‚Äù A number of Steele‚Äôs biggest claims ‚Äî including its allegation from ""Kremlin insiders"" that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had met in Prague with Putin associates and foreign hackers ‚Äî were knocked down by special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Attorney General William Barr told Congress that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the DOJ and the FBI handled the Trump-Russia investigation, and he said that ‚Äúthe people helping me with my review will be working very closely with‚Äù Horowitz.

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would ‚Äúexamine the Justice Department‚Äôs and the FBI‚Äôs compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].‚Äù

Horowitz stated that he would ‚Äúreview information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ‚Äôs and FBI‚Äôs relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.‚Äù This ‚Äúalleged FBI confidential source‚Äù is Steele.

Barr has said Horowitz‚Äôs investigation should be completed in either May or June."
Labor Dispute Opens New Front in Fight to Privatize the VA,http://nymag.com,['Sarah Jones'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/labor-dispute-veterans-affairs-privatization.html,"Robert Wilkie. Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images

During his Senate confirmation hearing, Robert Wilkie, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said he wouldn‚Äôt privatize the VA‚Äôs health-care services. He‚Äôs since repeated that promise to veterans themselves. ‚ÄúThe private sector cannot replicate VA‚Äôs expertise in things like spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, rehabilitative services, prosthetics, audiology, services for the blind, suicide prevention,‚Äù he told members of the American Legion in 2018.

But Wilkie was nominated by President Trump, who has surrounded himself with advocates for the privatization of the VA since taking office. His decision to fire Wilkie‚Äôs predecessor, David Shulkin, an Obama appointee who opposed privatization, may not have had as much to do with Shulkin‚Äôs alleged spending improprieties as it did with months of sustained lobbying against the secretary from allies of Concerned Veterans for America. The Koch-backed advocacy group supports an expansion of private-sector care for veterans ‚Äî and Wilkie, since his confirmation, has deviated little from that goal.

On Wilkie‚Äôs watch, the VA has begun to shrink. (The VA reached out following publication to dispute this, stating: ‚ÄòSince last quarter, VA achieved a net increase of 3,043 employees and maintained a vacancy rate of approximately 11 percent.‚Äù) The department, which provides free or low-cost health care to around 9 million enrolled veterans as part of its mission to support former service members, has nearly 49,000 unfilled vacancies. Meanwhile, the Mission Act, which will expand the VA‚Äôs privatized community-care network for eligible veterans, is scheduled to take effect in June.

Now, a nascent contract dispute between the VA and the American Federation of Government Employees may bolster fears that Wilkie‚Äôs reforms are privatization in all but name. On Thursday, the VA submitted a proposal to renegotiate its collective-bargaining agreement with the AFGE, which represents around 250,000 department employees. The department‚Äôs proposals would drastically reduce the amount of time employees are allowed to spend on union business during the workday, among other changes. In a press release, the VA said it hoped to reduce staffers‚Äô union time from 1 million hours per year to around 10,000, a change that would, it claimed, direct ‚Äúmore than $48 million per year‚Äù back to aiding veterans. The press release was otherwise light on detail, though in it, Secretary Wilkie described this as ‚Äúa reset‚Äù of the VA‚Äôs relationship with the AFGE. ‚ÄúWith VA facing thousands of vacancies, these proposals could add more than 1 million man-hours per year back into our work force ‚Äî a vital influx of resources that would make an almost immediate difference for veterans and the employees who care for them,‚Äù Wilkie said.

These restrictions on union time would make it difficult, if not quite impossible, for staff to conduct legally permissible union business during work hours. And the VA‚Äôs plan goes even further. According to a copy of the proposal package provided by the union, the VA wants to eliminate 28 provisions of the department‚Äôs current collective-bargaining agreement. Union representatives would lose their offices inside VA facilities, and could no longer use VA equipment to carry out their duties. The department‚Äôs new contract with AFGE would last for ten years, but only the VA could make changes to it during that time; the union would be prohibited from doing the same. The VA seeks to weaken the grievance procedures set out in its previous agreement with AFGE. Communication between the union and the department would have to take place entirely at the national level. Employees who need to file grievances, for example, would no longer be able to do so at the local level. The union believes this could create a bottleneck that would slow the processing of employee grievances. The union also alleges that at least two of the VA‚Äôs proposals ‚Äî to require the union to pay for the time management spends on union business, and to pay attorneys‚Äô fees to the VA ‚Äî would violate existing labor law.

Contacted for comment, VA press secretary Curt Cashour directed New York to a May 2 editorial published by Wilkie on InsideSources.com. In it, the secretary said that the department‚Äôs reforms would ‚Äúmake sure that the contract does not interfere with the department‚Äôs ability to take action against poor performers‚Äù and eliminate language in the previous agreement that ‚Äúhas effectively allowed the union to co-manage the VA.‚Äù

Asked specifically about the union‚Äôs claim that some of the proposals are illegal, Cashour said, ‚ÄúWhen department employees and attorneys ‚Äî at the demand of the union ‚Äî are required to cease providing medical care and support for veteran services, to prepare for and engage in union-demanded activities such as grievances, disciplinary appeals, or arbitration, it‚Äôs only fair for the union to reimburse taxpayers for this time spent not taking care of veterans.‚Äù

David Cann, AFGE‚Äôs director of field services and education, told New York on Monday that the VA‚Äôs proposals ‚Äúare unique.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm seeing out of the VA is the most both-barrels anti-union effort that I‚Äôve seen in my time with AFGE.‚Äù The VA‚Äôs proposals resemble executive orders that Trump signed last May. One would have significantly reduced the amount of time that federal workers are allowed to spend on union business. AFGE sued the administration and won an injunction in August that blocked certain provisions of the orders from going forward. The Trump administration appealed the injunction, and the case is ongoing. ‚ÄúFor whatever reason, the VA is acting in contravention of that injunction, and proposing limitations on the rights of members that are exactly the same as what the court has said they‚Äôre not allowed to do,‚Äù Cann said.

The VA‚Äôs proposal package seems to be ‚Äúa clear case of failing to bargain in good faith, which is an unfair labor practice under the relevant statute,‚Äù Joseph Slater, the Eugene M. Balk professor of law and values at the University of Toledo, told New York in an email. Slater, who has reviewed a summary of the VA‚Äôs proposals, added that provisions ‚Äústrike me as illegal bargaining proposals on their own,‚Äù including the provision that would allow only the VA to make changes to the contract once it‚Äôs in place. ‚ÄúThe ten-year duration is clearly trying to lock in extreme terms for an unusually long time, which is commonly held to be bargaining in bad faith. Eliminating procedures and appropriate arrangements generally seems legally dicey to me too, as those are statutory rights,‚Äù he continued.

‚ÄúI could go on,‚Äù he concluded, ‚Äúbut this is a set of radical, unworkable proposals that no union would agree to.‚Äù

The VA isn‚Äôt the first federal agency to call for a draconian renegotiation of its collective-bargaining agreement with AFGE. The Social Security Administration has proposed similar changes to its union contract, down to the removal of union representatives from their offices inside SSA buildings. Contract negotiations with AFGE may become not just a backdoor for the Trump administration to get around the injunction, but the locus at which its antipathy to the federal workforce meets its hostility toward unions.

The first two years of Trump‚Äôs presidency have already been difficult for the federal workforce. One of Trump‚Äôs first actions as president was to implement a temporary federal hiring freeze. He‚Äôs overseen two significant government shutdowns, the most recent of which lasted for five weeks and cost federal employees two pay periods. (Though federal workers received back pay after the government reopened, many federal contractors did not.) The VA isn‚Äôt the only federal agency facing a staffing crisis, either. Though the status of the VA‚Äôs workforce has a clear, disproportionate effect on veterans, so too does the state of the federal workforce at large. A third of federal employees are veterans. Cann told New York that AFGE believes that figure is even higher for employees of the VA.

But the fact that Wilkie is pursuing certain conflict with AFGE, instead of filling his department‚Äôs vacancies, kindles a fear specific to the VA: that the secretary intends to let the VA atrophy and funnel more and more veterans into private medical care. ‚ÄúIf we really want to fix the VA so badly, let‚Äôs start hiring, and fill up some of those 49,000 [staff] vacancies,‚Äù Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at a recent town hall co-sponsored by National Nurses United and CommonDefense, a progressive veterans‚Äô advocacy group.

There‚Äôs no question that the VA suffers from systemic problems. Twenty-four veterans have died by suicide on VA campuses during the last 18 months, the Military Times reported in April. The department‚Äôs tech problems are so pronounced that implementation of the Mission Act may prove disastrous. According to ProPublica, a planned tool to help determine which veterans are eligible for private community care is so unreliable that ‚Äúit threatens to disrupt the health care of about 75,000 veterans every day.‚Äù Nevertheless, a joint study from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and the White River Junction VA Medical Center found that VA medical facilities achieve health-care outcomes that are consistently as good as, or even better than, private alternatives in 121 regional markets. In polling, veterans themselves reliably oppose privatization, though they‚Äôre less hostile to the notion of some community-based choices as a supplement to the VA‚Äôs public services. The American Legion, like every other major veterans‚Äô service organization, opposes privatization of the VA.

Alexander McCoy, the political director of Common Defense and a former Marine, told New York that his organization is watching the labor dispute closely. ‚ÄúThe secretary of Veterans Affairs and Trump are trying to use veterans as props for union-busting,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about improving our health care or fixing problems with the VA. They‚Äôre punishing workers for their own campaign to starve the VA.‚Äù

Kate Hoit, an Army veteran affiliated with VoteVets, a progressive organization that has repeatedly sued the Trump administration for its handling of the VA, agreed. ‚ÄúFirst and foremost, our concerns rest in the fact that the changes in the collective bargaining agreement will make the VA a worse place to work and therefore result in worse care for veterans,‚Äù Hoit said in a statement to New York.

Private-sector unions, too, worry that the VA‚Äôs contract proposals belie its commitment to privatization. Sara Nelson, who heads the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and called for a general strike in response to the latest government shutdown, said that it‚Äôs ‚Äúno surprise‚Äù that the Trump administration would target AFGE‚Äôs VA members, who have traditionally enjoyed a robust contract. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all a direct attack on VA workers and their union,‚Äù Nelson said in a statement to New York. ‚ÄúWhy? Because they are the ones demanding accountability at the VA, they are the ones blowing the whistle on waste and fraud, they are the ones standing in the way of privatization. That‚Äôs the ultimate goal: privatize the VA so the giant health care corporations can reap the billions spent on caring for our veterans, ignoring the fact that veterans overwhelmingly prefer the VA to private healthcare.‚Äù

AFGE will likely need all the support it can get. Slater, the law professor, cautioned that if the union wanted to file an unfair labor practices charge against the VA, it may have difficulty finding relief. Trump took until March of this year to nominate a general counsel to the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority, the body responsible for addressing labor grievances against federal agencies. Unions have already criticized Trump‚Äôs FLRA pick, Catherine Bird. National Treasury Employees Union president Tony Reardon told Bloomberg Law that Bird, who formerly worked in the office of general counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services, was ‚Äúdirectly involved in the agency‚Äôs bad faith bargaining last year.‚Äù Reardon added that his union has filed four grievances against HHS for unfair labor practices. Even if Bird is confirmed, Bloomberg Law said she‚Äôll have to process an extensive backlog of cases because the office has been vacant for two years.

Federal law also prohibits VA employees from going on strike, which further restricts AFGE‚Äôs options as it navigates contract negotiations. But Cann said that the union is considering other forms of direct action. ‚ÄúGetting people involved, doing petitions, doing informational rallies, applying pressure on the agency by pointing out their hypocrisy and their anti-union animus, reaching out to the handful of friends we have on the Hill, we plan on doing all of that,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre counting on employees who care so much about the work they do as caregivers to veterans to be willing to stand up, and get involved in this campaign, and object to having their voices silenced.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs you have recognized, the Committee‚Äôs request is unprecedented, and it presents serious constitutional questions, the resolution of which may have lasting consequences for all taxpayers,‚Äù the letter read.

Mnuchin told the Massachusetts Democrat he'd relied on the advice of the Justice Department. He concluded that the department was ‚Äúnot authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Department of Justice has informed us that it intends to memorialize its advice in a published legal opinion as soon as practicable.

The move, which was expected, is sure to set in motion a legal battle over Trump‚Äôs tax returns. The likely options available to Democrats would be to subpoena the Internal Revenue Service for the returns or to file a lawsuit.

Neal originally demanded access to Trump‚Äôs tax returns in early April under a law that said the IRS ‚Äúshall furnish‚Äù the returns of any taxpayer to a handful of top lawmakers, including the chair of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.

The White House and the president‚Äôs attorneys declined to comment on the deadline to turn over Trump‚Äôs returns. Trump already has signaled he has no intention of turning over the much-coveted records.

State Department Continues Fight to Strip Gay Couple‚Äôs Two-Year-Old Son of Birthright Citizenship,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-continues-fight-to-strip-gay-couples-two-year-old-son-of-birthright-citizenship,"Ever since twins Aiden and Ethan Dvash-Banks were born in Toronto in September 2016, they have shared everything‚Äîthe same button nose, the same swoopy haircut, the same pug/terrier mix London. But for years, the U.S. State Department has fought an escalating legal battle to ensure that they don‚Äôt share one important thing: American citizenship.

Although Aiden and Ethan‚Äôs fathers, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, have been married since 2010, only Andrew is an American citizen. While that would be enough for children in a heterosexual marriage to qualify for U.S. citizenship while born abroad, the State Department has held the Dvash-Bankses to a different standard, requiring the family to undergo DNA testing to establish that Aiden‚Äîbut not Ethan‚Äîwas the biological son of a U.S. citizen.

The boys‚Äô parents sued, arguing in federal court that proving a biological connection between a child and a U.S. citizen parent isn‚Äôt required to extend birthright citizenship from a married parent to a child, and in February, the judge ruled in their favor.

‚ÄúThe basis for the State Department‚Äôs imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation‚Äù of existing immigration law, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter wrote in a decision issued in February, dismissing the department‚Äôs attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples ‚Äúunilateral.‚Äù

But on Monday, the State Department appealed that decision, continuing a years-long bid to strip Ethan of his citizenship.

‚ÄúOnce again, the State Department is refusing to recognize Andrew and Elad‚Äôs rights as a married couple. The government‚Äôs decision to try to strip Ethan of his citizenship is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and morally reprehensible,‚Äù said Aaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system. Morris successfully argued in federal court that a policy requiring genetic testing for the children of same-sex binational couples created a new double standard for citizenship: one for the children of gay couples and one for the children of straight couples.

After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriage in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance declaring that ‚Äújust as [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] applies all relevant laws to determine the validity of an opposite-sex marriage, we will apply all relevant laws to determine the validity of a same-sex marriage.‚Äù

In response to a request for comment on the appeal, and on whether it plans to require DNA testing of all binational married couples in order to establish a biological relationship and thereby to establish birthright citizenship, a State Department spokesperson said that the department ‚Äúdoes not comment on pending litigation.‚Äù

Morris also noted that in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the State Department has filed its appeal, the standard of using DNA testing to ensure a biological relationship between a child and a married U.S. citizen parent in order to confer citizenship has already been soundly rejected.

‚ÄúThis is settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which has already established that citizenship may pass from a married parent to a child regardless of whether or not they have a biological relationship,‚Äù Morris said.

Despite that precedent, Aiden and Ethan‚Äôs fathers are still deeply concerned with the State Department‚Äôs decision to appeal the case.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre outraged that the State Department is so intent on harming our family and the LGBTQ community,‚Äù Andrew and Elad said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe fight is not over, and we will not rest until our family is treated fairly and equally. Nothing can tear us apart. The four of us are unbreakable.‚Äù"
Vietnam veteran files federal lawsuit to remove Bible on display at VA hospital,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vietnam-war-veteran-files-federal-lawsuit-to-remove-bible-at-veterans-hospital,"A Vietnam War veteran filed a federal lawsuit against the Manchester Veterans Affairs Medical Center this week in an attempt to remove a Bible on display at the New Hampshire facility.

James Chamberlain, who served in the U.S. Air Force, is a Christian but believes the Bible in the VA facility‚Äôs lobby violates the First Amendment. According to the lawsuit, the Constitution bars the government from giving ‚Äúfavoritism to one religious belief at the expense of others.‚Äù

""Despite his personal beliefs, he is offended that other people's beliefs are not represented,"" Chamberlain's attorney Larry Vogelman said, according to NBC Boston . ""To isolate one religion and hold it out as the official religion is just wrong.""

The Bible, which was carried by a prisoner of war in World War II, is featured at the Missing Man Table that remembers missing veterans and prisoners of war. But the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday, claims that the original table tradition didn‚Äôt feature the Bible and that the table should honor all who served.

The Bible was initially removed in January after the Military Religious Freedom Foundation said that 14 veterans of multiple faiths opposed its placement. However, the Bible was put back in February.

Curt Cashour, a spokesperson for the VA, said in a statement that the VA would not be ‚Äúbullied‚Äù moving forward.

""This lawsuit ‚Äì backed by a group known for questionable practices and unsuccessful lawsuits ‚Äì is nothing more than an attempt to force VA into censoring a show of respect for America‚Äôs POW/MIA community. Make no mistake: VA will not be bullied on this issue,"" Cashour said."

Josh Kaul defeated Attorney General Brad Schimel in November as part of a Democratic sweep of all statewide offices.

In his first four months in office, Kaul has fulfilled his campaign promise to withdraw Wisconsin out of a multistate lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act.

He has also switched sides in lawsuits over whether the state Department of Natural Resources can legally impose tighter regulations on factory farms and high-capacity wells, re-aligning with environmental advocacy group Clean Wisconsin.

Republicans say Kaul can't be trusted to defend GOP-passed laws. But Kaul says he's not being ideological, he just views the law differently.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced the decision to revert back to originally proposed standards for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in a letter to the state Department of Ecology on Friday. In 2016, federal authorities established a standard of 7 parts per quadrillion as acceptable for the chemical that was commonly found in industrial and commercial products until the 1960s, and continues to leech into the state‚Äôs waterways.

‚ÄúUpon reexamination, the EPA concludes that (the previous standards) are protective of its designated uses and based on sound science,‚Äù wrote Chris Hlidack, the EPA‚Äôs regional administrator, in the letter.

The EPA‚Äôs decision Friday returns the standard to one endorsed by state regulators three years ago, but one that conservation groups and native tribes say is too lenient to protect the health of those who eat large quantities of fish exposed to the chemical.

‚ÄúThe science on this issue has not changed; there is absolutely no logical reason to change the law,‚Äù said Jerry White Jr., the Spokane Riverkeeper, in a statement. ‚ÄúThis decision dramatically increases the amount of toxics allowed in Washington waters, including the Spokane River. It places serious, disproportionate, and preventable health risks on those who eat fish from our river, especially tribal communities in our Basin.‚Äù

The change was immediately requested by industry groups in and around Spokane that would have had to accelerate their cleanup processes to meet the new standard. That included Greater Spokane Inc. and the Northwest Pulp & Paper Association. One of the members of that trade group is Inland Empire Paper Co., a subsidiary of the Cowles Co., which also publishes The Spokesman-Review.

Local lawmakers had also raised concerns about the standard promulgated by the EPA. Last year, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers added a provision to a federal government spending bill that would have prevented the EPA from enforcing the standard. Mayor David Condon said the city would be working toward what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äúvariance‚Äù to the new rule, arguing that residents were footing the bill for a massive overhaul of the Spokane‚Äôs water treatment plant through utility payments based on the state standard.

‚ÄúThe City of Spokane remains committed to protecting water quality in the Spokane River, and our citizens are making a generational investment in river health,‚Äù Condon said in a statement Friday. ‚ÄúThe City was not informed or consulted about the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs decision today to approve the Water Quality Standards proposed by the Washington state Department of Ecology back in 2016.‚Äù

The Department of Ecology said through a spokeswoman that it received the letter Friday and was working with the offices of Gov. Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson on next steps. Both have been critical and lodged legal challenges against environmental moves made in the Donald Trump administration.

Rick Eichstaedt, the former director of the Center for Justice and the director of Gonzaga Law School‚Äôs Environmental Law Clinic, said EPA‚Äôs decision will almost certainly be challenged legally.

‚ÄúThis is going to be a really contentious rulemaking process,‚Äù Eichstaedt said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to result in litigation.‚Äù

The letter indicates the federal standards will remain in place until ‚Äúa notice and comment process through a separate notice of proposed rulemaking to withdraw‚Äù the federal rules takes place. The EPA quickly removed a document posted online last month indicating such talks would be moving forward, saying they were published in error."

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior Department officials who have blocked lawmakers from interviewing agency employees about whether Secretary David Bernhardt was complying with recordkeeping laws.

The committee‚Äôs threat ratchets up the pressure on Interior in the latest skirmish between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the lawmakers' complaints that agencies are withholding documents and ignoring requests to send senior officials to testify before Congress.

‚ÄúPlease be advised that any official at the Department who ‚Äòprohibits or prevents‚Äô or ‚Äòattempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent‚Äô any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,‚Äù Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a prepared statement.

Cummings also complained in the letter to Cole Rojewski, Interior's director of congressional and legislative affairs, that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations.

Oversight has sought interviews with Interior‚Äôs administrative assistant to the deputy secretary, scheduling and advance director, executive assistant to the office of the deputy secretary and acting chief of staff and associate deputy secretary. The committee asked Interior to respond to the interview requests by Friday.

Cummings is also using the the threat of withholding salaries to force Commerce Department officials to appear before it for interviews relating plans to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.

In his statement, Cummings pointed to a 2016 GAO report that said a department‚Äôs budget ‚Äúappropriation was not available to pay the salary of a federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress.‚Äù

Oversight and the National Archives and Records Administration are investigating allegations that Bernhardt was keeping meetings off his official calendars and not supplying information about meetings to the public.

Interior refused the committee‚Äôs previous requests to interview several staffers, telling Oversight that the interviews ‚Äúare unnecessary at this time,‚Äù according to a letter the committee sent to Interior today.

At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the Interior Department budget on Tuesday, Bernhardt defended preventing the employees from talking to the committee, saying ""it‚Äôs not the appropriate time"" for those interviews, and that his decision was designed to protect career employees.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking about individual employees who have long standing in the department,‚Äù he said in response to questioning from Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). ‚ÄúWe have wonderful career employees here ... they‚Äôve never had this happen to them in their careers.‚Äù

Lawrence shot back that Congress was responsible for oversight of the agency.

""You have been requested to comply. With all due to respect, you are required to comply,‚Äú she said.

Besides refusing interviews, Interior has declined to provide documents the Oversight and House Natural Resources committees requested on March 13, according Cummings‚Äò letter. The department instead offered tens of thousands of pages of documents unrelated to the committee's request, the letter states.
