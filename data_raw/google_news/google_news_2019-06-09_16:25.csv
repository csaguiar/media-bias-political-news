I Helped Obama Win in 2012. Now Trump Is Using the Same Playbook.,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Ben Labolt', 'Former National Press Secretary For President Obama S Reelection Campaign']",06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/trump-could-win-2020-heres-what-democrats-can-do/591265/,"Simultaneously, Trump has begun to hold rallies in battleground states across the country, dipping into media markets where he can fire up his base, such as Panama City, Florida, and battleground markets, such as Green Bay, Wisconsin. Many of these visits lead to localized polling bumps that last for weeks.

Look no further than the Trump campaign’s press secretary’s Twitter feed to watch daily footage of the campaign reconnecting with supporters and asking them to engage its networks. Trump’s campaign manager is raising general-election funds and appearing before influential audiences.

Meanwhile, neither the Democratic National Committee nor any of the major Democratic super PACs are live with any notable broadcast or digital-advertising budget in battleground states targeted toward general-election swing voters. The 23 Democratic presidential campaigns are naturally focused on proximate targets, such as winning early states and meeting the DNC’s fundraising thresholds. As a partner at Bully Pulpit Interactive, a communications and digital-marketing agency that has in the past served as an advertiser for Democratic presidential campaigns and super PACs, I follow this world closely. I’ve seen a number of campaigns begin to spend on digital advertising, but their ads are not focused on messages that will erode support for Trump. That’s not the role they are expected to play at this stage.

Democrats face the urgent necessity of countering the Trump campaign in the battleground states. The leading Democratic presidential candidates have raised less this year than they did in 2007. (In the first quarter, Senator Bernie Sanders topped out at $18.2 million, followed by Senator Kamala Harris at $12 million. In the first quarter of 2007, Hillary Clinton raised $26.1 million, and Barack Obama raised $25.7 million.) Democratic donors may be sitting on the sidelines because the field is wide and they are undecided. But if so, that also represents an opportunity. They could fund an effort that turns to the general election today even if they haven’t picked their primary horse.

There is no dearth of advertising material to air. The Chinese are importing soybeans from Russia and Brazil instead of Iowa and Ohio. Trump is steadily unwinding protections for LGBTQ Americans. Taxes have gone up on some voters who pay state income taxes after Republicans repealed the state and local tax exemption. And Democrats are again fighting to protect health-care benefits. The content writes itself.

What worries me is that I’ve implemented many aspects of the strategy that the Trump campaign has been executing. The groundwork for President Obama’s 2012 victory against Mitt Romney was laid in 2011. In November of that year, The New York Times Magazine ran a cover story called “Is Obama Toast?” declaring that Obama had a 17 percent chance of winning reelection based on the economic indicators that had been historically predictive of whether the president wins reelection."
"Trump is 'perfectly happy' to hit China with new tariffs if Xi meeting doesn't go well, Mnuchin says",https://www.cnbc.com,['Everett Rosenfeld'],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/09/mnuchin-trump-will-decide-about-china-tariffs-after-meeting-with-xi.html,"U.S. President Donald Trump walks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Washington, U.S., April 21, 2017.

U.S. President Donald Trump will make a decision about whether to slap China with more tariffs after meeting with his Chinese counterpart later this month in Japan. That's according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who told CNBC on Sunday that the American leader will be trying to determine if Chinese President Xi Jinping is willing to head ""in the right direction"" on a deal to reshape the trade and commercial relationships between the world's top two economies. ""We're going to need to see action, and President Trump is going to need to make sure he's clear that we're moving in the right direction to a deal,"" Mnuchin told CNBC's Nancy Hungerford. ""The president will make a decision after the meeting."" Trump has previously indicated he expects to plan his next trade war moves after that G-20 meeting. ""If China wants to move forward with the deal, we're prepared to move forward on the terms we've done. If China doesn't want to move forward, then President Trump is perfectly happy to move forward with tariffs to re-balance the relationship,"" he said. The two presidents last met in December 2018 in Buenos Aires — already several months into their escalating trade war. At that time, Xi and Trump agreed to suspend planned increases in tariffs while both sides redoubled negotiating efforts. The subsequent few months saw no further escalations amid repeated rounds of talks in both Washington and Beijing, but that pause ended in May when Trump unexpectedly said on Twitter that his administration would be levying new taxes on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods — and he threatened even more to come.

'We've stopped negotiating'

American officials have repeatedly claimed that action was in response to China attempting to renegotiate parts of a deal it had previously agreed to — which Beijing has denied — and the prospect of additional tariffs on that $325 billion worth of Chinese products has hung over the bilateral relationship for the last month. ""We made enormous progress, I think we had a deal that was almost 90% done. China wanted to go backwards on certain things,"" Mnuchin said. ""We've stopped negotiating."" Where the countries go from here, according to the Treasury secretary, is up to Trump to decide when he and Xi meet in Osaka, Japan at the end of June. ""In the case of Buenos Aires, we came out of that, we had direction from the two presidents, (Trump) put the increases on hold. The president will make a decision after the meeting,"" Mnuchin said. ""I believe if China is willing to move forward on the terms that we were discussing, we'll have an agreement. If they're not, we will proceed with tariffs,"" he added.

The thorny issues

Mnuchin weighed in on several of the thorniest subjects thought to be separating the American and Chinese sides from a deal. For one, he said that the issue of removing China's so-called non-tariff barriers to foreign companies succeeding within its borders remains central to the U.S. position on the talks. ""In negotiating our agreement, one of the big parts of the agreement has always been about non-tariff barriers, is about forced technology transfer. These are very important issues to us, and critical to any agreement,"" Mnuchin said. ""These are issues where we've made a lot of progress, and any agreement we have, we'll need to be certain that that's included."" American officials and businesses have long argued that China's official and unofficial rules put non-Chinese firms at a disadvantage in the country. One of the most frequently cited examples is a ""forced tech transfer"" regime — in which companies are coerced into sharing their advanced technology and know-how with Chinese organizations in exchange for market access. Trump has also suggested that he may want his negotiating teams to pick up the issue of China's currency, but Mnuchin on Sunday dismissed the notion that Beijing is actively keeping the yuan low in an effort to win a trade advantage over the likes of the U.S. Instead, he said, any weakness now seen in the Chinese currency is the result of downward economic pressures — in part due to Trump's tariffs on the country. ""I do think their currency has been under pressure,"" the Treasury secretary said. ""There's no question that, as we put on tariffs, people will move their manufacturing outside of China, into other areas, and that's going to have a very negative impact on their economy. And I think you see that reflected in the currency."" Another topic that has raised tensions between Beijing and Washington is Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. The U.S. government has cracked down on the tech firm, effectively blacklisting it from doing business with American businesses, on the basis of claims it is a security risk. The rationale, according to the Trump administration is that the firm's involvement in sensitive networking technology could potentially be leveraged by Beijing for spying or other malicious actions. Both China and the company have denied such a risk exists. Mnuchin emphasized that the Huawei blacklisting is solely a national security issue, and isn't a non-tariff front of the trade war — even though Trump has suggested that the telecom company could get wrapped into a wider deal. ""They're separate from trade: Both we and China have acknowledged that in our discussions,"" he said. ""Now, of course, President Trump, when he has the meeting, to the extent he gets certain comfort on Huawei or other issues, obviously we can talk about national security issues, but these are separate issues, they're not being linked to trade."" He emphasized the U.S. claim — central to recruiting allies in its effort to control the spread of Huawei tech — that Trump's prior comments do not reveal an effort to gain trade leverage over Beijing: ""I think what the president is saying is, if we move forward on trade, that perhaps he'll be willing to do certain things on Huawei if he gets comfort from China on that, and certain guarantees.""

Warren's popularity has inched up alongside her focus on churning out detailed policy plans. | Paul Sancya/AP Photo 2020 elections Trump backlash sparks avalanche of 2020 policy proposals The sheer multitude of policy proposals is staggering.

In the last week alone, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren released trillion dollar-plus climate change plans, while Jay Inslee added to his voluminous set of tracts on the issue.

Julián Castro unveiled a wide-ranging proposal to address “overaggressive” policing, Beto O’Rourke produced a raft of government and electoral reforms and Cory Booker unfurled a housing plan heavy on land use, estate tax and federal grant rules.

In a presidential primary system that doesn’t always reward substantive policy debates, the 2020 contest is beginning to stand out for featuring an unlikely renaissance of ideas. Twelve hours rarely passes without a candidate offering some new plan.

“Right now, the primary is an ideas contest,” R.L. Miller, founder of the super PAC Climate Hawks Vote, said. “Jay Inslee’s policies are getting talked about, even if he himself is not rising much in the polls. Kamala Harris is putting out some very bread and butter, kitchen table policies. One of the ways in which candidates stand out right now … is to write smart, compelling policies. And that’s why every day or so it seems like another candidate has released another policy.”

One reason for the rush of policy proposals is Warren, the Massachusetts senator whose popularity has inched up alongside her focus on churning out detailed policy plans. It’s even created a fundraising opportunity for her campaign: the sale of “Warren Has a Plan for That” T-shirts.

“Now the others are saying, ‘I’ve got to get me some positions, too,’” said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion.

But broader forces are at work, as well. Never before has a presidential primary opened with an incumbent president who is as loathed by Democrats as is Donald Trump — or who has so dramatically altered the policy landscape on issues ranging from climate change and health care to immigration and trade. At the same time, the president is famously disinterested in policy details.

For brooding Democrats, the primary field’s position papers are an emotional refuge — this summer’s dreamy must reads.

“I think that what is happening is the voters are taking the policy proposals as visions of hope after the 2½ years of Trump, where everything has been so negative, so horrific,” Ray Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said. “Voters are starving for some positive, hopeful, aspirational things to look forward to.”

Doug Herman, a California-based Democratic strategist, put it this way: “If you’re looking at the plans as a solution, then today is dystopia and tomorrow is utopia.”

The yearning for changed policies in the White House — regardless of the Democrat shouldering them — is so acute that when 14 presidential contenders traveled to California recently for the Democratic State Convention, supporters of Bernie Sanders and Warren temporarily suspended rival demonstrations to join together in a chant for ""Medicare for All.""

For candidates still introducing themselves to voters, the substance of a plan can carry significant political weight. Biden’s $1.7 trillion climate proposal served to blunt some criticism from the party’s left flank, though it inadvertently drew unfavorable attention when it appeared to include passages copied from existing documents.

Harris, a California senator, has used policy proposals involving teacher pay and maternal mortality to reinforce her credentials as an advocate for working people and women — especially women of color. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota put infrastructure investment at the center of her campaign with her first major policy proposal. And even long-shot candidates can rely on policy proposals to generate some media attention — as John Delaney received for his climate change proposal and plan to create a national service program for young people.

The sheer multitude of plans is staggering, reflecting both the breadth of the 24-candidate Democratic field and the lack of any one dominant issue within it.

“Obviously the economy’s important,” Miringoff said. “But I don’t think there’s one thing that’s driving the electorate, other than Donald Trump, and there are a lot of things Democrats are interested in.”

How closely voters are scrutinizing the policy proposals they come across is unclear. There is also some risk to laying out detailed proposals because it offers a fixed target in the general election — particularly if it contains controversial elements.

After the midterm elections last year, only 9 percent of Democrats listed policies as reasons for votes they had cast that cycle, with a majority of voters citing partisan concerns instead, according to a Pew Research Center survey from November.

But Democratic voters appear to want their candidates to have plans. And they have frowned on those who are slow to introduce them. O’Rourke, despite once writing a book about legalizing marijuana and espousing specific positions on any number of issues early in his campaign, was widely perceived as light on policy before releasing a robust climate plan in April. He has now released plans, as well, on immigration, reproductive rights, and government and electoral reform — a plan that is divided into three parts with footnotes and nearly 30 key points.

“The one thing you’ll always hear in focus group research is, ‘I want to see the plan,’” Herman said. “But what that translates to in real life is that they want to see you hold up a stack of papers and say, ‘This is my plan.’ Most voters don’t really care what’s in it. They just want to know you have a plan.”

That is a departure from the most recent presidential election, which was defined less by policy than by Trump’s bombast and Hillary Clinton’s emails. Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina-based Democratic strategist who worked for Clinton's 2016 campaign, said “policy got lost in the conversation because the current president … wanted to have personality conversations instead of policy conversations.”

Now, Seawright said, “I think the American people are so hungry and thirsty for [policy] that I think it’s the candidate’s job to really feed the electorate’s thirst for a real policy agenda that will have an impact.”

That is, if the interest holds.

Paul Maslin, a top Democratic pollster, said it is possible that voters next year will be especially interested in policy. But it is also possible the interest is temporary, the function of a “monster of content that has to be filled somehow.”

“There’s so many things spinning around that are part of the game that you have to fill them, and it’s sort of like, let’s do policy now, because there’s only so much viral campaigning or town halls on CNN or door to door in Iowa or New Hampshire or driving in the country,” Maslin said. “I don’t know that the policy push means that’s going to be a crucial criterion that’s going to determine people’s votes next January or February, or whether it will just be one building block on a very complex road.”"
Trump's lonely signature at the top of a D-Day proclamation is making the rounds on social media after other world leaders signed at the bottom,https://www.businessinsider.com,['David Choi'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-signature-dday-letter-europe-2019-6,"President Donald Trump's ubiquitous signature is making rounds on social media after it was spotted on a D-Day proclamation signed by world leaders this week.

Trump observed the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion at Portsmouth, England, with other leaders on Thursday and signed a D-Day proclamation to ""ensure that the sacrifices of the past are never in vain and never forgotten.""

Allied forces invaded Normandy, France on June 6, 1944. Roughly 2,500 US troops were killed in what was the largest amphibious invasion in history. Around 2,700 British troops and 946 Canadian troops who also took part in the assault were killed.

""We stand together today to honour the memory of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice on D-Day, and those many millions of men and women who lost their lives during the Second World War, the largest conflict in human history,"" the letter said.

""We commit to work constructively as friends and allies to find common ground where we have differences of opinion and to work together to resolve international tensions peacefully,"" the letter added.

Fifteen world leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, signed the document in blue ink near the bottom of the text.

Trump, however, signed the document in the upper, left-hand corner:

The location of Trump's signature was mocked by some people on social media: ""Guess which world leader signed his name at the top, when everyone else signed at the bottom,"" tweeted Stig Abell, an editor for The Times Literary Supplement.

""Look at the bright side,"" another Twitter user said. ""Thank god he's not a founding father, otherwise he would have signed the top of the Declaration of Independence.""

Other users noted the limited real estate on the document: ""Looks a bit busy down there, and thats [sic] exactly what i would do,"" another tweet said.

Trump's signature has been described as ""rigid"" and has been ridiculed during his presidency. His bold signature, often drawn by a thick, black pen or marker, is frequently seen on official orders.

""The signature since he's been president is more condensed, which means he's more uptight actually,"" handwriting expert Michelle Dresbold said in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Trump previously signaled his disdain for government-ordered pens and professed his love for Sharpie pen. Trump said Sharpie delivered him a special, gold labeled pen.

""I was signing documents with a very expensive pen and it didn't write well,"" Trump said in an Axios interview on HBO. ""It was a horrible pen, and it was extremely expensive.""

""And then I started using just a Sharpie, and I said to myself, well wait a minute, this much writes much better and this cost almost nothing,"" Trump added."
A Drama of Trump’s Own Making Ends With a Familiar Hero,https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/us/politics/a-drama-of-trumps-own-making-ends-with-a-familiar-hero.html,"After withdrawing his tariff threat against Mexico, Mr. Trump expressed displeasure at some of the “reviews” — his word — of the drama. “While the reviews and reporting on our Border Immigration Agreement with Mexico have been very good, there has nevertheless been much false reporting (surprise!) by the Fake and Corrupt News Media, such as Comcast/NBC, CNN, @nytimes & @washingtonpost,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday.

Mr. Trump’s penchant for threats has been characteristic of his administration from the beginning. In the first days of his presidency, he threatened to impose a high import tax on all goods coming into the country, only to retreat amid a storm of protests by business and its allies.

He makes lots of threats he never follows through on. He regularly threatens to sue adversaries and rewrite libel laws to punish news media organizations. He threatened to take away a license from NBC, to eliminate a tax break for the National Football League and to withdraw American troops from South Korea over a trade dispute.

He threatened repeatedly to lock up Hillary Clinton (while bristling when Nancy Pelosi threatened to do the same to him). He threatened to release tapes of his conversations with James B. Comey when he was F.B.I. director, only to later admit there were no such recordings. He threatened to punish General Motors for closing a plant.

Some threats are more apocalyptic. He threatened “fire and fury” against North Korea and “the official end of Iran” if either endangered the United States. His bellicose rhetoric about North Korea led to unprecedented talks with its leader, Kim Jong-un, although a nuclear agreement remains elusive. Iran brought two ships with missiles back to port and unloaded them. His threat to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement yielded negotiations with Mexico and Canada that produced a revised pact.

But threats, idle or otherwise, get him in trouble too. His repeated threats to fire Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, amounted to obstruction of justice, according to his critics. His defense is that they were just threats and he did not actually follow through — or his staff refused to carry out his wishes.

And some targets no longer shrink in the face of threats as they once did. After Mr. Trump last week threatened an economic boycott against AT&T to influence the news coverage of its subsidiary, CNN, it was largely ignored. Not only did investors not flee, but AT&T’s stock is up 5.7 percent since he issued the threat."

Battle over science roils EPA,https://thehill.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447520-battle-over-science-roils-epa,"Environmental Protection Agency is battling its own board of science advisers over its controversial plan to dismiss certain types of scientific research from consideration when issuing rules.

A meeting this week between the agency and some of the nation’s top scientists highlighted the growing rift between the EPA and the scientific community, with members of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) pushing back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public.

Critics say the move would omit important research from EPA consideration and lead to a dramatic rollback of existing regulations.

The SAB, a team of more than 40 of the nation’s top scientists, have been asking to weigh in on the controversial proposal since it was unveiled more than a year ago.

On Wednesday, it said it would do so —despite a request from the agency to review a narrow portion of the rule.

There’s mistrust between the scientific community and EPA’s leaders in the Trump administration.

Then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittEPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage EPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees MORE said the proposal, called Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science, would battle “secret science” when it was first introduced. That spurred scientists to call the proposal “censored science.”

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T Overnight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T Dem lawmakers blast Trump for opening door to mining in Grand Canyon MORE on Wednesday appeared before the board, vowing to improve the relationship between it and the agency.

“I’ll be the first to admit that we have not utilized you in ways that we should. We can and we will do better,” Wheeler said.

But many in the science and environmental community walked away from the meeting disheartened at what they see is the agency’s plan to amplify pet policies and the voices of industry over those from scientists.

“I would say the way that the meeting proceeded kind of contradicted a lot of Administrator Wheeler’s statement at the beginning of the meeting,” said Genna Reed, lead science and policy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Their discussion showed that EPA has not really involved the Science Advisory Board and gotten their advice on several of the deregulatory actions they’ve proposed.”

Scientists have had a number of concerns over how the Trump administration values science, but things really came to a head when the EPA announced the science transparency rule without first consulting the SAB.

The group didn’t find out about the rule until it was publicly announced — a sign, scientists and environmentalists say, the EPA was not interested in meaningful feedback.

The proposal has since proven to be one of the most controversial EPA has written, prompting 600,000 comments. Critics say the rule will exclude some of the most important research from consideration simply because it does not rely on data that can be shared publicly.

The board sent a letter in May of 2018 with a number of questions and asking to weigh in on the rule but it took almost 11 months before the agency responded in April of this year.

Wheeler apologized for the delay Wednesday, saying it was the result of the agency taking time to rethink how it wants to work with the board going forward.

He asked the board to give its thoughts on how the agency can deal with studies that don’t make their data public because it includes confidential business information or personally identifiable information.

The board bucked that request and instead voted to review the proposal in its entirety.

“I’m wondering if any of the comments the EPA received gave you pause about proceeding with that rule?” asked Barbara Morrissey, chair of a separate EPA panel, the Children’s Health Protection Advisory Committee.

“I agree the confidentiality issue in an important and a thorny one so I’m glad that you referred that to us, but I’m concerned about whether the best available science can be ignored because it can’t be replicated for obvious reasons,” she said, nodding to studies of people who were exposed to harmful chemicals.

Watchers of the board were surprised by the vote given how the makeup of the board has changed under the Trump administration.

Fears that the EPA planned to sideline scientists started under Pruitt when he announced that scientists who receive grants from the EPA would not be allowed to serve on the board—a move that knocked out about half of the members sitting on the Science Advisory Board.

Reed with the Union of Concerned Scientists said there are pretty much two types of grants available to scientists—those from the EPA and those from industry. She didn’t understand why getting an EPA grant would present a conflict of interest when an industry grant wouldn’t.

“People who received these no strings attached grants and are experts on some of the most pressing environmental issues are kept from serving on the board,” she said. “It’s clearly a political maneuver to change the composition of these advisory committees.”

Twenty six of the 45 current board members were appointed during the Trump Administration, a huge amount of turnover in a board that otherwise loses under a fifth of its members each year due to term limits.

“I was pleasantly surprised,” Chris Zarba, who served as the former staff coordinators for SAB until last year, said of the vote to review the entire science transparency rule. It’s not that the Trump administration picks aren’t qualified, he said, but a good board needs diversity.

“Think of it this way. If I was picking a world class football team, and I only picked people that were world class, top-ranked players — if all those people I picked were field goal kickers, I’d never win a game,” he said. “It’s hard to question any single member on the board, and by law the administrator can pick anyone they want and any member that is qualified, but the bigger question is: is the entire team well equipped and accurately representing mainstream science? I think we will see how it turns out...There are certainly picks I wouldn't have recommended to the administrator.”

Robert Phalen is one Trump administration pick that has been questioned by scientists for views of air pollution that are out of line with most mainstream scientists. The University of California Irvine professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science that “modern air is a little too clean for optimum health.""

Phalen was one of the few at the meeting to vote against reviewing the science transparency rule in its entirety.

“I can see and respect both sides of the debate on transparency,” he told The Hill in an email. “We need to know if the research used for regulations is free of serious errors, and that requires other scientists having access to the data. On the other hand if the data were widely available it could be improperly used, such as for disclosing private information. So both sides have validity.”

Wheeler said the agency will move forward with something, assuring the board that the administrator will always have the power to give an exemption to an important study, even if it can’t disclose all its data.

“I do fundamentally believe the more information we put out to the public as far as what is the basis for our regulatory decisions, the more sound our decision will be and the more easily understood and accepted by the public our decision will be because they see all the science we are using,” he told the board."

There are no signs that the U.S. economy may be heading into a recession, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Speaking to CNBC on Sunday, the American official expressed nothing but optimism about the state of his country's economy. That analysis comes despite a May jobs figure that came in significantly below expectations and increasing expectations that the Federal Reserve could opt to cut interest rates multiple times this year.

""U.S. growth it still really the bright spot of the world,"" Mnuchin told CNBC's Nancy Hungerford.

""As it relates to the employment numbers, I wouldn't focus on any one number: There's plenty of volatility in these numbers,"" he added. ""We still see the growth in the U.S. as really quite strong.""

In fact, the Treasury secretary said his concerns are about economic falterings beyond American borders. ""We are somewhat concerned about what we see as a slowdown in Europe, China and other areas of the world,"" he said.

And while markets may be forecasting that the U.S. central bank will initiate some easing, Mnuchin suggested that doesn't presage any economic downturn.

""I don't see any signs of a recession. I would say the bond markets are predicting ... a lowering of interest rates. We are in an environment where global interest rates are very low around the world, so I think that's what you're seeing in the U.S. bond markets,"" he said. ""But, no, we see no signs of a recession. We see another strong quarter in the United States.""

Mnuchin declined, citing the principle of central bank independence, to say whether he though the state of the U.S. economy warranted any interest rate cuts from the Fed."

The White House reportedly blocked climate testimony warning of a 'possibly catastrophic' future because it didn't 'jibe' with Trump's policy,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aria Bendix'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-blocked-climate-testimony-trump2019-6,"The White House is engaged in a war of words about climate change.

Last Wednesday, Rod Schoonover, a senior analyst at the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, was barred from submitting his written assessment of the effects of a warming world to the House Intelligence Committee, the Washington Post reported.

Schoonover was scheduled to testify on behalf of the bureau at a climate change hearing held on June 5. Though he was permitted to speak in person, his office's written statement was blocked by White House officials, who thought his scientific claims contradicted the policies of the Trump administration.

In his written testimony, Schoonover predicted that the ""the compounded effects of climate change"" would produce ""significant,"" ""possibly catastrophic,"" harm to the planet. The ability to prevent this future, he wrote, will depend partly on humanity's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

A White House aide told the Washington Post that the testimony didn't ""jibe"" with the administration's official stance on climate change.

The testimony was reportedly opposed by members of the White House's Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, and National Security Council, including William Happer, a National Security Council senior director. Happer, who was dismissed from his post at the Department of Energy in 1993, has stated that most of Earth's warming ""has probably been due to natural causes.""

Before the White House barred Schoonover's written testimony, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research reportedly refused a request from the Trump administration to eliminate certain scientific claims.

Here are a few claims from the written document, first obtained by the Washington Post:

Extreme high temperatures are increasing worldwide, and will continue to increase, due ""largely"" to greenhouse gas emissions.

Today's levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere haven't been seen in ""at least 800,000 years.""

Oceans are becoming more acidic due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Climate change will amplify ""stresses"" such as droughts, floods, and fires.

The effects of climate change could undermine trade routes, the global economy, and the world's food supply.

Climate change will ""almost certainly"" threaten national security in the coming decades.

The crackdown on Schoonover's testimony reflects a larger effort on behalf of the Trump administration to police government reports related to climate change.

In May, the New York Times reported that the administration planned to prevent the federally-funded National Climate Assessment from outlining the ""worst-case scenarios"" if climate change went unchecked.

The Times also reported that the White House aimed to prevent the US Geological Survey from making climate predictions beyond 2040. Scientists expect the worst effects of global emissions to manifest after that time period.

You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/william-barr-doj-return-d-day-shot,"Attorney General William Barr compared his arrival at the Justice Department to the type of situation soldiers faced before D-Day.

""As we've been watching the coverage of June 6, 1944 D-Day, I had the thought that my arrival this time felt a little bit, I think, like jumping into Sainte-Mère-Église on the morning of June 5, trying to figure out where you could land without getting shot,"" he said at the FBI Academy on Friday.

Thursday marked the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the day when Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy in an effort to challenge the Nazi stronghold in Northern Europe.

DEMS UNVEIL CONTEMPT RESOLUTION FOR BARR, MCGAHN OVER SUBPOENA SNUB

President Trump spent that day at Normandy, commemorating the sacrifice of American veterans as he faced impeachment calls and investigations from Democrats in Congress.

“To more than one hundred and seventy veterans of the Second World War who join us today – you are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live,"" he said.

While in Normandy, Trump also spoke with Fox News about the Russia investigation and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who resisted impeachment but also reportedly said she wanted to see Trump in ""prison.""

“She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them,"" he said of Pelosi.

ADAM SCHIFF CONTINUES ATTACK ON BARR, SAYS AG IS 'SECOND MOST DANGEROUS MAN' IN US

Pelosi, who also visited Normandy, refused to discuss impeachment during an interview on D-Day but has repeatedly criticized the administration, especially the attorney general.

Barr, who also served as AG under former President George W. Bush, returned to the Justice Department as Pelosi's party continued pressing the Russia issue and his department faced intense questioning surrounding the investigation.

From the start, Barr was suspected of bias due to a memo he wrote which said he thought Trump was well within his powers when he fired former FBI Director James Comey -- one of the main issues in suspicions surrounding whether the president obstructed justice.

Since his arrival, Barr has taken actions that prompted both media figures and congressional Democrats to accuse him of shielding the president from warranted scrutiny. Barr has also come under fire for pursuing the president's directive to de-classify intelligence material in order to uncover information related to the Russia probe's origins.

HOUSE DEMS TO VOTE ON HOLDING BARR, MCGAHN IN CONTEMPT, SEEKING TO KEEP MUELLER SPOTLIGHT ALIVE

That prompted an inquiry from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who blasted the AG as unworthy of that title. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who also serves on that committee, said that while he was reluctant to impeach Trump, he was ready to pursue that path with both Barr and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

Democrats seemed poised to at least hold Barr in contempt as his Department refused to comply with House Democrats request for more information surrounding the investigation.

Citing Barr's refusal, House Democrats proposed giving congressional investigators the power to ""“to initiate or intervene in any judicial proceeding before a Federal Court.""

State Dept. denies embassies’ requests to fly rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-denies-embassies-requests-fly-rainbow-pride/story?id=63566900,"The State Department has denied multiple U.S. diplomatic posts' requests to fly the rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles during LGBT Pride Month, according to two State Department sources.

The decision is the latest in a string of moves by the agency under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's tenure that LGBT rights activists say discriminate against the community.

Among the U.S. missions overseas that were denied are Brazil, Germany, Israel, and Latvia, one source told ABC News.

The denials fly in the face of the spirit of President Donald Trump's stated push to launch ""a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality."" While the president tweeted last Friday that the White House would ""celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation"" -– making him the first Republican president to do so – his administration has not proclaimed June as LGBT Pride Month.

Pride flags can be displayed elsewhere on a U.S. mission's grounds, but not the official flagpole, according to department guidance distributed in May. Flying any special flag on the official flagpole at a US diplomatic post overseas requires special permission, per the department's Foreign Affairs Manual.

The denial to the U.S. embassy in Germany is particularly striking since Trump's envoy to Berlin is Richard Grenell, one of the highest-ranking openly gay officials in the administration.

""The President's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,"" Grenell told NBC News, which was first to report on the denials.

In 2016, the Obama administration granted ""blanket written authorization from the Under Secretary for Management to display the pride flag on the external-facing flagpole"" during June, according to a cable sent at the time. But that permission was rescinded under the Trump administration, and individual posts had to request permission to fly the pride flag.

In previous years, an official cable was sent from Washington with guidance on how to mark LGBT Pride month and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.

But this year, Pompeo did not approve the cable and instead, the department sent guidance to posts via email that noted it would not transmit an [an official cable for and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia] and LGBT Pride Month this year.""

That meant embassies and consulates could still mark both with whatever actions they wanted. But they were not given encouragement as in years past to engage in outreach with local LGBT communities, and they had to again get permission to fly the Pride flag on the official flagpole.

This time, those requests were denied, the sources said. The State Department has not responded to requests for comment.

LGBT rights activists expressed concern last week after news broke that the State Department was planning to convene a new commission on human rights that was based on ""natural law"" -- often taken to mean a religiously-based interpretation that excludes LGBT rights.

The author of the commission's concept paper is Robert George, a prominent anti-LGBT academic who created the National Organization for Marriage, a source told ABC News.

The department has also come under fire from Congress for a policy that does not automatically grant birthright citizenship to U.S. citizens' children who are born abroad through assisted reproductive technology, which lawmakers say indiscriminately affects gay and lesbian couples.

Under State Department policy, children born overseas must be the biological child of a U.S. citizen to receive citizenship at birth. But citizenship will not be granted to the child if it is born through in vitro fertilization and surrogacy and the genetic parent is not a U.S. citizen, even if the couple is legally married.

In several cases, the children of same-sex couples have had their citizenship denied or delayed even though at least one parent is a U.S. citizen. The State Department is currently fighting lawsuits from two couples on this issue.

Nearly 20 Democratic senators and 80 House members signed two letters to Pompeo Thursday demanding he reverse the policy."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP

Lawyers for the House of Representatives are pushing back on the Justice Department's decision to walk away from a statute barring female genital mutilation — and an unusual argument that lawmakers shouldn't intervene to defend the interests of Congress in the case.

The fight is unfolding over the first federal criminal prosecution for female genital mutilation.

Last year, a judge in Michigan threw out charges against several women who had their daughters circumcised. The Justice Department notified Congress it would not appeal that decision because of constitutional considerations.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote to Congress in April to say female genital mutilation should be ""universally condemned"" but that DOJ had ""reluctantly determined"" it lacked a ""reasonable defense"" of the law following Supreme Court rulings in other cases.

In stepped the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center, which is working with Congress to mount a defense of the statute. The lawyers argued Congress has an interest in the enforcement and defense of the laws it has passed.

The ICAP lawyers were surprised, though, to face opposition from the Justice Department, which only once before has opposed moves by the House and Senate to weigh in on legal disputes.

""It's deeply concerning to see the Justice Department abandoning its defense of this important federal law,"" said Joshua Geltzer, the executive director of ICAP.

""It's further concerning to see the department resisting even the effort by the House of Representatives to offer its own defense of the law it helped to enact. The court should reject the department's effort and at a minimum hear the House's arguments in defense of the statute.""

ICAP is arguing that it wants to weigh in to support the law — which made it a crime to ""knowingly"" circumcise young women who have not yet reached the age of 18 — not to try to force the Justice Department to proceed with a criminal prosecution.

Four of the eight people who were originally charged in Michigan face other criminal allegations, including obstruction of justice.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that half a million women and girls inside the U.S. have suffered genital mutilation or are at risk in the future.

Congress outlawed it, but the Justice Department's Office of Legislative Affairs earlier this year asked Congress to amend that existing law to make clear that it applies to travel between states and when payments or offers are made in connection with the circumcision.

The issue is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which covers territory that includes Michigan.

DOJ distance from Congress

DOJ's position in the female genital mutilation case followed closely behind its refusal to defend President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy legislation, the Affordable Care Act.

In practice, the Justice Department routinely defends legislation passed by Congress so long as there are reasonable arguments that are lawful.

Attorney General William Barr and lawyers inside the White House opposed the decision to walk away from the defense of the health care law, but they were overruled by President Trump.

Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail have criticized that move. But Barr appeared unbothered about their concerns in testimony earlier this year — if the law is sound, they shouldn't be bothered, he said.

""You say that administration's position is hokey and then you say the sky is falling?"" the attorney general said. ""If this was such a hokey position to take, what are you worried about?"""
U.S. and Mexico Issue Joint Declaration on Migration and Tariffs,https://www.nytimes.com,['Liam Stack'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/state-department-mexico-trump.html,"President Trump pulled back from his plan to impose tariffs on all Mexican imports, saying on Friday night on Twitter that the United States and Mexico had reached an agreement to reduce the number of migrants entering the United States over the southwestern border.

The tariffs, which could have been potentially crippling for Mexico, were to go into effect on Monday. Mr. Trump’s announcement came after several days of intense negotiations between the two countries in Washington.

“The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended,” Mr. Trump wrote just before 8:30 p.m. “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border.”

Here is a joint statement by the United States and Mexico released by the State Department on Friday night:

“The United States and Mexico met this week to address the shared challenges of irregular migration, to include the entry of migrants into the United States in violation of U.S. law. Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution."
VA watchdog report finds veterans are owed refunds for incorrect fees,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/va-watchdog-report-finds-veterans-owed-refunds-incorrect/story?id=63546615,"For years, disabled veterans were mistakenly charged fees when taking out home loans and the federal government now owes millions of dollars in refunds, a watchdog report revealed this week.

The Department of Veterans Affairs issued more than $280 million in excessive fess between 2012 and 2017, and took no action despite knowing that veterans were owed refunds, the VA Inspector General report found.

In many cases, third-party lenders rely on the VA to certify that a veteran is exempt from certain fees when applying for a home loan. But its exemption certificates were “outdated, incorrect, or missing exemption status resulting in veterans being incorrectly charged a funding fee,” according to the report.

The Under Secretary for Benefits responded to the report by saying the problem would be corrected by the end of July.

Although most cases involved veterans becoming exempt from the fees only after they were issued, investigators found the VA did not implement its own policy to identify and refund the charges.

“Requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” the report stated.

The fees averaged $4,000 and some were considerably higher. One was for $19,470.

More than half of the 72,900 veterans who are entitled to refunds have yet to be paid by the VA.

When the issue was first identified in 2014, an analysis estimated that 48,000 veterans were owed as much as $151 million in overpaid fees.

When asked why corrective action wasn’t taken at the time, current and former leaders of the loan office said they were “focused on other competing priorities” and said they faced “historically high loan volumes” in the following years, according to the inspector general."
Treasury targets Iran's most profitable oil refiners with new sanctions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/treasury-targets-irans-most-profitable-oil-refiners-with-new-sanctions,"The Treasury Department imposed broad sanctions Friday on Iran's petrochemical and refinery industry for contributing funds to the financial arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, which the State Department recently named a terrorist organization.

The sanctions target Iran’s largest and most profitable petrochemical holding group, called the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company, which maintains dozens of companies and subsidiaries.

“This action is a warning that we will continue to target holding groups and companies in the petrochemical sector and elsewhere that provide financial lifelines"" to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed the sanctions on the holding company's 39 subsidiary petrochemical companies and foreign-based marketing firms.

The Treasury charges the petrochemical refiners with providing financial support to Khatam al-Anbiya, the Revolutionary Guard's engineering conglomerate, which the U.S. government refers to as the ""economic arm"" of the group.

“By targeting this network we intend to deny funding to key elements of Iran’s petrochemical sector that provide support to the IRGC,” Mnuchin said.

The Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and its group of subsidiaries represent 40% of Iran’s total petrochemical production and 50% of Iran’s total petrochemical exports, according to the Treasury Department."
"DHS watchdog finds spoiled food, nooses at multiple immigration detention centers",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/dhs-oig-watchdog-spoiled-food-nooses-immigration-detention-centers-b5796c0ff257/,"The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report Thursday detailing the horrific conditions at immigration detention centers across the United States. Inspectors found “immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards” including nooses in detainee cells, overuse of solitary confinement, and spoiled food, among other issues.

DHS OIG inspected four Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, including the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado, the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, and the Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey.

According to the report, the “inspections of the four detention facilities revealed violations of ICE’s detention standards and raised concerns about the environment in which detainees are held.”

OIG described the food service issues at Adelanto and Essex as “egregious.” At Adelanto, “lunch meat and cheese were mixed and stored uncovered in

large walk-in refrigerators,” while chicken “smelled foul and appeared to be spoiled.” Food in the freezer was also expired. At Essex, “open packages of raw chicken leaked blood all over refrigeration units” and “lunch meat was slimy, foulsmelling and appeared to be spoiled.”

All of the facilities demonstrated “serious issues with the administrative and disciplinary segregation of detainees” that violate ICE detention standards and infringe on detainee rights, the report read.

The findings confirm what most immigration activist groups and some progressive members of Congress have been clamoring about for months: ICE is routinely violating the human rights of the individuals in its custody.

“The report’s findings reveal that issues in ICE detention are not isolated — they are systemic,” Freedom for Immigrants, a non-profit that has been monitoring the conditions at Adelanto and other ICE facilities for years, said in a statement. “And yet, not one single entity in this detention apparatus is ever held accountable for these human rights violations. This is outrageous. More and more evidence points to the fact that ICE and private prison companies like GEO are incapable of providing for the well-being of immigrants. That’s why we must abolish detention. It’s time to implement humane community-based alternatives that treat people with dignity and respect.”

While ICE standards require facilities to place detainees in disciplinary segregation only after they have committed a prohibited act, Adelanto, Essex, and Aurora punished immigrant detainees with solitary confinement for unproven disciplinary violations. Detainees in solitary were found to have limited access to recreation and even showers despite ICE standards mandating that individuals have access to these basic resources.

At the facility’s bathrooms, OIG observed mold throughout all the

walls in the bathroom area, including ceilings, vents, mirrors, and shower

stalls. Prolonged exposure to mold and mildew can lead to allergic reactions and long-term health issues.

Immigrants in detention are required to receive toiletries including including shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste, lotion, and soap. At Essex, however, detainees reported not having received any toiletries. Staff at the facility told inspectors that toiletries must be purchased through the commissary, which is against ICE standards.

At Aurora, visitation rooms go unused. DHS OIG found that while the facility is capable of hosting in-person visitation, it only allows “non-contact visits” — even to children and family.

ICE standards mandate “that detainees shall be able to maintain morale and ties through visitation with their families, the community, legal representatives and consular officials, within the constraints of the safety, security and good order of the facility.”

Three of the four detention centers that were inspected are operated by GEO Group, a private prison company that contracts with the federal government.

GEO Group, among other similar companies like CoreCivic, has greatly benefited from the Trump administration’s increase in immigration enforcement. ICE is detaining more people than ever before, a record-breaking 52,000, and GEO Group is making money off of it. Just this week the private prison company announced a 314 bed expansion at the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas. The expansion would bring the total bed count to 1,314. The company is expected to rake in $10 million as a result."

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL CITED STEELE IN EMAILS WITH OHR AFTER FLAGGING CREDIBILITY ISSUES TO FBI, DOCS REVEAL

A Justice Department spokesman on Friday did not immediately return an inquiry from Fox News about the bonuses.

The conservative group Judicial Watch, known for suing for public records, released the documents related to Ohr’s salary Friday, saying they obtained them from the Justice Department through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Ohr’s actions during that time have been of interest to investigators, as it’s believed Ohr was the back channel between Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and the FBI. It was also revealed that his wife, Nellie Ohr, conducted opposition research on Trump for the firm Fusion GPS – the same company that commissioned the dossier – raising conflict of interest questions.

Judicial Watch is questioning why Ohr, who was later demoted at DOJ, was given a bonus.

“These documents will raise questions as to whether the conflicted Bruce Ohr, who the FBI used to launder information from Christopher Steele was rewarded for his role in the illicit targeting of President Trump,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement.

Even though Ohr was removed from his position as Associate Deputy Attorney General in 2017, he later received a $2,600 pay increase in 2018, the records indicate, showing Ohr earned $189,000 that year.

"Did Trump Administration ‘Purge’ 200,000 VA Health Care Applications?",https://www.snopes.com,['Bethania Palma'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/06/07/trump-admin-va-applications/,"Five years have passed since Scott Davis testified before Congress about mismanagement at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a condition that resulted in almost a million backlogged applications and a sometimes deadly state of limbo for veterans waiting to get health care. On 13 May 2019, Davis penned a widely read opinion piece for the Washington Examiner in which he stated that despite a whirlwind of media attention in years past, the problem had hardly been resolved.

Despite President Donald Trump’s blasting the administration of his predecessor for the problem, Davis wrote, “The Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.”

“I tried in a very non-partisan way to say, two years after you made a big deal about this, this is happening on your watch,” Davis told us by phone. Davis is a former public affairs officer for VA Member Services, which deals with enrollment. Although he currently works in a different department, Davis is still employed by the VA.

The VA has taken issue with Davis’ use of the word “purge” in reference to applications, with spokeswoman Susan Carter telling us by email that it’s a “loaded term” and calling Davis’ opinion piece “misleading.” However, the VA confirmed that 208,272 veterans’ applications for health care had been moved from “pending” status to “closed” status between January and February (she did not specify the year). Once an application has been closed, the veteran must reapply for health care benefits.

Davis maintained taking issue with his terminology was just wordplay, and that no functional difference existed between “closing” and “purging” an application from the veteran’s perspective. “Offering the person the opportunity to reapply is not offering them anything,” Davis told us. “Intake is a very basic function of any government organization. If you can’t do that, that’s a problem. And that’s a problem that people in my opinion, from the president on down, should be concerned with, because this is the nation’s largest health care system.”

If a veteran applies to receive VA benefits but the application is incomplete, the person has a year to submit necessary additional information. During that time, the application is placed in “pending” status. After a year, in accordance with federal law, the application is placed in “closed” status by the VA, and the veteran is notified by letter how to reapply. The VA states it notified all veterans with incomplete applications via letter “that they are in pending status and that they have 365 days to complete their applications.”

Between January and May 2019, a total of 21,881 applications have been moved to “pending” status, according to Carter’s email. Davis sent us a copy of the VA’s Fiscal Year 2019 briefing book showing more than 317,000 applications currently in “pending” status. That same book shows over 270,000 applications in “closed” status.

Davis told us that known issues exist with the VA’s notification process dating back to a 2014 scandal that prompted Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump had been critical of the scandal. The VA Office of Inspector General determined in 2015 that “extensive, persistent problems with veterans’ health care enrollment records maintained by the [Health Eligibility Center or HEC]” existed.

Whistleblower Allegations

The 2015 report confirmed whistleblower allegations that the VA had 867,000 “pending” applications, and that of that backlog more than 307,000 were records associated with deceased veterans. But auditors were unable to determine how many of those were people who died while awaiting health care because of sloppy record-keeping by the VA. (The issue was widely misreported, and Trump asserted that all 307,000 cases were veterans who died awaiting care while their applications were pending.)

In 2017, auditors reported that the VA lacked an adequate, uniform system for enrolling veterans at the point of contact, VA health-care facilities. We asked the VA whether a national enrollment policy was enacted in response to that report, and spokeswoman Susan Carter told us a policy was “still under development.”

Carter also said that the VA makes thousands of attempts to reach veterans in “pending” status. The VA “regularly reaches out to Veterans both by mail and by phone. In this fiscal year alone, VA has made over 200,000 call attempts to Veterans with pending applications, and over 300,000 attempts to newly enrolled Veterans. On average over 27,000 calls are placed each month to Veterans with a pending [Veterans Health Administration] application to assist them with completing anything that is missing in order to reach an enrollment determination. VA makes six attempts with each Veteran over the course of one year.”

We asked how many of those attempts yielded verifiable contacts with veterans but have not yet received an answer to that question.

Letters by Mail

Davis questioned whether veterans ever received the letters or calls. He provided us an internal memo dated 30 November 2016 in which Health Eligibility Center (HEC) officials cautioned that tens of thousands of addresses had been flagged as potentially bad, while acknowledging that “although a letter was never returned by the postal service, we cannot say that the Veteran received it.”

“How many times do we all miss one letter in the mail? In 2019, that’s how they’re communicating? It’s ridiculous,” Davis said. “To say, ‘We sent a letter to people’ in 2019 — I know people in government don’t know how the internet works, but people under 60 aren’t running to the mailbox every day.”

The quality of VA health care for veterans, and the agency’s mismanagement of processes that help them get it, have for years been a focal point of public concern, but the controversy rose to the surface again in April 2019 amid news reports that four veterans had committed suicide at VA facilities in the span of one month. On that issue, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote:

Veteran suicide is an acute crisis wrapped in a national crisis. Between 2005 and 2016, suicide rates in the general population climbed 21%. For veterans, already taking their lives at twice the U.S. rate, it climbed 26%. More than 6,000 veterans are dying by their own hands each year – nearly 20 a day. The latest deaths renew questions about whether the VA, criticized and investigated for failing to provide timely or sufficient help to veterans, is doing enough to solve the problem. That is despite making suicide prevention a high priority in recent years.

We asked the VA how many veterans committed suicide while their applications were in “pending” status between January 2012 and May 2019 but received no response to that question."

"More Than 100,000 Americans Urge EPA To Restrict Unnecessary Use of Monsanto’s Weedkiller on Oats",https://www.ewg.org,[],,,,https://www.ewg.org/release/more-100000-americans-urge-epa-restrict-unnecessary-use-monsanto-s-weedkiller-oats,"WASHINGTON – This week, more than 100,000 Americans officially joined EWG and 20 companies calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to significantly restrict the use of Monsanto’s weedkiller glyphosate on oats as a pre-harvest drying agent.

A coalition of companies and public interest groups, led by EWG and Megafood, gathered 104,952 signatures on online petitions to the EPA, urging the agency to lower the tolerance limit of glyphosate in oats and prohibit its pre-harvest use. The names of those who signed the petitions were submitted to EPA on Wednesday.

The EPA’s legal limit for glyphosate residues on oats is 30 parts per million, or ppm. The petition, first filed last September, asks the agency to set a more protective standard of 0.1 ppm, which was the legal limit in 1993.

“Administrator Andrew Wheeler and the EPA could quickly remove one of the more concerning routes of dietary exposure to glyphosate for children by restricting the unnecessary use of glyphosate on oats,” said EWG Legislative Director Colin O’Neil. “Americans are demanding the agency act to protect the public and the food supply from being contaminated with this toxic weedkiller linked to cancer.”

“It’s hard to find 100,000 people who agree on anything,” O’Neil said. “But when it comes to feeding themselves and their families, they agree that we should not have to worry whether eating healthy, oat-based foods for breakfast could come with a dose of glyphosate.”

The petition was amended this week and submitted to the EPA docket to include additional companies that have signed on since last year.

Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Bayer-Monsanto’s Roundup, is the most widely used pesticide in the world. It is largely used as a weedkiller on genetically modified corn and soybeans. But it is increasingly being used for crop management and applied pre-harvest to a number of non-genetically engineered crops, including oats.

Glyphosate kills the crop, drying it out so it can be harvested sooner than if the plant were allowed to die naturally. This is very likely one of the leading sources of dietary exposure for people who consume foods made with oat-based foods, like cereal and oatmeal.

Two rounds of laboratory tests commissioned by EWG found glyphosate in nearly every sample of oat-based cereal and other breakfast products at levels higher than what EWG scientists consider protective for children’s health with an adequate margin of safety.

On June 12, EWG will release results of its latest tests, which will include additional oat-based cereals and other foods that were not analyzed for glyphosate in the two earlier rounds.

A 2017 study by a team of California scientists estimate that between 2014 and 2016, at least 70 percent of American adults surveyed had detectable levels of the cancer-causing weedkiller in their bodies. That compares to 12 percent in American adults between 1993 and 1996, just before the use of glyphosate started to surge with the advent of GMO crops designed to withstand direct application of the chemical.

In 2015, 17 of the world’s top cancer researchers convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer reviewed hundreds of studies on glyphosate and voted unanimously to classify the weedkiller as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” In 2017, California added glyphosate to its official list of chemicals known to cause cancer.

These companies are cosigners of the petition to the EPA: MegaFood, Ben & Jerry’s, Stonyfield Farm, MOM’s Organic Market, Nature’s Path, One Degree Organic Foods, National Co+op Grocers, Happy Family Organics, Amy’s Kitchen, Clif Bar & Company, Earth’s Best Organic, GrandyOats, INFRA, KIND Healthy Snacks, Lundberg Family Farms, Organic Valley, Patagonia Provisions, PCC Community Markets, Foodstirs and Kamut International, Ltd.

The Justice and Commerce departments on Thursday rejected House Democratic demands for more documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, likely leading to contempt citations for Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

In a letter to Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the documents the panel subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.

Story Continued Below

“[T]he committee’s insistence that the department immediately turn over these documents ... is improper,” Boyd wrote, adding that the Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of documents and made officials available for interviews.

A Commerce Department spokesperson accused the committee of trying to interfere with ongoing litigation that centers on the constitutionality of the citizenship question appearing on the census.

“In its zeal to influence the Supreme Court’s decision, the committee is poised to hold Secretary Ross in contempt,” the spokesperson said. “Holding the secretary in contempt is an empty stunt, and it shows that the committee is simply interested in playing politics.”

The Democrat-led committee gave the Justice Department and the Commerce Department until 5 p.m. on Thursday to comply with its subpoenas, threatening to initiate contempt proceedings absent compliance.

Cummings said his committee gave Barr and Ross every opportunity to provide the documents but they didn’t cooperate and made no counteroffers.

“They seem determined to continue the Trump Administration’s cover-up,” he said in a statement.

The committee has been investigating the decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, with lawmakers accusing the Trump administration — Ross in particular — of lying about its origins.

New evidence emerged last week that the administration allegedly “concealed” the role of now-deceased Republican gerrymandering expert Thomas Hofeller, who believed that adding a citizenship question to the census would boost Republicans in future elections.

The Trump administration has said it is simply trying to enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have argued that such a question would create an undercount of ethnic and racial minorities, resulting in newly drawn congressional districts that would diminish their influence in American elections.

Cummings said this week that the Trump administration was seeking “to gerrymander congressional districts in overtly racist, partisan and unconstitutional ways,” and he accused the Trump administration of a “coverup.” Republicans on the committee have said that holding Barr and Ross in contempt is an effort to improperly interfere with ongoing court proceedings about the census question.

The subpoenas, which were first authorized in April, required the Justice and Commerce departments to turn over all communications with the White House, the Republican National Committee, and President Donald Trump’s campaign, among other entities. The subpoenas also sought memos and witness testimony.

One of those witnesses, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore, refused to answer lawmakers’ specific questions about his role in drafting a DOJ memo, requesting the addition of a citizenship question, and he later skipped a scheduled deposition with the committee.

In a statement, the Justice Department said Gore had “never heard of” Hofeller’s work, and added that it “played no role in the department’s December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question.”

Barr is expected to be formally held in contempt of Congress in a separate matter on Tuesday, when the House is scheduled to vote on a contempt citation for his refusal to turn over former special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report and underlying evidence, allowing the House Judiciary Committee to enforce its subpoena in federal court.

The contempt resolution will also allow other committees to enforce their subpoenas without requiring a full House vote.

"VA may owe veterans millions in refunds but knowingly hasn't paid them for years, probe finds",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/06/va-may-owe-disabled-veterans-millions-refunds-home-loan-fees/1367679001/,"CLOSE

WASHINGTON – More than 50,000 disabled veterans could be owed as much as $190 million in refunds from the Department of Veterans Affairs for home loan fees they were wrongly charged or no longer owe, an investigation has found.

Senior leaders knew about the problem for years but didn’t ensure veterans received what they are due, the investigation by the VA inspector general found.

Veterans pay the fees when they buy homes with the help of VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program, but they are supposed to be exempt if they are disabled. Fees can total up to 3.3% of a home's value.

In cases where veterans improperly paid the fees or the VA later determined they were disabled, the agency is supposed to issue refunds.

But the VA didn’t do that in thousands of cases dating back more than a decade because the veterans didn't ask for the refunds.

VA loan managers, who knew about outstanding debts to veterans since at least 2014, told investigators that they had been focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications.

Investigators from the inspector general’s office said in their report released Thursday that they found it “troubling” that the managers were “aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued.”

“It is the review team’s opinion that requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” investigators said.

'Internal quality improvement'

The VA issued a press release last month – as the inspector general was preparing to release the investigation results – announcing that the agency is now notifying veterans when they buy homes under the program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in the release.

The release did not say what is being done to ensure veterans due refunds from loans in prior years are paid. The inspector general found the amounts owed in its review ranged from $5,000 to $20,000.

The VA said veterans who believe they are owed a refund should consult the agency’s website for more information about VA home loan funding fees.

Between 2012 and 2017, the VA collected roughly $10 billion in fees from veterans under the loan program.

The inspector general estimated disabled veterans who were wrongly charged accounted for $286 million of those fees. But the VA only refunded about $100 million, leaving an estimated $190 million that may still be due to 53,200 veterans.

The Loan Guaranty program was established in 1944 to help veterans finance home purchases. Loans are provided by private lenders, but the VA guarantees a portion of the loans for eligible buyers. The lenders collect the fees and transmit them to the VA.

If a veteran wrongly paid the fees, the VA can refund the money directly to the veteran. If the fees were included as part of a loan, the VA pays the lender, which applies it to the loan balance.

'Other priorities'

In 2014, regional VA loan officials in St. Paul, Minnesota, notified senior VA managers that an analysis found nearly $150 million may be due in refunds to disabled veterans for fees on 48,000 loans issued between 2006 and 2014.

“As of January 2019, the review team received no indication that a large-scale effort had been initiated to issue refunds to these veterans,” the inspector general said.

The director of the Loan Guaranty program since 2017, Jeffrey London, told investigators he “considered contracting out the task of issuing refunds, but never requested the award of a contract because other priorities…took precedence,” the investigators wrote.

The inspector general recommended the agency identify and pay all the veterans owed refunds. In addition, the VA should implement procedures to minimize the number of veterans who are wrongly charged fees and conduct periodic reviews to ensure those who are receive prompt refunds.

The VA told investigators some of the fees were incorrectly assessed by lenders, not the VA. But agency officials said in their response to the report that they “generally agreed” with the investigation’s findings and are consulting lawyers about complexities related to issuing refunds.

The agency “has drafted a plan with contingencies ready for implementation depending on the (legal) opinion,” the VA response said. The agency did not elaborate on what the plan is or when refunds will be issued.

The letter comes after BuzzFeed News reported in March that local rangers and other groups associated with the World Wide Fund for Nature in nations in Africa and Asia had been involved in human rights abuses against indigenous communities while carrying out conservation efforts.

The letter does not mention the World Wide Fund for Nature.

The two lawmakers asked Bernhardt to provide a briefing on the international conservation grants awarded and overseen by the Department of the Interior and the agencies under its jurisdiction.

“Among the victims of these alleged abuses are indigenous peoples living near protected areas,” they wrote. “Despite the importance of protecting wildlife and endangered species from extinction, the United States must not be party to violations of basic human rights.”

The World Wide Fund for Nature has since started an independent review after the allegations were detailed in the BuzzFeed story.

""We see it as our urgent responsibility to get to the bottom of the allegations BuzzFeed has made, and we recognize the importance of such scrutiny,” the charity said in a statement to BuzzFeed as part of the March story."

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)

The Homeland Security watchdog has agreed to an outside review of its performance following missteps that led it to retract 13 audits of disaster responses that hid problems and instead flattered the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The outside review will be done by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that Homeland Security’s monitor has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA, officials said.

The peer review, to be completed next year, comes after an unusual internal investigation uncovered a disturbing pattern at the oversight agency responsible for rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the sprawling Department of Homeland Security.

John V. Kelly, now the acting inspector general, overrode auditors who flew to communities affected by hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters from 2011 to 2016 to assess how well FEMA helped local residents recover, according to the internal investigation. It said auditors often discovered problems with the response, but Kelly, then in charge of the auditing teams, instead directed them to write what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed its oversight of FEMA’s disaster response with ‘feel good’ reports]

Under pressure from Congress, the inspector general’s office purged the faulty reports from its website in 2017 and 2018 and acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards. Then the watchdog spent 14 months examining what went wrong.

It released an internal investigation in May that found fault with Kelly, his managers and their oversight of a staff that was supposed to offer real-time oversight from the ground of FEMA’s disaster response.

Kelly apologized to his staff of 600 auditors and investigators and took responsibility for failing to “set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

Federal inspectors general are traditionally evaluated by their peers every three years. The Homeland Security inspector general asked to have its next review in 2020, a year early.

Following a report Thursday in The Washington Post, two top Democrats in Congress called on the inspector general’s office to do better.

“We rely on [the office] for fact-based products that are invaluable in conducting oversight, and these reports did not meet the standard,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement.

Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the failures underscore the urgency for the Senate to confirm a permanent inspector general.

“Any effort to gloss over real challenges . . . limits the ability of federal, state and local governments to learn from their mistakes and improve performance for future disasters,” Peters said in a statement.

[Read the inspector general’s internal review of the oversight missteps here]

President Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office.

The office said it is making changes that include more rigorous training of auditors to improve their objectivity, more reliance on direct sources to document their findings and rotating assignments.

The internal review also prompted the agency to address poor employee morale. Deputy Inspector General Jennifer Costello, in her written response, said she wanted “equal measures of self-awareness and accountability” and acknowledged a need for stronger leadership.

The office ranked 303 of 415 of departments that operate as part of larger agencies in last year’s Best Places to Work in the Federal Government survey, and has hovered at the bottom for years.

Charles K. Edwards, the acting inspector general under President Barack Obama, was found by a Senate oversight panel in 2014 to have altered and delayed investigations at the request of senior administration officials, compromising his role as an independent watchdog.

Edwards routinely socialized with department leaders and gave them inside information about the timing and findings of investigations, the report found. And he improperly acquiesced to requests from top political advisers to then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to change the wording and timing of three separate reports.

In an email Thursday, inspector general spokeswoman Erica Paulson said the office is addressing poor morale, appointing an ombudsman, creating an employee advisory council and encouraging more communication between managers and their staffs.

The inspector general “workforce remains focused and dedicated to our mission: rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in DHS programs and operations and issuing high-impact, high-value oversight reports,” Paulson said in a statement.

“While disheartening, the mistakes on this small percentage of our work should not diminish confidence in the great work that this office has done and continues to do on behalf of the American taxpayers.”

Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency watchdog gave Homeland Security a rating of “pass with deficiencies” after reviewing a sample of audits. The black mark came primarily from one audit: The assessment of FEMA’s performance after catastrophic flooding in southern Louisiana in 2016.

The EPA review identified a variety of shortcomings with the audit, including poor supervision and issues with how the staff assessed FEMA’s performance.

“As a result, the audit report may not present a complete assessment of the issues affecting the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) response to the 2016 Louisiana,” reviewers found. The internal investigation supported EPA’s conclusions."
Congressional Democrats Demand State Dept. End ‘Disturbing’ Policy Denying Citizenship to Kids of LGBT Couples,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Scott Bixby', 'National Reporter']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senate-democrats-demand-state-dept-reverse-disturbing-policy-denying-citizenship-to-kids-of-lgbt-couples,"Nearly one hundred members of Congress, including five presidential candidates, have added their names to a pair of letters calling on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately reverse a State Department policy that withholds American citizenship from some children of U.S. citizens who are born abroad.

One letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Kamala Harris of California and signed by 17 other Democratic members of the chamber, calls the policy “a thinly veiled attack on LGBTQ Americans whose children are conceived through the use of egg donors and gestational surrogacy.”

“Your Department’s reinterpretation of immigration law to deny the constitutional right of citizenship to the children of same-sex couples who are born outside the United States is extraordinary and deeply disturbing,” the letter states. The letter’s 19 signatories urge Pompeo to immediately drop the State Department’s appeal of a court ruling striking down the policy, “and make it clear that every U.S. married couple is entitled to the same rights under the U.S. Constitution, no matter whom they love.”

In addition to Merkley and Harris, the letter was signed by Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Udall (D-NM), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Another letter, signed by the co-chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and every gay, lesbian and bisexual member of the House of Representatives, was delivered to Pompeo on Thursday afternoon. In that letter, the 80 signatories called the policy “discriminatory and cruel.”

“Welcoming a new child into a family should be a time of joy and excitement, but instead it is being met by your Department treating these couples differently than their different-sex counterparts,” the second letter, led by Reps. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), stated.

The policy in question changes the State Department’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a 1952 law that codifies eligibility for U.S. birthright citizenship. Under the policy, children born abroad via assisted reproductive technology like gestational surrogacy or sperm donation are considered to have been born “out of wedlock,” even if their parents are legally married U.S. citizens.

“Out of wedlock” births abroad face a bevy of legal and logistical hurdles to gaining birthright American citizenship, and the policy has led to numerous instances of the children of U.S. citizens being effectively turned away at the border.

“They basically take our marriage, and they say ‘It doesn’t mean anything. Your child was born out of wedlock,’” Adiel Kiviti, whose three-month-old daughter was born with the help of an egg donor and a gestational surrogate in Canada, told The Daily Beast last month. “We were there when she was born, she took her first breaths in our arms. Make no mistake: We are her parents—we are her only parents on her only birth certificate.”

“This is a very clear attack on families, on American families,” his husband Roee, who married Adiel in California in 2013, said at the time. “Denying American married couples their rights to pass their citizenship, that is flat-out discrimination, and everyone should be concerned about this.”

Two same-sex couples have sued the State Department over the policy, which they say disproportionately affects LGBT families, who stick out when seeking government documents that recognize the birthright citizenship of children born abroad.

The INA makes no reference to biology in determining birthright citizenship of children born abroad to married U.S. citizens, giving the policy little textual support in law. In February, a federal judge ruled that “the basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, and dismissed attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples as “unilateral.”

But the State Department has appealed that ruling, and has fought to summarily dismiss a suit brought by another same-sex couple against the policy.

The publication of a story by The Daily Beast on the policy brought renewed national attention to the issue, prompting nearly every Democratic presidential candidate, as well as senior congressional leadership, to call for the policy’s reversal.

“Once again, the Trump administration is demonstrating just how far they are willing to go to undermine our core values and advance their hateful agenda,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement last month. “The State Department must uphold our laws, end this cruel and inhumane policy and treat every family with the dignity and respect that they deserve.”

In the letter from Senate Democrats, signatories called the department’s legal defense of the policy part of a larger tapestry of decisions that have hurt LGBT Americans, from its decision to not grant visas to the same-sex partners of some foreign diplomats to what they called the “muted” response to anti-LGBT persecution abroad.

“Every new American parent should focus on celebrating the birth of a child, not be consumed with fear that all members of their family may not be welcomed back home to the United States,” the signatories wrote. “The United States can best advocate for LGBTQ rights around the world by living its values at home, especially during this month of Pride.”

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter."
USDA investigates unapproved GMO wheat found in Washington state,https://www.reuters.com,"['Julie Ingwersen', 'Min Read']",06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-wheat-gmo/usda-investigates-unapproved-gmo-wheat-found-in-washington-state-idUSKCN1T900O,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture has confirmed the discovery of unapproved, genetically modified (GM) wheat plants growing in an un-planted agricultural field in Washington state.

There was no evidence the wheat had entered the food supply, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said in a statement on Friday. The wheat is resistant to glyphosate, a widely used herbicide commonly referred to as Roundup.

“USDA is collaborating with our state, industry and trading partners, and we are committed to providing all our partners with timely and transparent information about our findings,” the statement said.

There are currently no commercially approved genetically modified wheat varieties, and incidences of rogue plants are rare. However, unapproved plants were found in 2018 in Alberta, Canada, in 2016 in Washington state, in 2014 in Montana and in 2013 in Oregon.

A Bayer Crop Science spokeswoman said the latest finding may have occurred on the site of a former field trial. Last year Bayer bought Monsanto, which in the late 1990s and early 2000s developed wheat genetically modified to withstand its Roundup herbicide, a weed killer containing glyphosate.

Monsanto shelved the genetically engineered wheat in 2004 amid market concern about rejection from foreign buyers. The United States was the world’s second-largest wheat exporter after Russia in the 2018/19 marketing year.

“We have been informed by USDA of a possible detection of GM wheat in Washington State, possibly on the site of a former field trial,” Bayer Crop Sciences spokeswoman Charla Lord said.

“We are cooperating with USDA to gather more information and facts as the agency reviews the situation,” Lord said.

Samples of the wheat plants from the field in Washington were sent to the USDA’s Federal Grain Inspection Service lab in Kansas City, Missouri, as well as a USDA lab in Pullman, Washington, for testing and confirmation, according to a joint statement from the National Association of Wheat Growers and U.S. Wheat Associates, a trade group that promotes U.S. wheat sales.

Bayer, which inherited litigation over Roundup with its $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto last year, faces lawsuits by more than 13,400 plaintiffs in the United States, alleging the product causes cancer.

A California jury last month awarded more than $2 billion to a couple who claimed Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It was the largest U.S. jury verdict to date against the company in litigation over the chemical."
DOJ files detail Flynn-Russia contacts shortly before FBI informant sprang into action,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-files-flynn-russia-fbi-informant,"A Justice Department court filing Thursday provided more details on Michael Flynn's contacts with high-level Russian officials in December 2015 and January 2016, a period shortly before a U.S. intelligence informant allegedly sprang into action to seek out more information on the future national security adviser.

Within days of a January 2016 Flynn phone call to Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak referenced in the court filing, a Russian-born U.K. academic said FBI source Stefan Halper suddenly contacted her to gain information on Flynn.

MUELLER FILES SHOW FLYNN UNDER INVESTIGATION EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT

Asked about the timing, a source familiar with the situation told Fox News that ""nothing is a coincidence"" when it comes to Halper, and that Kislyak was likely under U.S. surveillance at the time of the contacts.

The information was contained in a so-called ""302"" witness report prepared by top FBI brass and finalized more than three weeks after Flynn's Jan. 24, 2017 White House interview with two FBI agents, including Peter Strzok. Flynn previously served as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency during the Obama administration, before advising the Trump campaign and briefly joining that administration. A semi-redacted version of the 302 was released last December that omitted reference to some of Flynn's contacts after his DIA service.

In particular, only the unredacted 302 indicates that Flynn told the interviewing agents that he had ""met with Kislyak at the Russian Ambassador's residence next to the University Club prior"" to traveling to Russia in December 2015. The mid-afternoon visit, which the 302 characterized as a ""courtesy call,"" came as Flynn was preparing to travel to Moscow as a private citizen to speak at a Russia Today (RT) event.

Flynn was paid $45,000 to speak on Middle East issues at the gathering, where he shared a table with President Vladimir Putin. According to the 302, Flynn received an appropriate ""threat briefing"" from U.S. officials before attending.

Additionally, according to both the redacted and unredacted 302s, ""Flynn stated he called Ambassador Kislyak following [former GRU Director Igor] Sergun's death in Lebanon ... to express his condolences"" and note that Sergun was ""someone the U.S. could work with."" Segun died Jan. 3, 2016.

Just days later, as Flynn's role informally advising the Trump campaign became known, a Russian-born U.K. academic, Svetlana Lokhova, said she received an invitation out of the blue to a private dinner party with Halper.

Halper is widely reported to have been a confidential source in the FBI's original probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Halper also reached out to Trump campaign aides including Carter Page, George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis.

“It was very, very unusual because Stefan Halper and I, despite being part of the same group, and meeting pretty much in a public forum, we've had no personal contact at all. [Halper] to me was an obnoxious academic who absolutely hated all Russians,"" Lokhova told Fox News in April.

FLYNN: FBI PUSHED ME NOT TO HAVE LAWYER AT FATEFUL WHITE HOUSE INTERVIEW

In a lawsuit filed last month, Lokhova accused Halper and various news media outlets of conspiring to defame her, by falsely claiming she had inappropriate contact with Flynn to further the narrative that Flynn was compromised by Russia.

The complaint asserted that ""Stefan Halper is a ratf----- and a spy, who embroiled an innocent woman in a conspiracy to undo the 2016 Presidential election and topple the President of the United States of America.""

According to the lawsuit, ""On January 12, 2016, [Cambridge Professor Christopher] Andrew emailed Lokhova, and invited her and her partner, David North ('North'), to Andrew’s house to have dinner with Halper and his wife. Two dates in February were offered. Andrew stated that the purpose of the dinner was to discuss the book that Lokhova and he were authoring. Lokhova was perplexed. At no point before this unexpected invitation had Halper expressed any interest in Lokhova’s work.""

The complaint alleges, ""Halper had no interest in Lokhova’s work. Rather, Halper wanted to have dinner with Lokhova to probe her for information relating to Flynn in the hopes that his FBI handlers might find a basis upon which to file an application to conduct surveillance and spy on General Flynn.""

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' FLYNN

Halper has said virtually nothing in public about his role. During a rare interview with BBC Radio 4 Today in May 2017, Halper was asked if the Trump FBI inquiry was of Watergate proportions. He responded that the probe was ""moving in that direction.""

Multiple independent reviews into potential FBI and DOJ misconduct in 2016 are ongoing, as new information suggests the Trump team was targeted earlier than previously known. Buried in the second volume of the Mueller report was a mention of an existing FBI investigation of Flynn ""based on his relationship with the Russian government,"" which predated Flynn's phone calls during the presidential transition in December 2016 with Kislyak that ultimately led to his termination for lying.

It had been originally thought that Flynn’s communications with Kislyak – picked up by the U.S. intelligence community – made the FBI suspicious, sparking the Flynn probe.

According to Mueller's report, ""members of the intelligence community were surprised by Russia's decision not to retaliate in response to the sanctions. When analyzing Russia's response, they became aware of Flynn's discussion of sanctions with Kislyak. Previously, the FBI had opened an investigation of Flynn based on his relationship with the Russian government. Flynn's contacts with Kislyak became a key component of that investigation.""

After Fox News reported on the development last month, President Trump questioned, in a tweet, why he wasn't briefed on the probe in 2016 ""so that I could make a change?""

Separately, the 302 released Thursday also revealed for the first time that in late December 2016, Kislyak called Flynn to set up a videoconference between the president-elect and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The call was to take place Jan. 21, 2017 -- the day after Trump's inauguration."
V.A. Prepares for Major Shift in Veterans’ Health Care,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jennifer Steinhauer'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/va-health-care-veterans.html,"In the 2018 fiscal year, 1.7 million veterans used some form of private care. That number, based on the department’s eligibility projections, could increase as much as 30 percent under the new Mission Act, adding just over a half-million veterans to the pool seeking private care — although both critics and supporters of the change believe that number is low.

“I think it’s safe to assume that over the next several years you will see more veterans getting their health care in the community,” said Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America — an advocacy group with ties to the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch — which has pursued expanding the use of private health care for veterans. Democrats on Capitol Hill agree.

Even so, it will take some time to see whether the expanded access to private care results in a gentle migration of veterans who are not being well served by nearby V.A. centers, or in a shift of a significant share of veteran care to an increasingly expensive private health care marketplace, starving the V.A., as critics have warned. The quality of care in the private system, as well as wait times within it, will be closely monitored by both opponents and supporters of private care.

“I don’t expect a flood of veterans coming in tomorrow or next week saying I want to go into the private sector,” Robert Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, said Tuesday in an interview. “I’m confident that we will have a good rollout. I’m looking forward to it.” Mr. Wilkie said he will visit the V.A. in Salem, Va., on Thursday to observe the start there.

Mr. Wilkie has repeatedly said that most veterans would continue to seek care at department health care centers because they largely like the care and the understanding of veterans’ issues. Several studies underscore the V.A.’s popularity."
Someday the U.S. Will Have to Actually Deal With Its Nuclear Waste Problem,https://slate.com,['Jane C. Hu'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/department-of-energy-nuclear-waste-reclassification-yucca.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Jeff J. Mitchell—WPA Pool/Getty Images.

Of all the things in the world to worry about, nuclear waste management is not at the top of most people’s lists. We trust (or hope, at least) that expert scientists and policymakers will make good decisions about how to make sure radioactive byproducts stay far, far away from us, by whatever means possible. But, many of those experts say, we’re going to need to figure out a new way to manage our country’s nuclear waste—and soon.

To that end, the Department of Energy announced Wednesday that they are reclassifying the definition of “high-level,” or highly radioactive, waste stored in underground tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. The DOE hopes that the redefinition will expedite cleanup of the waste. Currently, the high-level waste stored at these sites is waiting for the government to open a secure waste repository (like Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which has been in limbo for decades). But if some of the less radioactive waste qualifies under the new definition, it might instead be shipped off to other sites, like one in Texas, where it could be mixed with “concrete-like grout.” The cleanup at Hanford has already cost the country billions of dollars and is projected to cost billions more as we continue the search for the waste’s final home. (Adding some urgency to developing a new plan is the risk that containers could leak and contaminate the environment, especially if there’s an earthquake in Washington.)

The DOE’s new plan could be cost-effective, sure, but the question is whether it’s safe. When the agency first announced reclassification plans in October 2018 and solicited public comment, the proposal received thousands of responses. And Washington state officials are not happy; Gov. Jay Inslee and Department of Ecology Director Maia Bellon have both sent letters of concern to the DOE. “I am gravely concerned with DOE forging ahead with a new interpretation of HLW that does not comport with federal law, despite objections from Washington state,” wrote Bellon.

Some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts.

In addition to the waste we already have sitting around at Hanford and other old nuclear weapons facilities (charmingly called “legacy waste”), nearly 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 60 facilities around the U.S. are creating new waste every day. The type of waste produced by those two types of facility contains different radioactive materials with varying half-lives, but the same storage issues remain: What will we eventually do with all this radioactive stuff?

The lack of solution is not from lack of discussion. There have been all sorts of wacky ideas floated about where to store nuclear waste. Some have proposed we shoot it all into space, maybe have it orbit Venus. But given how spacecraft are prone to explosions, which would effectively mean showering the world with bits of radioactive waste, that idea stalled. In the ’90s, the idea of burying waste in deep ocean seabeds seemed promising, but it never really got off the ground. And some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts. As the earth thaws out, old waste becomes uncovered.

Here in the U.S., we’re running out of space, and experts are concerned about the lack of long-term solutions. “Instead of a planned, coherent system, we have the confusion of an unplanned, less than optimal system,” nuclear experts wrote in a 2018 report on nuclear waste management strategy and policy, calling the U.S. program “an ever-tightening Gordian Knot” subject to technical, scientific, logistical, regulatory, legal, financial, social, and political challenges. “This is not a situation that builds public confidence.”

Currently, we’re at a standstill. In 1987, the government designated Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada as the storage facility for waste, but more than three decades later, proper approvals are still pending. Buckets of radioactive waste are still sitting around at the various facilities around the U.S., waiting for a place to go. While critics from environmental advocacy organizations like Columbia Riverkeeper and National Resource Defense Council have condemned the DOE’s reclassification, calling it “irresponsible,” “outrageous,” and an “attempt to cut corners,” local government welcomed the new policy. Richland, Washington, Mayor Bob Thompson told the Tri-City Herald that the decision was a “fantastic opportunity” to speed up Hanford’s cleanup.

We could avoid adding to the problem by trying to reduce the amount of waste generated. One way to do that is to recycle. By separating out uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, engineers can reuse those in reactors to generate additional energy and throw out the rest. “Ninety-five percent of original energy is in the unused fuel,” says Kathryn Huff, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois, who likens the process to recycling a soda can: You wash out the sugar and dirt to reuse the aluminum. By reusing fuel, nuclear plants could cut down on the amount of space they need for waste containment by an order or two of magnitude.

On that front, countries like France, the U.K., and Japan are way ahead of us. France, in particular, leads the game; it generates about 80 percent of its energy through nuclear plants, but thanks to its recycling site, called La Hague, the waste currently fits “in a room not significantly bigger than a basketball court,” says Huff. Of course, the U.S. is a far bigger country than France, we’ve run our reactors for longer, and we have a lot more waste already sitting around, so we’ll never shrink our waste pile to that size. But La Hague is a testament to how the amount of true waste can be reduced through reprocessing.

Adopting recycling is subject to many of the same logistical and regulatory pitfalls as building a repository. For one, recycling is more expensive, and without regulatory pressure to change existing systems, commercial nuclear energy plants may not want to pony up the cash. (Opponents of reprocessing, like the Union of Concerned Scientists, also point to high costs of reprocessing, estimating it could cost tens or even hundreds of billions to implement.) Beyond the costs of just reprocessing waste, we’d also have to build critical infrastructure, like recycling facilities and retrofitting of existing reactors to accept recycled fuel. France’s energy system is government-run, and its government has decided to invest the money to have less waste sitting around in the long term.

To make progress on recycling, or building a repository, or even having a coherent plan for the roughly 80,000 metric tons of waste in our country, experts say any decisions about nuclear management need to be removed from the political cycle. “The instability in the dynamics of American politics makes it a challenge to develop a sustainable program,” says Huff. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, a group of experts assembled by the Obama administration in 2012, brought up similar concerns in its recommendations and suggested that the government establish an entirely new government entity to oversee nuclear waste policy. “The overall record of DOE and of the federal government as a whole, however, has not inspired widespread confidence or trust in our nation’s nuclear waste management program,” the commission wrote in the final report. “The Commission concludes that a new, single-purpose organization is needed … to get the waste program back on track.” Members recommended also that this organization would solicit active consent from affected communities and implement policies that would provide continuity from administration to administration.

But until then, it seems inevitable that the rules will keep shifting, and we’ll keep passing the buck on the problem of waste management. What’s now “high-level” waste seems destined to be reclassified, but it’s also possible that the next administration could change the definition right back. Unless the government moves toward a longer-term solution, we’ll likely be stuck in limbo until something catastrophic happens, the waste’s radioactivity decreases over thousands of years, or the world ends—whichever comes first.

DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border,https://www.politico.com,['Marianne Levine'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/dhs-migrants-renting-babies-border-1356307,"A U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle sits near the border wall with Mexico in Calexico, Calif. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo Immigration DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border

Department of Homeland Security officials told senators at a lunch Wednesday that migrants are “renting babies” to speed their trip across the border, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley.

“I can't believe that this actually happened, that the people down there in Central America or Mexico are renting babies to get across the border and then sending the babies back and renting them again to come back across the border,” he Iowa Republican said Thursday.

Grassley said DHS officials made the claim at the GOP’s weekly Steering Committee lunch. He said he did not request additional evidence but expressed alarm if it is true.

“I hope you guys will help advertise that, assuming that the information I heard yesterday was accurate, because that is a humanitarian crisis that we have to be concerned about,” Grassley said.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This not the first time DHS officials have claimed children are being used to make border crossings, though the agency has presented little evidence of fraudulent cases.

Earlier this year, then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the agency uncovered “‘recycling rings’ where innocent young people are used multiple times to help aliens gain illegal entry.”

DHS has recently begun an initiative to look into “fake families” as a way to discourage child trafficking.

Under the pilot program, federal immigration officials have requested DNA samples to help confirm parent-child relationships of migrants caught at the border.

Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Mark Morgan told reporters Tuesday that 206 fraudulent cases had been identified from mid-April through the end of May. However, he did not say how many of those cases involved children traveling with another relative who was not a biological parent or step-father or step-mother.

Grassley’s comments come amid Republican senators' growing frustration that Mexico has not done more to stem crossings at the border.

“Every carrot I know has been exhausted in terms of getting the Mexican government to be more cooperative on a sustained basis,” Sen. Marco Rubio said. “A lot of what’s driving this migration is the reality that they’re going to be assisted on that path toward the United States.”

Why Mueller’s team omitted that part of the Kilimnik narrative from its report and related court filings is not known. But the revelation of it comes as the accuracy of Mueller’s Russia conclusions face increased scrutiny.

ADVERTISEMENT

The incomplete portrayal of Kilimnik is so important to Mueller’s overall narrative that it is raised in the opening of his report. “The FBI assesses” Kilimnik “to have ties to Russian intelligence,” Mueller’s team wrote on Page 6, putting a sinister light on every contact Kilimnik had with Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman.

What it doesn’t state is that Kilimnik was a “sensitive” intelligence source for State going back to at least 2013 while he was still working for Manafort, according to FBI and State Department memos I reviewed.

Kilimnik was not just any run-of-the-mill source, either.

He interacted with the chief political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, sometimes meeting several times a week to provide information on the Ukraine government. He relayed messages back to Ukraine’s leaders and delivered written reports to U.S. officials via emails that stretched on for thousands of words, the memos show.

The FBI knew all of this, well before the Mueller investigation concluded.

Alan Purcell, the chief political officer at the Kiev embassy from 2014 to 2017, told FBI agents that State officials, including senior embassy officials Alexander Kasanof and Eric Schultz, deemed Kilimnik to be such a valuable asset that they kept his name out of cables for fear he would be compromised by leaks to WikiLeaks.

“Purcell described what he considered an unusual level of discretion that was taken with handling Kilimnik,” states one FBI interview report that I reviewed. “Normally the head of the political section would not handle sources, but Kasanof informed Purcell that KILIMNIK was a sensitive source.”

Purcell told the FBI that Kilimnik provided “detailed information about OB (Ukraine’s opposition bloc) inner workings” that sometimes was so valuable it was forwarded immediately to the ambassador. Purcell learned that other Western governments relied on Kilimnik as a source, too.

“One time, in a meeting with the Italian embassy, Purcell heard the Italian ambassador echo a talking point that was strikingly familiar to the point Kilimnik had shared with Purcell,” the FBI report states.

Kasanof, who preceded Purcell as the U.S. Embassy political officer, told the FBI he knew Kilimnik worked for Manafort’s lobbying firm and the administration of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose Party of Regions hired Manafort’s firm.

Kasanof described Kilimnik as one of the few reliable insiders the U.S. Embassy had informing on Yanukovych. Kilimnik began his relationship as an informant with the U.S. deputy chief of mission in 2012–13, before being handed off to the embassy’s political office, the records suggest.

“Kilimnik was one of the only people within the administration who was willing to talk to USEMB,” referring to the U.S. Embassy, and he “provided information about the inner workings of Yanukovych’s administration,” Kasanof told the FBI agents.

“Kasanof met with Kilimnik at least bi-weekly and occasionally multiple times in the same week,” always outside the embassy to avoid detection, the FBI wrote. “Kasanof allowed Kilimnik to take the lead on operational security” for their meetings.

State officials told the FBI that although Kilimnik had Ukrainian and Russian residences, he did not appear to hold any allegiance to Moscow and was critical of Russia’s invasion of the Crimean territory of Ukraine.

“Most sources of information in Ukraine were slanted in one direction or another,” Kasanof told agents. “Kilimnik came across as less slanted than others.”

“Kilimnik was flabbergasted at the Russian invasion of Crimea,” the FBI added, summarizing Kasanof’s interview with agents.

Three sources with direct knowledge of the inner workings of Mueller’s office confirmed to me that the special prosecutor’s team had all of the FBI interviews with State officials, as well as Kilimnik’s intelligence reports to the U.S. Embassy, well before they portrayed him as a Russian sympathizer tied to Moscow intelligence or charged Kilimnik with participating with Manafort in a scheme to obstruct the Russia investigation.

Kasanof’s and Purcell’s interviews are corroborated by scores of State Department emails I reviewed that contain regular intelligence from Kilimnik on happenings inside the Yanukovych administration, the Crimea conflict and Ukrainian and Russian politics. For example, the memos show Kilimnik provided real-time intelligence on everything from whose star in the administration was rising or falling to efforts at stuffing ballot boxes in Ukrainian elections.

Those emails raise further doubt about the Mueller report’s portrayal of Kilimnik as a Russian agent. They show Kilimnik was allowed to visit the United States twice in 2016 to meet with State officials, a clear sign he wasn’t flagged in visa databases as a foreign intelligence threat.

The emails also show how misleading, by omission, the Mueller report’s public portrayal of Kilimnik turns out to be.

For instance, the report makes a big deal about Kilimnik’s meeting with Manafort in August 2016 at the Trump Tower in New York.

By that time, Manafort had served as Trump’s campaign chairman for several months but was about to resign because of a growing controversy about the millions of dollars Manafort accepted as a foreign lobbyist for Yanukovych’s party.

Specifically, the Mueller report flagged Kilimnik’s delivery of a peace plan to the Trump campaign for settling the two-year-old Crimea conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

“Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a ‘backdoor’ way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine,” the Mueller report stated.

But State emails showed Kilimnik first delivered a version of his peace plan in May 2016 to the Obama administration during a visit to Washington. Kasanof, his former handler at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, had been promoted to a top policy position at State, and the two met for dinner on May 5, 2016.

The day after the dinner, Kilimnik sent an email to Kasanof’s official State email address recounting the peace plan they had discussed the night before.

Russia wanted “a quick settlement” to get “Ukraine out of the way and get rid of sanctions and move to economic stuff they are interested in,” Kilimnik wrote Kasanof. The email offered eight bullet points for the peace plan — starting with a ceasefire, a law creating economic recovery zones to rebuild war-torn Ukrainian regions, and a “presidential decree on amnesty” for anyone involved in the conflict on both sides.

Kilimnik also provided a valuable piece of intelligence, stating that the old Yanukovych political party aligned with Russia was dead. “Party of Regions cannot be reincarnated. It is over,” he wrote, deriding as “stupid” a Russian-backed politician who wanted to restart the party.

Kasanof replied the next day that, although he was skeptical of some of the intelligence on Russian intentions, it was “very important for us to know.”

He thanked Kilimnik for the detailed plan and added, “I passed the info to my bosses, who are chewing it over.” Kasanof told the FBI that he believed he sent Kilimnik’s peace plan to two senior State officials, including Victoria Nuland, President Obama’s assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs.

So Kilimnik’s delivery of the peace plan to the Trump campaign in August 2016 was flagged by Mueller as potentially nefarious, but its earlier delivery to the Obama administration wasn’t mentioned. That’s what many in the intelligence world might call “deception by omission.”

Lest you wonder, the documents I reviewed included evidence that Kasanof’s interview with the FBI and Kilimnik’s emails to State about the peace plan were in Mueller’s possession by early 2018, more than a year before the final report.

Officials for the State Department, the FBI, the Justice Department and Mueller’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Kilimnik did not respond to an email seeking comment but, in an email last month to The Washington Post, he slammed the Mueller report’s “made-up narrative” about him. “I have no ties to Russian or, for that matter, any intelligence operation,” he wrote.

Kilimnik holds Ukrainian and Russian citizenship, served in the Soviet military, attended a prestigious Russian language academy and had contacts with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. So it is likely he had contacts over the years with Russian intelligence figures. There also is evidence Kilimnik left the U.S.-funded International Republican Institute (IRI) in 2005 because of concerns about his past connections to Russia, though at least one IRI witness disputed that evidence to the FBI, the memos show.

Yet, omitting his extensive, trusted assistance to the State Department seems inexplicable.

If Mueller’s team can cast such a misleading portrayal of Kilimnik, however, it begs the question of what else might be incorrect or omitted in the report.

Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrBarr compares his return to DOJ to D-Day invasion Barr compares his return to DOJ to D-Day invasion Amash hits Trump and his allies: They are 'trying to excuse' his obstruction efforts MORE has said some of the Mueller report’s legal reasoning conflicts with Justice Department policies. And former Trump attorney John Dowd made a compelling case that Mueller’s report wrongly portrayed a phone message he left for a witness.

A few more such errors and omissions, and Americans may begin to wonder if the Mueller report is worth the paper on which it was printed.

Interior has 5 versions of the secretary's schedule -- but they don't always match,https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/david-bernhardt-conflicting-calendars-interior/index.html,"Washington (CNN) During the early days of the Trump administration, lawmakers and government watchdogs complained agencies weren't turning over Cabinet secretaries' schedules as has been practice. Now, one department has presented those groups with the opposite problem, creating new questions about a lack of consistency and transparency.

The Interior Department has released five different versions of Secretary David Bernhardt's schedule for the first five months of 2019.

The department released Google calendar entries, two versions of daily cards -- which are synopses of the secretary's calendar given to him as a reminder of upcoming events, according to Interior -- briefing book pages and secretary's schedules, which are released on the same section of the Interior website as press releases.

But many of these sources give conflicting information when compared side by side on any given day.

With none of the five sources apparently being the definitive record, it raises questions about what the secretary is actually using to schedule his days and why the public doesn't have access to it.

Conflicting schedules

Take January 10 of this year.

At 9:30 a.m., Bernhardt had a meeting titled ""deputy secretary lapse working group."" Or did he? That information comes from his Google calendar entry, a schedule page and the daily cards for that day. So, it seems clear.

But the briefing book entry for the day says Bernhardt attended a staff meeting at that time. Is that the same meeting or a different one?

Then, according to the briefing book, he had two vaguely described entries -- another staff meeting at 11 a.m. and an ""external lunch off the record"" at noon.

So, what do the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page have at that time? No mention of an 11 a.m. meeting, but an additional 11:45 a.m. meeting with Matt Pottinger and Eric Johnson (NSC) and no mention of a 12 p.m. lunch but a 12:30 p.m. meeting with Brian Jack (OPA), according to the Google calendar and daily cards. NSC stands for the National Security Council and OPA stands for Office of Political Affairs, an office in the White House. The department schedule page seems to confirm that information in a more opaque way, listing an 11:45 a.m. meeting with NSC and a 12:30 p.m. meeting with OPA.

Depending on which calendar you pick, at 2 p.m., Bernhardt either had a meeting with ""Bremberg & Leggit (DPC)"" according to the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page, or he had an ""external call - TRCP,"" according to the briefing book. TRCP stands for Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. A spokesperson for the group confirmed that a member of their organization had a phone call with Bernhardt on that day and time.

At 4:15 p.m., Bernhardt was either in a staff meeting, according to his Google calendar and secretary's schedule page, or he was in an ""AS/WS Operations Meeting,"" according to two versions of the daily cards for that day.

Maybe those are the same, since an operations meeting would presumably be with staff. And that's just one day.

""Like most (if not all) of us, the Secretary of the Interior has a daily schedule that is subject to constant change,"" Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said.

""Appointments that were expected get canceled, unexpected appointments arise and plans get interrupted by events. The department seeks to ensure that the public has access to the secretary's activities by posting online the various tools used to plan his day by different staff members,"" Block said. ""We are constantly working to ensure that the public has a window into the work the secretary is doing on behalf of the American people.""

Five calendars, no consensus

Not all of the calendars conflict every day. On certain days, all five versions of Bernhardt's schedule line up. In some cases, external meetings that don't include meeting attendees on the daily cards have meeting attendees listed in the secretary's schedule page for the same day. Since mid-March, versions of the secretary's schedule pages have included more names of meeting participants.

But there are too many discrepancies to know what the secretary is doing other days. On February 21, there are at least three discrepancies between the name or subject of the meeting, and another 10 instances of meetings and departure times not listed on all the calendars.

And it's not just the entries themselves that don't line up. The different sources of Bernhardt's scheduling information don't cover all five months of 2019. The department posted Google calendar entries from January to May, two versions of daily cards from January to April 16, briefing book pages from January to March and webpages with the the secretary's schedule page from January to March and April 28 to May 24.

The Center for Western Priorities, a watchdog group that focuses on environmental issues and has been critical of the Trump administration, feels the deluge of contradictory information is not just a matter of sloppy record keeping, but rather a concerted effort to conceal the secretary's activities from the public.

""Despite numerous requests from the public, the press, and Congress, David Bernhardt still refuses to release his actual calendar -- the one that tells him not just where to go, but what his meetings are about,"" Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss told CNN. ""It's not just a lack of transparency. It's Bernhardt taking repeated steps to conceal his actions.""

Some of the entries include vague terms like ""external"" and ""internal"" meeting, which Bernhardt has been criticized for in the past, because it gives little insight into who he's meeting with and for what purpose they're meeting.

A CNN review found 88 entries in Bernhardt's daily cards that use the term ""external"" or ""intergovernmental"" to describe a meeting without any further details.

""No one keeps a day planner that only says 'internal briefing' and 'external meeting' with no details. You simply couldn't' function,"" Weiss said.

Calendar controversy continues

Bernhardt, a former fossil fuel lobbyist, previously came under scrutiny from watchdog groups and Democratic members of Congress for not releasing his full schedule publicly. When asked by the House Natural Resources Committee to provide his complete schedule earlier this year, Bernhardt said he had ""not personally maintained a calendar for years,"" and that he had ""no intention of doing so now,"" in a letter to the committee.

A week before his confirmation vote in the Senate, Interior published hundreds of pages of documents containing new details about some meetings that were left off of previous versions of Bernahrdt's calendars.

The House Oversight Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee requested interviews with four Interior staff members to further investigate recordkeeping practices at the department in March.

Before becoming secretary, Bernhardt served as deputy secretary to former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. When Zinke resigned amid a host of ethics scandals at the end of 2018, Bernhardt stepped in to lead the agency in an acting role and was confirmed to the post in April.

When Zinke announced his resignation in December, he referred to the allegations against him as ""false.""

""I love working for the President and am incredibly proud of all the good work we've accomplished together,"" Zinke wrote on Twitter. ""However, after 30 years of public service, I cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations."""
Five ways Google could be vulnerable to a Justice Department probe,https://www.theverge.com,['Jun'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18650489/google-justice-department-antitrust-investigation-monopoly-claims,"On Saturday, The Wall Street Journal reported that investigators from the Department of Justice will examine “Google’s business practices related to its search and other businesses.” It’s one of the biggest threats Google has ever faced from US regulators, but so far, we don’t know much about the case itself. The Journal’s description was open-ended, and the nature of Google’s business makes it vulnerable to antitrust challenges from a number of different directions. Google dominates the search market, but it also holds nearly 40 percent of the digital advertising market, and Android is the world’s most popular operating system. In all of these markets, critics have claimed that Google is simply too big, and it’s faced billion-dollar fines over each of them in Europe.

The probe is supposedly in its early stages, and it’s not clear what the Justice Department might consider worth investigating. But the earlier EU fines, along with a 2013 Federal Trade Commission investigation, offer some guidance. We’ve broken down some of the major monopoly allegations against Google as well as how courts and regulators have treated them so far — from search engine rankings to Android app bundling. (Google, perhaps understandably, did not respond to a request for comment.)

Google has monopolized ad placement

Google is the biggest single player in online advertising: one forecast puts its market share at 37.2 percent in 2019, compared to around 22.1 percent for its closest rival, Facebook. It makes money on two fronts: advertisers can buy ad space through a Google exchange, and websites can serve Google ads through the AdSense program. It’s been accused of abusing its power on both sides of the transaction, which is something Google denies.

The European Commission has specifically investigated Google’s relationship with web publishers. In March, it found that Google had unfairly banned AdSense customers from placing other search engines and ad boxes on their sites. (Google phased out this clause, but it retained the right to “premium” ad space on websites until 2016.) Publishers had fewer options for selling their ad space as a result, potentially driving down their revenue. At the same time, anyone using Google’s ad placement service was also pushed toward using the search engine exclusively, making it harder for competitors like Bing to get off the ground. The EC court fined Google €1.49 billion, saying it had “cemented its dominance” through illegal means. “Google’s conduct harmed competition and consumers,” the court said, “and stifled innovation.”

The FTC also examined this policy, and although it cleared Google in 2013, investigators privately expressed serious concerns about the practice. Bloomberg has noted that AdSense is a declining part of Google’s business, and the company has changed its policies to avert some of the key complaints. But the Justice Department could still decide that these exclusivity deals helped Google — unfairly — reach its current level of power.

Google has monopolized ad sales

Antitrust watchdogs aren’t just worried about how Google places ads on websites; they’re worried about how it sells that ad space. Google historically auctioned off space in a way that favored its AdX marketplace. When publishers and ad tech companies tried to get around that with something called header bidding, Google pushed back with a centralized system that would still give Google’s own exchange a potential advantage.

US and EU regulators approved Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick — which helped Google establish its ad empire — in 2008. Since then, they’ve focused their critiques on things like exclusivity deals. And Google could argue that it’s not hurting consumers or treating other exchanges unfairly. Header bidding can make pages load more slowly, so discouraging it could help web users. Google has dropped policies like the “last look” advantage, which let Google one-up other bids. Amazon has also started chipping away at Google and Facebook’s advertising market share, so it could also say there’s more competition.

Even so, “the fact that Google is able to dominate the advertising market is quite dangerous,” says Matt Stoller, a fellow at the anti-monopoly advocacy group Open Markets Institute. It gives Google power over how people can make money online — and, by extension, what kind of content people see when they browse the web.

Google downranks its competitors in search

But for ordinary users, ad tech might still seem a bit abstract, and there’s a much more visible controversy brewing with Google search.

Google uses search to highlight other Google services, including its business review and shopping platforms. More worryingly, it’s also demoted search results from competing companies. The UK-based comparison shopping platform Foundem claims that Google buried its site while promoting Google Shopping, for instance. EU regulators agreed that the company had overstepped, fining Google €2.4 billion.

Restaurant recommendation site Yelp has also complained about Google’s special search cards, which appear on top of its normal results. (Both of these allegations are unrelated to President Donald Trump’s conspiratorial claims of political “search bias.”) “There’s a lot of great evidence out there showing that Google sort of undertook a strategy to keep its competitors at bay,” says Yelp public policy director Luther Lowe.

The FTC took a look at search manipulation but eventually cleared Google, despite internal concerns. American antitrust law centers on harm to consumers, not businesses — and Google successfully argued that it’s simply offering a better experience than these other sites. But Yelp has since countered this claim with its own studies, suggesting that these cards reduce the usefulness of search results. Former FTC adviser Tim Wu called the research “surprising and shocking,” and it might count against Google in a Justice Department probe.

Google forces phone makers to bundle its apps

Google releases its Android operating system under an open-source license, but phone and tablet makers need to license popular apps like Google Maps and the Google Play Store. For a long time, these manufacturers had to bundle a whole suite of Google services, including Chrome and search. This disadvantaged rival browser and search engine companies, leading the EU to hand down a record-breaking €4.3 billion fine. In response, Google started offering European users a choice of browser and search engine. It also unbundled its services in Europe and started charging an app licensing fee instead.

This may be Google’s most direct equivalent to Microsoft’s “browser war,” which led to a massive antitrust trial in the ‘90s. But The Wall Street Journal’s reporting doesn’t mention Android, and the FTC’s earlier investigation focused more on ads and search practices. So we’ll have to wait to see how broad the Justice Department’s investigation really is.

Google could monopolize the web experience

All of the preceding claims have been around for years, and they involve core parts of Google’s business. But they’re not the only things that might catch the attention of antitrust watchdogs. Google AMP, for example, has raised eyebrows among regulators, activists, and web publishers. It makes pages load super fast on mobile browsers, but it also acts like a special Google-built portal to the web, granting the company a huge amount of power. Google has answered this criticism by giving up some control of AMP, which is an open-source project, to a multicompany committee.

To a far lesser extent, some critics are worried about Google’s moves to block “bad” ads on Chrome — noting that Google has the means and motive to favor its own ads in the process, and Chrome holds an estimated two-thirds of the browser market. When some code suggested that Google might limit third-party ad-blocking extensions, the developers of Ghostery threatened to file an antitrust complaint, until Google said it had never intended to break the extensions.

These complaints haven’t garnered nearly as much attention, and they’re likely to remain in the background of any antitrust probe. But they’re a reminder that Google’s reach is constantly expanding — and so are the complaints against it."

US Commerce Department offers solution for obtaining minerals critical to the military,https://www.defensenews.com,"['Kelsey Reichmann', 'Kelsey Reichmann Is A General Assignment Editorial Fellow Supporting Defense News', 'Fifth Domain', 'Federal Times.

The report was released Tuesday amid a trade war between the United States and China.

“The United States is heavily dependent on critical mineral imports. If China or Russia were to stop exports to the United States and its allies for a prolonged period — similar to China’s rare earths embargo in 2010 — an extended supply disruption could cause significant shocks throughout U.S. and foreign critical mineral supply chains,” the report states.

The report also notes that the U.S. is import-reliant on 31 of the 35 minerals designated as critical by the Department of the Interior. Furthermore, the U.S. completely relies on imports for 14 of these minerals.

The report also says the country’s imports of “critical mineral commodities” exceed 50 percent of its annual consumption. These rare earth minerals are often used in the production of aircraft, computers and GPS systems.

Last year China produced 78 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals, according to researchers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

“These critical minerals are often overlooked but modern life without them would be impossible,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a news release. “Through the recommendations detailed in this report, the Federal government will take unprecedented action to ensure that the United States will not be cut off from these vital minerals.”

One solution to this problem is to enhance international trade and cooperation in relation to rare earth minerals, according to the report.

However, the Government Accountability Office in April found that the U.S. is reliant on China for several critical minerals. And China has noted that it could cut off the U.S. from some rare earth minerals should the trade war continue.

The report from the Department of Commerce proposes a continued expansion of rare earth minerals trading with Canada, Australia, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. It notably does not include China.

The report does, however, mention China as an area to which American production companies relocated, and it called for more investment in the National Defense Stockpile program.

The NDS program, which would provide critical materials to support industrial investments to help civilian needs in an emergency, is not financially sustainable, according to the report."
Former DHS official on CBP declaring 'full-blown' border emergency: Authorities at point of 'desperation',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/cbp-declaring-full-blown-border-emergency,"The head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) declared Wednesday a ""full-blown emergency"" at the southern border, as the number of apprehensions surged last month to levels not seen in more than a decade.

Responding on ""America's Newsroom"" Thursday, former Department of Homeland Security official Theresa Cardinal Brown said it's clear that authorities at the border are in a state of ""desperation.""

Brown said the situation is different from years past because of the number of families and children who are seeking asylum at the border and having to be detained.

TRUMP SAYS MEXICO IS AN ‘ABUSER’ OF THE US, AMID TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS

In his comments to reporters, Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders called the immigration system ""broken,"" explaining that facilities housing migrants near the border are ""well beyond capacity.""

""This ongoing crisis has placed a tremendous strain on our limited resources and operational effectiveness,"" he warned.

Brown told Bill Hemmer that Border Patrol agents and other officials feel like they're not getting enough support and resources from lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

MEXICO OFFICIALS PREPARE TO INTERCEPT ABOUT 1,000 MIGRANTS

""I hear very much the desperation of operators and people whose job it is to deal with the people they encounter at the border effectively and humanely, who feel like they're not able to do their job. ... It is a crisis,"" she said.

Brown said the White House and lawmakers from both parties need to come together and figure out how to deal with the crisis.

She said tensions are high between House Democrats and President Trump in particular, but she pointed back to Bill Clinton negotiating ""significant legislation while he was under impeachment.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible -- more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year.

The number of apprehensions was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

The latest figures could embolden President Trump amid tense negotiations with Mexico over the immigration crisis.

Last week, in an effort to force Mexico to do more to “stop the invasion” of migrants into the U.S., the president vowed to impose a new 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports. The tariffs, set to go into effect on June 10 absent an agreement, would increase over time, reaching 25 percent by Oct. 1.

USDA relocation plan has top NIFA staff competing for handful of D.C. jobs,https://www.politico.com,['Liz Crampton'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/07/usda-relocation-plan-1513620,"USDA has said the relocation will save taxpayer dollars and bring the agencies closer to major farming regions. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Agriculture USDA relocation plan has top NIFA staff competing for handful of D.C. jobs

The Trump administration's plan to move the National Institute of Food and Agriculture out of Washington has created a cutthroat competition among high-level staffers for a limited number of non-relocation positions that employees liken to a ""Hunger Games""-like environment.

Some 70 national program leaders — top positions within NIFA that oversee research areas from forestry to nutrition — are faced with competing for just six national program leader jobs that will remain in D.C., according to interviews with several current and former agency staffers and a copy of a document USDA officials shared with employees detailing the positions that will be required to relocate.

Story Continued Below

Just 20 positions agency-wide will be kept in Washington to maintain “D.C.-centric functions,” such as interacting with lawmakers and government and industry officials, the department said in the document. All other NIFA positions — a number USDA pegs at 315 jobs — will be based in the agency's new headquarters, a site for which is expected to be announced shortly.

Of the 20 positions that will be Washington-based, staffing for the six national program leader jobs will be determined by a “competitive process” in which employees will have to submit formal applications, according to the document.

Multiple national program leaders told POLITICO that Agriculture Department leadership has reassured them that no one will lose their job if they don't land one of the Washington posts.

But the employees said they are anxious about what their positions would entail if they are relocated. They said they feel like they've been left in the dark about how the application process will be conducted and what the timeline will be. And they said they believe the process will contribute to a spike in departures that has rippled through the agency since Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue unveiled the relocation plan in August.

“You would not believe the emotional distress people are going through,"" one of the employees told POLITICO, requesting anonymity for fear of reprisal. ""They’re losing sleep, getting sick, medical conditions are exacerbated by this.”

Employees now commonly use ""Hunger Games"" as a shorthand for the competition that awaits them — a reference to a science fiction book in which children are selected to compete to the death for entertainment.

NIFA workers didn't learn that select employees would be allowed to stay in Washington until a staff-wide meeting in March — or seven months after Perdue announced the relocation proposal, staffers told POLITICO. Following that meeting, ""people were left with a lot of questions and a lot of bewilderment about what this is going to do to us,” said another NIFA employee granted anonymity due to their fear of retaliation.

Employees said their unease over the pending move is made worse by the fact that the application process remains uncertain more than three months after the staff-wide meeting.

The department's decision to have national program directors vie for Washington-based jobs “starts pitting people against each other who have worked together for decades,"" said Sonny Ramaswamy, a former NIFA director during the Obama administration who has been outspoken against the relocation.

“It is the most pathetic thing to do,” he said.

NIFA has the primary responsibility of funneling USDA grants for projects to land-grant universities across the country. As the liaison between land-grant universities and the federal government, the agency coordinates regional research projects involving multiple academic institutions.

Perdue's plan to revamp the department's research wing would relocate NIFA along with the Economic Research Service. The proposal has been criticized by current and former agency staffers, who say morale has taken a huge hit, and by a number of lawmakers, mostly Democrats.

The House's fiscal 2020 spending bill for USDA, which cleared the Appropriations Committee earlier this week, includes language that would block Perdue from relocating the agencies and from implementing another part of the plan — bringing ERS under the control of the Office of the Chief Economist, where some argue it would be more open to direct influence from the Office of the Secretary. But it is unlikely the spending bill will become law before the department begins the final part of the relocation process.

Much of the criticism of the plan has focused on the department's motivations for relocating ERS staff and for the potential for its research to be politicized. A number of current and former agency employees previously told POLITICO they believe the move is an effort to silence research that could make the White House look bad.

A USDA spokesperson confirmed the department recently told NIFA and ERS employees how the reorganized agencies would operate — and stressed that communication with staff is a priority.

""As part of our vision to make USDA the most efficient, most effective and most customer-focused department in the federal government, USDA recently shared information with NIFA and ERS employees describing the proposed functionality of each agency which has been determined to remain within the National Capital Region versus the functionality that will be re-located,"" a USDA spokesperson said in a statement to POLITICO.

""Currently, USDA’s highest priority regarding the relocation is communicating with our employees. As there is additional information to share with the public, USDA remains committed to doing so,"" the statement added.

But employees warn that relocating NIFA will compromise the agency's ability to efficiently get research funds out the door. And they're worried that the move and the competitive process for the Washington-based jobs could contribute to people leaving USDA and create a brain drain of research knowledge that has already started to become apparent at ERS, where six economists left on the same day earlier this year.

NIFA employees are set to vote next week on whether to unionize. ERS staff voted to form a union last month.

USDA has said the relocation will save taxpayer dollars and bring the agencies closer to major farming regions. The department has narrowed the site selection process to the greater Kansas City area, North Carolina‘s Research Triangle Park and multiple locations in Indiana.

Perdue, in Raleigh, N.C., earlier this week, told a local news outlet that employees “have been vocal, obviously; but anytime you make change and you move people’s cheese, there’s always anxiety.”

Scientists inside and outside NIFA said they’re worried that taking the bulk of the agency away from Washington could also lower its profile among congressional appropriators and as a result lead to decreased funding levels.

There’s also widespread concern among researchers in academia that institutions near the new home of NIFA could be disadvantaged when applying for USDA funding by the department's effort to guard against the appearance of bias.

Linda Prokopy, a professor of natural resources and social science at Purdue University, said she's rooting for Indiana to not be selected because she believes it would reduce her chances of getting funded.

""They're going to bend over backwards to demonstrate that they're not biased and I don't think that's going to be good for whoever is in that final location,"" she said.

"EPA may take Salt Lake off its dirty-air list, thanks partly to the weather",https://www.sltrib.com,"['Spierce Sltrib.Com', 'Scott D. Pierce']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/06/06/epa-may-take-salt-lake/,"After 13 years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is poised to remove the Salt Lake metro region from its list of areas that violate its 24-hour pollution standards for fine particulates.

That’s partly because the state has made efforts to reduce its emissions — Utah’s Air Quality Board has passed more than 20 regulations to reduce industry emissions — and partly because Utah has been, well, lucky.

“Luck is a big part of this,” said Thom Carter, executive director of the Utah Clean Air Partnership, or UCAIR. “Remember, our air-quality problem starts as a weather issue. It all has to do with inversion.”

And temperature inversions, which trap dirty air in the Salt Lake Valley, were less severe from 2016 through 2018. The EPA made the proposal to change the region’s designation based on air-quality monitoring from that three-year period, which showed the area did not exceed the standard for the first time since it was established in 2006.

(The Salt Lake region includes all of Salt Lake and Davis counties and parts of Box Elder, Tooele and Weber counties.)

Just two years ago, the EPA classified the Salt Lake region as a “serious” nonattainment area.

“We’ve reduced our emissions significantly over this period of time,” Carter said. “Additionally, we’ve had great weather patterns in the last three years. But if we go a long time between storms in the wintertime, then we will exceed the limit.”

This is not a case of Salt Lake coming into compliance because the standards were lowered. Actually, when the policy was instituted in 2006, it was for PM10 particulates — a standard that has since been changed to the more stringent PM2.5, measuring particulates one-quarter the size of PM10.

The monitoring averages PM2.5 particulates across 24-hour periods, so the levels could still exceed the standard at times and be in compliance. The EPA’s rules allow an area to exceed the limits for approximately 21 days over the course of three years.

PM2.5 refers to particulates that are 2.5 microns or less in width; the largest are about 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair. They reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated.

Short-term health effects include eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, sneezing, runny nose and shortness of breath. Long term, the fine particulates can affect lung function and worsen asthma and heart disease.

Article continues below

Carter pointed to the billions and billions of dollars invested by mining companies and oil refineries to install the “best available technologies” to control their emissions as one reason the PM2.5 levels have fallen. He said individual Utahns have helped, too.

“We’ve seen in our own personal data where people are saying they’re car pooling more than they’ve ever carpooled. They’re not idling as much. They’re trip-chaining,” he said. “People are better aware of their own emission space, and they’re finding ways to be part of the solution.”

Not all Utahns, however, according to a Salt Lake Tribune-Hinckley Institute of Politics poll conducted in January. It indicated about a third of those surveyed had changed their commuting habits to improve air quality.

The change in designation is not yet a done deal. The EPA posted its proposal on the Federal Register on Wednesday; a 30-day period for comments runs through July 5. Comments can be submitted to regulations.gov, identified by docket ID No. EPA-R08-OAR-2019-0081.

Even if it is finalized, it’s not necessarily a permanent change. Monitoring will continue, and Salt Lake City could end up back on the noncompliant list.

“Today is a day for everybody to shake hands and say, 'Congratulations, we've achieved something,'” Carter said. “But this is step one. We're nowhere near being done. And anybody who thinks we're done is crazy."

Thousands of Brits Protest Trump’s Visit Alongside 16-Foot Farting Presidential Robot,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Jamie Ross'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-in-britain-thousands-of-brits-protest-presidents-visit-alongside-16-foot-farting-robot,"LONDON—Thousands of Brits took to the streets here Tuesday, where they marched alongside a 16-foot farting robot of Donald Trump and held aloft huge photos of John McCain in an attempt to trigger the president.

The protests—which saw thousands brave the typical British weather shielded by umbrellas emblazoned with anti-Trump slogans, EU flags, and the LGBTQ rainbow symbol—went within meters of Downing Street, where the president must have heard creatively foul-mouthed chants, although he still insists there have been no protests against him at all.

Protesters were kept away from the gates of Downing Street for Trump’s arrival and departure for talks with Theresa May. However, the thousands occupied a large stretch of central London, marching from Trafalgar Square past the government buildings of Whitehall and eventually arriving outside parliament to hear a speech by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.

As always, the protesters in Britain clearly put a lot of effort into their preparations to mock Trump. The most eye-catching part of the parade was a huge robotic statue named the Trump Dump, which featured the gigantic president atop a golden toilet, with a smartphone in his agitating hand. It emitted farting noises and the catchphrase “no collusion.”

“I wanted to honor him by showing him in all his glory,” the monster’s creator, Don Lessem, explained to The Daily Beast, claiming it cost him $25,000 of his own cash. “It’s 16 feet, which is the size of his ego. We wanted to match that. It needs to be a little more orange I think, but we tried to do it as proportionally accurate as possible, so his penis is three millimeters.”

Lessem’s ultimate goal is to crowdfund an effort to bring the robot to Washington, D.C. for the July 4 celebrations, but he was proud to give it its “world debut” to coincide with the president’s trip to London.

There were thousands of slightly less extravagant attempts to ridicule the president during his visit. On Monday, he dubiously claimed that he had been greeted by “tremendous crowds of well wishers” rather than protests and that there was “great love all around” on his first state visit.

On the contrary, the crowd couldn’t have displayed any more antipathy for him, even though there appeared to be smaller numbers than a huge protest against him last year. Signs showed various degrees of exasperation, ranging from the playful “Who invited this wally anyway?” to the frank “You’re a racist twat, mate,” to the laconic “Fuck this fucking fucker.”

One popular choice appeared to be showing images of the late Senator John McCain, following reports last week that the White House ordered the USS John S. McCain to be hidden from Trump’s sight in Japan.

Jeffrey Kaser Paradi explained to The Daily Beast: “I never thought I’d be holding a photograph of a Republican ever in my life, but after last week when the White House instructed the Navy to cover up the name of the battleship for fear of triggering Donald Trump. You know, I’d just hate for him to see an image of him on his trip here to the U.K..”

The protest was largely good-natured and police seemed relaxed. It was clear that the protest was also about Britain’s own political crises, with the anti-Trump marchers displaying a lot of support for the European Union and the pro-Trump marchers being very supportive of Brexit.

There were some scenes in the crowd that perhaps went slightly too far when the two sides clashed. One small, paper U.S. flag was torn from one pro-Trump marcher and stomped upon, while a Make America Great Again hat was snatched from the head of a Trump supporter and dumped in a fresh pile of dung left behind by one of the police horses.

But the anti-Trump marchers’ activity was largely limited to chants and songs, a lot of which were based on classic British music. For example, a somewhat predictable remix of Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall” that replaced the word “brick” with something a little ruder.

Trump supporters were vastly outnumbered, largely white and male, and they were significantly angrier than the anti-Trump marchers. They marched with QAnon and anti-George Soros flags, were abusive toward rival protesters, and many proudly espoused extreme right-wing views.

One group calling itself Scots for Trump gathered at the protest with a big banner and were led by a well-known activist, Alistair McConnachie, who has previously made headlines in Scotland for denying that Jews were murdered in gas chambers in Nazi Germany. “That’s not something I would speak about because whenever you speak about it only gets yourself into hot water,” he told The Daily Beast when questioned about it.

McConnachie’s main beliefs appeared to be supporting Trump for “standing up very strongly for the principle of borders,” while also campaigning vociferously against Scottish independence. Asked why he supports a rigid border system between Mexico and the U.S. but argues so strongly against it between England and Scotland, his only attempt at an explanation was that the Scottish border “only exists in the imagination.”

During a press conference with May later Tuesday, Trump wrongly claimed there were “thousands of people” on the streets cheering him on both days of his visit so far and that he didn’t see any protesters. He does have supporters, but from Tuesday afternoon’s evidence they appeared to be nothing more than a handful of oddballs with extreme views.

Trump could be confused or, more likely, willfully wrong. But if he wants to see the evidence for himself he need only pop outside, with an umbrella."
"DOJ rejects call for census docs, teeing up contempt vote",https://thehill.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/447390-doj-rejects-call-for-census-docs-teeing-up-contempt-vote,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) informed Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee that it would not be meeting their request for additional documents regarding the administration's push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The response comes despite the committee’s threats it would schedule a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrBarr compares his return to DOJ to D-Day invasion Barr compares his return to DOJ to D-Day invasion Amash hits Trump and his allies: They are 'trying to excuse' his obstruction efforts MORE in contempt if the subpoenaed information wasn’t provided by 5 p.m. Thursday.

In a letter written to committee Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsBarr compares his return to DOJ to D-Day invasion Barr compares his return to DOJ to D-Day invasion White House sought to assert executive privilege in Kobach interview on census citizenship question, Cummings says MORE (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd alleged the “committee's action is premature,” adding DOJ officials “are disappointed by the committee's mischaracterization of the Department's continued and ongoing efforts to accommodate the committee's oversight interests.”

Boyd argued the documents subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege, adding the agency has worked to accommodate the panel’s requests by providing relevant documents and made senior officials available for transcribed interviews with committee staffers.

The DOJ and Democratic-controlled committee have been at odds over the push for certain documents and the panel’s call for John Gore, a top official in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, to testify without a department lawyer present — a move the agency said is unprecedented.

Barr instructed Gore not to comply with the committee’s request unless the committee agrees to allow the presence of DOJ counsel.

“Despite the Department's significant and ongoing efforts to accommodate the Committee's requests, your June 3 letter alleges lack of compliance by the Attorney General based on (1) the Committee's dissatisfaction with the Department's ongoing document production; and (2) the Attorney General's instruction that Mr. Gore not appear before the Committee for a third time, for a deposition, unless the Committee allows him to be accompanied by Department counsel.

""Let us address first the Attorney General's instruction concerning Mr. Gore's appearance,” Boyd wrote.

Boyd said DOJ is amenable to working with and providing information to the panel, but argued their call for the information could interfere with the Supreme Court’s ongoing litigation on the matter.

“The Department remains willing to continue working with the Committee to find a resolution that would balance Congress's ‘legitimate need for information that will help it legislate’ and the Department's ‘legitimate, constitutionally recognized need to keep certain information confidential,"" he wrote.

“One challenge, of course, has been the Committee's desire to conduct oversight of the Commerce Department's decision to reinstate the citizenship question on the 2020 Census while the matter is being actively litigated, rather than waiting a short period of time until the matter is resolved. Nonetheless, as discussed, the Department will continue to produce documents to the Committee as appropriate.”

In addition to issuing a subpoena for Gore in April, the Oversight Committee also issued two separate subpoenas: One requesting the agency's communications on the census question with the White House, the Republican National Committee, the Trump campaign and Congressional lawmakers; and another seeking unredacted internal communications and documents on the addition of the question from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossWhite House sought to assert executive privilege in Kobach interview on census citizenship question, Cummings says White House sought to assert executive privilege in Kobach interview on census citizenship question, Cummings says Cummings to move forward with contempt votes for Barr, Ross over census question MORE.

The Department of Commerce announced the addition of the question on citizenship status on the next census last year, saying it will help the Department of Justice enforce the Voting Rights Act.

The decision sparked pushback from a number of states, who launched legal challenges to the addition of the question in the courts.

Critics of the decision argue it could deter individuals from responding to the census, which could lead to the population being undercounted. The census is used, in part, to calculate how federal funding is allocated.

In a letter written to Barr on Tuesday, Cummings said he would hold off on scheduling the contempt vote if the subpoenaed information was provided by Thursday.

He also pointed to evidence filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in court last week that alleged previously undisclosed actions by a Republican redistricting strategist in getting the citizenship question added to the 2020 census, raising questions about the motivation of the addition.

The Justice Department adamantly denied the allegations, arguing the ACLU’s evidence is an ""eleventh hour"" attempt to derail the Supreme Court's consideration of the citizenship question.

""This baseless attack on the integrity of the Department and its employees is based on nothing more than fevered speculation and supposed 'new' evidence that, in reality, the plaintiffs have known for months,"" the Department said. ""The study that plaintiffs recovered from the personal belongings of a deceased private citizen played no role in the Department of Justice’s letter recommending reinstatement of a citizenship question to the Census.""

The U.S. Agriculture Department has good news it seemingly wants nobody to know about.

On April 23, the USDA released its “School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study,” with no news release, no fanfare. The link on the USDA website disappeared for several days after that and was altogether inaccessible before reappearing under a different URL.

The USDA says the study was “the first nationally representative, comprehensive assessment” of school meals after the implementation of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, a key initiative of the Obama administration that mandated healthy changes in food at schools.

The best news was that the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010), a multicomponent measure of diet quality, shot up dramatically for both school-provided breakfasts and lunches.

For the 2009-2010 school year, the score for breakfast was an abysmal 49.6 out of 100 (even lower than the overall American average of 59), rising to 71.3 by the 2014-2015 school year. In that same time frame, the lunch score went from 57.9 to 81.5. The score for whole grains in school meals went from 25 to 95 percent of the maximum score, and the score for greens and beans rose from 21 to 72 percent.

In addition, there was greater participation in school meal programs at schools with the highest healthy food standards. And the study found food waste, a troubling national problem in the lunchroom, remained relatively unchanged.

The 52-page summary of study findings is chockablock with other good news, so why isn’t Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue crowing about it?

The USDA did not respond directly when asked about the rollout beyond a statement that said it conducts studies like this to inform choices on policies and program operations, and that “we intend to use it to make these great programs even better.”

“It seems fairly outside of the norm for a federal agency to release a study that directly contradicts what the administration’s position is,” explained Elizabeth Balkan, food waste director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “That’s why it was released very quietly.”

In December, Perdue announced the USDA was weakening school nutrition standards for whole grain, nonfat milk and sodium, all of which had been tightened during the Obama administration. He cited food waste and nonparticipation as key rationales for the shift.

“If kids are not eating what is being served, they are not benefiting, and food is being wasted,” he said at the time.

About two-thirds of the 30 million children who eat school meals every day qualify as low-income and are getting meals free or for a reduced price. Low-income kids are disproportionately affected by obesity and are less likely to be fed healthy meals at home, so the nutritional makeup of those school meals is impactful. Kids can get more than half of their daily calories from school meals.

“As a nutrition and public-health policymaker, what’s extraordinary is for a policy to have that large an effect, to affect tens of millions of school kids. If you consider the crisis that we face — people living shorter, less healthy lives — solutions usually take decades,” said Jerry Mande, a senior USDA official during the Obama administration who was involved in developing the standards. “Within two years there’s a dramatic change. This demonstrates the power the USDA has to change the way kids eat. We should be doubling down on this.”

Advocates say the push to roll back stricter requirements is consistent with President Trump’s overall mission of deregulation.

“Waste was the smokescreen,” said Margo Wootan, vice president for nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “There have been several studies that showed that food waste hadn’t increased.”

Wootan enumerates many things that can be done — beyond making food saltier, fattier or more processed — to reduce food waste in schools. Have recess before lunch to work up hunger and don’t schedule lunch times midmorning before kids are peckish. Cut up apples instead of offering them whole. Offer taste tests and share tables and give students opportunities to provide more input. Perhaps most importantly, adopt an “offer versus serve” approach at elementary schools and middle schools (it is required at high schools). This means that students can select three out of five meal components and avoid things they don’t like and are likely to discard.

“The Trump administration wants to tick off the maximum number of regulations it can say it rolled back,” Wootan said. “It’s another tick mark on the deregulatory agenda.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 13.7 million, or 18.5 percent, of children aged 2 to 19 are obese. That percentage is higher for Hispanics (25.8 percent) and non-Hispanic blacks (22 percent).

The American Medical Association changed the term obesity from a condition into a disease in 2013. The CDC says obesity puts people at an increased risk for all causes of death, but it is linked to high blood pressure and cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and some cancers.

The School Nutrition Association, the trade group for school food-service manufacturers and school food professionals, has commended Perdue for seeking regulatory flexibility.

Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the association, says that although the study findings are very positive, the new standards have presented challenges for school districts.

“We’re seeing a lot of schools struggle with cultural preferences with students. Like white rice — some cultures don’t eat brown rice. And in the Southwest, there are students who are not familiar with a whole-grain tortilla.”

She also says that participation in school lunch programs has dropped, from 32 million to 30 million, under the new standards, and that as a result, costs per student have increased.

Schools are forced to rely more heavily on a la carte items (a sandwich, rather than the full meal with fruits, veggies and milk) to stay solvent.

Schools have also looked to restaurant practices, offering more customizable meals such as burritos made to order, to boost participation, and catering programs on the side to bolster revenue. Bottom line, she says: The cost of preparing the new style of meals frequently exceeds the cost of reimbursement.

However, that runs counter to the study’s finding that healthier meals did not impose a greater financial burden.

“There was no significant association between reported cost per NSLP (National School Lunch Program) lunch and the nutritional quality of the meals,” the study said. “That is, mean reported costs per NSLP lunch were not significantly higher in schools that prepared more-nutritious meals . . . than in schools that produced the least-nutritious meals.”"
