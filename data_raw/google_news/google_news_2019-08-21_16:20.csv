Migrant Families Would Face Indefinite Detention Under New Trump Rule,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Michael D. Shear', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/us/politics/flores-migrant-family-detention.html,"“It was about prolonged detention of children had proven to be harmful to their health,” Mr. Thompson said. “I think the court looked at it from that perspective rather than a punitive decision on the department.”

The Trump administration’s regulation, which is several hundred pages long, eliminates a requirement that federal detention centers for immigrant families be licensed by states, most of which had no such licenses.

Instead, under the regulation, the three centers built to house hundreds of immigrant families — in Dilley and Karnes City, Tex., and Leesport, Pa. — would have to meet standards set only by ICE, which runs them.

The administration officials insisted Tuesday that the facilities were, and would continue to be, maintained at high standards for the immigrants who were detained there. They said the facilities provided health care, education and “top notch” food.

But critics of the administration have long argued that the facilities were unsuitable for children to be held for long periods of time. And the recent examples of horrible conditions at overcrowded Border Patrol detention centers have underscored their concerns about the residential centers.

“We don’t disagree with detaining children when it’s necessary — namely, if they’re a flight risk or they’re a danger to themselves or others, we agree,” said Peter Schey, a lawyer who filed the original case and has continued to defend the settlement terms in court since. “It’s the unnecessary detention of child that this settlement sought to end. So these regulations really reflect a flagrant disregard on the part of President Trump and his administration for the safety and the well-being of children in the care of the federal government.”

Last summer, the Trump administration began separating children from their parents as a way to get around the Flores agreement. The children were sent to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services while the adults were imprisoned while awaiting trial on their violation of immigration laws."
Trump's attempt to outrun a recession might make things worse,https://www.cnn.com,['Donna Borak'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/21/politics/us-economy-recession-trump/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump is trying to outrun a possible recession as he runs for reelection in 2020, but his efforts to keep the economy going now might make any downturn harder to fix.

Trump says he's looking at a range of proposals to keep the economy moving -- everything from giving workers a pay bump by cutting payroll taxes to cutting capital gains taxes for investors.

But economists say attempts by the President to get ahead of a slowdown today would leave policymakers with far less ammunition to fend off further calamities down the road.

""We're shooting all the arrows before we even need to start shooting,"" said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""If things turn out badly, our conventional tools will have been exhausted to a great degree.""

During past downturns, both Democrats and Republicans -- including former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- have leaned on tools like one-time tax rebates or extended unemployment benefits to spur consumer spending, a major driver of economic growth.

"In Denmark, Bewilderment and Anger Over Trump’s Canceled Visit",https://www.nytimes.com,['Martin Selsoe Sorensen'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/world/europe/greenland-denmark-trump.html,"ODENSE, Denmark — The astonishment in Denmark over President Trump’s apparent desire to buy Greenland turned to bewilderment and anger on Wednesday after the American leader abruptly scrapped a state visit because the Danes have no desire to sell.

The cancellation was a rare snub of Denmark’s head of state, Queen Margrethe II, who had extended the invitation to the president and would have hosted him and the first lady.

News that Mr. Trump had called off his visit “came as a surprise,” the Royal House’s communications director told the state broadcaster, adding, “That’s all we have to say about that.”

Others, however, had more to say. “Is this some sort of joke?” Helle Thorning-Schmidt, a former prime minister, wrote on Twitter. “Deeply insulting to the people of Greenland and Denmark.”"

Joe Walsh, a pugnacious former congressman, is preparing a Republican primary challenge to President Trump that he previewed as a daily “bar fight” with the incumbent over his morality and competency.

Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman, said he is inching closer to a bid of his own by sounding out activists in New Hampshire and other early-voting states about an insurgency focused on the ballooning deficit.

Jeff Flake, a former Arizona senator and Trump antagonist, said he has taken a flurry of recruitment calls in recent days from GOP donors rattled by signs of an economic slowdown and hungry for an alternative to Trump.

And former Ohio governor John Kasich will head to New Hampshire next month to “take a look at things” after experiencing “an increase” in overtures this summer, an adviser said.

The anti-Trump movement inside the Republican Party — long a political wasteland — is feeling new urgency to mount a credible opposition to Trump before it’s too late. With state deadlines for nominating contests rapidly approaching in the fall, potential candidates face pressure to decide on running within the next few weeks. So far, only former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld has declared that he is running, but he has struggled to gain traction.

Republicans considering bids, as well as those trying to draft other candidates, acknowledge that defeating Trump appears to be nearly impossible but argue that a recession or an unforeseen change in the political climate could weaken him enough to make a primary challenge more than a Never Trump fantasy.

“Anybody who says, ‘I think I can beat Donald Trump,’ I think is stretching it,” Sanford said. “It’s a daunting task and it is indeed preposterous at many different levels.”

But Sanford said he recently returned from a trip to New Hampshire and is leaning toward jumping in — “another ‘green light on go’ versus ‘no go’ ” — and figures he “could win without winning.”

“If [Trump] gives you a nickname and has surrogates rough you up, you could get a message out and create a national conversation on what it means to be a Republican these days and that could probably be worth the endeavor,” Sanford said.

Money will be an immense hurdle. Trump and the affiliated committees raising money for his reelection bid reported collecting $105 million in April, May and June, shattering quarterly records. Many traditional Republican donors already are backing Trump, but anti-Trump organizers are courting wealthy independents or even liberals to contribute in the GOP primary, if only to bruise the president and help the eventual Democratic nominee in the general election.

Trump’s advisers and allies have dismissed the efforts as feckless plotting by a bloc that has lost relevance in the GOP. They also say the Trump campaign has built significant structural advantages that have effectively ensured he will be renominated at the party’s convention in Charlotte, such as placing loyalists in leadership posts at state parties and working closely with state GOP chairs to manage the delegate selection process.

“It’s a free country and people are allowed to have hobbies,” former House speaker Newt Gingrich said with a chuckle when asked about the primary bustle.

Inside the White House, neither Trump nor his team consider Weld or the prospective candidates to be serious threats because there has been no evidence of a groundswell of grass-roots support behind them.

“There’s no discussion of any of them or any of that,” said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president. “None of them even has risen to the level of a nickname.”

The Republican National Committee is using aggressive measures to stave off any possible primary tussle. RNC members passed a resolution this year giving Trump the party’s “undivided support” and effectively merged with Trump’s campaign. “Republicans are firmly behind the president and any effort to challenge him in a primary is bound to go absolutely nowhere,” RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.

A Fox News poll last week had Trump at 88 percent approval among Republicans, which was the rating he had among Republicans in Gallup polling for the first half of August. The polling outlook among Republicans in early voting states is also favorable to Trump.

But that hasn’t stopped anti-Trump Republicans from scrambling to map out potential campaigns, driven by varying mixes of duty, conservative ire, ambition, vanity and loathing for Trump.

Walsh, now a talk-radio host, said he voted for Trump in 2016 but concluded after Trump declined in Helsinki last year to confront Russian President Vladi­mir Putin over election interference that he was “fundamentally unfit” for the office. He said he is huddling this week with potential supporters and is leaning toward announcing a campaign next month.

Referring to Trump, he said, “He’s a bully and he’s a coward. Somebody’s got to punch him in the face every single day.”

Walsh, who has his own history of incendiary comments, was elected to the House from Illinois in 2010 as part of the tea party wave and served one term. He described himself as an immigration hard-liner and said he would not challenge Trump from the center but from the right and on moral grounds.

Sanford is taking a different tack. He said that the case against Trump over morality, decency and corruption already is being made by other conservative commentators, so his prospective candidacy would fixate almost entirely on Trump’s deficit spending.

“We really are at a financial tipping point the likes of which we haven’t seen in a very long time,” Sanford said. “Unless we constructively engage this issue, which is not being done, I think the financial markets will do it for us, and historically that process has been bloody for regular, working, everyday Americans.”

Kasich, meanwhile, is “continually looking at this race and has seen an increase in people asking him to get in,” adviser John Weaver said. He is returning to New Hampshire in September to reconnect with supporters in the state in which he finished second to Trump in the 2016 primary.

“It’s prudent to take a look at things,” Weaver added.

Weld, a moderate and maverick who was the Libertarian Party’s vice-presidential nominee in 2016, acknowledged that his campaign has so far sputtered, but he plans to spend much of the fall roaming around New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary state that has elevated past challengers of incumbents.

“I’ve been thinking for a long time that the president’s shtick might begin to wear a little thin,” Weld said. “It’s not just because of the tariffs and his economic policy, but because of how he crossed the line in going after congressman Elijah Cummings and Baltimore as a ‘rat-infested’ city, and then the outrageous racism of taking on four minority congresswomen.”

Weld’s campaign, however, is dealing with its own upheaval. His political confidant, veteran GOP strategist Stuart Stevens, departed on Aug. 1 to work at a pro-Weld super PAC, and Jennifer Horn quietly exited as Weld’s campaign manager earlier this summer, with Weld now in the process of hiring new advisers.

New Hampshire’s terrain is far from guaranteed to be fertile for Trump’s critics. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is mulling a Senate campaign that could energize Trump’s most loyal supporters in the state — and Trump has cultivated his core voters there with arena rallies and frequent visits.

“It’s going to be extremely difficult for any primary candidate to build the operation required to be effective,” said Horn, a former New Hampshire GOP chair.

Despite the daunting odds, Flake said some Republican donors have “stepped up” their calls to him in recent days as the stock market has been rattled. Flake said they have asked whether he would reconsider a bid against Trump, months after he joined CBS News as a contributor and ruled out a 2020 campaign.

“They are wondering, if the economy isn’t stellar next year, how is the party going to win? By the president offending more people?” Flake said, declining to name the donors.

Flake said he has told them he is unlikely to reconsider his decision but would keep the door slightly ajar.

“I haven’t changed my mind and this is still the president’s party,” he said. “That’s the case right now.”

Anthony Scaramucci, once one of Trump’s biggest boosters on the White House staff, has turned on the president and is using his celebrity to rally Republicans against his former boss. He announced Tuesday he would create a super PAC, “the Committee to Dismantle Trump,” to run advertisements attacking the president.

“I’m going to throw my own dough in there, ask others to put their dough in there, and we’re going to explain to people what he’s doing,” Scaramucci told strategists David Axelrod and Mike Murphy on the “Hacks on Tap” podcast. He added, “I can grab a hold of 5, 6, 8 percent of the people that know he’s nuts and possibly move them.”

At the center of the fledgling movement is Bill Kristol, a longtime conservative commentator, who has become a power broker for anti-Trump Republicans — and a target of scorn for Trump and his followers.

Kristol directs an outside group, Republicans for the Rule of Law, and has played the role of recruiter, such as when he pitched Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan about running against Trump at a Baltimore Orioles game in April. Hogan decided not to run.

Kristol said he respects Weld, along with others who might run, but said his “dream scenario” would be for Trump to weaken this fall and a more prominent Republican decide to get in. This would have echoes of 1968, when then-President Lyndon B. Johnson’s reelection campaign was upended by Sen. Eugene McCarthy’s near upset in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, prompting Johnson to withdraw and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy to enter the race.

“You need more erosion of Trump in the polls, maybe an economic slowdown, more of a sense of him coming unglued, but the key is getting voters to focus on the question of whether they’re okay with four more years of Trump in the Oval Office,” Kristol said.

Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, is privately held by many anti-Trump activists and donors as their preferred standard-bearer, even though they do not expect him to run.

While Romney has kept a low profile in the Senate, he said in a speech in Salt Lake City on Monday that he considers himself a “renegade Republican” — and, in a swipe at Trump, said that “the likes of Putin and [North Korean dictator] Kim Jong Un deserve a censure rather than flattery,” according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

But Romney was realistic about the political dynamics. “My slice of the Republican Party these days is about that big,” he said, holding his hands closely together.

"DHS moves to end limits on detention of migrant families, close 'loophole'",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-detention-migrant-families,"The Trump administration announced Wednesday it would move to scrap a major court agreement in order to allow for migrant families to be detained longer as their cases are being considered, instead of having to release them after 20 days.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, in a press conference detailing the decision, claimed that the long-standing court order known as the Flores agreement has incentivized illegal immigration and represents a ""loophole"" in the immigration system.

That agreement prohibited children from being kept in detention for more than 20 days. As a result, officials were releasing entire families to keep them from being separated -- though last year, the administration did separate families as part of a ""zero tolerance"" program that eventually was stopped amid a bipartisan outcry.

BORDER PATROL NABS NEARLY 200 CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS NEAR NEW MEXICO PORT OF ENTRY

""Today, the government has issued a critical rule that will permit the Department of Homeland Security to appropriately hold families together and improve the integrity of the immigration system,” McAleenan said. “This rule allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress and ensures that all children in U.S. government custody are treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability.”

The Flores ruling came about as a result of a 1980s case in which a girl named Jenny Flores, then 15, was detained with adults by U.S. authorities after she fled El Salvador. Beginning in 1997, the Flores settlement called for migrant children to be sent to care programs after 20 days, and be given access to medical treatment and visits with relatives. McAleenan said the new rule takes the place of Flores, while keeping many of its terms.

The new rule is slated to go into effect in 60 days, though the change is sure to face a new court challenge.

In July, at a House Oversight Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., accused McAleenan and other administration officials of seeking to scrap the Flores Settlement, with the alleged goal ""to keep kids longer"" in custody.

McAleenan pushed back against that characterization. He explained that he wanted to keep families together for the time necessary it takes for immigration proceedings to go through, and for the justice system to make a ruling on the case.

“We want to keep families together through an immigration proceeding that's fair and expeditious in an appropriate setting,” he said. “That can't be done in 20 days with due process.""

Democrats have slammed the detentions as “inhumane."" When the new rule was announced, the ACLU called it ""another cruel attack on children,"" by allowing them to be held for longer than previously allowed.

""The government should NOT be jailing kids, and certainly shouldn’t be seeking to put more kids in jail for longer,"" they said.

Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro vowed to end all detention if he wins the presidency.

""Separating migrant children from their parents is appalling—but indefinitely detaining families isn’t a better alternative,"" he tweeted after McAleenan's announcement.

Republicans such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have claimed that the current system has resulted in children being used, repeatedly, by adults posing as family members to get into the U.S.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

“This is a sick system, it’s rotten to its core,” Graham told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo in July, stating that 30 percent of those who cross into the U.S. with children are “fake families,” and that loopholes are used to let the same children come back over and over, bringing different adults with them.

McAleenan said approximately 6,000 migrants fraudulently presented themselves as families in the past fiscal year.

""No child should be a pawn in a scheme to manipulate our immigration system,"" he said.

In addition to putting an end to the 20-day limit, the plans announced Wednesday also set standards for detention facilities, which have been criticized by members of both parties for not having sufficient resources to keep people in proper living conditions.

""The new rule establishes a high national standard for care of children and families in custody,"" McAleenan said, noting that maintaining proper standards of care is a ""core"" element of the new rule.

Former VA pathologist charged in deaths of 3 veterans,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dr-robert-levy-former-va-pathologist-charged-in-deaths-of-3-veterans/,"Little Rock, Arkansas -- A pathologist fired from an Arkansas veterans hospital after officials said he had been impaired while on duty was charged Tuesday with involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients. Authorities say he misdiagnosed them and altered their records to try to conceal his mistakes.

A grand jury indictment unsealed Tuesday charged Dr. Robert Morris Levy in the patients' deaths and on multiple charges of fraud and making false statements for his alleged attempts to conceal his substance abuse and incorrect diagnoses.

""In doing so, he was allowed to stay employed with the Veterans Administration, thus earning a salary, benefits and possibly a bonus,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said at a news conference in Fayetteville, referring to the Department of Veterans Affairs by its former name.

Levy, 53, who worked at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville, was paid an annual salary of $225,000, according to the indictment. He was fired from the hospital in April 2018.

Dr. Robert Levy KFSM-TV

VA officials said in January that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating back to 2005. Levy has acknowledged that he once showed up to work at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks drunk in 2016, but he denied that he had worked while impaired. He entered an in-patient treatment program following that incident and returned to work in October 2016 after agreeing to remain sober and submitting to random drug testing.

Levy, who was being held at the Washington County jail, pleaded not guilty at a hearing Tuesday. Kees said that as of Tuesday morning, Levy had not obtained counsel to represent him in the case.

In the deaths, Levy is accused of falsifying entries in his patients' records after making incorrect and misleading diagnoses. In one case, a patient died of prostate cancer after Levy determined that his biopsy showed he didn't have cancer, prosecutors allege.

Prosecutors say a second patient died of squamous cell carcinoma after Levy misdiagnosed the patient with another form of carcinoma. In a third case, the indictment says, a patient with small cell carcinoma was treated for a type of cancer he didn't have following an incorrect diagnosis by Levy, and died.

In two cases, he's accused of falsifying patients' medical records to state that a second pathologist agreed with his diagnosis.

Prosecutors say Levy received bonuses in 2016 and 2017 that were based in part on him reporting that his clinical errors were less than 5%. But, according the indictment, almost 10% of the diagnoses he made had clinical errors.

""These charges send a clear signal that anyone entrusted with the care of veterans will be held accountable for placing them at risk by working while impaired or through other misconduct,"" VA Inspector General Michael Missal said.

Levy ingested 2-methyl-2-butanol, a chemical that would intoxicate him but that standard drug and alcohol screenings don't test for, according to the indictment. Levy is accused of lying to hospital officials when he told them he wasn't under the influence of any intoxicants. Levy is charged with multiple counts of mail and wire fraud for his purchase of the chemical.

CBS Fort Smith, Arkansas affiliate KFSM reports U.S. Attorney Kees told a news conference Levy ""had the medical expertise, the knowledge, the skill set and the equipment to know exactly how much of this substance to take. He had the equipment to measure it out precisely, and he had the knowledge to know how to ingest it so it wouldn't be fatal.""

The station notes that, ""Ingesting between 18 and 27 grams of the substance can induce signs of intoxication and cause unconsciousness only 30 minutes after taking the drug, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).""

""The effects can last into the following day and can be followed by deep, daylong sleeping and a two-week recovery,"" the NCBI says.

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines, Kees said."
What we need to know from the Horowitz report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/what-we-need-to-know-from-the-horowitz-report,"There will be much to learn in Inspector General Michael Horowitz's upcoming report on the Trump-Russia investigation, but most of it will likely boil down to just two questions. One, how much did the Obama Justice Department spy on the Trump campaign? And two, was it justified?

Many Democrats would immediately protest the word ""spying."" But the public already knows the FBI secured a warrant to wiretap low-level Trump adviser Carter Page a few months after Page left the campaign. The public also knows the FBI used informant Stefan Halper to gather information on other Trump campaign figures. And the public knows the FBI sent an undercover agent who went by the alias ""Azra Turk"" to London to tease information out of another low-level Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos.

Was that all? Were there more? Horowitz should give definitive answers.

And what did the spying involve? In such intelligence work, wiretaps are recorded; transcripts are made. The same can be true for person-to-person conversations between FBI informants and Trump campaign figures. In May, Trey Gowdy, the former Republican congressman who read deeply into Trump-Russia materials when he was in the House, strongly implied the FBI had transcripts of informant communications.

""If the bureau is going to send an informant in, the informant is going to be wired,"" Gowdy told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo. ""And if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there's going to be a transcript of that.""

""Where are the transcripts, if any exist,"" Gowdy continued, ""between the informants and the telephone calls to George Papadopoulos?""

The ""if any exist"" was Gowdy's way of casting his statements as a hypothetical, but there was no doubt he was speaking from the knowledge he gained as a congressional investigator.

And then the biggest questions: If there was evidence gained from the wiretapping and informing, what was it? Was it valuable? What did it tell the FBI about Russia and the Trump campaign? And did it prove that the Justice Department was right all along to spy on the campaign — that the spying was, in the words of Attorney General William Barr, ""adequately predicated""?

Here is why Republicans are skeptical. Special counsel Robert Mueller had access to the results of the FBI's spying, and Mueller could not establish that there was any conspiracy or coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. After a two-year investigation with full law enforcement powers, Mueller never alleged that any American took part in any such conspiracy or coordination.

So, Republicans know the end result of the investigation, but they don't know how it began. Yes, they know the official story of the start of what the FBI called Crossfire Hurricane — that it began with a foreign intelligence service (Australia) telling U.S. officials that Papadopoulos appeared to have foreknowledge of a Russian plan to release damaging information about Hillary Clinton. But they don't think it's the whole story.

That's where Horowitz comes in.

There's one big potential problem that people on Capitol Hill are talking about, and that is the issue of classified information. Everyone expects a significant amount of Horowitz's report to be classified. How much, no one is quite sure. But the fact is, the report was done to tell the American people what the nation's intelligence and law enforcement agencies did during the 2016 election. Issuing a report with page after page blacked out would not be a good way to do that. But no one will know the extent of the classification issue until Horowitz is ready to go public.

And even if it were entirely declassified, Horowitz will not tell the whole story of spying and the 2016 election. Horowitz is the inspector general of the Justice Department and does not have the authority to investigate outside the department. For example, he cannot probe the actions of the Central Intelligence Agency and its then-director John Brennan during the period in question.

That will be the role of another investigator, John Durham, the U.S. attorney appointed by Barr to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe. Durham is working with the support of top Republicans on Capitol Hill, like Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, who recently said, ""I really am very curious about the role that the CIA played here.""

But first, the Horowitz report. It will be an important step in answering the questions of how much spying took place and whether it was justified. It's long past time Americans learned what happened.

USDA cuts buyout packages for employees who won't relocate,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/usda-buyouts-kansas-city/index.html,"(CNN) The US Department of Agriculture is shrinking payments offered to employees who applied for buyouts rather than relocate to the greater Kansas City area, according to a document obtained by CNN.

The one-time payouts are being reduced from $25,000 to $10,000 because so many workers applied, according to the document.

The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents workers at the affected agencies, says employees of the two research-related agencies that are being moved out of the the Washington area are ""extremely upset.""

A USDA spokesperson told CNN that the department said the change was made in order to offer payments to all eligible employees, rather than offer only the higher amount on a first-come, first-served basis. Workers still have the option to refuse the reduced payment if they decide to relocate, the spokesperson added.

The change comes after a union-compiled survey released last month showed an overwhelming number of the reassigned employees will likely choose to leave rather than relocate -- losses that could drain institutional knowledge and talent at two units that fund agricultural research across the nation and produce crucial reports, including data on agricultural markets and estimates of US and international agricultural productivity.

Trump administration to allow longer detention of migrant families,https://www.cnn.com,"['Geneva Sands', 'Sam Fossum']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/21/politics/immigration-family-detention-flores/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration on Wednesday announced plans that could hold undocumented families detained together indefinitely, replacing the agreement that set a 20-day limit for holding children.

The rule unveiled by acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan is part of the administration's aggressive effort to revamp immigration laws as the number of families and unaccompanied minors crossing the US-Mexico border has increased.

Under what is known as the Flores settlement, the government is required to release a minor from a non-licensed facility as expeditiously as possible, which has been set at 20 days.

McAleenan said the rule is meant to reduce the number of families trying to enter the US.

Trump expected to nominate replacement for Jon Huntsman Jr. in Russia,https://www.ksl.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Ksl', 'Posted - Aug']",,,,https://www.ksl.com/article/46622286/trump-expected-to-nominate-replacement-for-jon-huntsman-jr-in-russia,"SALT LAKE CITY — President Donald Trump has apparently already lined up a replacement for Jon Huntsman Jr. as U.S. ambassador to Russia.

Trump is expected to name Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan to the Moscow post, according to The New York Times.

The president told reporters in Washington, D.C., that Sullivan “could very well be” his choice.

“He’s somebody that’s being put up and respected very much,” the president told reporters in Washington, D.C. “Well, I know that (Secretary of State) Mike Pompeo likes him very much, and he’s very respected.”

Huntsman announced his resignation earlier this month and is expected to return to Utah to consider another run for governor. His resignation is effective Oct. 3. October marks two years for Huntsman in Moscow.

Sullivan, 59, has served as deputy secretary of state since May 2017. He was acting secretary of state during April 2018 after Trump fired Rex Tillerson. He also served as deputy secretary of commerce in the George W. Bush administration.

A lawyer who has worked in other government departments, Sullivan would bring limited diplomatic experience in dealing with Moscow.

Russia has not been a major part of Sullivan’s government work, but last month he led a delegation of Trump administration officials who met with his Russian counterpart in Geneva to discuss arms control and other security issues, according to the Times. Last December, Sullivan toured Central and Eastern Europe, where he pressed officials on Russia’s “destabilizing” and “malign activities,” according to a State Department news release about the trip.

A former Veterans Affairs pathologist fired for being intoxicated on the job was charged with three counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection with ""incorrect and misleading diagnoses"" he made, federal prosecutors in Arkansas said Tuesday.

Robert Morris Levy was indicted by a federal grand jury and faces additional charges of fraud and making false statements. Prosecutors said he was in custody.

Levy not only lied about his alcohol use and manipulated mandatory alcohol and drug tests, but he also falsified patient records that ultimately caused the veterans' deaths, a federal investigation found.

""These charges send a clear signal that anyone entrusted with the care of veterans will be held accountable for placing them at risk by working while impaired or through other misconduct,"" VA inspector general Michael Missal said in statement.

For three patients, Levy entered ""incorrect and misleading diagnoses,"" and in two of those cases, he falsely stated that a second pathologist confirmed a diagnosis he had made, investigators said.

Levy worked as the chief of pathology at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks, a VA hospital in Fayetteville, Arkansas, from 2005 until he was fired in 2018.

Levy pleaded not guilty at a hearing Tuesday and had not obtained counsel to represent him, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said an administrative review began in 2015 after Levy was accused of being drunk on the job, which he denied. In 2016, a drug test found that Levy was at work with alcohol in his system, which he acknowledged.

Levy was removed from work and entered a rehab program. When the program ended, he agreed to abstain from alcohol and take random drug screenings in order to return to the VA hospital, prosecutors said.

However, investigators found that in June 2017, Levy began using 2-methyl-2-butanol (2M-2B), which ""enables a person to achieve a state of intoxication but is not detectable in routine drug and alcohol testing methodology,"" prosecutors said.

He used the chemical 12 times and hid it from the VA hospital, prosecutors said. He faces up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines.

Katharine Gorka, a controversial political appointee in the Department of Homeland Security, is leaving her position as U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s press secretary two months after accepting the job.

Gorka, who has a track record of criticizing Islam and embracing Muslim-focused conspiracy theories during her career, said Tuesday that her departure from CBP is a personal decision to spend more time with her family.

“I’m at my third-year mark in my service to the [Trump] administration. And I felt like the time has come to spend more time with my family,” said Gorka, who previously served as a senior adviser for the Department of Homeland Security. “I’ve been really honored to serve both the administration and at CBP.”

Gorka’s husband, Sebastian Gorka, served as an adviser to President Trump before his sudden departure in 2017, a week after senior adviser and former Breitbart executive Stephen K. Bannon was ousted from his position as Trump’s chief strategist.

Both Gorkas previously wrote for Bannon’s Breitbart and operated in far-right political circles, focusing much of their activism on what they viewed as the dangers of Islam, before joining the Trump administration.

During her time as CBP press secretary, Gorka rarely appeared in public or on television to speak on behalf of the agency. The liberal activist group Democracy Forward sued DHS earlier this year to find out “what Gorka is doing at DHS.”

Gorka declined to discuss the details of her departure. She said she felt the Trump administration had been supportive of her work.

“I think they’ve appreciated my service, and I think people who serve in politically appointed positions understand the challenges,” she said. “It’s a very demanding job.”"
Pompeo announces 'countdown' clock as Iran weapons embargo ends in 2020,https://www.cnn.com,"['Joshua Berlinger', 'Kylie Atwood', 'Jennifer Hansler']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/middleeast/iran-united-states-intl-hnk/index.html,"(CNN) United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned against ending an arms embargo on Iran, likening every day until the deal's October 2020 expiration as a ""#CountdownToTerror.""

The push to extend the ban on weapons sales to Tehran comes amid increasing efforts by Washington to restrict Iran's oil exports. Since the decision by US President Donald Trump in 2018 to abandon the Iran nuclear deal , Washington has attempted to use what it calls ""maximum pressure"" to change Iran's behavior and limit its nuclear ambitions.

""Time is drawing short to continue this activity of restricting Iran's capacity to foment its terror regime. The international community will have plenty of time to see how long it has until Iran is unshackled to create new turmoil, and figure out what it must do to prevent this from happening,"" Pompeo said Tuesday, during an address at the United Nations.

Also on Tuesday, the State Department released what Pompeo termed a ""#CountdownToTerror clock"" tracking the time until the arms embargo and a travel ban on Qasem Soleimani expire next year. Soleimani commands Iran's Quds force , which is responsible for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' overseas activities.

The arms embargo covers all weapons sales and ""related material"" to Iran. It was put in place by the UN and is set to be lifted five years after the adoption of the nuclear deal.

The @UN arms embargo on #Iran and the travel ban on Qasem Soleimani expire in October 2020. Our #CountdownToTerror clock is tracking how long until Iran is unleashed to create new global turmoil. We must not let his happen. https://t.co/4UtnMREgah

Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Pompeo warned the international community against helping ships that are believed to be carrying illicit crude oil from Iran in breach of US sanctions.

Pompeo's comments followed reports that an Iranian tanker called the Bonita Queen was headed to Syria to deliver crude oil.

""We've made clear anyone who touches it, anyone who supports it, anyone who allows a ship to dock, is at risk of receiving sanctions from the United States of America. So if that ship again heads to Syria, we'll take every action we can consistent with those sanctions to prevent them,"" Pompeo said.

A source at the company Tanker Tracker, which tracks top oil exports based on satellite technology, said that the Bonita Queen was sailing toward Syria carrying about 600,000 barrels of oil. The source said Syria illegally receives about 3 million barrels of crude oil a month shipped from abroad.

The Bonita Queen does not fly the Iranian flag, but it is managed by the same company as a tanker now called the Adrian Darya 1, formerly known as the Grace 1.

The Adrian Darya 1 was impounded last month by the UK in Gibraltar on suspicion that it was attempting to carry oil to Syria, in breach of European Union sanctions. The ship was released Sunday , shortly after the United States issued a warrant for its seizure Friday in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to stop the tanker.

Iran has maintained that it is not seeking a confrontation and the US actions are tantamount to bullying.

""Iran is not interested in confrontation. We were not the ones who walked away from a carefully negotiated agreement, an agreement that was not exactly what we wanted and certainly not exactly what the US wanted, or Europeans wanted or for that matter not exactly what China and Russia wanted,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tuesday, referring to the nuclear deal."
"Trump Has Right to End DACA, Justice Dept. Tells Supreme Court",https://www.nytimes.com,['Michael D. Shear'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/us/politics/daca-trump.html,"WASHINGTON — Justice Department lawyers told the Supreme Court on Monday that President Trump acted lawfully in September 2017 when he decided to end an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation.

In a legal brief submitted to the court, the lawyers asserted that the president was fully within his rights to eliminate the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and said the lower courts were mistaken when they said Mr. Trump’s action almost two years ago was arbitrary.

The Department of Homeland Security “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” the lawyers argued, disputing the conclusions by the lower court judges about the three reasons the administration gave for ending the program. “None of those three grounds is remotely arbitrary or capricious, let alone all three.”

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments about the fate of the program in November. The justices could decide the case next spring or summer, just as the presidential election campaign is in full swing."
Former US attorney expects 'blockbuster' FISA abuse report from DOJ inspector general,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-us-attorney-expects-blockbuster-fisa-abuse-report-from-doj-inspector-general,"Former U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis predicted the Justice Department inspector general's report on alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses will be ""hard-hitting,"" with multiple recommendations for prosecution.

During an interview Monday on Fox News, Lewis said he used to work with Inspector General Michael Horowitz at the Justice Department and called him as ""tough as a nail."" Lewis added, ""He’s tough, he is smart, and I think the report will be a blockbuster."" He expects Horowitz's findings to make special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election ""look like a sixth grade book report.""

Asked to explain why, Lewis said, ""It’s going to come out. It’s going to be hard-hitting. [Horowitz] spent almost two years interviewing various people — witnesses. Looking at what he describes [as] almost a million documents. And I think he’s going to make recommendations regarding prosecution and turn this whole FISA — this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act — the submissions, I think he will turn them on their head.""

British ex-spy Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications and have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

[Analysis: Who and what the Horowitz report is likely to cover]

Although some Trump allies have expressed high expectations for Horowitz's report and Attorney General William Barr's review of the origins of the Russia investigation, others are preaching caution. ""Republicans usually set the bar so high that when we don't meet it, the media narrative then becomes Republicans don't even own their promises. Just promise a fair investigation that goes wherever the facts take us,"" former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy said on Fox News last month.

Lewis, who served with Barr at the Justice Department under President George H.W. Bush, was reacting to an interview Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham did over the weekend in which he said he believes the IG report would be “ugly and damning” for the DOJ and its handling of the Russia investigation.

Graham said he wants ""as much as possible"" declassified from Horowitz's report as possible, but former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu warned former FBI Director Christopher Wray might fight to keep its contents classified because he has been ""co-opted by the FBI bureaucracy.""

Lewis said he does not agree with Sununu's assessment, calling Wray a ""good, honest broker,"" but advised the FBI chief to ""err on the side of transparency"" because he suspects the FISA Court may have been used by the FBI to target President Trump's 2016 campaign.

Asked where the investigation is headed, Lewis said former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Andrew McCabe ought to be ""worried"" about submissions that were made to the FISA Court. Both Strzok and McCabe filed separate lawsuits against the DOJ and FBI claiming they were subject to politically motivated firings last year.

He also said former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos and former national security adviser Michael Flynn should be be ""sort of happy"" because Horowitz's report might be used to help them overturn their convictions, stemming from Mueller's investigation, for lying to FBI investigators."

The U.S. State Department has approved a possible $8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Tuesday in an official notification to Congress.

The potential deal is for 66 aircraft, 75 General Electric engines, as well as other systems, the agency said in a statement, adding it served the interests of the United States and would help Taiwan maintain a credible defense.

China has already denounced the widely discussed sale, one of the biggest yet by the United States to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province. It has warned of unspecified ""countermeasures.""

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch, a Republican, has welcomed the proposed sale of the Lockheed Martin Corp F-16 jets.

""These fighters are critical to improving Taiwan's ability to defend its sovereign airspace, which is under increasing pressure from the People's Republic of China,"" he said in a recent statement.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Monday that President Donald Trump notified Congress of the sale last week.

Pompeo told Fox News the sale was ""consistent with past U.S. policy"" and that the United States was ""simply following through on the commitments we've made to all of the parties.""

In Taipei, President Tsai Ing-wen said the sale would help Taiwan build a new air force and boost its air defense capacity.

In a post on Facebook, Tsai said she was grateful for Washington's ""continuous support for Taiwan's national defense"".

""With strong self-defense capacity, Taiwan will certainly be more confident to ensure the cross-strait and regional peace and stability while facing security challenges,"" she said.

Taiwan unveiled its largest defense spending increase in more than a decade last week, amid rising military tensions with China."

The Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday filed a motion in federal court in Washington, D.C., for summary judgment, asking Judge Trevor McFadden to direct Treasury and the IRS to comply with the committee's requests and subpoenas for six years of the president's federal tax returns.

The committee also asked McFadden, a Trump appointee, to consider the case on an expedited basis, proposing a schedule under which briefs on relevant issues would be filed by Oct. 25 with oral arguments taking place ""as soon as practicable"" after that.

In its own court filing Tuesday, Treasury and the IRS asked that the committee's summary judgment motion be put on hold until after McFadden resolves the administration's own forthcoming motion to dismiss the House lawsuit.

The Ways and Means Committee filed the lawsuit in July, after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinTrump says he'll decide on foreign aid cuts within a week Democrats push judge for quick action on Trump tax returns lawsuit Five key players in Trump's trade battles MORE and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig rejected the requests and subpoenas for Trump's tax returns.

In arguing on Tuesday that the judge should direct the administration to provide the tax returns, the committee said that the ""defendants’ defiance is an extraordinary departure from established principles of law.""

The committee said that its subpoenas are valid, and that the section of the tax code under which it requested Trump's tax returns doesn't give Treasury and the IRS any discretion.

Treasury has said that it thinks the committee's requests and subpoenas for Trump's tax returns lack a ""legitimate legislative purpose,"" and that Democrats' real purpose for seeking the documents is to expose the tax information of a political rival.

But the committee argues its requests and subpoenas do have a legitimate legislative purpose, because the panel is conducting oversight and considering legislative proposals relating to how the IRS enforces tax laws against a president.

The committee revealed in its new court filings that on July 29, it received an unsolicited communication from a federal employee it claims made credible allegations of possibly inappropriate efforts to influence the IRS's mandatory audit program of presidents.

Mnuchin replied that the Treasury didn't have any records that were covered under the tax code section under which Neal made his request. Mnuchin also said that Neal should raise his concerns with the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.

The administration argued that it plans to file a motion to dismiss the case that will raise issues about ""whether political conflicts between the elected Branches fall within the sphere of authority that the Constitution assigns to the Federal courts."" It asked McFadden to stay the committee's motion until the judge rules on its motion to dismiss.

The administration argued that its motion and the committee's motion will require the court to consider different issues. The administration is proposing a schedule under which oral arguments on its motion to dismiss would be held the week of Oct. 16 or soon after that.

But the committee, which argued that it has standing to sue, thinks that the judge should consider the administration's expected motion to dismiss and the panel's summary judgment motion concurrently, arguing the motions are likely to raise overlapping issues.

The House panel argued that ""time is of the essence"" in resolving the case, since the current Congress will end in January 2021.

""The Committee must obtain a prompt resolution of the issues in this case if it is to have enough time to investigate the tax issues implicated by President Trump’s tax returns and return information and propose and pass any legislation that it may deem appropriate in response,"" the panel argued.

The administration, however, said that the committee's concern about the speed of the case ""rings hollow,"" since Neal didn't request Trump's tax returns until several months after he became chairman, and the lawsuit wasn't filed until weeks after Treasury and the IRS rejected Neal's subpoenas.

Trump and several of his business entities also are being heard in the case as defendant-intervenors. They argued on Tuesday that the committee's motion for summary judgment should be postponed until after they can request information about Democrats' true motives for requesting Trump's tax returns.

State AGs prepare antitrust investigation into tech firms,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-ags-prepare-antitrust-investigation-into-tech-firms,"The top law enforcement officers in several states are gearing up to launch an antitrust investigation of Silicon Valley’s biggest firms, according to multiple reports, adding to the scrutiny tech companies are already facing from federal regulators.

The investigation is expected to get off the ground as soon as next month and would follow a meeting representatives from states had with antitrust officials from the Justice Department last month.

A group of state attorneys general plan to soon issue civil investigative demands to the tech companies, and the investigation will examine whether Silicon Valley’s most powerful firms suppressed competition in the tech industry.

It’s unclear how many states are expected to participate and whether it will be a bipartisan group, but the Wall Street Journal reported as many as 20 attorneys general could join the effort.

After last month’s meeting at the Justice Department, the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said a group of eight state attorneys general met with Attorney General William Barr to discuss “the real concerns consumers across the country have with big tech companies stifling competition on the internet.”

Paxton’s office said the states are “considering a range of possible antitrust actions against such companies.”

An investigation into big tech companies spearheaded by the states would run alongside investigations launched by the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission into anticompetitive behavior by leading internet companies.

The Justice Department said last month it had opened a sweeping antitrust review into “market-leading online platforms,” which is likely to include Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The Federal Trade Commission launched a technology task force in February designed to monitor competition in the tech sector and investigate any possible anticompetitive conduct.

The commission also opened an antitrust investigation into Facebook, the social media company acknowledged in financial filings last month.

The inquiries from the federal government come alongside continued efforts in Congress to examine the practices of some of the country’s biggest technology companies.

To address the growing dominance of Silicon Valley firms and whether they have shut smaller competitors out of the marketplace, 2020 Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up the Facebook, Amazon, and Google, while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed antitrust action against big tech companies."
DOJ to Supreme Court: Trump decision to end DACA was lawful,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/latino/458102-doj-to-supreme-court-trump-decision-to-end-daca-was-lawful,"In a late-night filing ahead of a case scheduled for oral arguments in November, Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued the Trump administration had the legal authority to rescind DACA in 2017.

The case under review by the Supreme Court is about the legality of the president's order to end DACA, not the legality of the Obama-era program that allows hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as minors — to temporarily live and work in the United States without risk of deportation. ""At best, DACA is legally questionable; at worst, it is illegal,"" wrote Francisco.The case under review by the Supreme Court is about the legality of the president's order to end DACA, not the legality of the Obama-era program that allows hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as minors — to temporarily live and work in the United States without risk of deportation.

The court is likely to issue its decision in the case in June or July, just months ahead of the presidential election. The final ruling could have profound implications for the 2020 race and thrust immigration back into the spotlight as a central campaign issue.



Trump in 2017 prompted litigation with his order to strip the benefits granted to Dreamers by his predecessor.

That order was blocked by federal judges, and the 9th Circuit affirmed those decisions on the grounds that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enacted Trump's rescission of DACA based solely on ""a belief that DACA was unlawful."""
The 6 things you most need to know about Trump’s new climate plan,https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/19/20812243/trump-epa-climate-plan-ace-cpp-6-things,"In June, the Trump administration unveiled its proposed replacement for the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. Last week, a coalition of 29 states and cities filed a lawsuit to block the rule, claiming that it violates Trump’s obligations under the Clean Air Act.

And on Sunday, nonpartisan research firm Resources for the Future, along with researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Syracuse University, and the Boston University School of Public Health, released new research showing that even Environmental Protection Agency’s meager projected pollution reductions from its rule are likely overestimated.

The story of EPA carbon regulations is long and tangled, but if you’re in a hurry, here’s the short version: The president’s plan is the bare minimum the EPA thinks it can get away with. It won’t reduce emissions much; in fact, it is likely to increase both carbon dioxide and local air pollutants, along with their health impacts, in more than a dozen states. (Seriously.) And the EPA is going to have a hell of a time justifying it to a court.

Now let’s walk through the longer version of the story. Most coverage so far has focused on the plan’s striking weakness (for obvious reasons), but there are several other aspects of the fight over power plant emissions that are worth understanding. How these policy and legal questions get resolved will have enormous influence on what the next administration — if we ever make it to another administration — can do to address climate change.

So, with that in mind, here are the six things you need to know about Trump’s Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) plan.

1) Trump’s EPA is regulating carbon because it has to, not because it wants to

The Trump administration has repeatedly expressed skepticism toward climate change, hostility toward regulation, and an all-consuming hatred for anything with former President Barack Obama’s fingerprints on it. If it had its druthers, it wouldn’t regulate carbon emissions at all.

But it has to. In 2007’s Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that if the EPA finds that greenhouse gases are a threat to public health, it must regulate them as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. In 2009’s Endangerment Finding, the EPA found that, yes, greenhouse gases are a danger to public health.

Those twin developments created a set of legal obligations for the agency. It must:

regulate mobile sources of greenhouse gases, i.e., vehicles — that was Obama’s fuel economy standards, which Trump is busy gutting;

regulate new stationary sources of greenhouse gases, i.e., power plants and refineries — that was Obama’s 2013 limits on new sources, which Trump is busy gutting;

regulate existing stationary sources of greenhouse gases — that was the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which Trump is now gutting.

Some of the wackier denialists in the conservative coalition were pressing the EPA to challenge the endangerment finding (and former Administrator Scott Pruitt considered it). If successful, that would negate all these obligations. But, perhaps perceiving how futile and silly such an effort would be, the EPA elected not to.

So it was forced to replace, not just cancel, Obama’s fuel economy standards, replace, not just cancel, Obama’s regulations on new power plants, and replace, not just cancel, the Clean Power Plan. Thus, ACE.

2) The legal question at the heart of the dispute over CPP has never been decided by courts

The Clean Air Act (specifically, Section 111) calls upon the EPA to set air pollution standards by determining “the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction … adequately demonstrated.”

Just what constitutes the “best system of emission reduction” is at the heart of the dispute between CPP proponents (environmentalists and Democrats) and critics (polluting industries and Republicans).

After studying the issue for several years, Obama’s EPA realized a few things. First, power plants do not operate in isolation; they are parts of a large, interconnected grid, a single machine, and their operations are determined by its needs. And second, states are already busy reducing greenhouse gas emissions using a variety of policy tools connected to grid operations — fuel-switching from coal to natural gas, adding renewables, energy efficiency, etc.

The EPA concluded that the “best” (most efficient and economical) way to reduce power plant emissions is to support those efforts by requiring states to reduce the average carbon intensity of their overall power sectors. They could reduce the emissions of individual plants, or increase energy efficiency, or build more renewables, or replace coal plants with natural gas. In the argot, the plan allowed emission reductions “beyond the fenceline” of individual power plants.

By setting targets at the aggregate level, rather than at the level of individual power plants, the CPP gave states maximum flexibility (something conservatives ostensibly support in general). It left them more than one tool for compliance.

The alternative — requiring only emission reductions “within the fenceline,” at individual plants — was seen as untenable. The fact is, an individual fossil fuel power plant just doesn’t have the capacity to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions much (absent carbon capture and sequestration, which is still wildly expensive). It can operate more efficiently, getting more power per unit of fuel, but those are improvements at the margin. The only practical way to get substantial reductions from the power sector is to require aggregate reductions.

As soon as the CPP was proposed, a large coalition of 24 states, along with several companies and other groups, sued. (There were actually multiple suits that eventually got consolidated into one.)

The main legal critique was simple: By regulating beyond the fenceline, the EPA had exceeded its statutory authority. (For an in-depth look at the fenceline question, you can read this post.)

In January 2016, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals denied a motion to stay the CPP while it was under legal consideration. Just a few weeks later, in February, the Supreme Court overrode that decision with a 5-4 decision of its own, issuing a stay on the CPP until the litigation was settled.

Although both sides had already made their case in circuit court, the court agreed to the EPA’s request that it withhold judgment until EPA issues a replacement plan. Since, as was inevitable, that replacement plant has sparked a lawsuit, it will end up in court anyway.

Long story short: Despite what you’d think from listening to Trump administration rhetoric, no court has yet ruled on the fenceline question. And a court eventually must.

Obama’s EPA did its homework, and beyond-the-fenceline proponents are confident of their case, at least in circuit court. But the case is likely to go back to the Supreme Court, and, well, we all know how that’s going.

If courts end up rejecting the Trump EPA’s inside-the-fenceline interpretation, it would throw the agency into chaos. But it would give a Democratic successor administration free rein to issue a new, stronger CPP (which the Resources for the Future analysis says could reduce electricity sector emissions 37 percent above the baseline case by 2030).

If courts accept the narrow interpretation, it would be an enormous blow to Democratic efforts on climate change going forward, putting the Clean Air Act, at least Section 111, out of reach as a carbon reduction tool.

3) ACE is so weak, it could potentially lead to higher emissions

Trump’s EPA accepted the inside-the-fenceline restriction that Obama’s EPA found untenable, so ACE only applies to individual plants. Consequently, it won’t reduce carbon emissions much.

The CPP did not set mandatory carbon reduction targets, but the EPA calculated that if states opted for the most stringent pollution control plans, the CPP would yield electricity sector emission reductions of 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. (Since EPA’s 2015 analysis, progress on clean energy has been incredibly rapid. We now know that most of the emission reductions CPP targeted were going to happen anyway. Thus the need for an updated CPP.)

ACE, on the other hand, might not reduce emissions at all relative to baseline. It might even raise them. Yes, you read that right: Trump’s pollution rule might produce more pollution than no rule at all.

How is that possible? Well, remember, ACE applies only to individual power plants (coal plants, mostly), and the only way to improve the emissions performance of individual power plants is through efficiency upgrades. But efficiency upgrades — heat rate improvements (HRI), in the lingo — make those plants cheaper to run.

If they’re cheaper to run, utilities will run them more often. That will increase their net emissions. Resources for the Future refers to this as “rebound” and says the EPA underestimates it in several ways.

First, the agency plans changes to New Source Review — pollution standards that must be met by new or upgraded plants — to make it easier to upgrade coal plants without triggering new standards. (See No. 4, below.) That will have the effect of boosting HRI. In the initial draft release of ACE, those standards changes were included. But in the final rule, they were left out, enabling the EPA to lowball HRI.

But the agency still plans to make those changes to New Source Review; by failing to include them in its analysis of ACE, it is deliberately hiding the ball.

Second, in its analysis, the EPA excluded two of the best technologies for HRI (blade path upgrades and redesign/replace economizers — don’t ask). And third, the agency’s analysis excludes the Section 45Q tax credit passed by Congress, which would offer tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration.

Long story short, even the administration’s paltry project carbon emission reductions from ACE — between 0.7 and 1.5 percent lower than baseline — are likely overstated. In fact, coal plants are likely to run more than EPA estimates, will means CO2 will fall less (or not at all) and other local air pollutants will increase in many states, with all their concomitant health effects.

A final note: reductions of 0.7 to 1.5 percent are basically a rounding error and they hinge entirely on the market fate of coal plants. Resources for the Future ran an analysis of several different market scenarios and found that even small changes in market assumptions — demand, the price of natural gas, etc. — could wipe out those gains.

Basically, ACE isn’t a serious plan to reduce carbon emissions. It’s more of a statement by Trump’s EPA that it doesn’t have the power to reduce power sector carbon emissions.

4) Gutting New Source Review (which goes along with ACE) could also raise emissions

From an environmental perspective, the original sin of the Clean Air Act (at least the 1970 and 1990 amendments to the CAA) was grandfathering.

The presumption was that new power plants would be built with modern pollution controls and old plants would gradually phase out and close down. So existing plants were grandfathered in — they didn’t have to meet the new standards.

To ensure that existing plants didn’t increase their pollution in the meantime, the CAA standards applied not only to new plants but to existing plants that made substantial upgrades that would increase their pollution. More specifically, “any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted” would trigger the standards.

Any utility planning a new plant or a plant upgrade has to submit to the New Source Review to ensure they’re meeting pollution standards.

So if utilities built new plants, they had to meet modern pollution standards. If they upgraded old plants, they had to meet modern pollution standards. But if they just kept their polluting old plants running and running forever, without upgrades, they didn’t have to meet modern pollution standards. And so that’s what they did.

Consequently, the US has been saddled with a large, old fleet of dirty coal plants for decades, with utilities making just enough repairs to keep them in operation but not enough modifications and upgrades to trigger New Source Review. The average age of a US coal plant is 39 years — roughly its rated life span.

Environmentalists have complained about these plants for ages, saying that utilities should shut them down. Utilities have also complained, saying the prohibitive costs of NSR are preventing them from upgrading their fleets.

Obama’s CPP was supposed to finally get at those old plants. Given the way NSR has traditionally worked, ACE would have too. It would have forced plants to make efficiency improvements, which would have triggered NSR, which would have triggered tighter standards. (By EPA’s own estimate, 80 percent of coal-fired power plants do not meet current NSR standards for local air pollutants.)

Trump’s EPA doesn’t want utilities to face the terrifying prospect of being forced to clean up their old fleets (“enormous new permitting burdens”), so it plans to “reform” New Source Review. It will no longer be an increase in total emissions that triggers the review — only an increase in a plant’s hourly emissions rate. If a plant reduces its hourly emissions rate, increases its total runtime, and thus increases its total emissions, no problem.

New Source Review is one of the very few regulatory tools available to reach these existing, dirty plants, and EPA wants to take it off the table. Long-term, that could free lots of utilities to update their dirty old coal plants (to comply with ACE) and keep them running even longer.

5) Even after torturing the numbers, the EPA couldn’t make ACE look like a good deal

The awkward fact for Republicans has always been that air quality regulations work. They produce social, economic, and health benefits well in excess of their compliance costs. There is a robust literature and a long practical history showing as much. (See here for the EPA’s cost-benefit analyses on the CAA, which links to dozens of independent sources.)

At every new round of regulations, conservatives and polluting industries complain that they are too onerous, that they will destroy the economy, cost jobs, raise energy prices. And every time, it doesn’t happen. Compliance proves cheaper than expected, the economy continues growing, and public health improves.

Republicans have not responded to this reality by accepting that they were wrong about air quality regulations. Instead, they’ve responded by trying to game the numbers, massaging cost-benefit calculations to give more amenable outcomes.

That continues in the ACE proposal. As Brad Plumer reported in a great New York Times piece, the EPA no longer counts climate benefits that occur outside US borders, which is both morally and atmospherically daft.

But even more daft, rather than the Obama administration’s 3 percent discount rate, Trump’s EPA is using a discount rate of 7 percent.

Discount rates refer to how much future benefits are “discounted” when expressed in today’s dollars — or more colloquially, how highly we value future benefits. (A higher rate means we value them less; a lower rate, more. A rate of zero means we value them equally as much as present benefits.)

A 7 percent discount rate is at the high end of what markets and governments use for personal investments, i.e., how much individual investors value their future profits. But applied to intergenerational investments, i.e., how much sacrifice we’re collectively willing to impose on future generations, it is sociopathic.

“If you use a rate above 5 percent,” Maureen Cropper, an economist at the University of Maryland, told Plumer, “you’re essentially saying that we shouldn’t worry today about anything that happens 100 years from now.” (If you want to dig deeper, here is a post I once did on discount rates, using otters.)

Using these tricks and others, all of which make the rule more legally vulnerable, EPA cut its estimate of the “social cost of carbon” — the total societal value of a ton of GHG emission reductions — from around $50 (the Obama administration’s median number, arrived at after an extensive interagency process that Trump has tried to cancel) to between $1 and $7 (a value rectally extracted by Trump’s EPA over the course of months).

Naturally, that makes cutting greenhouse gases look a lot less attractive. But here’s the first twist.

Even if the climate benefits of the CPP are cut close to nothing, the other benefits, primarily in reductions of local air pollutants like SO2 and NOx, still more than pay for it. That’s true even though the EPA ignored many benefits it claimed to be unable to quantify.

EPA says they are ""unable to quantify the economic value of changes in exposure to mercury, carbon monoxide, SO2, and NO2, ecosystem effects or visibility impairment"" in regulatory impact analysis https://t.co/YDFACjisfg — ⚡Taylor Kuykendall (@taykuy) August 21, 2018

EPA just couldn’t make the numbers work for it.

And so, as Lisa Friedman first reported for the New York Times, according to the EPA’s analysis, “the new rules could also lead to as many as 1,400 premature deaths annually by 2030 from an increase in the extremely fine particulate matter that is linked to heart and lung disease, up to 15,000 new cases of upper respiratory problems, a rise in bronchitis, and tens of thousands of missed school days.” (And the Resources for the Future analysis shows that those numbers are almost certainly conservative.)

Yes, the EPA is proposing a policy that it concedes will lead to 1,400 premature deaths, 48,000 new cases of “exacerbated asthma,” and at least 21,000 new missed days of school every year, through 2030. That should be fun to justify to a court.

And as Nathanael Johnson noted in Grist, EPA’s analysis shows that ACE’s net costs outweigh its net benefits:

EPA’s press officers aren’t exactly highlighting the findings that the proposal would leave Americans worse off. In a fact sheet, for example, the EPA trumpets its finding that ACE could save power plants up to $6.4 billion in compliance costs. But wade into the details to look up that scenario (check out table 18 on page 165), and you see that the EPA weighs that $6.4 billion against health costs that run between $16.6 billion and $75 billion.

“When an agency wants to do something that’s harmful to the American people, it typically tries to hide it,” Richard Revesz of the Institute for Policy Integrity told Johnson. “What’s unusual here is that the EPA just comes out and says it.”

However — and here’s the second twist — Trump’s EPA is currently working to rectify the situation.

As Friedman smartly notes, the massive study upon which EPA bases much of its work on the health effects of particulates (the famous Harvard “Six Cities” study) would be excluded from EPA consideration if the administration’s daffy “secret science” proposal goes through.

As Vox’s Umair Irfan reported, the proposal would exclude from EPA analysis any study in which participants’ identities are concealed — which is most big public health studies, for obvious reasons. Experts are almost unanimously horrified by the proposal, including the EPA’s science advisers, but it appears to be moving forward.

So enjoy this particular EPA analysis (yet another triumph of career staff over their political hack bosses). The next time EPA runs cost-benefit analysis on an air rule, it won’t include many of the health benefits of pollution reductions, because it will have consciously prevented itself from knowing about them.

6) We may have already reached the CPP’s 2030 goal; it’s time for more ambition, not less

According to the Sustainable Energy In America Factbook, US power sector emissions are down 28 percent from 2005 levels. The researchers at Rhodium Group estimate that they will be down 37 percent by 2025.

That means the CPP reach target for 2030 — 32 percent reduction — will likely be achieved in the next few years, just based on current market trends.

This extraordinary progress has been hard-won, utility by utility, and the CPP — even though it never went into effect! — was a big part of that. The tangible prospect of federal regulations got every state and utility, even those with no interest in climate change, thinking, talking, and planning around carbon reductions. And guess what? When utilities start looking around in earnest, they find that cutting carbon is pretty easy.

Reducing electricity sector emissions has proven much cheaper and easier than envisioned even by the optimists at Obama’s EPA. The sensible thing to do in this situation is to boost the plan’s ambition.

In comparing the ACE to the CPP, remember that the emissions baseline has changed a lot since 2014 thanks to cheap renewables and natural gas. @EPA could have responded to this by raising the ambition bar. Instead, they lowered it. pic.twitter.com/REdDtPiy9x — Trevor Houser (@TrevorGHouser) August 21, 2018

It is difficult to know just how much the weakening of CPP into ACE will blunt that progress — how much progress still depends on policy and how much it has taken on a market momentum of its own. (One thing upon which virtually every expert agrees: US coal is going to continue dying.)

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University took a look at prospects for the electricity sector hitting Paris climate targets without the CPP. They found that it basically depends on natural gas prices. If they stay low or fall further, there’s a chance of hitting 2025 and 2030 Paris targets. Even if they rise a bit, Paris targets are still within reach, though “it becomes essential for many of the existing regulatory and tax inducements to be retained, and perhaps enhanced.” (In particular, they mention renewing federal renewable energy tax credits, which are set to expire.)

But there is broad consensus in the energy community that even if the electricity sector can limp past the 2030 finish line without (much) supportive federal policy, there’s no way the US will get on track for its longer-term carbon targets (80 percent reductions by 2050) without concerted policy support.

Depending on how courts rule on the fenceline issue, it’s possible that a Democratic administration that takes power in January 2021 could almost immediately issue a strengthened CPP, targeting, say, 80 percent electricity sector reductions by 2030, which will definitely wipe out all the coal and rein in natural gas.

Alternatively, if a Supreme Court decision with Brett Kavanaugh restricts the EPA to inside the fenceline, the prospect of substantially reducing carbon emissions using EPA regulations will basically be off the table, leaving federal legislation — or action at the state and local level — the only road forward on climate change.

Even more alternatively, if Trump wins reelection, the EPA by 2024 is likely to be a thoroughly degraded agency, its rules and staff stacked in favor of industry and most of its institutional memory and expertise lost. And the US will be out of the global climate effort entirely, a rogue actor lurching in the direction of myopic greed during the years the world most needs solidarity."

The Justice Department is ignoring centuries of investigations into presidents in an attempt to dramatically curtail Congress’ power to probe President Donald Trump, House Democrats argued Tuesday.

In a court filing, House lawyers said the Justice Department’s call to invalidate a subpoena for Trump’s financial records was so sweeping it would essentially inoculate presidents from congressional inquiry — reversing precedents that began with George Washington, who submitted to congressional inquiry.

Story Continued Below

“These arguments are fabricated out of whole cloth: they may represent what the department wishes the law were, but they are not the law,” House lawyers wrote, accusing the Justice Department of trying to rewrite Congress’ authority to investigate a sitting president.

Trump sued the House Oversight and Reform Committee earlier this year in his personal capacity after Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) issued a subpoena to accounting firm Mazars USA, seeking several years of the president’s financial records. The subpoena came after the president’s former personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen accused Trump of artificially inflating and deflating the values of his assets in order to win approval for loans — including one in a bid to buy the Buffalo Bills — or reduce his overall tax burden.

District Judge Amit Mehta, an appointee of President Barack Obama, upheld the committee’s subpoena in May, but Trump’s attorneys appealed the decision. The case is being heard at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Trump’s personal lawyers contend the committee overstepped its authority by subpoenaing the president’s personal records, arguing the committee failed to identify a legitimate “legislative purpose” to support its demands. Last week, the Justice Department echoed those arguments, suggesting courts should look dubiously at any efforts by Congress to “regulate the president.”

Trump’s personal legal team endorsed the Justice Department’s argument in a separate filing Tuesday, urging the court to give great weight to DOJ’s claims.

“The lack of any historical support for a legislative subpoena from a standing committee of Congress for the president’s records — directed to a third-party custodian no less — raises constitutional red flags,” Trump’s lawyers wrote, calling the committee’s demands “blunderbuss” and unreasonably broad.

In response, House general counsel Douglas Letter and his deputies rejected that as “an astounding and novel theory of limited congressional power to conduct investigations and oversight.”

Letter invoked the St. Clair investigation of 1792, when Washington acknowledged that a House inquiry for presidential papers could be valid “as the public good would permit.” He went on to cite an 1861 investigation of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, the Pearl Harbor investigation of 1945, Congress’ access to Richard Nixon’s tax returns, the Iran-Contra investigation of 1987 and the Whitewater investigation that began in 1995 as examples of presidents being targeted by — and at times responsive to — congressional inquiries.

“Presidents from George Washington on (unlike Mr. Trump) have understood that Congress has the power to conduct investigations and oversight of the president as part of the constitutional design,” the attorneys added.

Letter also noted that the argument from Trump’s personal attorneys and the Justice Department suggest Congress must already know the legislation it wants to pass before it has gathered any facts in its investigation.

“The department’s test is at odds with the Supreme Court’s express recognition that legislatures need facts to legislate wisely—facts that are frequently obtained through investigations,” House lawyers wrote.

They argued, as they have in previous court filings, that Congress has broad investigative authority as a co-equal branch of government.

“The Oversight Committee’s subpoena is an exercise of the House’s Article I power and not an attempt to usurp Executive power,” the House attorneys wrote.

Byron Allen Rips Comcast & Donald Trump’s DOJ For “Institutionalized Racism” As SCOTUS Showdown Looms,https://deadline.com,"['Dominic Patten Mike Fleming Jr', 'Dominic Patten', 'Mike Fleming Jr']",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://deadline.com/2019/08/byron-allen-comcast-civil-rights-lawsuit-supreme-court-filing-reaction-doj-donald-trump-1202671369/,"With the nation's highest court aiming to look at the ongoing lawsuit between the NBCU owner & Entertainment Studios, the DOJ has now waded in

EXCLUSIVE: Heading towards a $20 billion showdown with Comcast at the U.S. Supreme Court this fall in his long running racial discrimination lawsuit against the media giant, Byron Allen today tore into the Brian Roberts-run behemoth and an 11th hour intervention by the Department of Justice

“This is historic,” the Entertainment Studios boss said of the August 15 brief filed by the feds seeking to tighten the definitions of a Reconstruction Era statute in Comcast’s favor. “Donald Trump’s DOJ and Comcast are working together to destroy a civil rights statute in the U.S. Supreme Court.”

“You have one of the biggest media companies in the world, which has been beating up Donald Trump for racism, and now they are saying, we will work together to maintain institutionalized racism in America, in this Amicus Brief they delivered last Thursday,” Allen asserted in the starkest of terms of the now William Barr-run DOJ and its move to tip the scales for Comcast as the parties await a November 13 hearing before the nine Justices.

The newly declared emphasis by the DOJ now puts a more than 150-year law in a distinctly different light from how Allen’s lawyers have been reading it, as the Department’s filing openly says.

“Although the statute does not expressly describe the necessary causal link between a plaintiff ’s race and a defendant’s refusal to contract, the text is most naturally read to require but-for causation, and background common-law principles confirm that a but-for rule applies,” the incensory submission last week from Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Assistant AG Joseph Hunt argues (read it here).

“The court of appeals erred in concluding otherwise,” the DOJ brass state of lower court ruling in February in the huge money suit that Allen first filed in early 2015, along with a $10 billion suit against Charter Communications several months later. Comcast and Charter sought to have the matter dismissed. When they failed in that effort to end a case that they framed as a form of corporate expression, the MSNBC-owner took the battle to Chief Justice John Roberts and the Associate Justices.

The government detailed its POV by saying last week that “because ‘making’ a contract means entering a contract, a person does not enjoy ‘the same right’ guaranteed by Section 1981 if race prevents her from entering a contract that a similarly situated white person would have entered. And the inverse is also true.”

The feds’ brief leaning into the law to require that Entertainment Studios has to prove that race was not merely a motivating factor, as 9th Circuit interpreted the statute earlier this summer. Now, under the DOJ’s take of the stature, Allen’s lawyers could be required to prove that race was absolutely only reason that Comcast didn’t place the company’s channels on its distribution services and platforms.

For Allen, the result is a near impossible standard for Entertainment Studios or any other person or entity availing themselves of the statute as it presently stands.

“They said, we need to go to the Supreme Court and change the definition of the statute so African Americans cannot use it and we can compromise everyone’s civil rights,” Allen told Deadline of the sudden paperwork by the DOJ, offering the Comcast and their well-funded lobbyists in D.C. an advantage at the Supreme Court.

“Comcast, in the name of profits, is compromising everyone’s civil rights,” the CEO and Joe Biden-donor proclaimed. “If you think you have a good case, take me to court. Deal with me. Don’t jeopardize everybody’s civil rights.”

Contacted by Deadline, Comcast had no comment on the DOJ brief or Allen’s remarks about the filing. Entertainment Studios themselves have until next month to respond to the feds’ filing and Comcast’s own docket entry citing the Appeal Court reading of the post-Civil War statute as too broad.

Following a surprising reversal of fortune this winter where the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal essentially brought the case back to life, SCOTUS agreed in June that they would review the matter after a request by Philadelphia-based and very well politically connected Comcast.

With the initial filing of his cases in 2015 and 2016, Allen’s contention has been that both Comcast and Charter violated the Civil Rights Act after he attempted for years to get the cable giants to carry his networks, which were available to millions of television viewers through rival distributors including Verizon, the now AT&T-owned DirecTV and DISH. The African-American executive said he has been repeatedly rebuffed and jerked around and states clearly that he believes race played a factor because Entertainment Studios is a fully minority owned entity.

Both Comcast and Charter in their respective suits have said race was not a factor in the carriage deals or lack there of.

Allen and Entertainment Studios are represented in the case by a team from Miller Bardondess LLP and University of California Berkley School of Law’s Erwin Chemerinsky. Attorneys from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP are working for Comcast in the matter."
EPA sued for allowing use of pesticide harmful to bees,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458094-epa-sued-for-allowing-use-of-pesticide-harmful-to-bees,"An environmental group is suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its decision to expand use of a pesticide the agency considers toxic to bees.

In July the EPA said it would allow sulfoxaflor to be used in ways barred during the Obama administration as well as on new crops where the pesticide had not been used before.

“Even for Trump’s EPA, which seems to measure success by pesticide-company profits, it’s stupefying to OK spraying a bee-killing poison across millions of acres of crops frequented by bees,” Lori Ann Burd, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s environmental health program, said in a statement. “While leading scientists and countries across the globe are calling for eliminating harmful bee-killing pesticides like sulfoxaflor, Team Trump is cheerfully promoting its use like a corporate PR firm. It’s nauseating.”

Burd said the pesticide will harm not just bees and butterflies but also plants that rely on them for pollination.

The EPA would not comment on the lawsuit but said the pesticide ""provides benefits to growers and is supported by strong science that shows minimal risks for pollinators.""

In previous documents, the EPA described sulfoxaflor as “very highly toxic” to bees, and a study published in Nature last year found sulfoxaflor inhibited bumblebee reproduction.

In a July call with reporters to announce the decision, a top EPA official emphasized the agency’s research on the pesticide's effects on bees and said the rule was designed with pollinators in mind.

“To reduce exposure to bees, the product label will have crop-specific restrictions and important pollinator protection language,” including limits on how close to bloom sulfoxaflor can be sprayed, the official said.

But it may be difficult to monitor whether the regulations spare bees as intended. Just before EPA’s decision on sulfoxaflor, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it was suspending one of the few remaining government data sets that monitor bee populations and loss.

The center’s suit, filed in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, argues the EPA failed to compile “substantial evidence” as required under law before approving sweeping new uses of sulfoxaflor. They say the EPA also failed to consult with other agencies to ensure the new regulation wouldn’t harm endangered species.

The suit is not the first on the pesticide.

It was temporarily barred after a lawsuit from beekeepers in 2015, pushing the EPA in 2016 to change its instructions for how to use the pesticide in a way designed to reduce the harm to bees.

EPA said it was spurred to reconsider uses of sulfoxaflor following numerous emergency requests from states — many of which the agency granted — to allow the use of the pesticide on certain crops. It contends sulfoxaflor is safer than the alternatives.

The regulation allows farmers to once again use sulfoxaflor on citrus, cotton and types of squash, and the pesticide can now be used on alfalfa, corn, cocoa, grains and pineapple, among others, for the first time.

In some cases, farmers will not be able to spray sulfoxaflor within three days of bloom, but bee activists say the pesticide can remain in the soil and harm bees.

Bees are key in the production of almost a third of U.S. crops, spurring a commercial bee industry that brings colonies from field to field to pollinate farmers’ fields.

The EPA said the economic plight of farmers was a factor in its decision. The agency said growers could see net revenue losses of up to 50 percent if they aren't able to use the pesticide.

But Burd said pesticides like sulfoxaflor are dangerous to bees because they attack the nervous system, causing bees to get confused and diminishing their appetite.

“They don’t respond as well to predators ... cognitive loss is causing them to die as they get lost in the field,” she told The Hill previously.

Story Highlights The Justice Department demanded that Alabama fix its prison problems or face possible litigation.

Mississippi's prisons may be as bad or worse. A DOJ investigation has been requested.

One group calls conditions in Mississippi comparable to those in third-world countries.

Starting pay for guards in Mississippi is so low, those with families are eligible for food stamps.

Mississippi has saved a lot of money on its prisons over the past several years. But as the experiences of next-door neighbor Alabama show, rampant violence and understaffing can eventually draw scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department, with potentially costly consequences.

In April, the Justice Department concluded that “there is reasonable cause to believe that the men’s prisons [in Alabama] fail to protect prisoners from prisoner-on-prisoner violence and prisoner-on-prisoner sexual abuse, and fail to provide prisoners with safe conditions.” It demanded that the state fix the problems or face possible litigation.

Alabama’s prisons are so bad, they violate the U.S. Constitution’s guarantees against cruel and unusual punishment, the Justice Department has said.

Mississippi’s prisons may be as bad, or even worse, the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica reported. The ratio of prisoners to guards at South Mississippi Correctional Institution is 23 to 1, several times higher than Alabama’s, which stands at 9.9 to 1.

DOJ should investigate Mississippi's prisons, group says

FAMM, a national nonprofit group advocating criminal justice reform, has called on the Justice Department to investigate Mississippi’s prisons.

Kevin Ring, president of the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, said the conditions remind him of prisons found in third-world nations. “They’re uninhabitable,” he said. “This is why we need the government to step in.

An ongoing hell:Inside Alabama's prisons

“When there is no oversight and accountability, this is what you get.”

Rivers Ormon, press secretary for Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, said public safety remains a prime concern for the governor. She noted that the inmate population in state prisons fell by 11% in the year after the state passed prison reform in 2014.

“Certain challenges have made managing the system more difficult,” Ormon said in a statement, adding that Bryant has confidence in his team at the Department of Corrections.

(Ormon’s statement failed to note that the prison population is increasing again and is poised to top the 2014 figure in 2020.)

Mississippi prison guards: Shortage, lowest paid in nation

Prison guards in Mississippi are the lowest paid in the nation. Corrections Commissioner Pelicia Hall asked state lawmakers to give guards a significant pay raise, but that was rejected in favor of a more modest increase. The starting pay for guards is so low, those with families are eligible for food stamps.

Hall said she’s doing the best she can with the resources she has.

Alabama's recent history offers lessons in what may happen if conditions in Mississippi don’t improve.

The Justice Department’s investigation of Alabama was triggered by allegations that officers were having sex with inmates. Investigators visited four Alabama prisons and talked to 55 employees and 270 prisoners.

“Alabama is deliberately indifferent to that harm or serious risk of harm and it has failed to correct known systemic deficiencies that contribute to the violence,” Justice Department investigators said in their report. “The deplorable conditions within Alabama’s prisons lead to heightened tensions among prisoners. And, as a result, the violence is spilling over so that it is affecting not only prisoners, but [Alabama Department of Corrections] staff as well.”

'Sooner or later, the bill will come due'

Separately, Alabama is being sued over its treatment of mentally ill inmates. A federal judge has ordered the state to add as many as 2,000 new officers in the next several years.

Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, has called for Alabama to build new facilities to replace its “deplorable,” “horrendous” and “inadequate” prisons. The latest cost for replacing three men’s prisons? $900 million.

Ross Parker Simons, a lawyer from Pascagoula, Mississippi, who represents prisoners in the state, said if the Justice Department conducted an investigation here similar to the one it did in Alabama, he expects the department would give the same notice to Mississippi’s governor.

David Fathi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project, said Mississippi will have to confront its problems soon. “A state can’t continue to operate unconstitutional prisons. Sooner or later, the bill will come due.”

Trump agrees not to slash foreign aid,https://www.post-gazette.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2019/08/20/Trump-foreign-assistance-pompeo-mnuchin-budget-white-house-aid/stories/201908210104,
Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Permit Employment Discrimination Against Transgender Workers,https://time.com,['Tara Law'],,,,https://time.com/5654844/title-vii-trump-transgender-department-of-justice-supreme-court/,"The Trump administration’s Department of Justice is asking the Supreme Court to set a legal precedent that would enable employers to fire employees because they are transgender.

The Department of Justice has submitted a brief to the Court Friday asking the Justices to rule that Title VII, a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, religion or national origin, does not protect transgender people. The department argued that they should throw out a lower court ruling that found that a funeral home that fired a transgender woman had discriminated against her.

The brief concerns R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, one of three cases that the Supreme Court agreed to hear earlier this year that concern whether Title VII can be applied to LGBTQ workers.

In the case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit found that the owner of the funeral home, Thomas Rost, had violated the law when he fired Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman who worked for the company from 2007 to 2013. According to court documents, Stephens sent the company a letter in 2013 that said she struggled with a “gender identity disorder” and planned to begin to live as a woman, including by wearing the company’s female uniform – a jacket and skirt – instead of a suit and tie.

The company argued that Stephens was fired because she refused to wear the company’s dress code and argued that “[m]aintaining a professional dress code that is not distracting to grieving families is an essential industry requirement that furthers their healing process.”

In its brief, the Department of Justice has argued in favor of the funeral home, arguing that Title VII only protects what it defines as “biological sex.”

“In 1964 [when Title VII was enacted], the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex. It did not encompass transgender status,” the DOJ writes, clarifying, “In the particular context of Title VII—legislation originally designed to eliminate employment discrimination against racial and other minorities—it was especially clear that the prohibition on discrimination because of “sex” referred to unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace.”

Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Stephens, told HuffPo that the case could weaken Title VII protections both for transgender people and other groups.

“People don’t realize that the stakes are extending not just the trans and LGB communities, but every person who departs from sex stereotypes: Women who want to wear pants in the workplace, men who want more childbearing responsibilities,” Strangio said.

American Airlines to pay $22.1 million U.S. fine over mail delivery times: Justice Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Shepardson', 'Min Read']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-american-airline-fraud/american-airlines-to-pay-22-1-million-u-s-fine-over-mail-delivery-times-justice-department-idUSKCN1VA2AH,"FILE PHOTO: An American Airlines plane takes off from Los Angeles International airport (LAX) in Los Angeles, California, U.S. March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc, the largest U.S. airline, will pay $22.1 million to settle claims it falsely reported the times it transferred possession of U.S. mail to foreign postal administrations or other intended recipients, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.

The United States Postal Service contracted with American to take possession of receptacles of U.S. mail at six locations and then deliver it to numerous international and domestic destinations. The settlement resolves claims American Airlines falsely reported the times it transferred possession of the mail. American did not immediately comment Tuesday.

“We expect companies doing business with the government to comply with their contractual obligations,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt, who heads the department’s civil division. “The Department of Justice vigorously pursues all manner of fraudulent conduct that undermines the benefits that the government has bargained for.”

American said in a statement it was pleased it had reached a settlement.

“The allegations focused on conduct that was remedied years ago, and we have invested in new equipment and procedures to ensure that we are in full compliance with our commitments,” the statement said. It added that “the U.S. Postal Service is an important customer for American, and we are glad to have corrected these procedures and put this matter behind us.”

American said in a securities filing the Justice Department in April 2015 notified the airline it was investigating American’s 2009 and 2011 contracts with the U.S. Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air.

The contract required American to take possession of mail at U.S. locations or at various Department of Defense and State Department locations abroad, and then deliver that mail to numerous international and domestic destinations.

“To obtain payment under the contracts, American Airlines was required to submit electronic scans of the mail receptacles to USPS reporting the time the mail was delivered at the specified destinations. The contracts specified penalties for mail that was delivered late or to the wrong location,” the Justice Department said.

“The U.S. Postal Service contracts with commercial airlines for the safeguarding and timely delivery of U.S. Mail to foreign posts, including the mail sent to our soldiers deployed to foreign operating bases,” said Scott Pierce, special agent in Charge, USPS Office of Inspector General."
Meet the man ready to battle Congress in support of Trump’s immigration strategy,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1667511/meet-tom-homan-trumps-immigration-hawk-up-for-top-role-at-dhs/,"Tom Homan officially retired after 34 years of government service last June, but it’s pretty hard to tell. He has been an upstate New York beat cop, a Border Patrol officer and, these days, he’s the acting head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Homan, 57, is also now one of the most vocal defenders of US president Donald Trump’s controversial immigration policies as a Fox News talking head and fiery op-ed contributor. His unyielding support was on full display at a bruising Congressional hearing in July, when Democrats attacked the administration’s continuing policy of family separation.

“I am thankful that we have a president that not only talks the talk about securing our border, but he walks the walk,” Homan said at the hearing. “No president has done more to try to secure our border, especially in a time of crisis, than president Trump.” He cited Trump’s executive orders, emergency declaration, and an agreement with Mexico that many immigration experts said was underwhelming.

In return, Homan is perpetually floated as a top candidate for any big Department of Homeland Security (DHS) job that comes up, including most recently the big one: Secretary. Trump even named Homan his “immigration czar” during a rambling Fox & Friends phone interview in June. He neglected to tell Homan, who has not formally been offered the job.

The Trump White House has not served as a smart career move for people of Homan’s age and experience. Well-established experts often leave with a worse reputation than when they arrived. There was Gary Cohn, the former economic advisor, whose reason for leaving earned him his own scathing Onion article. Rex Tillerson’s many years in the oil industry may forever be overshadowed by his firing as secretary of state while on the toilet.

Nonetheless, Homan is eager to serve, he told Quartz in a recent interview. He said he expects the president to nominate someone soon to be the permanent secretary of DHS. He’s not sure if it will be him, but whoever it is, he said, “has to be ready for a fight” with Congress.

Homan says democrats want “open borders” and to make “illegal immigration legal.” So whoever Trump nominates will need to withstand the likely political backlash.

“If your feelings are easily hurt, it’s not a job for you,” he said. He noted the time that the former secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, was booed in a Mexican restaurant in Washington after the administration launched its family separation policy.

As far as potential nominees go, Homan makes sense for Trump. He epitomizes the all-or-nothing approach of the president’s anti-immigration effort.

The White House’s current demands, as Homan stated in his Congressional testimony, include rewriting some of the current foundations of US immigration policy. The president wants Congress to eliminate the “Flores Settlement,” for instance, which limits the amount of time the government can detain families and provides immigrant children human rights protections. He also wants to alter the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPRA), which forces US officials to carefully screen children from Central America before deporting them, and tighten the standards by which asylum-seekers can claim they face a “credible fear” at home.

Back in 2016, when Trump was running for president, Homan was reluctant to share his thoughts on the candidate’s immigration policies. “I can’t say what I think,” he said at the time. Now, however, he is open about his support. “I don’t agree with everything he’s ever said, but he’s the first president who has ever tried to secure this border,” Homan told Quartz.

Homan says he fully supports the president’s efforts to make asylum laws more strict, for example. About 90% of asylum seekers pass the initial “credible fear” test that allows them to remain in the US and go through the process of applying for protections. The percentage of those who are actually granted asylum, however, has plummeted under the Trump administration. The process can take years, and the Trump administration wants to hold people in detention until they appear in court, resulting in overcrowded and unsanitary detention centers.

Immigration activists say there’s no reason to detain asylum-seekers in this way, and that offering immigrants a more humane option than detention, like assigning a case worker who shepherds them through the system, is a cheaper and more effective option.

“I understand the [credible fear] threshold is low on purpose because we don’t want to send people back to persecution and death. I get that,” Homan said. But it is “ridiculously low.”

On the controversial topic of “removals”—deporting people who have lived in the US for years and may not have committed any crime—Homan similarly has a cut-and-dry take.

“Everyone is having a fit right now,” he said, referring to public reaction to ICE raids. But, he explained, ICE sent out notices to thousands of people informing them they had been ordered to leave the country. He said these people were told to “turn themselves in” so immigration agencies could work with them to get them home. “They refused to show up,” Homan said. “So ICE has to go out and find them.”

“If they don’t do that there is no integrity in the entire system. We might as well take everyone off the border and get rid of all the judges, because there are no consequences.”

Supporting policies that aren’t working

Homan’s apparent allegiance to the Trump administration’s current immigration policy is a problem for the simple reason that the policies are so far not effective, experts say.

The nature of US immigration changed long before Trump became president. In the last two decades, the number of single men coming from Mexico for economic opportunity plummeted. In the same period, more and more families began traveling from Central America to find protection from violence back home.

It was only when Trump entered office, however, that the crisis reached its current level of urgency.

“The administration has repeatedly stated that the Congress is to blame for this situation at the border. But the legal framework in place today is the same that was in place, three, five, and 10 years ago,” said John Cohen, a veteran law enforcement officer and former acting under-secretary at DHS.

The problems at the border are “a direct result of the approach and programs put in place by this administration as it relates to border security,” he added.

Those policies and programs range from diverting funds to build a wall to reducing aid to Central America. The Trump administration also began a “metering” program, which limits the number of people who can apply for asylum. It has forced some asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico during their application process, and is putting more border-crossers in detention facilities. Overworked courts means those migrants could be in detention for months or even years.

“Everything they have done to restrict immigration has been misguided,” Cohen said. Instead of targeting Congress, Trump should be frustrated with the people at the White House who have “sold him an approach to border security and immigration that simply won’t work,” he added.

So Cohen doesn’t see how appointing Homan as secretary would have any positive result.

“My concern is that Homan is a one-trick pony,” Cohen said. “His career has been in a very narrow area of law enforcement…He believes the number one focus of the department and state and federal law enforcement should be immigration enforcement, and that is not a view shared by the overwhelming number of people in law enforcement.”

The DHS has a number of other responsibilities beyond immigration, including emergency response, aviation security and cybersecurity.

Cohen and other former officials argue that DHS needs someone who can simply right the ship, filling the numerous vacancies left by an administration that has removed anyone not on board with its vision. This will become especially important as the department soon faces the potential emergencies of another hurricane season, and tries to balance Trump’s demands to clamp down on legal immigration with the reality of US law, it’s own budget, and its many other responsibilities to the country.

Fighting for Trump

Trump has said he likes a fighter, however. And Homan showcased that kind of pugnaciousness at the House Oversight Committee hearing in July. House Democrats grilled him about the hundreds of kids separated from their parents at the border and the “subhuman” treatment that they faced.

“Do you have no shame about the fact that it’s all done in the shadow of the American flag?” asked a distraught Gerry Connolly, the Virginia Democrat.

Rep. Gerry Connolly to Tom Homan: “You’re not at the border right now! You’re in a hearing room! It’s my time!” https://t.co/PMMPrjVR8C pic.twitter.com/xVGo0FhQTs — The Hill (@thehill) July 13, 2019

Homan became furious after Jesus Garcia, the Illinois Democrat, accused him of ignoring the mistreatment of immigrant children because they were a different race:

In tense exchange, Rep. Jesús García spars with acting ICE Dir. Thomas Homan over child separation: “Is it because these children don’t look like children that are around you?” “Your comments are disgusting!” Homan responds. “This is out of control.” https://t.co/iDdAVvNOKm pic.twitter.com/TJh4StH1UL — ABC News (@ABC) July 12, 2019

Later, Homan told Fox he was so upset, he considered assaulting Garcia. So it seems he might be exactly what Trump is looking for in a new DHS head."
USDA recalls chicken products due to possible Listeria contamination,http://www.fox5atlanta.com,"['Fox News', 'Claire Simms', 'Cal Callaway', 'Aungelique Proctor']",,,,http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/usda-recalls-chicken-products-due-to-possible-listeria-contamination,"- The U.S. Department of Agriculture said around 135,810 pounds of fully cooked poultry products from Tip Top Poultry is being recalled due to Listeria monocytogenes contamination concerns.

Tip Top Poultry is based in Rockmart, Georgia.

The possibly contaminated frozen, diced, and mechanically separated ready to eat chicken were produced on January 21, 2019.

Poultry products effected by the recall have ""P-17453"" inside the USDA mark of inspection or on the case. These items were shipped to hotels, restaurants, and institutions nationwide.

According to the USDA, consumption of food contaminated with L. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns.

Dept. of Energy recommends keeping your thermostat set to 78 or higher,https://www.abc15.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/dept-of-energy-recommends-keeping-your-thermostat-set-to-78-or-higher,"PHOENIX — What temperature do you keep your thermostat at?

A new report from the Department of Energy suggests keeping your home no cooler that 78 degrees, even during the summer months in Arizona.

The report is aimed at helping people save money during the summer, while trying to keep you cool at the same time.

The DOE recommends keeping your home at 78 or warmer while you’re inside, and turning it up several degrees while you’re at work or away from home.

Here are five tips from the DOE to save money on your energy bill:



On hot days, avoid using the oven; cook on the stove, use a microwave oven, or grill outside.

Take advantage of daylight instead of artificial lighting, but avoid direct sunlight.

Wash only full loads of dishes and clothes. Consider air drying both dishes and clothing.

If you use air conditioning, a ceiling fan will allow you to raise the thermostat setting about 4°F with no reduction in comfort.

Install window coverings to prevent heat gain through your windows.

Vote in our poll of the day below to let us know what you keep your thermostat set to at night!"

It’s been more than a year since the last public status conference was held for the court-mandated Albuquerque Police Department reform effort and a lot has happened.

The judge presiding over the case stepped down, and a new one was appointed. Mayor Tim Keller and his administration completed their first year in office. APD completed a monumental review of the backlogged use-of-force cases.

On Tuesday morning, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the city of Albuquerque, the police department, the police union and the many stakeholders in the effort gathered for the first time before Judge James Browning in Federal Court.

Overall, the consensus throughout the all-day hearing was that APD has improved dramatically under this administration, there’s a lot more left to be done, and all of the participants are committed to seeing the reform through.

ADVERTISEMENTSkip

................................................................

No action was asked of the judge.

“I believe we have established real momentum,” Mayor Keller said, as the first speaker to address the room. “Our commitment to this process is real and enduring.”

One of the enduring problems the department needs to continue to address is getting supervisors – like sergeants and lieutenants – to enforce policies and discipline officers who violate them, said Dr. James Ginger, the independent monitor overseeing a police reform effort, speaking via teleconference.

“(Police Chief Michael) Geier has pulled a U-turn with this police department and is getting it in line with best practice,” he said. “But until the sergeants are in harness and pulling in the same direction as the chief, things won’t get done as quickly.”

Paul Killebrew, with the United States Department of Justice, echoed that sentiment.

He said one of the problems the DOJ found in its yearslong investigation into APD was a lack of consistency and accountability when officers violated policies or used excessive force. He said often times discipline was meted out only if stories appeared in the media or the city needed a “sacrificial lamb.”

Now he said he’s still noticing ways in which supervisors skirt reporting use of force by detailing an action in an “Additional Concern Memo” rather than an official report to the Internal Affairs Division.

He said the practice spiked in 2018 at the same time the IA force review division began gearing up.

................................................................

The chief put a stop to this process earlier this summer but Killebrew said it was an example of how the department will have to play “whack-a-mole” to catch people trying to avoid calling out misconduct.

Both the city attorney’s office and the attorney for the police union objected to Killebrew’s characterization of the memos and said there was no concerted effort to hide misconduct.

On the other hand, Killebrew noted the department’s IA force division “went beyond expectations” in tackling a 300-case backlog of use-of-force cases. Those cases were older than 120 days and no disciplinary action could be taken against the officers, but the investigators still looked at every single one from the ground up, noted any infractions in an officer’s file and kept an eye out for enduring patterns or problems.

Many of the cases predated the current administration, and Killebrew said he believed they “made the best out of a bad situation.”

Chief Geier plans to personally meet with officers who were found to be at fault to coach them on what they need to improve upon."
Lawmakers criticize EPA draft rule for curbing rights to challenge pollution permits,https://thehill.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458158-lawmakers-criticize-epa-draft-appeals-rule-for-limiting-rights-to,"Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns over a forthcoming environmental rule that could limit the rights of individuals and communities to challenge granted federal pollution permits.

Three Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday taking issue with reported changes that they warned could ""benefit wealthy industry groups at the expense of everyday Americans unable to afford lengthy litigation battles.""

The letter was signed by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. Frank Joseph PalloneLawmakers call on Trump to keep tech legal shield out of trade talks Hillicon Valley: FTC fines Facebook B in privacy settlement | Critics pan settlement as weak | Facebook also faces FTC antitrust probe | Senate panel advances 'deepfakes' legislation | House passes anti-robocall bill House passes anti-robocall bill MORE (D-N.J.), Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairwoman Diana DeGette Diana Louise DeGetteHere are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment Crucial for Congress to fund life-saving diabetes research Overnight Health Care — Sponsored by Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids — White House withdraws controversial rule to eliminate drug rebates | Grassley says deal on drug prices moving 'very soon' | Appeals court declines to halt Trump abortion referral ban MORE (D-Colo.), and Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee Chairman Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoHouse Democrats push automakers to rebuff Trump, join California's fuel efficiency deal Overnight Energy: Democrats seek help in appealing to conservatives on climate | Whistleblowers say Interior sidelined scientists | Automakers strike fuel efficiency deal with California in rebuff to Trump Interior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump MORE (D-N.Y.).

The letter follows reports that the EPA is preparing a final regulation that would no longer allow individuals or communities to challenge the Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) on any decisions about how much pollution is legally allowed at nearby power plants. However, the rule would reportedly allow the industry to continue to appeal denials.

“We believe the reported changes would threaten human health and the environment,” the lawmakers wrote Tuesday.

They added that the House panel is “troubled by EPA’s reported efforts to limit the ability of communities to challenge the Agency’s permitting decisions.”

“Additionally, we are concerned that EPA is contemplating actions which could undermine the EAB’s ability to effectively and independently adjudicate permits, limit the scope and nature of EAB’s review, or foreclose administrative appeals altogether,” they wrote.

While the EPA has not finalized the regulation, it is expected to be released soon.

The EPA did not immediately return requests for comment on the lawmakers’ letter. The agency has not officially confirmed or denied the existence of the forthcoming rule.

“EPA is always interested in improving its processes while maintaining environmental protection. Contrary to the speculation by certain parties, EPA is working to protect the public interest and transparently carry out its work,” a spokesman said in a statement in July.

An internal June 19 EPA email obtained by The Hill characterized the proposed procedural rule as an attempt to “streamline and modernize the role of the Environmental Appeals Board in EPA’s permitting process.”

The email sent to staff from Carol Ann Siciliano, the EPA’s acting deputy general counsel for environmental media and regional law offices, noted that the rule proposal was a top priority for EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerEPA walks back use of 'cyanide bombs' to protect livestock from wild animals EPA proposes rolling back states' authority over pipeline projects New Mexico says EPA abandoned state in fight against toxic 'forever chemicals' MORE.

In their letter, the lawmakers requested that Wheeler confirm the forthcoming EAB proposal and provide additional details, including how the changes under consideration might impact low-income and minority communities. Additionally, they asked the EPA to set up a briefing with the committee over the rule."
Lindsey Graham says Horowitz FISA report will be 'ugly and damning' for DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-18-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-says-horowitz-fisa-report-will-be-ugly-and-damning-for-doj,"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina predicted Sunday that the upcoming report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act would be “ugly and damning” for the DOJ.

The Republican Senate Judiciary chairman spoke with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures, saying the much-anticipated Horowitz report was “coming out in weeks, not days, not months.” In explaining to Bartiromo why the release of the report had been repeatedly delayed — Attorney General William Barr predicted early this year it would come out in May or June — Graham said “every time you turn around you find something new.”

Graham predicted Horowitz would have a lot to say about ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" at the FBI and DOJ, and would likely have recommendations about what should be done to fix it.





Graham also said once Horowitz finishes his report, it will be sent to the Justice Department for a review for any classified information. The senator said he was meeting with Barr next week to ensure as much of the report as possible is made public.

“I want to declassify as much as possible,” Graham said. “I want the American public to hear the story. I want all of this information to come out. I don’t want people to believe what I say about it — I want them to read for themselves how bad it was.”

""I believe the Horowitz report is going to be ugly and damning regarding the Department of Justice handling of the Russia probe,"" Graham added.

The FBI and DOJ obtained four FISA warrants and renewals against Trump campaign associate Carter Page beginning in October 2016 through June 2017. The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the DOJ and FBI made extensive use of the dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Clinton campaign hired the firm through Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm, and the campaign was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race. Steele’s funding from Democrats was never revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

And newly released FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, even after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from ""Russian conspiracy theories."" Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI too.

Graham explained today that Horowitz “is doing a very in-depth dive about the FISA warrant application” and is looking into “the behavior regarding the counterintelligence operation.” Graham said he believed the evidence would show the FBI’s FISA filings were “a fraud on the court.”

The senator specifically pointed to the FBI being “on notice” that Steele “hated Trump, that he was an unreliable informant,” as well as Steele’s information — “unverified to this day” — allegedly coming from Russian sources and allegedly exonerating nonpublic transcripts of interviews of Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos with an FBI informant, likely Cambridge professor Stefan Halper.

The interactions that Papadopoulos had with the mysterious Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud allegedly led to the FBI opening an inquiry into Trump in July 2016. Mifsud allegedly told Papadopoulos in the spring of 2016 about the Russians having “dirt” on Hillary Clinton. Papadopoulos then allegedly mentioned this to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who later passed the information along to the FBI, triggering what the FBI dubbed “Crossfire Hurricane.” Republicans now say exonerating information about Papadopoulos was concealed from the FISA Court.

“I want it all out,” Graham emphasized. “I want people to see how off the rails this investigation got, and I want people to be held accountable. And I am patient, I’m not in a hurry to do it, I want to do it right.”"

Yields on the 10-year US Treasury note were solidly higher, rising back above those for 2-year notes, an improvement for an indicator seen as a reliable recession warning.

The Dow suffered its worst session of the year last Wednesday after yields on short-term US Treasuries briefly exceeded long-term notes, but since then, US stocks have risen the last three sessions.

About 20 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.0% at 26 139.11.

The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.1% to 2 919.02, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.2% to 7 994.16.

This week's calendar includes new home sales for July, as well as minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting.

But all eyes will be on the high-profile annual central bank gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyoming that includes an appearance by Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday.

Markets expect the Fed to cut interest rates again this year after enacting the first rate cut in more than a decade last month, a move economists see as helping to delay the onset of an economic downturn.

Several leading retailers reported will report earnings this week, including Home Depot, Target and Nordstrom.

"Washing or rinsing raw chicken puts you at risk for illness, says USDA study",https://www.fox10phoenix.com,[],,,,https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/washing-or-rinsing-raw-chicken-puts-you-at-risk-for-illness-says-usda-study,"Individuals are putting themselves at risk for illness when they wash or rinse raw poultry says a study from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Mindy Brashears, the USDA's Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety, joined FOX 5 Tuesday and said the major cross-contamination concerns are focused around the sink where the chicken is washed. Brashears said it is important to both clean and sanitize areas of the kitchen that any part of the chicken came in contact with.

The USDA is recommending three easy options to help prevent illness when preparing poultry, or meat, in your home.

1. Significantly decrease your risk by preparing foods that will not be cooked, such as vegetables and salads, BEFORE handling and preparing raw meat and poultry.

2. Thoroughly clean and sanitize ANY surface that has potentially touched or been contaminated from raw meat and poultry, or their juices.

3. Destroy any illness causing bacteria by cooking meat and poultry to a safe internal temperature as measured by a food thermometer.

"Commerce Department will extend Huawei reprieve, Ross says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team""]",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/commerce-department-will-extend-huawei-reprieve-ross-says/2019/08/19/82a11436-c275-11e9-9986-1fb3e4397be4_story.html,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Monday that his department will grant another temporary reprieve to Huawei Technologies, delaying the implementation of a penalty on the Chinese tech giant for another 90 days.

Ross made the announcement during an appearance on Fox Business Network.

“It is another 90 days for the U.S. telecom companies,” Ross said. “Some of the rural companies are dependent on Huawei. So we’re giving them a little more time to wean themselves off. But no specific licenses are being granted for anything.”

The next deadline, he added, is roughly Nov. 19.

On Sunday, President Trump suggested that his administration was not likely to grant another reprieve to Huawei, citing national security concerns. “At this moment, it looks much more like we’re not going to do business,” Trump said, pushing back against reports of the expected reprieve.

Trump directed the Commerce Department in May to place Huawei on its “Entity List,” known to some as the “death penalty.” The move makes it difficult for Huawei to do business with any U.S. company. Days later, the Commerce Department announced a 90-day reprieve that allowed some sales to Huawei to continue temporarily, effective May 20.

Ross said Monday that the Commerce Department had also decided to add 46 more Huawei subsidiaries to the Entity List.

“We now have more than 100 subsidiaries on the Entity List,” he said, explaining that “adding more entities makes it more difficult for Huawei to get around the sanctions.”

The ban is one of three by the U.S. government targeting Huawei. Last year, Trump signed a defense-spending bill that barred the federal government and its contractors from doing business with Huawei and several other Chinese companies on national security grounds. A separate ban prohibits companies that do business with Huawei from providing services to the U.S. government.

Some U.S. tech companies have applied for licenses that would allow them to continue to sell to Huawei, arguing that the Commerce Department ban could harm their bottom lines and their ability to innovate."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday dismissed the biofuel industry’s argument that waivers granted to small oil refineries were destroying demand and that were damaging for the ethanol producers.

“There is zero evidence that EPA’s congressionally mandated small refinery exemption program...has had any negative impact on domestic corn ethanol producers,” a spokesman for the EPA said in emailed comments."
DOJ asks appeals court to block subpoenas for Trump bank records,https://thehill.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/457967-doj-calls-on-court-to-block-subpoenas-for-trump-bank-records,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday asked a federal appeals court to block House subpoenas for President Trump Donald John Trump Former US ambassador: 'Denmark is not a big fan of Donald Trump and his politics' Senate Democrats push for arms control language in defense policy bill Detroit county sheriff endorses Booker for president MORE’s personal financial information.

In a Monday brief, the DOJ argued that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit should block subpoenas from House committees who are seeking Trump’s records at Deutsche Bank and Capital One.

Trump has sued to prevent Capital One and Deutsche Bank from turning over records of their business with the president to the House Financial Services, Intelligence and Oversight and Reform committees.

Those committees issued subpoenas for Trump’s financial records in April as part of a broad investigation into Russian money laundering and financial crimes in the U.S.

The District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in May that the House subpoenas should proceed, but the requests are on hold while Trump appeals the case.

The Justice Department argued in its Monday brief that the district court erred in approving the subpoenas without asking lawmakers to narrow the scope of their requests. The DOJ said lawmakers have failed to prove a legitimate legislative reason for the subpoenas, which they claim clash with constitutional protections for executive power.

“There is no objective reason for a congressional investigation into the general problem of money laundering and other illicit financial transactions to focus on the President and his family,” the department argued.



“The Committees have not connected the dots between the ‘undeniably broad’ scope of these subpoenas and the general legislative purpose that the House has articulated: closing regulatory loopholes that permit corrupt financial activity,” the department wrote.



The DOJ has also previously weighed in on another court fight for Trump's financial records, in the case involving a subpoena for documents from Mazars, an accounting firm, being sought by the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Earlier this month, the department similarly said in a court filing before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that the committee had not provided a legislative reason for seeking those documents."
Justice moves to halt airline ticket company merger,https://www.foxbusiness.com,[],,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/sabre-stock-drops-as-doj-sues-to-block-farelogix-acquisition,"The U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit Wednesday that aims to block a $360 million deal in which travel-technology giant Sabre Corporation would acquire Farelogix, Inc., a software company that provides ticket-booking services to airlines.

Sabre shares dipped slightly on the news.

Per a press release that accompanied the suit, the DOJ claims that the acquisition would eliminate competition in the travel market that largely benefits airlines and consumers.

“Sabre’s proposed acquisition of Farelogix is a dominant firm’s attempt to take out a disruptive competitor that has been an important source of competition and innovation,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, said. “If allowed to proceed, the acquisition would likely result in higher prices, reduced quality, and less innovation for airlines and, ultimately, traveling American consumers.”

Sabre, which has long operated on outdated tech, is the dominant provider of booking services in the United States, holding more than 50 percent of airline bookings through travel agencies. The company’s revenues totaled approximately $3.9 billion in 2018.

Farelogix’s innovative approach in the travel market, according to the release, “has injected much-needed competition into stagnant booking services markets,” allowing airlines to leverage “their ability to turn to Farelogix to negotiate lower fees with Sabre and the other [global distribution systems], and to reduce their reliance on GDSs for booking services.”

Despite the DOJ suit, Sabre is planning to push ahead with the acquisition. Sabre and Farelogix have extended the new termination date of their acquisition to April 30, 2020.

“Over the past nine months, we believe we have done all we can to address the DOJ’s concerns,” Sean Menke, Sabre president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “While we hope the DOJ will ultimately recognize that this transaction is pro-competitive, we are prepared to vigorously defend the deal in court if necessary.”"
