"Trump’s Personal Assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, Shared Intimate Details of First Family",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Katie Rogers', 'Annie Karni', 'Maggie Haberman']",08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/us/politics/madeleine-westerhout-trump-family.html,"Mr. Trump did not immediately trust her when she was hired at the White House. She had no prior relationship with him, and according to “American Carnage,” a recent book by Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine, she wept on election night at the fact that he won — an account confirmed by White House officials.

But she was immediately installed outside the Oval Office. Mr. Trump, who was whipsawed and overwhelmed by his own surprise victory, has historically cared a great deal about who guards access to him; at Trump Tower, it was a role of considerable influence. With so much to learn and so many jobs to fill, he had little choice but to go along with the staff that was provided to him, according to current and former officials. Mr. Trump was told by Mr. Priebus that she could be trusted.

Mr. Priebus eventually left the White House, but Ms. Westerhout developed her own relationship with her perennially suspicious boss. The president appeared happy to see her when she would pop her head into his office to try to interrupt a meeting that had dragged on too long, even if he shooed her away, according to White House aides.

The president had grown to trust her and had grown fond of her. According to Mr. Alberta’s book, Mr. Trump would refer to Ms. Westerhout as “my beautiful beauty.” She was often at his side on trips to Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach, Fla., resort, where she would accept gifts on behalf of Mr. Trump and trade business cards with his supporters. Some of them knew that if they wanted to reach the president by phone, they could bypass his other gatekeepers and go directly to her.

But she also had a fairly large coterie of enemies, including some in the East Wing — the purview of the first lady, Melania Trump — which viewed her with suspicion. Some of the president’s friends counseled him over the past two years that she was, in the words of one, “immature,” and was blocking access to him from some people he had known for years.

She had also raised suspicion with her indiscreet comments about the president, including openly complaining to aides that Mr. Trump had disrupted his own schedule because he had been late leaving the White House residence after his daily executive time sessions, according to one former official.

Inside the faction-split White House, Trump loyalists cheered Ms. Westerhout’s departure as a move that was long overdue, and said they hoped it served as something of a wake-up call for Mr. Trump to bring in more loyalists into the West Wing. But current and former officials also expressed alarm about what information Ms. Westerhout could share down the road, not just about the president, but about her colleagues."
Trump Tweets Sensitive Surveillance Image Of Iran,https://www.npr.org,['Geoff Brumfiel'],08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/30/755994591/president-trump-tweets-sensitive-surveillance-image-of-iran,"Trump Tweets Sensitive Surveillance Image Of Iran

President Trump has tweeted what experts say is almost certainly an image from a classified satellite or drone, showing the aftermath of an accident at an Iranian space facility.

""The United States of America was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir [Space Launch Vehicle] Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran,"" the president said in a tweet that accompanied the image on Friday. ""I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One.""

NPR broke the news of the launch failure on Thursday, using images from commercial satellites that flew over Iran's Imam Khomeini Space Center. Those images showed smoke billowing from the pad. Iran has since acknowledged an accident occurred at the site.

Some of the highest-resolution imagery available commercially comes from the company Maxar, whose WorldView-2 satellite sports 46-centimeter resolution.

But the image shown in the president's tweet appears to be of far better quality, says Ankit Panda, an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, who specializes in analyzing satellite imagery. ""The resolution is amazingly high,"" says Panda. ""I would think it's probably below well below 20 centimeters, which is much higher than anything I've ever seen.""

Panda says that the tweet discloses ""some pretty amazing capabilities that the public simply wasn't privy to before this.""

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred questions about the image to the White House, which declined to comment.

The image shows the aftermath of the accident, which experts believe took place while the rocket was being fueled. Clearly visible is the truck used to transport and erect the rocket, and the words ""The product of national empowerment,"" which have been written along the edge of the pad. The picture also shows extensive debris and charring around the pad.

It was not entirely clear where the president's photo came from. Panda believes it was most likely taken by a classified U.S. satellite. But Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network at the One Earth Foundation, believes that the resolution is so high, it may be beyond the physical limits at which satellites can operate. ""The atmosphere is thick enough that after somewhere around 11 to 9 centimeters, things get wonky,"" she says.

That could mean it was taken by a drone or spy plane, though such a vehicle would be violating Iranian airspace. Hanham also says that the European company Airbus has been experimenting with drones that fly so high, they are technically outside the atmosphere and thus operating outside national boundaries. But she says she doesn't know whether the U.S. has such a system.

Glare in the center of the image suggests the image in the tweet was itself a photo of a briefing slide. Panda suggests it could have been displayed on a computer screen in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. It's also possible it was a photo of a piece of paper.

Either way, Panda notes that a small redaction in the upper left-hand corner suggests the intelligence community had cleared the image for release by the president.

But both he and Hanham question whether releasing it was a good idea. ""You really risk giving away the way you know things,"" Hanham says. ""That allows people to adapt and hide how they carry out illicit activity.""

""These are closely held national secrets,"" Panda adds. ""We don't even share a lot of this kind of imagery with our closest allies."" In tweeting it out to the world, Trump is letting Iran know exactly what the U.S. is capable of. He's also letting others know as well, Panda says. ""The Russians and the Chinese, you're letting them know that these are the kind of things that the United States has the capability of seeing,"" he says.

German Cabinet and Bundesbank Are in Close Communication on CBDC Issues,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Helen Partz', 'Ivan Franciscovich']",08-30-2019,2019,8,https://cointelegraph.com/news/german-cabinet-and-bundesbank-are-in-close-communication-on-cbdc-issues,"The Cabinet of Germany and Germany’s central bank Deutsche Bundesbank are working together closely on issues related to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

Awareness of global CBDC situation

On Aug. 29, Germany’s federal parliament (Bundestag) published official feedback to a request from parliamentary group the Free Democratic Party, which asked the Cabinet to respond to six questions related to CBDCs in July 2019.

In the document, dated Aug. 16, the Cabinet answered all questions by the group, citing major reports and surveys in the space, including a January report by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). Specifically, when asked about its knowledge or insights about CBDC, the Cabinet cited the BIS, claiming that 70% of global central banks are engaged in CBDC work, but only two have concrete plans to issue digital central bank money.

Status of existing projects: unclear

The Cabinet emphasized that Sweden is the only country in the European Union that is currently considering issuing CBDCs. However, a final decision about CBDC issuance has not been reached, the authority stated. In addition, there are some concrete CBDC plans in Uruguay but shakey pilots have led to uncertainty as to future implementation, the Cabinet wrote.

The authority outlined a similar situation with the Chinese central bank, which launched a research program on the possible issue of CBDC back in 2014 but is still experiencing a lack of clarity regarding the issue. The Cabinet also cited Venezuela’s Petro (PTR) project, referencing a 2018 Reuters report claiming that there were still no transactions in the oil-backed national cryptocurrency.

In July 2019, the head of Bundesbank Jens Weidmann expressed support for Facebook’s much-discussed crypto project Libra, claiming that global regulators should not suppress the initiative in its infancy."
Trump’s Unprecedented Fight to Withhold Information,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Kerry W. Kircher', 'Former House General Counsel']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/house-needs-its-subpoena-power-against-trump/596857/,"Under these circumstances, the House has to keep fighting, including by suing civilly to enforce its committees’ subpoenas. During the period that I served in the Office of General Counsel, only two House-subpoena cases ended up in court: Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers (during George W. Bush’s presidency) and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder (during Barack Obama’s presidency). I worked on both. These cases provide some guidance on how the current suits will likely unfold, at least at the lower-court level.

In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi was speaker, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to testify about, and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten to produce records relating to, the White House’s firing of an unusual number of U.S. attorneys. The Bush White House directed Miers not to appear and Bolten not to provide records, claiming that senior White House aides were absolutely immune from congressional subpoenas (the same claim the Trump White House now makes with respect to McGahn). Ultimately, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued to compel compliance.

U.S. District Judge John Bates, a Bush appointee, ruled in 2008 in the Miers case that senior White House aides are not immune from congressional subpoenas, that Miers had to appear before the committee but could raise privilege objections in response to specific questions, and that Bolten had to either produce the documents subpoenaed or provide to the committee a log of the documents as to which he claimed privilege. Bates also indicated that if further disputes ensued regarding specific privilege objections, he would help resolve them. Miers and Bolten appealed. But shortly thereafter, President Obama was sworn in, and the parties settled: The Judiciary Committee took Miers’s testimony and Bolten produced some, although not all, of the subpoenaed documents.

Kia Rahnama: What Congress can do when Trump appointees defy it

In 2011, when John Boehner was speaker, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform subpoenaed Attorney General Eric Holder for documents that concerned “Fast and Furious,” an undercover Justice Department law-enforcement operation that went awry and resulted in the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. After months of back-and-forth and the production of a small number of documents to the committee, Holder claimed that the remaining documents were protected by a common-law privilege little understood outside legal circles, known as the deliberative-process privilege. As before, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued, this time to compel compliance with certain specific aspects of its document subpoena.

In 2013, U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson, an Obama appointee, ruled that the House had standing to sue. On the merits, however, the case dragged on for several more years—because of the volume of documents at issue, because Jackson allowed the Justice Department to assert new privileges as the case proceeded, and because she concluded that the deliberative-process privilege had some constitutional roots. Ultimately, the committee obtained many, although not all, of the documents it had sought."
The Justice Department Can’t Keep Its Own Law Secret Forever,https://www.politico.com,"['Jack Shafer', 'Cristian Farias']",08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/29/the-justice-department-cant-keep-its-own-law-secret-forever-227984,"Win McNamee/Getty Images Law And Order The Justice Department Can’t Keep Its Own Law Secret Forever

Cristian Farias is a former member of The New York Times’ editorial board and a writer-in-residence at the Knight First Amendment Institute.

When the Supreme Court and lower courts interpret the Constitution and laws, their decrees are public, accessible and subject to debate. In some instances, if an interpretation of the law doesn’t sit well with the public, Congress can respond by amending the law, effectively nullifying a court’s decision. Or if a ruling on a constitutional question is especially egregious, a constitutional amendment, though unlikely, remains an option.

But it turns out there’s a whole category of American law that is above such checks and balances. The public knows nothing about it and there’s no way to challenge it in court, let alone debate it in the halls of Congress.

Story Continued Below

For decades, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has flexed its interpretive power as the ultimate arbiter of what the law is for the executive branch, building a whole body of secret law that remains shielded from public view. Very little is known about these opinions—which carry the force of law, resolve disputes between agencies, direct the conduct of federal officials and can even affect civil rights and liberties. In the view of one scholar, these opinions date “to the beginning of the Republic” and can even “rival the opinions of the Supreme Court.”

These decisions number in the thousands, and the few that become public see the light of day at the discretion of the Justice Department. But the vast majority stay secret—binding executive branch officials and activities across administrations. Because almost everyone who isn’t a lawyer in the office is kept in the dark about these legal conclusions, Congress and the public can’t debate them or seek amendments in the event of abuses. Courts are of no help either.

Indeed, without transparency to test these legal opinions in a court of law or the court of public opinion, it is often the case that the Justice Department has the final say on the actions of federal agencies and officers, and there’s not much anyone can do about it. From Robert Mueller’s decision to follow a 1973 Justice Department recommendation that a president can’t be indicted while in office to numerous pronouncements shielding Donald Trump or officials in his administration from congressional oversight, the Office of Legal Counsel makes law that holds tremendous sway over issues of public concern.

And yet despite the influence of the office’s opinions across the executive branch and their centrality to many of Trump’s controversies, all the public knows about them is the smattering of decisions that are made public from time to time. The Justice Department claims to have the last word over what gets released to the public, subject to a secretive “publication review committee” that calls the shots.

According to one former Justice Department official, in 1991, when Attorney General William Barr first led the Justice Department, the government only published 13 opinions out of an estimated 625 that the Office of Legal Counsel gave to other agencies—a paltry 2 percent that leaves Americans with little understanding of the law that guided the United States’ government at the time.

In 2016, Congress amended the Freedom of Information Act to place a 25-year cap on documents previously shielded by what the Justice Department calls “deliberative process privilege”—which the government has cited in the past to keep Office of Legal Counsel’s precedent-setting legal opinions secret. By law, then, that type of privilege should no longer cover such decisions older than 25 years—though some or portions of them may still be kept from disclosure if, for example, they contain classified information. And neither should the department be allowed to claim attorney-client privilege over these opinions, which aren’t legal advice but controlling decisions of law.



With this understanding of the law and with an eye toward greater transparency, a group of scholars last week filed a lawsuit in federal court arguing that Office of Legal Counsel memoranda that are at least 25 years old should be disclosed to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. Among the plaintiffs are historians of presidential power, the civil rights movement, the laws of war, government surveillance and immigration—all areas where the government’s enormous discretion to enforce the law has been guided by legal judgments that our citizenry would be well served to understand and reckon with, even today. The Justice Department didn’t comply with an earlier administrative request for these opinions.

Understanding past overreach could help us better understand today’s. Barr, then and now, is the kind of attorney general whose expansive views of executive power deserve legal scrutiny—and the public is entitled to know to what extent the Office of Legal Counsel abetted or disregarded his maximalist impulses. More than 25 years ago, he was behind some of the Justice Department’s darkest hours: From a lawless surveillance program he approved that long predated the National Security Agency’s post-9/11 excesses to his role in recommending pardons for officials implicated in the Iran-Contra affair, the American people deserve to know how much secret law he helped create for the presidents he’s served—and how much of it may still be good law for the rest of the executive branch today. For all we know, some of these decisions may have been overruled by later administrations, presidents or attorneys general; the enduring secrecy of these opinions makes it difficult to tell.

Right now, we see these opinions’ weight and opacity playing out. In December, the Trump administration is expected to resume executing federal prisoners on death row, ending a longstanding, de facto moratorium on the federal death penalty. Barr’s decision to reinstate the practice didn’t happen in a vacuum, but was preceded by the advice of the Office of Legal Counsel, which in May concluded in a 26-page memorandum that the Food and Drug Administration lacks the authority to regulate “drugs” and “devices” used in capital punishment.

That conclusion was squarely at odds with the agency’s prior disapproval of pentobarbital, the drug Barr now wants to use in the upcoming executions. Whatever regulatory roadblocks existed before have been removed. The Office of Legal Counsel has now declared what the law is—at least as far as the executive branch and the FDA are concerned. Unless a court steps in, these executions will move forward with Barr’s new lethal cocktail of choice.

The Office of Legal Counsel’s historical memoranda may not all concern issues of life and death, but they should concern all of us—and the Justice Department would be acting in the national interest if it disclosed them as the law requires."
Ukraine's New Parliament Approves Top Cabinet Officials,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-08-29/ukraines-new-parliament-approves-top-cabinet-officials,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks to newly elected Ukrainian parliament deputies during parliament session in Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 29, 2019.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's president on Thursday urged lawmakers to help liberalize the economy and pursue integration into Europe as the newly-elected parliament swiftly approved his appointees for top government jobs.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian elected president in April, told parliament that the public expects lawmakers to help return Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and settle the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Facing a hostile parliament after his landslide victory, Zelenskiy called a snap parliamentary election in July that gave his Servant of the People party the parliament majority. The party takes its name from the popular television sitcom in which Zelenskiy played a high school teacher propelled into the presidency.

Like Zelenskiy, a newcomer in politics, none of the Servant of the People lawmakers have previous experience in parliament. Many Ukrainians, who have grown tired of the old elites they see as corrupt and inefficient, see it as an advantage.

The Verkhovna Rada on Thursday quickly named Oleksiy Honcharuk, 35, as the nation's new prime minister. In his speech in parliament, Honcharuk pledged to focus on encouraging economic growth, raising living standards and combating corruption.

""No one will be allowed to steal in the new government,"" he said.

Some observers saw Honcharuk as a creature of oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi, who owns the television station that aired the sitcom that made Zelenskiy a star. Honcharuk has been reportedly close to Andriy Bohdan, Zelenskiy's chief of staff, who had close ties with the oligarch.

""Honcharuk is a technical figure, who will convey the interests of the group of people linked to Kolomoyskyi and Bohdan,"" said Volodymyr Sidenko, an analyst with the Razumkov Center, an independent Kiev-based think tank. ""These people will now play a key role in distributing financial flows.""

Sidenko noted that Honcharuk will face a tough task of introducing unpopular measures that Ukraine's Western investors expect the government to take to shore up the economy.

""The new prime minister will have to do dirty and unpopular work, reducing state subsidies and social assistance as required by the International Monetary Fund and other Western lenders,"" Sidenko said.

The lawmakers also quickly approved other Zelenskiy's appointees for top jobs.

Ivan Bakanov, who directed Zelenskiy's campaign, was named the chief of Ukraine's Security Service, the SBU.

Dmytro Razumkov, who served as Zelenskiy's campaign adviser and later became the leader of his party, was elected parliamentary speaker.

The Rada also approved the new foreign minister, Vadim Pristaiko, who previously served as Ukraine's ambassador to Canada and later its envoy to NATO.

Speaking to lawmakers, Pristaiko pledged to push for settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where fighting between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have killed more than 13,000 people since 2014.

""We need peace and stability,"" he said.

Andriy Zahorodniuk, who was named defense minister, pledged to streamline the military and free it of graft.

""Everyone knows that they steal in the army,"" he said. ""People have grown tired of those problems.""

Two of the members of former President Petro Poroshenko's Cabinet kep their jobs — Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and Finance Minister Oksana Markarova.

Markarova is a technocrat, while Avakov helped Zelenskiy win by speaking out about Poroshenko's alleged attempts to buy voters' support before the election.

Volodymyr Fesenko of the Penta Center think tank said Zelenskiy wants the new Cabinet to speed up liberal economic reforms, but is aware of the challenges.

""President Zelenskiy wants the new parliament and the new Cabinet to serve as instruments to achieve quick reforms,"" Fesenko said. ""The new Cabinet will inevitably face a dilemma of how to conduct swift reforms without a further plunge in the already low living standards that could provoke a social explosion."""

Ukrainian and Russian officials spent the day Friday hammering out the details of a highly anticipated prisoner exchange, officials in Kiev and Moscow reported, as each country continued to explore how the newly installed administration of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will reshape the hostility between the two neighbors.

Ukraine’s new chief prosecutor reported early in the morning that the large-scale exchange was underway, but Zelensky’s office said the report was premature, and the Ukrainian security service said there would be no swap on Friday.

More than 60 prisoners were reported to be involved, including 24 Ukrainian sailors who were detained when their ships were seized in 2018 in the Kerch Strait between Crimea and the Russian mainland.

Russian and Ukrainian news services reported that final negotiations were continuing and that both sides expect the exchange to happen. They have been in talks over such a move all summer.

Zelensky’s office was critical of the preliminary reports that the exchange was underway.

“It is not the first time we have seen such information chaos caused by some reference to unconfirmed information and multiple ‘sources.’ We urge everyone to understand the consequences of misinformation: it’s like playing on society’s emotions. When this reciprocal release of detained persons is completed, the Office of the President will announce that via official channels,” his office said on Facebook.

Valentin Rybin, a lawyer for Russians held prisoner by Ukraine, said that the Russian prisoners were preparing to leave but were still in detention and that Zelensky had yet to issue them pardons.

The most prominent prisoner expected to be released on either side was the filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who was arrested by the Russians in Crimea in 2014 and sentenced to a 20-year term on a charge of plotting terrorism. Last year, he conducted a 145-day hunger strike, demanding the release of Ukrainian prisoners held by Russia. He was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament and has been supported by prominent filmmakers in Europe as well as in Russia.

A member of the Ukrainian parliament, Viktor Medvedchuk, visited two other Ukrainian prisoners at Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, taking them bread and salt in a symbolic welcome.

A Russian journalist with the Ria-Novosti news agency, Kirill Vyshinsky, was released on bail Wednesday by a Ukrainian court, though he has told reporters that he wants to stay in Ukraine to clear his name in the courts. Vyshinsky was arrested in May 2018 and charged with treason; he was still awaiting trial.

Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in the spring of 2014after the Maidan protests in Kiev that led to the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Shortly after, rebellion against the new government was launched in two regions in eastern Ukraine. Russia has played the leading role in fostering that rebellion, which has remained more or less at a stalemate for the past five years.

Zelensky, a comic actor whose most famous television role was as a schoolteacher whose viral rant propels him to the presidency, became president in fact this May, elected in April by a Ukrainian population that had grown weary of the war and of the deeply rooted corruption that is a feature of the nation. He said he wanted to find a way to ease tensions in the east but had only a vague platform. He won the election easily, and his backers took control of the parliament in voting this summer.

Zelensky’s new cabinet was installed Thursday.

The news of the release was first reported on Facebook by Ukrainian lawmaker Anna Islamova, in a post reshared by Ruslan Riaboshapka, Ukraine’s new prosecutor general.

Nigeria has backed down and lowered visa fees for Americans after a US visa hike,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/africa/1698117/nigeria-reduces-visa-fee-for-americans-in-response-to-trump/,"It’s taken just a day for the Nigerian government to respond to the Trump administration’s latest visa clampdown measure on Nigerians.

It has reduced visa fees for Americans traveling to Nigeria from $180 to $150 in response to the US embassy’s introduction of a “reciprocity fee” for Nigerians. The US embassy claims the new reciprocity fee, ranging from $80 to $303 and only to be paid for approved visas, has been introduced to “eliminate that cost difference” between visa application fees for both countries.

The move was in line with a Trump executive order in 2017 for the US secretary of State to, among other things, adjust fee schedules “to match the treatment of United States nationals” by other countries. The US embassy claimed it has been in talks with Nigerian authorities for 18 months to align visa fees.

For its part, Nigeria’s government says the decision to lower visa fees for American applicants was taken months ago but was not implemented given the transition in government. (Nigeria’s president Buhari only inaugurated a new cabinet last week after winning reelection for a second term in February).

It’s unclear if the new visa fee reduction for American applicants to Nigeria will also see the US Embassy revise its reciprocity fee structure for Nigerians.

Some international business people and tourists from countries including the United States have long complained about the high expense of Nigerian visas and the difficulty of obtaining them. The Buhari government has targeted improving this with programs including visa-on-arrival for business people and potential investors. Yet, Nigerians also face challenges with the US visa application process, which is renown for its intensive paperwork (even for short stay visas) and involves daunting consular interview sessions that often end in vague reasons for application rejections.

The quick reaction from Nigerian authorities is a change of tack from earlier measures by the Trump administration to clamp on Nigerian visa applications. In May, the US suspended a visa waiver program for Nigerian applicants and has reportedly considered issuing visas for shorter validity periods in response to the high rates of Nigerian nationals overstaying visas.

David Brooks: The man Trump wishes he were,https://www.sltrib.com,"['David Brooks', 'The New York Times']",08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/08/30/david-brooks-man-trump/,"In the first few months of his presidency, Donald Trump surrounded himself with a certain sort of ramrod military man: John Kelly, Michael Flynn, H.R. McMaster and Jim Mattis. These men had or appeared to have the kind of manly virtues and bearing that Trump likes to see in himself: courage, toughness, combativeness.

But when you look at how someone like, say, Jim Mattis forged his character, you realize that he is actually the exact opposite of Trump. Mattis built strengths and virtues through the steady application of intense effort over decades. Trump is a man who has been progressively hollowed out by the acid of his own self-regard.

Mattis is a man who is intensely loyal to others and attracts loyalty among those around him. Trump is disloyal to others and attracts disloyalty in return.

The contrast between how these two men were forged is so stark that it throws into relief how character is and isn’t formed.

Mattis was a mediocre college student. He partied too much and was jailed for underage drinking. But then he discovered the Marine Corps. His new book, “Call Sign Chaos,” which he wrote with Bing West and which will be released next week, is purportedly about leadership but really it is a portrait of Mattis’ life-defining love for the Marine Corps.

His prose sings when he describes those times when he was out on some battlefield exercise with front-line Marines. When he is stuck away inside the Pentagon or high up commanding NATO, you feel his longing for their presence.

Mattis reads Roman writers like Marcus Aurelius, but he is no stoic. Decade after decade he is touring some front or another, starting a million affectionate conversations. “How’s it going?” “Living the dream, sir,” is how those conversations begin. He trusts his Marines enough to delegate authority down. He clearly expresses commander’s intent in any situation and gives them latitude to adapt to circumstances.

Love is a motivational state. It propels you. You want to make promises to the person or organization you love. Character is forged in the keeping of those promises. If, on the other hand, you are unable to love and be loved, you’re never going to be in a position to make commitments or live up to them. You’re never going to forge yourself into a person who can be relied upon.

Mattis’ drive, born of his devotion to the Corps, is his most telling trait. He works insanely hard, propels himself extremely quickly, making himself, every day, a better Marine. Much of the work is intellectual. He thought the second Iraq War was a crazy idea, but when he was ordered to command part of it, he started reading Xenophon and ancient books about warfare in Mesopotamia.

“If you haven’t read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate, and you will be incompetent, because your personal experiences alone aren’t broad enough to sustain you,” Mattis and West write.

He is also willing to submit himself to an institution. Somebody like Trump is anti-institutional. He thinks every organization is about himself, and every organization’s procedures and traditions should bend to his desires.

But a person with an institutional mindset has a deep reverence for the organization he has joined and how it was built by those who came before. He understands that institutions pass down certain habits, practices and standards of excellence.

Mattis asserts that his way of doing warfare is simply the Marine way. In the Marine way, for example, “Amateur performance is anathema, and the Marines are bluntly critical of falling short. … Personal sensitivities are irrelevant.” Each mission gives him another body of knowledge, another strength, greater capacity to live execute his devotion to his country.

James Davison Hunter, who wrote, “The Death of Character,” once noted that good character does not require religious faith. “But it does require the conviction of truth made sacred, abiding as an authoritative presence within consciousness and life, reinforced by habits institutionalized within a moral community. Character, therefore, resists expedience; it defies hasty acquisition. This is undoubtedly why Søren Kierkegaard spoke of character as ‘engraved,’ deeply etched.”

In Mattis’ career you see something one saw in the great George Marshall’s career: that you need to work within a structure to be creative. Both generals were total company men, dedicated to their service, yet they were constantly trying to change its practices to keep up with the times.

Mattis barely mentions Trump in this book and doesn’t describe what must have been one of the truly challenging tasks of his life — working under Trump without getting tainted.

He didn’t write about Trump because he didn’t want to undermine the people still working inside the administration. But, he told Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic: “There is a period in which I owe my silence. It’s not eternal. It’s not going to be forever.”

Like Goldberg, I think it would be proper for Mattis to end his silence about Trump before the next election. Voters need his firsthand perspective to make a judgment about the fitness and character of the commander in chief.

US still to grant any Huawei trade licences,https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49495887,"Image copyright Getty Images

US officials have not granted any licences to trade with blacklisted Chinese firm Huawei, despite receiving more than 130 requests, Reuters says.

The US restricted companies from selling to the electronics giant in May, citing national security concerns, which have been dismissed by Huawei.

President Donald Trump said last month that some exemptions would be allowed.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

One industry source suggested to the BBC that a lack of clear guidelines from the Trump administration is to blame for the current standstill.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US is locked in a trade tariff battle with China

William Reinsch, a former US commerce department official, claims that officials are ""afraid"" to make a decision.

""Nobody in the executive branch knows what Trump wants and they're all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,"" he told Reuters.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

The US recently added a further 45 businesses associated with Huawei to an export blacklist.

It is the latest in a string of mixed signals from the president, who said this week that crucial trade talks with China would resume ""very shortly"".

His surprise announcement came after the the US revealed that it would be adding trade tariffs to $550bn (£449bn) worth of Chinese imports.

Huawei is the world's second-largest smartphone marker behind Samsung Electronics, but it has so far failed to make a dent in the US, where it currently holds less than a 1% market share.

The company has laid off more than 600 of its US staff since it was blacklisted by the US.

The US Department of Justice has claimed that its close ties with the Chinese government open it up to the the risk of its equipment being used to spy on other countries.

Huawei's future in the UK is also up for debate, with an announcement revealing whether it should be excluded from the rollout of 5G mobile networks by the end of the year.

Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan told the BBC that she hoped the government ""could do something by the autumn""."
Myanmar's KBZ Bank hires legal powerhouse Williams & Connolly after holding company was implicated in UN report,https://www.cnbc.com,['Brian Schwartz'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/29/myanmar-kbz-bank-hires-williams-connolly-for-potential-legal-trouble.html,"One of the most lucrative private banks in Myanmar has hired a legal powerhouse after its holding company was implicated in a scathing United Nations report that blasted the country's military.

Kanbawza Bank has tapped Williams & Connolly, a U.S.-based law firm, to be the company's legal representatives in case U.S. sanctions arise from the U.N.'s fact finding mission. The report accuses Myanmar's military of having ties to a litany of businesses and that those dealings have led to extensive human rights abuses. The U.N. called for a criminal investigation into KBZ Bank's parent company, KBZ Group, for allegedly funding a border fence that has prevented Rohingya Muslims from returning to Myanmar after fleeing the country in 2017.

The firm sent a letter to the bank's CEO, Michael DeNoma, earlier this month and it describes the agreement between the two parties, including a $250,000 retainer.

""Williams & Connolly LLP will provide legal services to you in connection with potential US legal issues and sanctions matters which may arise out of an August 5, 2019 UN Human Rights Council Report on Myanmar,"" David Aufhauser, a partner in the firm, wrote. Aufhauser was previously a managing director and global general counsel at investment bank UBS.

The bank's new hire was discovered after CNBC reviewed foreign lobbying registration forms, with one of the documents describing other responsibilities that may involve having to reach out to members of President Donald Trump's administration, congressional lawmakers and the U.N. itself.

""Additional services will potentially include providing advice regarding legal consequences of the report, providing advice on lobbying and public relations issues related to the representation, lobbying U.S. government officials in the Executive Branch, Congress,and/or the United Nations, and discussing the matter with U.S. or international media organizations,"" the exhibit reads.

The U.N., Aufhauser and KBZ Bank did not return requests for comment.

The effort by KBZ Bank to retain a marquee legal team suggests there are internals fears of severe backlash after the U.N. report, especially from foreign governments such as the U.S. The bank itself has always been held in a high regard around the world.

The Milken Institute, a economic think tank based out of California, described KBZ Bank in a 2017 study as a firm that dominates the Myanmar market.

""Among the privately owned banks, the so-called 'Big Three' dominate the market,"" the study says. ""Combined, Kanbawza Bank (KBZ), Ayeyarwady Bank (AYA), and Co-operative Bank (CB) control about two-thirds of all loans, two-thirds of all deposits, and more than 50 percent of all bank branches in the country.""

Members of the U.N. are scheduled to meet in September for the 74th session of the General Assembly in New York."
Can Trump force U.S. companies out of China?,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Rachel Layne'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-force-u-s-companies-out-of-china-not-technically-but-he-can-make-it-very-hard-to-stay/,"The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 would give President Trump discretion to impose restrictions on U.S. companies doing business in China if he declared an emergency.

The law was first used in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on the Iranian government during the Iran hostage crisis.



Although Congress could intervene to block Mr. Trump from declaring an emergency, it would be unlikely to do so given the ongoing partisan conflict in Washington, D.C.

President Donald Trump startled investors last week when he took to Twitter and ""hereby ordered"" U.S. companies to stop doing business in China as the countries continue to clash over trade. So is he within his rights?

The answer, experts say, is probably so. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a more than 40-year-old law Mr. Trump later cited in another tweet, gives the executive branch broad powers that, if invoked, could make it difficult for U.S. companies to operate in China.

Passed by Congress in 1977, IEEPA authorizes the president — after a national emergency is declared — to ""investigate, regulate or prohibit"" a range of activities by U.S. companies engaged in global commerce. Those include foreign exchange transactions, banking payments or transfers, and the import or export of foreign currency and securities. The law was first used in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on the Iranian government during the Iran hostage crisis.

IEEPA is ""an extraordinarily broad and open-ended delegation from Congress to the president,"" Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and Hoover Institute fellow, said in a tweet. As of earlier this year, U.S. presidents had invoked the act more than 50 times since its initial passage, according to the Congressional Research Service.

CBS News poll: U.S. consumers concerned about China tariffs

More recently, Mr. Trump in May invoked IEEPA in placing restrictions on U.S. companies doing business with Chinese technology company Huawei. He also threatened to use it to impose tariffs on Mexico tied to immigration. The difference now is that Mr. Trump is threatening to use IEEPA, which is typically used for sanctions, as a cudgel in his administration's trade war with China.

Mr. Trump's threat to block U.S. companies from doing business in China ""would face no effective legal barrier,"" Height Securities analyst Clayton Allen said in a research note. The White House could also expect backing from the courts, which have tended to uphold even broad exercises of power under IEEPA, Goldsmith said in another tweet.

The White House has since walked back Mr. Trump's order that U.S. companies cut ties with China amid protest from the business community. But he could still brandish IEEPA down the road if the conflict continues to deteriorate.

""So in theory that law exists, but that's not what the president said. He is asking American companies to take a look, take a fresh look at frankly moving out of China, go in someplace else,"" Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, told Margaret Brennan Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

Trump gets ready to ""double down"" on trade war with China

So what's to stop Mr. Trump from using IEEPA to push U.S. companies around in an unending series of national emergencies? In a word, Congress, which is constitutionally mandated to regulate commerce with foreign countries and which could vote to end a national emergency.

The problem there is that Congress would likely need a two-thirds majority to end a national emergency, according to the Congressional Research Service. Partisan conflict in Washington would make that a tall task, giving Mr. Trump more room to exercise his power under IEEPA."

The Federal Reserve’s Job Isn’t to Help Trump — or to Hurt Him,https://www.barrons.com,['Randall W. Forsyth'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/donald-trump-federal-reserve-trade-war-51566950641,"Text size

The policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to promote maximum employment and stable prices. That is what Congress has mandated, period.

This bears repeating, because the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York thinks it’s actually the job of the central bank to oppose Executive Branch policies with which it takes issue.

In a Bloomberg opinion piece, Bill Dudley argues the Fed should not “enable” the policies of President Donald Trump, which will he says will produce an “economic disaster.”

Leave aside the arguments over policy for a moment. Consider instead the Constitutional question of an unelected agency of government officials working to thwart the policies of elected officials.

Like him or not, Trump was duly chosen by Electoral College as the 45th President of the United States. As such, he is empowered to carry out the functions and duties as the head of the Executive Branch, as articulated by the U.S. Constitution, subject to the checks and balances provided by the Legislative and Judicial branches.

The Fed, meanwhile, is run by unelected officials, some of whom are nominated by the executive and confirmed by the legislative branch. Others are selected solely by private citizens answerable to no one else.

The Fed is a creation of Congress, which can change its structure, aims, or operating procedures. And similar to Supreme Court justices, members of the Fed’s Board of Governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Fed governors serve 14-year terms, while the chair has a four-year term (coincident with his or her term as governor.) The 12 Fed district bank presidents are chosen by the banks’ own board of directors, with no legislative oversight.

Monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, comprising the seven Fed governors, with the Fed Board Chair also chairing the FOMC, plus five of the 12 Fed district chairs. The Fed presidents rotate every year, except for the New York Fed president, which is a permanent member, in recognition of New York’s status as the nation’s—and arguably the world’s—financial capital. The New York Fed president also is the FOMC vice chair, further cementing the post as first among equals.

Leave aside the anachronistic structure of the Fed, cobbled together over a century ago. Defenders say it is designed to provide independence for the central bank. Critics argue it makes it unaccountable, resulting in campaigns to “audit the Fed” and its decision making, which the central bank has adamantly opposed.

That’s not to say the Fed has avoided being drawn into the political realm, sometimes legitimately, more often not.

During World War II, the entire aim of the U.S. government was to support the war effort. That included the Fed, by facilitating the financing of the wartime deficit by pegging bond yields. By the early 1950s, that mandate to cap interest rates caused inflation. That led to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which freed the central bank to raise rates as needed to control inflation.

The need to raise interest rates produced other conflicts between the Fed and other branches of government, most notably during the 1960s, when spending on the Vietnam War and the Great Society stirred inflation. President Lyndon B. Johnson literally manhandled then-Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin for hiking rates then.

Richard Nixon, who blamed his loss in 1960 in part on a sluggish economy resulting from tight Fed policy, installed the malleable Arthur Burns as his Fed Chairman after his 1968 presidential victory. Burns dutifully pursued stimulative policies to help ensure Nixon’s reelection, which provided the inflationary tinder for the explosion in oil prices, and the subsequent steep recession of 1973-74.

In more recent years, Alan Greenspan famously made certain to get along with both Republican and Democratic administrations (although George H.W. Bush blamed him for his reelection loss in 1992.) His successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, fared less well: The former didn’t get a third term under Barack Obama, while the latter wasn’t reappointed to a second term.

Jerome Powell got the nod from Trump, who nonetheless has stepped up his criticism of the central bank to unprecedented levels. Trump blasted the Fed for raising rates last year and its reluctance to lower them this year. While the central bank trimmed its federal funds target range one-quarter percentage point, the president has called for a cut of a full percentage point. That’s despite the Fed having achieved its aforementioned policy mandates, with unemployment at 3.7%, a half-century low, and inflation running a few tenths shy of its 2% target.

Fears of recession mainly stem from a global slowdown in manufacturing, which arguably stems mainly from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. In his speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy confab last week, Powell acknowledged the impact of trade. “While monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,” he said. But, he added, “we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” opening the way for another rate cut in September.

Dudley, by contrast, suggests the Fed opt not to do that. “Officials could state explicitly that the central bank won’t bail out an administration that keeps making bad choices on trade policy, making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions,” he wrote.

Even more radically, Dudley contends that Trump’s attacks on the Fed puts the presidential election within the central bank’s purview.

“After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,” he writes. “If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”

This is shocking, coming from a person who used to be one of the top three monetary-policy officials in the U.S. Dudley, moreover, came to the New York Fed from Goldman Sachs, where he was their chief Fed watcher, so he was no neophyte when it comes to the intersection of policy and markets. That also made him just one of the many former Goldman types to ascent to high government posts, such as Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary during the financial crisis.

An independent central bank means one able to meet its clearly defined policy goals—not to pursue its own agenda to thwart policies of other branches of government.

That would be tantamount to a coup d’etat.

"Facing farmer anger, Trump scrambles Cabinet to brainstorm on biofuel policy: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/facing-farmer-anger-trump-scrambles-cabinet-to-brainstorm-on-biofuel-policy-sources-idUSKCN1VC1RN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump returns after travelling to the AMVETS convention in Kentucky, at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S. August 21, 2019. REUTERS/Tasos Katopodis

Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry. However, his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting on for re-election in 2020.

Trump met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They presented options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

One proposal that was discussed and was advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was rescinding seven or eight of the 31 waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals, but Trump was yet to make a final decision.

The sticking point is a technical proposal to redistribute projected volumes that could be exempted in the future through the annual biofuel mandate from 2020 onwards. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.

David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels.

“As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers won’t be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story,” Fialkov said.

The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible; and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The final one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump’s EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and billionaire Carl Icahn.

U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to a slump in crop prices and exports shrinking following Trump’s trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about the refinery waivers.

‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.

Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.

On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in the fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed.

“Enough is enough,” Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. “We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions.”

Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.

On Thursday, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.

Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market."

The stage for the Democratic presidential debate in Detroit on July 30. (Anthony Lanzilote/Bloomberg)

Opinion writer

The 10 Democratic presidential candidates left on the September debate stage (more may come back in October) include three female senators, one gay mayor, a Taiwanese American business leader, a Latino former Cabinet secretary and mayor, two African Americans (one of whom is a woman) and three straight white men. Democrats can rightly claim that their party’s politicians look more like America than ever before. Certainly nonwhite voters remain a mainstay of the Democratic Party. Yet support from these voters is limited to a very few candidates.

There has been a lot of coverage about South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s struggles with African American voters. However, plenty of other candidates on that stage will have little or no African American support. Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report notes that 24 percent of the 2016 Democratic electorate was African American. In four of six recent polls that broke out African American voters, she found that former vice president Joe Biden leads among African American voters by 19 to 36 points.

In the Quinnipiac poll, only four candidates — Biden and Sens. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) have at least 7 percent support among black voters. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) has 3 percent, and none of the others in the next debate has even 1 percent support among black voters.

In the Fox poll, Biden has more than twice the support among black voters as does, the second-place candidate (Sanders), and only four candidates have 8 percent or more, with Booker and Beto O’Rourke at 6 percent. Among all nonwhite voters, only four contenders get 7 percent or more.

Biden so dominates among African Americans that there is not a plethora of non-Biden black voters. With two very white states, Iowa and New Hampshire, kicking off the primary process, those with little or no African American support pay little penalty in the early goings. But it’s hard to imagine that if Biden keeps his support among African American voters (not to mention older voters, who overwhelmingly favor him) that someone else can piece together enough votes for the nomination. The media have tended to focus on what happens to the moderate voters if Biden fails, but the more important question is whether any other candidate can dominate among African Americans to the extent Biden has.

This remains a nagging concern for Warren, who generally draws in the high single digits among African Americans. It also explains why Harris has made a huge push in South Carolina, doing multiple events last weekend. She may stand to gain the most from African American voters as well as voters who aren’t “very liberal” (Sanders’s and Warren’s strong base) should Biden falter.

In all the talk of electability, the media continue to posit that the “safest” candidate is a white man with appeal in the Upper Midwest. That assumption, I’ve suggested, is misguided, considering the importance of the votes of African Americans and women in the suburbs. Candidates who seem to leave those voters cold don’t seem all that electable."

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended Aug. 24, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.

Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations. The Labor Department said only claims for the Virgin Islands were estimated last week.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 500 to 214,500 last week.

Layoffs have remained low despite a protracted trade war between the United States and China, which is crimping economic growth by undercutting business investment and manufacturing.

But the pace of job growth has been slowing since 2018. The government estimated last week that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade.

According to economists at JPMorgan, this meant that job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. The government will publish the revised payrolls data next February.

Still, the pace of employment gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 jobs needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Sustained labor market strength is supporting the economy through strong consumer spending.

For now, that is helping to calm concerns of a recession, which were fanned by a sell-off on Wall Street and an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 22,000 to 1.70 million for the week ended Aug. 17. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dipped 250 to 1.70 million.

The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which August's unemployment rate will be calculated. The four-week average of continuing claims was little changed between the July and August survey periods, suggesting the jobless rate could hold steady at 3.7%.

"I've taught US government for 40 years. Thanks to Trump, I'm doubting the Founders' plan.",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Ross K. Baker', 'Opinion Columnist', 'Published A.M. Et Aug.']",08-30-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2019/08/30/donald-trump-makes-me-doubt-founders-checks-and-balances-column/2132691001/,"I now hesitate to defend the 'genius' of the Framers. I no longer have confidence in the checks and balances they said would keep us on track.

The day after Labor Day, I will stand behind a lectern in a lecture hall on the campus of Rutgers University and teach a course that I have taught for 40 years. I have always approached the first day eager to teach about the establishment of our republic and how government works today. In the past three years, the eagerness has curdled into apprehension as I debate with myself how even-handed I should be in dealing with a national government that I can no longer recognize, much less approve of.

It would be pointless for me and boring for the students to spend the semester assailing President Donald Trump for casting public service as contemptible with his unjustified disparagement of everyone from scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency to the chairman of the Federal Reserve. His contaminating influence has even spread beyond the executive branch to transform the United States Senate, an institution that I have long revered, into a pitiable amen corner that either assents to his most outrageous statements or passively cringes in silence.

Whom did they learn that from?: When one of my students grows up to be a moral adult, I'm shocked. And inspired.

I am now hesitant defending what I used to refer to as the “genius” of the framers of the Constitution because I no longer have confidence in the checks and balances that James Madison assured us were “auxiliary precautions” to prevent our government from going off the rails at times when the wisdom of the American people is faulty. The faultiness of that wisdom is, in my mind, on vivid display by the man they chose to lead the nation.

Serious flaws in the political system

It is hard for me now, in discussing the voting behavior of Americans, to grasp what kind of desperation prompted so many of my fellow citizens to choose and now enthusiastically support a man who has degraded the office of the presidency. How can American citizens in whom sovereignty resides have acted so irresponsibly? I will grant, however, that the alternative was not a good one. But that also speaks to serious flaws in the system.

I have searched for historical examples to reassure the students, and myself, that we have sometimes made poor choices in the men we have elected president, but that the damage that they inflicted on the country was slight and things turned out all right. I find it harder these days to use these historical examples, because they were part of a different time in which partisan strife was not so intractable and there were individuals who enjoyed universal respect to whom we could turn to help right the ship. Recently, people looked hopefully on the the prospect of William Barr as attorney general — another Elliot Richardson or William Ruckelshaus perhaps — only to see him mutate into a stooge for the president.

More distressing even than lacking good people to restore the nation such as in the aftermath of Watergate and Richard Nixon’s resignation has been the failure of those exiting the Trump administration to speak openly about the mismanagement, capriciousness and venality of the president and his entourage.

Many individuals who spoke privately about Trump’s ignorance and caprice, such as former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, slunk silently into retirement without getting on the record their obvious contempt for Trump. Even the vaunted truth-teller Defense Secretary James Mattis, whose departure was attributed to policy differences with the president, has not aired those differences so that the public could be able to evaluate whose version was the more credible.

Pulling my punches on Trump

Few of our past presidents were wholly conversant with constitutional law, but most seemed to be wary of the electrified wires of the system of separation of powers that defined limits they dared not transgress. Attributing to President Trump the most innocent interpretation of his abuses of power, such as the recent order to American companies to leave China, he has been exposed as a constitutional imbecile.

Just for the looks: My school's lockdown drills, active shooter training are security theater. Yours are, too.

More ominously, he is a man with dictatorial tendencies that exceed even of those past presidents most contemptuous of checks and balances. He has elevated the Second Amendment’s protection of gun ownership to a level above that of the First Amendment’s protection against the abridgment of a free press, and he tampers dangerously with the 14th Amendment’s clear message on birthright citizenship.

Ultimately, I will probably pull my punches because I don’t want to come across as a scold, and I will temper my words because I don’t want to give my students the idea that all is lost. It would be truly be the worst message of all.

"UGA SGA discusses new initiative, transportation concerns in cabinet meeting",https://www.redandblack.com,"['Megan Mittelhammer', 'Digital Producer', 'Sam Perez', 'Savannah Sicurella', 'Campus News Editor', 'Hunter Riggall', 'News Editor']",,,,https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-sga-discusses-new-initiative-transportation-concerns-in-cabinet-meeting/article_e43feb56-cad9-11e9-bd43-8f5744342772.html,"Transportation, homecoming court and public forum discussions were all on the docket for Tuesday night’s University of Georgia Student Government Association Executive Cabinet meeting.

SGA Vice President Melissa Hevener started off the meeting with a general explanation of Senate meetings.

“SGA recognizes Senate as an open public forum. That means technically any student can come and attend senate because we are being held accountable by the student body through that mechanism,” she said.

Hevener explained that it is the student body’s responsibility to come to SGA members and voice their concerns, but it is additionally the representatives' duty to respond to their needs.

Next on the docket were “housekeeping” topics, including homecoming court nominations and the First-Year Connect mentor program. SGA Executive Cabinet Chief of Staff Hayden Kolodziejcyk explained the details of what was expected.

Hevener discussed plans for The Georgia Way, a new initiative designed to create an honor code for the student body that will help “to ensure that we are holding ourselves to certain community standards that may not be enforceable.”

As an organization, SGA wants every member of the community to feel valued, Hevener said. Concerning The Georgia Way, members are responsible for “pushing out this idea that as a student body, we stand behind these ideals of respect, honesty and integrity.”

The Georgia Way will accumulate to a week of programming in November after an initial planning meeting for members in mid-September. SGA will be designing the creed in a way that is inclusive of the student body as a whole. In an effort to represent the campus, Heavener encouraged members to use their voices to interact with as many student organizations on campus as possible so students feel that their voices matter.

President Rachel Byers opened the floor to an open discussion where members had an opportunity to express concerns they have heard from other students around campus. The most pressing issue was transportation complications.

Specifically, students discussed the UGA bus system and its effectiveness. Many members weighed in on the issue of overcrowding at bus stops, especially at the East Campus Village stop.

Hevener addressed concerns and said she, along with Byers and SGA Treasurer Nav Singh, have already met with UGA Transportation and Parking Services to discuss the issue.

Hevener said the housing of first-year students in the University Village graduate apartments has led the university to anticipate overcrowding in East Campus residence halls. According to Hevener, alterations were made to the stops and bus routes to make the bus system more efficient.

Byers added that UGA TPS mentioned making a change to the bus stop by Ramsey Student Center. While she said that option had been discussed, no official plans have been announced.

SGA will hold an open forum discussion for all students to attend on Tuesday, Sept. 3. The meeting will be held at 7 p.m. in the Miller Learning Center."
David Koch’s spirit is alive and well in the White House cabinet,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1694132/david-kochs-spirit-lives-on-in-the-white-house-cabinet/,"David Koch was no friend of US president Donald Trump. The businessman and conservative icon, who died today at age 79, made little secret of his dislike of the president or his policies—his tariffs, the travel ban, and almost everything else about him.

So they surrounded him with their allies instead.

The sons of Koch Industries founder Fred Koch, David Koch and his brother Charles were born into extraordinary wealth. For decades, they used their billions to wield political influence, supporting a sprawling network of conservative nonprofits closely aligned with their mission—right-wing libertarianism. The crux of this, as Charles Koch once put it, was a desire for “economic freedom”—with as little power in the hands of centralized government as possible. In short, he wrote, “big governments are inherently inefficient and harmful.”

The brothers favor minimal government “intrusions,” encompassing conservative economic policies such as minimal taxation and free trade, as well as more liberal, anti-interventionist social policies. Many of their main areas of concern have closely aligned with Koch Industries’ business interests, ushering in candidates who deny climate change, were likely to promote fossil fuel use, and support environmental deregulation.

They did this through organizations like Americans for Prosperity, which supported the establishment of the Tea Party movement, while concealing the identities of other, more media-shy, conservative donors.

When it came to Trump, who rose to political power on the heels of the Tea Party movement, their enthusiasm was much more muted. But while they may not like Trump’s style, and have publicly refused to donate directly to Trump’s campaign, the brothers’ influence is apparent in the president’s choice of advisors, including official counselor Kellyanne Conway. The president’s cabinet remains a who’s-who of Koch affiliates. Their nearly $900 million budget for the 2016 election seems to have had the desired effect.

Koch may be dead, but many of his preferred political figures—and, by extension, his preferred policies—continue to thrive in the highest positions of power. Here’s how.

Vice President Mike Pence

During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-trusted Trump advisor and the high-powered arch-conservative Steve Bannon expressed concerns that a potential Pence president would be “a president that the Kochs would own.” This pretty much sums up the long-held loyal relationship between Pence and the Kochs, which dates back to his time as an Indiana congressman in the early 2000s. Though a channel for the their influence in the White House, Pence differs from David Koch in his anti-choice evangelical position.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry

The Koch brothers are above all petrochemical magnates, so there is arguably no cabinet position more important than energy secretary. Perry, who once studied animal husbandry and has in the past actually recommended abolishing the energy department, might not be the most qualified for the job. But he is an important representative of the Koch’s interests at the country’s most important table. A climate change denier, Perry has been pushing for more fossil fuel and has called attempts to replace them with renewables “immoral.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

Formerly nicknamed the “congressman from Koch,” Pompeo is a member of the Wichita, Kansas, business community—the Kochs’ home base. He made the jump into politics thanks almost entirely to the Kochs’ support. He has, in fact, received more money from the brothers than any other single individual. Pompeo has shown his gratitude toward his donors by favoring environmental deregulation on energy production, and by defending his benefactors in the public arena, including an op-ed unsubtly titled “Stop Harassing the Koch Brothers.”

Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross

The billionaire investor was a close personal friend of David Koch’s. He was photographed with the late financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein at a dinner party at his home in 2010. (Koch was among Epstein’s personal friends.) Ross and his wife later attended Koch’s 2016 holiday party.

Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao

Chao is the wife of Senate leader Mitch McConnell, and a regular guest at Koch donor events. As secretary of labor under US president George W. Bush, Chao spoke at the 2002 annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Koch Industries is a longtime member of ALEC’s corporate board. She was also a fellow of the Heritage Foundation, a think-tank closely tied to the Koch brothers’ political ambitions.

Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos

Trump appointed the billionaire and charter school advocate as education secretary in 2017. Her family has close ties to the Koch brothers’ political fundraising, donating millions in 2016 to super-PACs, including the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Action Fund. Devos is a regular attendee at the Kochs’ biannual donor meeting, and is a financial backer of Koch-affiliated groups such as Americans for Prosperity, and the George Mason University-based Mercatus Institute. In October 2018, the education secretary met privately with members of the Koch-funded group Youth Entrepreneurs at a Koch Industries office in Wichita, Kansas."
State Department says removal of 'Palestinian Territories' from website isn't policy change,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jennifer Hansler', 'Andrew Carey']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/politics/state-department-website-palestinian-territories/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department on Monday denied that the removal of a listing for the Palestinian Territories from its website constituted a change in policy.

""Website is being updated. There has been no change to our policy,"" a State Department official said in a statement. Asked whether the listing would be added back to the website, the official reiterated that the site is being updated.

It is unclear when exactly the listing for the territories, which was once included as one of the ""countries and other areas"" under the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, was removed. It was active until at least February 2019, according to an archived version of the page. The State Department unveiled its modernized website in June 2019, and the link for the Palestinian Territories now redirects to a message about that modernization.

""Welcome to state.gov. We recently modernized our website. Part of this modernization was to reduce the number of pages on the current state.gov website by not moving items that are in existence on our archive sites. This keeps the content on the current state.gov current while older content remains intact and fully accessible on our archive sites,"" the message says.

The omission of the Palestinian Territories drew outrage from Palestinian officials.

The Ho-Chunk Nation Executive Branch Aims to be single-use plastic and Styrofoam free in one year,https://www.weau.com,['Hayley Spitler'],,,,https://www.weau.com/content/news/The-Ho-Chunk-Nation-Executive-Branch-Aims-to-be-single-use-plastic-and-Styrofoam-free-in-one-year-558847741.html,"The Ho-Chunk Nation president, in Black River Falls, has signed a proclamation calling for a reduction of single-use plastics and Styrofoam throughout the executive branch.

President of the Ho-Chunk Nation Marlon WhiteEagle (on the left)

Marlon WhiteEagle, now in his 8th week as president, says his decision reflects the desire of the Ho-Chunk Nation.

""I'm paying close attention to what they're saying, how they feel, what's important to them,"" said WhiteEagle. ""I just want to carry their priorities forward... through the government.""

He believes there are several benefits to going Styrofoam and single-use plastic free.

""We're really kind of going in and looking to see how we can save money, but still be environmentally friendly,"" WhiteEagle said.

The Ho-Chunk Nation government is made up of four branches: the general counsel, the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary branch.

While the proclamation only affects the executive branch, WhiteEagle says he hopes it inspires other areas of the Nation to make a similar change.

""I'm hoping that through doing this, the other branches will fall in suit with us and if other tribes see it, that they would consider doing something similar,"" WhiteEagle said.

The goal is to not only inspire change throughout the Nation, but that this proclamation also helps the Ho-Chunk people leave the mark that they want to.

""We want to build a legacy that we're not so wasteful and harmful to the environment,"" said WhiteEagle. ""Any opportunity we have to help with the environment, whether its partnerships with local and county governments, state governments, federal government, we will look to those opportunities and jump on board.""

Each facility director or executive branch manager now has one month to put together a plan of how they can reduce it.

WhiteEagle hopes to have the branch Styrofoam and single-use plastic free in one year."
Italy inches toward new govt as Trump backs Conte's return as PM,https://www.reuters.com,"['Gavin Jones', 'Min Read']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-5star/italys-5-star-opposition-clash-over-potential-cabinet-roles-idUSKCN1VH0QT,"ROME (Reuters) - The two parties trying to form a new Italian government made progress toward a coalition deal on Tuesday, cheering financial markets as well as U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he hoped Giuseppe Conte would be reinstated as prime minister.

The role of Conte has been a sticking point in the negotiations between the 5-Star Movement, a member of the outgoing coalition, and the opposition Democratic Party (PD), which has been resisting his reappointment.

“Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Conte,” Trump said on Twitter. “A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister.”

After setbacks early on Tuesday the roller-coaster talks between the anti-establishment 5-Star and the center-left PD appeared to be back on track later in the day, with upbeat comments from both sides prompting a strong market rally.

Italian 10-year bond yields fell to three-year lows, and the spread between German Bunds narrowed to below 182 basis points, the tightest since May 2018.

Tensions persist and surprises are possible, however.

Late on Tuesday, a PD source said talks were still at risk of failure over the post of deputy prime minister, saying 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio was insisting on retaining that role in a new coalition despite strong opposition to this from the PD.

Even if a deal were struck, it would need to survive an online vote of 5-Star party members, the party said in a blog post. Many of its rank and file are hostile to the PD and have used social media to urge Di Maio against doing a deal.

Investors, though, are betting that Italy will avoid snap elections, fearing they would be won by Matteo Salvini’s hard-right League party, which would put Rome on a collision course with the European Union over expansionary government spending.

“Our work is continuing in a fruitful way,” the PD’s Senate leader Andrea Marcucci told reporters in brief comments after an evening meeting with 5-Star officials.

Deputy PD leader Paola De Micheli said the two sides had “analyzed points for the basis of a common program”, while 5-Star’s Senate chief Stefano Patuanelli reported a “good climate” and said contacts would continue on Wednesday.

The parties are due to report back to President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday from 1400 GMT. If no deal has been sealed he will name a caretaker government and call elections.

Conte, who belongs to no party but is close to 5-Star, resigned last week after League chief Salvini declared his 14-month coalition with 5-Star was dead, seeking to trigger elections and capitalize on his surging popularity.

The move has not gone to plan, as 5-Star and the PD seek to form a coalition of their own, pushing the League into opposition.

FIGHT OVER JOBS

Earlier on Tuesday the PD/5-Star talks seemed to have run into trouble, with the two sides fighting over key jobs as well as being at loggerheads over Conte’s role.

The PD accused 5-Star of undermining the formation of a new cabinet by demanding the interior ministry for Di Maio. 5-Star denied this, and the parties canceled a scheduled meeting.

The PD says Di Maio is insisting on keeping the role of deputy prime minister that he held in the outgoing government, something it considers unacceptable if Conte is to stay on as premier.

It remains to be seen if the exchanges are merely tactics to secure the upper hand in negotiations over cabinet jobs, or whether they have the potential to scupper an accord between the two parties which have always been bitter adversaries.

The picture is complicated by deep internal divisions in both parties, each one split between leadership factions that want a deal and others that would prefer to risk an election.

Di Maio was absent at the start of an evening meeting of all the 5-Star lawmakers. The great majority favors an accord with the PD rather than a snap election which would probably see many lose their seats less than 18 months into this parliament.

Meanwhile Salvini continues to demand elections, and is likely to be disappointed by Trump’s endorsement of Conte, especially as the populist League chief has always expressed his admiration for the U.S. president.

Opinion polls suggest the League has lost 3-7 percentage points since collapsing the government, though it remains easily the most popular party, followed by the PD and 5-Star."

Each restaurant has agreed to give 50% of all food and beverage sales from both lunch and dinner on Saturday to the hospital.

Milwaukee Kitchen Cabinet, a local partnership program between the Wisconsin Restaurant Association and the National Restaurant Association, is hosting the The Do Good With Food initiative.

“The Calderone Club and San Giorgio Pizzeria are extremely honored to be a part of the Do Good With Food initiative,” said Gino Fazzari, owner of both restaurants and Milwaukee Kitchen Cabinet board member. “We love working with Children’s and look forward to generating proceeds to support all of their amazing programs.”

Those who are unable to dine-in during the fundraiser can donate to the cause here.

“Behind every program Children’s delivers is the support we rely on from our donors and partners in the community, and the restaurants behind Do Good With Food are a great example of this,” said Meg Brzyski Nelson, president of Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin Foundation. “The money raised will help support all of the extra special things that help us wrap around families to ease and prevent the suffering of children.”

Buhari kept the petroleum portfolio for himself, as in his first term, and appointed Timipre Silva as the junior minister, who is widely expected to manage the portfolio on a day-to-day basis.

Silva, a former governor of Bayelsa state in the southern Niger Delta oil production heartlands, replaces former ExxonMobil executive Emmanuel Kachikwu who was the country’s main representative at OPEC meetings.

Nigeria, which has Africa’s biggest economy, remains heavily reliant on crude oil sales despite efforts by Buhari to boost non-oil revenues since he first took office in 2015. Oil receipts account for about 90% of foreign exchange and low oil prices helped to push the country into recession in 2016.

The move to assign portfolios comes six months after Buhari won a presidential election and nearly three months after his second term began. The time taken to appoint ministers caused jitters amongst investors and threatened growth prospects.

Zainab Ahmed, who became finance minister in September last year after her predecessor resigned, retained the position with additional responsibilities for the budget and national planning.

The cabinet of 43 ministers faces a long list of challenges including tepid growth following Nigeria’s emergence from recession in 2017, high unemployment and galloping inflation that has hit the poorest people in a nation of 190 million people, most of whom live on less than $2 a day.

And security forces have been stretched as they try to tackle Islamists waging a decade-long insurgency in the northeast, banditry in the northwest and clashes between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities over dwindling arable land in central states.

“The core objectives of this administration are to improve security, achieve diversified, inclusive economic growth and fight corruption,” Buhari told his cabinet at the swearing in ceremony.

The ministry of power, housing and works - created to address challenges related to the country’s ailing electricity and transport infrastructure when Buhari first took office in 2015 - was broken up.

Babatunde Fashola, a former governor of commercial hub Lagos state who headed that super ministry in the first term, was named minister for housing and works.

Sale Mamman, a businessman and former ministry of works official, was given the power portfolio. His task will be to tackle a poor electricity supply that holds back everything from manufacturing to education, while addressing spiraling debts that have crippled the power sector and held back investment.

“We have seen an exodus of the more capable and technocratic ministers and in their place there are politically connected replacements,” said Malte Liewerscheidt, vice president at Teneo Intelligence.

He said some of the new entrants were stalwarts in Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party, who appear to have been rewarded for helping him to win February’s election, while others were part of a bid to solidify the party’s base in some parts of the country ahead of elections in 2023.

“There are no real surprises here. The potential for positive change is rather limited,” said Liewerscheidt."

Peter Jozef Cesnik, the Minister for Slovenians Abroad, told reporters the cabinet had approved the move given the widespread lack of water, electricity and medicines in Venezuela.

His ministry said about 1,000 people of Slovenian origin live in Venezuela of which around 100 were expected to ask for resettlement in Slovenia. The government expects to spend at least 200,000 euros ($222,880.00) for the process this year.

""(This) repatriation is...mostly a logistical and integration challenge. We need to ensure a safe exit from the crisis area and establish acceptable conditions for life in Slovenia,"" the ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters.

Slovenia is a small euro zone country in southeastern Europe which borders on Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia.

President Trump may think he’s keeping Chinese negotiators guessing with his whiplash-inducing remarks about the U.S.-China trade war.

But he’s not fooling anyone here.

More than a year into the deepening commercial conflict, Chinese officials and analysts say they’ve got a handle on the tweeter-in-chief and are no longer fazed by his unpredictable initiatives.

“There is a lot of fatigue with President Trump’s ‘art of the deal,’ ” said Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization and an adviser to China’s cabinet.

“It’s like a roller coaster. Buenos Aires, Osaka, Shanghai. He says one thing one day, then hits the world with a surprise the next day,” Wang said, referring to the sites of high-level, if ill-fated, negotiating sessions. “The more they deal with him, the more they figure him out.”

At the Group of Seven leaders’ summit in Biarritz, France, this weekend, Trump brushed aside complaints that his habit of swerving between tough talk and a salesman’s hype was damaging the global economy.

“Sorry! It’s the way I negotiate,” he told reporters Monday. “It’s done very well for me over the years. It’s doing very well for the country.”

It hasn’t, however, produced a deal that would commit China to make the structural changes in its state-led economy that the administration has been seeking for more than a year.

Trump has announced tariffs that by Dec. 15 will cover almost 97 percent of the Chinese merchandise that American companies import, according to economist Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

By depressing demand for Chinese goods, U.S. tariffs have cost 3 million Chinese factory workers their jobs, according to Trump, and put pressure on Chinese President Xi Jinping to make a deal.

Trump’s claim to have the upper hand at the negotiating table does not appear to have convinced the Chinese.

“They’ve decided Trump is a vacillating guy who can’t figure out what he wants and gets spooked every time the stock market goes down or someone accuses him of not being tough,” said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy in Beijing. “Although there are problems in China, they believe they have their economy under control, more so than Trump. They think he is more vulnerable to a slowdown and that they can afford to wait him out.”

By early May, the two sides had completed 90 percent of a deal involving major Chinese purchases of American farm, industrial and energy products as well as enhanced protections for foreign companies’ technology and trade secrets, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this summer.

But the trade war between the world’s economic superpowers appears to have entered a dangerous new phase this month, with new rounds of retaliatory tariffs and a demand from Trump that U.S. companies stop doing business with China.

That has caused alarm across the globe, with fears that the war could help tip leading economies such as Japan and Germany into recession and create new head winds for the American economy. China’s growth rate has, meanwhile, slowed to its lowest rate in three decades.

Chinese officials were initially mystified by Trump’s unconventional style, and Xi is said to have faced criticism for underestimating Trump’s resolve to tackle China’s trading practices.

But emerging last week from this year’s Communist Party confab at the beach resort of Beidaihe, China’s leadership appears to have decided to hunker down.

“What’s the point of calling Xi Jinping ‘a good friend’ and ‘a great leader’ but still increasing tariffs?” asked Yao Xinchao, a trade professor at the University of International Business and Economics. “He’s a 70-ish-year-old man but speaks like a 7-year-old kid. We just can’t listen to what he says now. I think Chinese leaders have realized this, too.”

Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at the Renmin University, shares a similarly disdainful view. “He is a real estate developer; he is a profiteer in the eyes of the Chinese people,” he said.

But the bottom line remains that China, which is experiencing a marked economic slowdown, wants a deal.

“The trade dispute between China and the U.S. should be resolved through dialogue and consultations,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday, adding that the United States’s “maximum-pressure approach hurts both sides and is not in the least constructive.”

“We hope that the U.S. can exercise restraint, return to reason, and demonstrate sincerity in order to facilitate further consultations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefits,” Geng said.

The question now is how the two sides find a way out of the standoff.

Wei Jianguo, a former vice minister of commerce, said Trump’s efforts to browbeat countries such as Canada, Mexico and Japan into making a deal will not work with China.

“We have seen and understand Trump’s style,” Wei said. “If he thinks he can secure an advantage for the U.S. and wear China down by exerting various kinds of extreme pressure, he’s dreaming. It’s impossible.”

[With the U.S.-China trade war escalating, Trump arrives at G-7 with a list of grievances ]

The longer this pattern continues, the more China becomes concerned that any deal won’t stick.

“Now China understands him thoroughly and knows that inconsistency is his nature,” said Wang, of Renmin University. “Even if an agreement is signed, he may not implement it well. But, without an agreement, he does this over and over again, which is also very annoying.”

Many analysts expect the dispute to continue to at least November, when the two leaders are likely to meet at a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Chile.

Xi, meanwhile, confronts domestic political challenges that likely reduce his willingness to make concessions under foreign pressure. The authorities in Beijing face a growing crisis in Hong Kong, where protests aimed at preserving the city’s special status continue, and are preoccupied by preparations to celebrate in early October the politically charged 70th anniversary of the Communist Party’s takeover of China.

The two hosts discussed Cuomo's interview with Kayleigh McEnany during the hand-off from Cuomo's show to Lemon's on Wednesday night. The interview occurred earlier on his show and it featured a heated back and forth after McEnany claimed that the president has not lied to the American people once.

Lemon began by claiming that Trump has lied 48 times during the last six days, and held up printed papers to make his point.

“She has no credibility, Chris,” Lemon chided. “Someone like that has no credibility, look, put whoever you want on your show. This isn’t chastising you, but the audience gets nothing from her because she doesn’t tell the truth.”

Cuomo defended the appearance arguing that “you have to know what they’ll bring your way.”

“What you heard from Kayleigh McEnany is the campaign pitch of the election,” Cuomo rebutted. “That’s what they’ll be up against. If they’re not ready to take it on. If they don’t hear it and don’t understand how many people receive it, they’re gonna wind up in the same position they are now for another four years.”

Lemon proceeded to list claims from the president that he said were false including ""people who were cheering in New Jersey after 9/11"" or when ""President Barack Obama was not born in the United States."""

During a regular daily news briefing, in which he usually expounds on everything from history and economics to culture, Lopez Obrador said the device had been found in a room used for meetings in the National Palace, his headquarters.

“Just imagine, they’ve been recording us in a meeting room, here in the Palace,” the president said as he reflected on the importance of free speech and transparency.

Lopez Obrador, who didn’t provide details on the camera or how it came to be there, said he had no secrets.

“What we talk about is completely legal, transparent, and there’s nothing that could be used against us,” he said.

During the presidential campaign last year, Lopez Obrador said he and his family were the victims of spying. Upon taking office in December, he put an end to the former national intelligence agency CISEN, giving the body a new name.

Lopez Obrador has accused previous governments of lacking transparency and suppressing dissent. He frequently blames negative reports about his administration on efforts by unnamed “adversaries” and “conservatives” to thwart his agenda.

The administration of his predecessor, Enrique Pena Nieto, faced persistent criticism over alleged surveillance by the state, and numerous reports were published of journalists, NGO workers and opposition politicians being snooped upon.

"U.S. emoluments clauses are the real ‘America First’ policy, but Trump ignores them",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Jamie Raskin', 'A Democrat', 'Represents Maryland S District In The U.S. House Of Representatives', 'Serves On The Judiciary', 'Oversight Committees. He Is An Emeritus Professor Of Constitutional Law At American University S Washington College Of Law.']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/28/whats-trumps-idea-america-first-g-cash-flowing-his-golf-resort/,"But if the public has grown wearily conditioned to expect Trump’s use of the government as an instrument of self-enrichment, we should also remember that the framers of the U.S. Constitution foresaw the potential for this kind of abuse of public office for private gain and did everything in their power to prevent it.

Alexander Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 72, warned that a day might come when a president treated the government as a get-rich-quick opportunity: “An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed, would feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such a man, to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted.”

Trump is getting payments from foreign governments. We have no idea what they are.

The framers wrote the foreign emoluments clause — the original and true “America First” policy — in Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution, to prevent the president and other federal officials from accepting, without congressional consent, “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” And they wrote the domestic emoluments clause in Article II, Section 1, Clause 7, which authorizes a fixed presidential salary that may be neither increased nor reduced by Congress during a president’s term, and which specifies that the president “shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.”

A G-7 summit at Trump Doral would violate both clauses, as it would mean huge payments to a Trump resort from both foreign government guests attending and participating federal agencies.

Trump’s ongoing use of the presidency as a for-profit enterprise contrasts sharply with the understanding of his predecessors. Take, for example, one of Trump’s heroes, President Andrew Jackson, one model for Trump’s vindictive brand of nationalism. When the government of Colombia presented Jackson with a ceremonial gold medallion, he described the gift as “most gratifying,” but understood that he could not keep it without congressional consent and promptly turned it over to Congress, which directed him to deposit it with the State Department.

In 1840, President Martin Van Buren reported a gift from the imam of Muscat (later Oman) of two Arabian horses and saddles, four cashmere shawls, a case of rose oil, a Persian carpet and a box of pearls; Congress made him deposit these objects with the National Institute Gallery and sell the horses. President Abraham Lincoln took care to disclose gifts of two elephant tusks and a sword from the king of Siam (later Thailand), which Congress directed him to deposit with the Interior Department.

These presidents joined all the others in internalizing the basic logic of the foreign emoluments clause: that in a nation that fought a revolution to break free of foreign domination by monarchical power, and whose Constitution commits us to the sovereignty of “We the People,” our elected officials are prohibited from pocketing payments, big or small, of any kind, from foreign rulers seeking political influence and leverage with our government.

It is only Trump — the president who dusted off “America First,” the mantra of anti-Semites and isolationists in the 20th century, and redeployed it for immigrant-bashing and impetuous trade wars in the 21st — who refuses to accept the honest-to-goodness America-first policy spelled out in our Constitution by American revolutionaries in the 18th. He has reaped hundreds of thousands, if not millions, from foreign governments patronizing his properties. Yet he has never asked for Congress’s consent for any of it, as the Constitution requires.

Congress isn’t just a co-equal branch. We’re first among equals.

The framers wanted to guarantee that the president would conduct government business with undivided loyalty to the American people and only in pursuit of the national good. And it is Congress’s prerogative to decide that a particular gift or payment poses no threat of corruption, and to allow it. (If Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen sent Trump a book about the history of Greenland, I might be persuaded to vote to let him keep it.) But that choice, in all cases, belongs to the representatives of the people, not the president — as James Madison insisted in the Federalist No. 10, “No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.”

Since taking office, Trump has continuously pocketed large sums of money, not mere trinkets, including from foreign states and monarchs. Ever since his inauguration, when he chose not to divest himself of his business interests and the Trump Organization hired a “director of diplomatic sales” to recruit foreign government contracts for its hotels, dignitaries have been spending freely at Trump properties. Foreign governments have also handed out lucrative regulatory benefits to Trump business entities abroad. In 2017, the Associated Press reported that the Chinese government “granted preliminary approval for 38 new Trump trademarks” shortly after Trump was inaugurated.

According to one report, when an organization linked to Saudi Arabian lobbying interests spent about $270,000 at the Trump hotel in Washington early in his administration, Trump didn’t report it. In 2018, a delegation accompanying Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stayed at the Trump International Hotel in New York City, and the hotel’s quarterly revenue got a sudden boost. There’s no official accounting of these payments, but Trump’s 2015 campaign remark is instructive: “Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them?”

The game was rigged in Ivanka Trump’s favor. How did her brand manage to fail?

Given human nature, I doubt Hamilton would have been surprised at all by Trump’s subsequent determination to aggressively resist the U.S. intelligence community’s finding, and all the supporting evidence, that Salman was almost certainly involved in the brutal assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Paradoxically, it’s almost certain that Trump knows he’s violating the Constitution because he has essentially admitted it. He gave away the game when the Trump Organization sent checks this year and last, totaling about $343,000, to disgorge what are described as profits from foreign government spending at Trump hotels.

He clearly seeks our absolution in return for this honor-system emolument rebate to the government, but it all amounts to sleight of hand: The Constitution doesn’t prevent the president only from taking profits from foreign government payments, it prevents him from taking any foreign government payments unless he obtains Congress’s consent first. He has not obtained congressional permission to keep either the net profits or the gross proceeds collected from various governments that have paid for Trump hotel stays and thrown parties at his clubs and restaurants. Nor has he accounted for what he has received and from whom, an act of omission that advertises his contempt for Congress and keeps us in the dark about the extent of his moneymaking while he’s clocked in as president. As Reuters recently reported, “The governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Thailand and the European Union got the green light” from the State Department “to rent a combined eight units in Trump World Tower and followed through with leases” without congressional approval.

The president’s lawyers say the emoluments clause applies only to gifts or compensation in exchange for official acts, not to private business transactions, arguing that the clause “is not a blanket prohibition on commercial transactions with foreign governments by businesses in which the official has a financial interest.” But this pinched interpretation clashes with the text of the Constitution, executive branch norms and judicial analysis. In a 1993 opinion, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel emphasized that “the language of the emoluments clause is both sweeping and unqualified,” and cited a 1970 Government Accountability Office decision that stated that the Constitution’s drafters “intended the prohibition” on accepting emoluments “to have the broadest possible scope and applicability.” In an April opinion, Federal Judge Emmet G. Sullivan analyzed the “text, structure, adoption, historical interpretation, and purpose of the Clause, as well as Executive Branch practice,” and rejected the claim that it does not apply to business payments to the president.

The issue, in any event, is the president’s appalling self-dealing. And it is Congress, which has ultimate authority over emoluments, and which must act to redeem and restore the constitutional design. The framers sought to sweep away the corruption inherent in monarchy and feudalism, systems of personal privilege for the few and inequality for the many. The same section of Article I containing the foreign emoluments clause provides that the United States shall grant “No Title of Nobility.” We have no royals here, and our elected officials must always remain the faithful servants of the people, not the agents of tyrants from nations still hungry for their own democratic revolutions; nor should elected officials, including and especially the president, use their position to line their own pockets with foreign tribute or taxpayer money. The framers gave us the America-first policy we need. Trump is shredding it."
Nadler to probe Trump's G-7 resort pitch,https://thehill.com,[],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/459187-nadler-to-probe-trump-proposal-to-host-2020-g-7-summit-at-trump-owned-property,"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler Jerrold (Jerry) Lewis NadlerHouse Democrats blur lines on support for impeachment Poll: Majority wants Trump out, but not through impeachment Second Democrat representing Trump district backs impeachment MORE (D-N.Y.) announced Wednesday his panel will broaden its investigation into President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump to host Kuwait's leader at White House in September West Virginia governor poll: Manchin leads GOP incumbent Justice by 10 points US service member killed in combat in Afghanistan MORE to include his proposal to hold the 2020 Group of Seven (G-7) summit at one of his family-owned properties in Florida.

Nadler said the president's pitch to host next year's meeting of world leaders at Trump National Doral Miami is ""only the latest in a troubling pattern of corruption and self-dealing by the President"" and may violate both the foreign and domestic Emoluments Clauses.

""The President’s personal financial interests are clearly shaping decisions about official U.S. government activities, and this is precisely the type of risk that the Constitution’s Emoluments Clauses were intended to prevent,"" Nadler said in a statement.

""More importantly, the Doral decision reflects perhaps the first publicly known instance in which foreign governments would be required to pay President Trump’s private businesses in order to conduct business with the United States,"" Nadler added.

Trump has publicly defended his resort as top contender for the next G-7 meeting, calling it a “natural” location because of its proximity to a major airport.

“Doral happens to be within Miami. It’s a city, it’s a wonderful place. It’s a very, very successful area of Florida,"" Trump told reporters at a press conference Monday at the conclusion of this year's G-7 summit, held in Biarritz, France. ""It’s very importantly only five minutes from the airport – the airport is right next door. It’s a big international airport, one of the biggest in the world.""

The president has insisted he was not trying to boost his own properties.

""With Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings, we call them bungalows, they each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views. We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants, it's like such a natural,"" Trump said. ""Each country can have their own villa or their own bungalow, and they have a lot of units in them, so I think it just works out well.""

The Emoluments Clause bars presidents from accepting gifts or other benefits from foreign and domestic governments without congressional approval.

Foreign and domestic government officials have frequently stayed at Trump-owned hotels and properties, prompting critics to argue Trump is benefitting financially from his role as president while in office.

Nadler, who is already leading a sprawling investigation examining allegations of obstruction of justice, public corruption and other abuses of power, said the Doral probe would be wrapped into the broader one.

""The Constitution demands that President Trump’s private interests and official conduct remain separate, and this latest announcement demands scrutiny by Congress,"" Nadler said.

""Potential violations of the Foreign and Domestic Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution are of significant interest and grave concern to the Committee as it considers whether to recommend articles of impeachment,"" he added. ""The Committee will broaden its ongoing investigation to include these latest revelations and will take further investigative steps, including scheduling hearings and requesting additional documents from the White House.""

Nadler's announcement comes as the White House has blocked both current and former officials from testifying before congressional committees, arguing that under the standard of immunity, confidentiality protections offered to the executive branch apply to current and former aides, effectively preventing them from disclosing what took place during their time in the administration.

The White House would likely follow a similar track if Nadler sought to subpoena administration officials over his property proposal."
