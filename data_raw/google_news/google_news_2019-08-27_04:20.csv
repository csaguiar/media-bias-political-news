"‘Sorry, it’s the way I negotiate’: Trump confounds the world at wild G-7",https://www.politico.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/26/donald-trump-g7-summit-confounds-1475891,"President Donald Trump at times sought to placate allies with assurances he would work with them to broker trade deals or find areas of compromise despite firmly established differences. | Jeff J Mitchell - Pool/Getty Images Foreign Policy ‘Sorry, it’s the way I negotiate’: Trump confounds the world at wild G-7 The president managed a G-7 summit his way — unwilling to commit to clear stances and declining to be boxed in by anyone.

BIARRITZ, France — The divisions were laid bare on the first day, when President Donald Trump insisted to U.S. allies at an opening dinner for the G-7 summit that Russia belongs back in the elite group of leading nations and then bluntly informed his French counterpart they do not see eye-to-eye on Iran.

But by the end of Day Three, Trump was having a kumbaya moment in public. “There’s been no fights or arguments. No anything. There’s been great unity here. The papers haven’t reported how great it’s been,” he told reporters at his midday meeting Monday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Story Continued Below

That was the pattern Trump followed for most of his three-day visit to southwestern France, where only the coastal winds rivaled the breakneck pace of vague and vacillating statements on pressing issues including North Korea, Iran, the environment and trade. The president at times sought to placate allies with assurances that he would work with them to broker trade deals or find areas of compromise despite firmly established differences.

It was typical Trump on display on the world stage, refusing to be boxed in by anyone on anything. The president’s meandering statements and conflicting remarks left aides and allies alike guessing at his intended course of action — and his critics reviving questions about his fitness for office.

“Sorry, it’s the way I negotiate,” Trump shot back at a reporter during Monday’s press conference when questioned about whether there’s an actual strategy behind his constant back-and-forth on his positions regarding trade with China.

“It has done very well for me over the years,” Trump said. “It’s doing even better for the country.”

The G-7 followed a week in which the president flip-flopped positions — often within a day — on China tariffs, gun restrictions, purchasing Greenland, tax cuts to fight a potential recession and more. The uncertainty flowing from the president triggered tremors in markets and questions from politicians and business executives about where the president seemed to be taking the world’s largest economy.

Earlier in the day, Trump had showered Chinese President Xi Jinping with praise, calling him “a great leader” and declaring that he and Beijing were ready — and eager — to return to the negotiating table. But less than 24 hours prior, Trump aides were forced to do damage control after he publicly suggested he may be having second thoughts on his tariff war China.

He only meant that he regretted “not raising the tariffs higher,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham later said.

From China and Iran to climate change and North Korea’s weapons testing, Trump spent the summit dancing between positions that endeared himself to his fellow leaders and positions that faithfully represented his “America First” approach — leaving observers to wonder whether he was keeping his options open, or simply making decisions on the fly without advance planning.

Never was the dithering more evident than during Trump’s interactions with French President Emmanuel Macron. The host of this year’s summit has positioned himself as a champion of multilateralism, offering a sharp contrast to Trump’s economic nationalism and scorn for global coordination.

In a move that angered some White House officials, Macron swept Trump off to lunch within an hour of his arrival in Biarritz, telling reporters before the pair was left to dine alone that their agenda for the weekend included topics like climate change, gender equality and the raging Amazon wildfires.

Administration officials, who complained that the president was cornered by his French counterpart, were caught off guard when Trump tweeted afterward that his lunch with Macron was “the best meeting we have had yet.”

“Progress being made!” he wrote.

But two days later, Trump skipped a working session on climate change — an issue some of his advisers had described as too “niche” for the G-7, a group whose original mission was to address pressing economic concerns. And when the president was asked hours later to share his views on climate change, his response couldn’t have put more daylight between him and Macron.

“I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth, the wealth is under its feet … I’m not going to lose that wealth on dreams, on windmills, which, frankly, aren’t working too well,” Trump said.

In a similar fashion, Trump told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe he understood his concerns about North Korea’s latest short-term missile launches. “I’m not happy about it,” Trump said, sitting next to Abe in a bilateral meeting on Sunday.

The next day, however, when he and Macron fielded questions from French and American reporters, Trump returned to his flattery of the North Korean leader, who he’s met twice. ”Kim Jong Un, who I’ve gotten to know extremely well … he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential,” Trump said.

He continued, “I think that North Korea has tremendous economic potential and I think that Kim Jong Un sees that he would be the leader and I think he sees the tremendous potential that it’s got.”

Even with the looming threat of a potential reversal, sometimes Trump’s charm offensive worked.

“On the digital tax, we have reached a deal to get beyond the difficulties we had between us,” Macron said Monday, referring to a revenue-based tax on tech giants that had infuriated administration officials.

And later Monday evening, French officials released a joint declaration on trade, Iran, Ukraine, Libya and Hong Kong — a document that seemed out of the question at the beginning of the summit, when French and U.S. officials offered conflicting accounts of why Macron had scrapped the joint communiqué that usually accompanies these gatherings.

“The G-7 organized in Biarritz by France was able to successfully reach agreements on several points,” read a translated version of the declaration.

Trump will face another test on the foreign stage within the next week, when he travels to Warsaw, Poland, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II.

Some of the G-7 leaders who were in Biarritz — heads of state whom the president irritated and complimented, often simultaneously — are also expected at the events, increasing the risk that Trump could perhaps undo some of the “progress” he so frequently touted while in France."

Varney: Trump 'dominated' the G-7 summit 'like no other president has done in years',https://www.foxnews.com,"['Fox News Staff', 'This Article Was Written Fox News Staff.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/varney-trump-at-g7-meeting-dominated-the-meeting-like-no-other-president-has-done-in-years,"Fox Business Network's Stuart Varney has a message for Americans, after a deluge of criticism of President Trump's performance at the G-7 meetings in France.

""No matter what you read and hear from the media, this G-7 was all about Trump re-aligning the world -- reshaping the world economy with America's interests first and foremost,"" said Varney on Fox Nation's ""My Take.""

CHINA ANNOUNCES IT SEEKS 'CALM' END TO TRADE WAR, AS MARKETS TANK AND CURRENCY HITS 11-YEAR FLATLINE

After President Trump's news conference, at the conclusion of the summit on Monday, CNN's Jim Acosta said, ""I think perhaps one of the biggest headlines coming out of this press conference that we just witnessed here in France is that the President would not be pinned down on this question of climate change.""

Varney said that analysis misses the point. ""Trade was the headline issue ... A deal with Japan -- they will import a lot more of our agricultural product. Britain gets a major trade deal after Brexit, and there's dialogue with Germany on car tariffs as well, but the most important -- China,"" stressed Varney.

At the press conference Monday, President Trump said, “China wants to make a deal. And I tell this to President Xi [Jinping] who I really respect ... I told him very strongly, I said 'Look, you’re making $500 billion a year and stealing our intellectual property…We can’t make a 50-50 deal ... If it’s not better, I don’t want to do business.”

WHITE HOUSE: TRUMP'S 'SECOND THOUGHTS' ON CHINA TRADE WAR 'GREATLY MISINTERPRETED'

Varney believes that it is time for America's European allies to get on board with the President's agenda. ""Europeans are frankly scared of America. Their economies are sinking. They've entered the fantasy land of negative interest rates. Their money is pouring over here, and they just don't know what to do. My advice -- jump on the Trump train and quit whining about Iran and climate change,"" advised Varney.

Opinion | My Final Break With the Trump State Department,https://www.nytimes.com,['Bethany Milton'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/opinion/trump-state-department.html,"When President Trump allowed a crowd to chant “Send her back!” about a sitting member of Congress — espousing an ideology in which naturalized American citizens, at least those who don’t fit a certain profile, are held to different and dangerous standards — he wasn’t thinking about me. He’s rarely thinking about me, the white American-born daughter of two American-born citizens.

But he is often thinking and talking about at least some of the tens of thousands of people I’ve helped immigrate to the United States — legally and permissibly — over my 11 years as a consular officer in the Foreign Service. From 2014 to 2016, I oversaw immigrant visa processing at the U.S. Consulate General in Mumbai, India. Every day, my team and I saw dozens of families destined to move to the United States as green card holders: older parents going to spend their final years surrounded by grandchildren, spouses matched up through online matrimonial sites, parents with kids in tow who had been waiting patiently since the early 1990s for their chance to join a sibling.

I also oversaw immigrant visa operations in Kigali, Rwanda, from 2018 to 2019, helping Rwandans and Congolese reunite with family members in the United States. Their stories often had a darker tone: marriages brokered in refugee camps, siblings separated by war, children born of rape. But the one thing that united almost every visa applicant I ever saw was the belief that life was going to be better in America. What a rude surprise, then, for them to face elected national leadership that targets them in such gruesome ways.

When a diplomat joins the State Department, she sits through two presentations toward the end of her weekslong orientation class. One is an afternoon session about the State Department’s storied dissent channel, which lets employees speak out internally about foreign policy decisions free from the fear of retaliation. How to use it, when to use it, what it means. The other is a much shorter presentation, one that lasts all of 15 seconds: “The day you can no longer publicly support your administration’s policies is the day you need to resign.”"
Justice Dept. could be nearing decision on whether to charge Andrew McCabe,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department', 'August At Pm', ""Matt Zapotosky Covers The Justice Department For The Washington Post'S National Security Team. He Has Previously Worked Covering The Federal Courthouse In Alexandria"", ""Local Law Enforcement In Prince George'S County"", 'Southern Maryland.']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-dept-could-be-nearing-decision-on-whether-to-charge-andrew-mccabe/2019/08/26/0e1a636c-c840-11e9-a1fe-ca46e8d573c0_story.html,"The legal team for Andrew McCabe met last week with the No. 2 official at the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, a person familiar with the matter said, suggesting that a decision could be close on whether the FBI’s former acting director will face criminal charges on allegations that he lied to investigators.

McCabe’s team met for more than an hourwith U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu and, separately, with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, the person said. Meetings with such high-level law enforcement officials typically come near the end of criminal investigations, affording defense attorneys a chance to make their last pitch on why their client should not be charged.

Spokesmen for McCabe and the Justice Department declined to comment. The person familiar with the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. The development was first reported Monday by the New York Times.

Federal prosecutors have been weighing for well over a year whether to charge McCabe, after the Justice Department’s inspector general alleged that McCabe had misled investigators several times about a media disclosure regarding the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s family foundation.

[Inspector general report faults McCabe for unauthorized disclosure of information, misleading investigators]

By the inspector general’s telling, McCabe approved the disclosure and later — when asked about the matter by investigators with the FBI’s inspection division and inspector general’s office — denied having done so. McCabe’s attorney has said previously that his statements “are more properly understood as the result of misunderstanding, miscommunication, and honest failures of recollection based on the swirl of events around him.” Lying to investigators is a federal crime.

McCabe, the FBI’s No. 2 official who was elevated to lead the bureau after President Trump fired James B. Comey as director in May 2017, has become a lightning rod for the political battles surrounding the bureau’s recent work. He authorized the FBI to begin investigating Trump after Comey’s firing, and he became a frequent target of the president’s criticism.

In March 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired Mc­Cabe, citing the inspector general’s findings. But McCabe alleged that the move — which came just hours before he could retire and collect full benefits — was politically motivated. He later wrote a book airing unflattering details of his interactions with Trump and Sessions, and earlier this month, he sued over his removal. CNN, another frequent Trump target, recently announced it had hired McCabe as a contributor.

[Andrew McCabe, Trump’s foil at the FBI, is fired hours before he could retire]

All the while, the U.S. attorney’s office for the District has continued to examine McCabe, its work evolving from a referral by the Justice Department inspector general’s office into a full-fledged grand jury investigation .

It remains unclear whether McCabe will be charged — although the recent meeting shows that the case is alive. Trump supporters probably would be dismayed to see the Justice Department pass on the case, particularly because there were Trump allies who pleaded guilty to lying as part of then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s probe. Charges against McCabe, on the other hand, could spark allegations from the left that he is being retaliated against for authorizing the investigation into Trump."
Ex-White House Aide Rob Porter Is Subpoenaed in House Impeachment Inquiry,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Julie Hirschfeld Davis', 'Maggie Haberman']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/us/politics/rob-porter-judiciary-subpoena.html,"WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee on Monday subpoenaed the former top White House aide Rob Porter to testify about President Trump’s efforts to impede the Russia investigation and asked a court to expedite a ruling on whether Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, must testify, pushing forward in its expansive inquiry into whether to impeach Mr. Trump.

The moves are the latest intensification of a multipronged effort by the Democrat-led House to explore Mr. Trump’s conduct in office with an eye toward determining if he obstructed justice and committed impeachable offenses. They unfolded as a growing chorus of Democratic lawmakers have come out over the past several weeks in favor of impeachment, and as the party’s progressive base clamors for more aggressive action in the face of insistence by Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the move is premature.

Mr. Porter was a key witness to Mr. Trump’s repeated attempts to thwart the special counsel’s investigation, including the president’s efforts to get Mr. McGahn to falsely deny a New York Times article that revealed his order to fire the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.

The Judiciary Committee went to court this month to enforce its subpoena of Mr. McGahn after the Trump administration asserted that top presidential aides were “absolutely immune” from its subpoenas. In its legal filing on Monday, lawyers for the House argued that the former White House counsel was the “most critical fact witness” in the committee’s examination of whether the president obstructed justice, including when he instructed Mr. McGahn to remove Mr. Mueller and then to lie about whether the president had done so, and later, to issue a statement lying publicly about it."
Lisa Page could save Andrew McCabe from DOJ criminal charges,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lisa-page-could-save-andrew-mccabe-from-doj-criminal-charges,"Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page could hinder a criminal case against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe if the Justice Department decides to bring charges against him.

Federal prosecutors are close to making a final decision on whether to indict McCabe, who is accused of lying to federal agents, the New York Times reported Monday.

McCabe’s lawyers met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who will help make the call on whether to prosecute, and U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu in two separate meetings last week. This signals McCabe’s lawyers could be making a last-ditch effort to convince the top law enforcement officials not to prosecute the case.

If they were to bring charges against McCabe, prosecutors would have to prove he knowingly and intentionally lied to investigators when he told them on two occasions that he did not remember authorizing Page to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter. McCabe corrected himself at a later time.

Page, who worked as a special counsel to McCabe, told a grand jury in Washington, D.C., that McCabe was authorized in his position as deputy director to give information to the media and had no motive to lie. Page resigned from the bureau last year after it was discovered she had exchanged anti-Trump text messages with former FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she had an affair.

Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018, less than two days before he was set to retire. This followed Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s inspector general, releasing a report in February 2018 detailing instances where McCabe “lacked candor” with then-FBI Director James Comey and investigators and concluded McCabe greenlit disclosures to the media of sensitive information on an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation “to make himself look good.”

McCabe's lawyers called the inspector general's report ""deeply flawed.""

Comey has said he did not give McCabe permission to leak, and when Sessions fired McCabe he stated the deputy director “made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions.”

McCabe, who was hired by CNN last week, sued in August, accusing Trump of forcing his subordinates at the Justice Department to participate in an “unconstitutional plan and scheme” to have him fired, and is demanding back pay, his full pension, and for his record to be expunged. Trump has accused McCabe, who authorized the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, of being involved in an ""illegal and treasonous"" plot against him.

Neither DOJ nor McCabe’s attorney immediately responded to the Washington Examiner’s requests for comment.

The investigation into McCabe has been lengthy — so long, in fact, the Times reported the term expired for grand jury hearing evidence. It began last year after Horowitz referred his findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges. Frustrated with the prolonged process, DOJ prosecutor Kamil Shields left the case and joined a private practice. Another assistant U.S. attorney, David Kent, is also no longer on the case.

McCabe is also likely still being scrutinized in Horowitz’s inquiry into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The surveillance warrant applications targeting Trump associate Carter Page required the approval of top members of the FBI and DOJ, and McCabe was involved in the FISA approval process.

Horowitz’s report is expected to be released to the public in late September or early October."
Former Trump aide subpoenaed to testify before House Judiciary Committee,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Alexander Nazaryan', 'Yahoo News']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/08/26/former-trump-aide-subpoenaed-to-testify-before-house-judiciary-committee/23801522/,"WASHINGTON — Robert R. Porter, the influential former aide to President Trump, has been ordered to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, in the latest sign that congressional Democrats will continue to press the Trump administration on questions related to electoral fraud and obstruction of justice.

Porter’s subpoena announced Monday by the Judiciary Committee’s chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., demands Porter testify at a Sept. 17 hearing.

As Trump’s staff secretary from from January 2017 until February 2018, Porter had daily access to the president and served as an Oval Office go-between to other high-ranking officials in the executive branch. Porter is also routinely mentioned in the second volume of Robert Mueller’s 448-page report, a redacted version of which was made public in April, in connection with Trump’s possible obstruction of justice.

Neither Porter nor his attorney was available for immediate comment. Members of the Democratic staff of the House Judiciary Committee would also not comment for the record.

His subpoena is the latest of several issued by the influential committee, which has engaged in zealous oversight of the Trump administration. Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Corey Lewandowski, who served as Trump’s first campaign manager during the 2016 presidential campaign, and Rick Dearborn, who was a White House deputy chief of staff in the early days of the administration.

Subpoenas have also recently been issued to Hope Hicks, one of Trump’s most trusted advisers, former White House counsel Don McGahn and McGahn aide Annie Donaldson.

Nadler has also moved to subpoena the unredacted version of Mueller’s report on the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia and, subsequently, the efforts of the Trump administration to hide evidence of that collusion.

Supporters of Trump have echoed his complaints that Nadler and his Democratic colleagues are engaged in a protracted “witch hunt” animated by a lingering disappointment that Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.

Porter has largely remained out of public view since leaving the White House in early 2018 amid allegations by two ex-wives that he had been abusive toward them. Porter has denied those allegations but has not discussed them at any significant length. He did, however, publish a Wall Street Journal op-ed on trade policy in March. In response, one of his ex-wives wrote in the Washington Post that “Rob’s sudden return to the public eye” was “deeply troubling.”

The committee’s interest in Porter is likely limited to potential obstruction of justice charges against Trump. The former Trump aide is absent from the first volume of the Mueller report, which focuses on electoral interference, because he was not affiliated with the Trump campaign. At the time of the 2016 election, he was a senior aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who has since retired.

Porter joined the Trump presidential transition and later became Trump’s staff secretary, meaning that he controlled the flow of information in and out of the Oval Office.

According to White House sources who spoke to this reporter for “The Best People,” a book about the Trump administration, Porter’s stock rose as McGahn’s fell. Trump was impressed by Porter, who has degrees from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, and who was a Rhodes Scholar. He was also a favorite of John Kelly, who succeeded Reince Priebus as the White House chief of staff. By mid-2017, Porter had considerable access to — and influence in — the Oval Office.

If he complies with the subpoena and testifies before the House Judiciary Committee, Porter will almost certainly be asked about several potentially obstructive incidents described in the Mueller report.

In one such incident, Trump asked Porter to “sound out” Rachel Brand, an associate attorney general, for her views on the Mueller investigation. The Mueller report says that Trump wanted to see if Brand was “on the team.”

“Porter did not reach out to her because he was uncomfortable with the task,” the report says. “Porter did not contact Brand,” it continues a little later, “because he was sensitive to the implications of that action and did not want to be involved in a chain of events associated with an effort to end the investigation or fire the Special Counsel.”

Porter was also present for a Dec. 6, 2017, meeting between Trump and Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general. Sessions had recused himself from the Russia investigation because of his own contacts with Russian officials during the presidential campaign. That recusal was a source of great irritation for Trump.

The Mueller report cites notes Porter took at that meeting. “I don’t know if you could un-recuse yourself. You’d be a hero,” Trump told Sessions according to those notes.

The House Judiciary Committee will likely seize on Porter’s recollections of the Dec. 6 encounter as further evidence that Trump attempted to hamper the Mueller investigation.

Also of interest to congressional investigators will be Porter’s recollection of an exchange with the president in his residence on Jan. 27, 2018, just days before Porter left the White House. According to the narrative in the Mueller report — which is based on Porter’s notes — Trump “said that one of his biggest failings as President was that he had not surrounded himself with good attorneys, citing Sessions as an example. The President raised Sessions’s recusal and brought up and criticized the Special Counsel’s investigation.”

An institutionalist who has worked in all three branches of government (before becoming a Hatch staffer, he was a clerk on the influential U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit), it’s difficult to imagine Porter either defying the subpoena or turning his testimony before Congress into a pro-Trump diatribe.

But it is just as difficult to imagine Porter turning on Trump. The president expressed sympathy for Porter as the allegations of domestic abuse became public, and the two continued to communicate after Porter left the administration, and there have been occasional rumors that Trump would like him to return in some capacity.

Nor is Porter likely to be the last current or former Trump official to be summoned to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. In July, the committee voted to authorize potential subpoenas for Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, former top adviser Stephen K. Bannon and 10 others, Porter among them. Some of those subpoenas have been issued, while others could be on the way.

Republican Senator Tom Cotton says it's a good idea to buy Greenland: Yikes. An excerpt from his New York Times op-ed:



After news leaked last week that President Trump had expressed interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark, his critics predictably derided him as crazy. But once again, the president is crazy like a fox. The acquisition of Greenland would secure vital strategic interests for the United States, economically benefit both us and Greenlanders, and would be in keeping with American — and Danish — diplomatic traditions. ... America is not the only nation to recognize Greenland’s strategic significance. Intent on securing a foothold in the Arctic and North America, China attempted in 2016 to purchase an old American naval base in Greenland, a move the Danish government prevented. Two years later, China was back at it, attempting to build three airports on the island, which failed only after intense lobbying of the Danes by the Trump administration.

Justice Department asks Supreme Court to allow border asylum ban,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Camilo Montoya-Galvez'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-asks-supreme-court-to-allow-border-asylum-ban/,"Washington — The Justice Department on Monday asked the Supreme Court to allow the Trump administration to implement its most sweeping effort yet to overhaul the asylum system along the border while a legal challenge plays out in court.

U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who represents the federal government before the court, urged the justices to issue an administrative stay on a ruling by a judge in San Francisco, who earlier in the summer blocked a regulation that would make most migrants from Central America and other countries ineligible for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The administration had already asked the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to do so. Earlier this month, the appellate court did not grant the government's request, but it said the injunction blocking the near-total asylum ban only applies within the court's jurisdiction. The decision meant that administration could proceed with the policy in New Mexico and Texas, but not in California and Arizona, which fall within the purview of the 9th Circuit.

Through its filing on Monday, the administration is asking the high court to allow the government to implement the rule along the entire border. Francisco said the policy ""serves important public purposes"" and ""alleviates a crushing burden on the U.S. asylum system by prioritizing asylum seekers who most need asylum in the United States.""

The rule, a joint effort by the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, restricts access to the U.S. asylum system for non-Mexican migrants who traveled through Mexico and other countries to reach the southwestern border, but did not seek protection in those nations.

Although designed to stem the flow of Central American migrants journeying north, the regulation also would affect people from other parts of the world trying to reach the U.S. through Mexico, including Cubans, Venezuelans, Brazilians and central Africans, who have traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border in higher numbers this year.

Administration officials have maintained that the rule would help curb what they call ""forum shopping"" by migrants. They have repeatedly accused migrants of preferring to seek asylum in the U.S., rather than in the countries along their journey that might be able to offer them safe haven.

""The rule also screens out asylum claims that are less likely to be meritorious by denying asylum to aliens who refused to seek protection in third countries en route to the southern border,"" Francisco wrote Monday. ""In turn, the rule deters aliens without a genuine need for asylum from making the arduous and potentially dangerous journey from Central America to the United States.""

But immigrant advocates have said the policy ignores U.S. and international refugee law and would force countless migrants and asylum seekers to return to places where they may face persecution.

When he approved a injunction against the ban in late July, Judge Jon Tigar of U.S. District Court in San Francisco seemed to agree with the concerns raised by the plaintiffs in one of two lawsuits. ""An injunction would vindicate the public's interest — which our existing immigration laws clearly articulate — in ensuring that we do not deliver aliens into the hands of their persecutors,"" he wrote in his ruling.

Late last year, Tigar halted a similar effort by the administration to prohibit migrants who cross the border illegally from being able to seek asylum. The Supreme Court, by a vote of 5 to 4, later rejected the administration's request to stay Tigar's ruling."
Weill Family Foundation announces public-private partnership with Energy Department on artificial intelligence,https://www.cnbc.com,['Riya Bhattacharjee'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/weill-foundation-announces-public-private-partnership-with-dept-of-energy-on-artificial-intelligence.html,"The Department of Energy and the Weill Family Foundation on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding for a new public-private partnership which will use the agency's artificial intelligence capabilities for biomedical research.

Former Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill and Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC's ""Closing Bell "" in an exclusive interview that the partnership aims to improve the diagnosis of brain diseases and neurological disorders, which would result in more effective treatment.

""As one looks at science and the development of new science, especially AI and computing, you really need to have partners to make things work."" Weill said. ""It's too expensive for anybody to try to do it by themselves.""

The partnership between the federal government and the Weill Family Foundation, involves Lawrence Livermore, Lawrence Berkeley and Argonne National laboratories, and was announced during a roundtable on DOE-fueled artificial intelligence at Lawrence Livermore Lab in Livermore, California.

The Department of Energy is currently home to the fastest supercomputers in the world.

The partnership aims to have new computers ready by 2022 that would run 15 times faster than current speeds.

""It will really break the logjam, especially as it related to neurodegenerative diseases,"" Weill said. ""And with everybody doing better, with the cancer research and with cardiovascular research, people are going to live longer. And we are all going to get these neurodegenerative diseases over time. And what we are working on is to prevent that because it would just be too costly.""

Perry said in the next 18 to 24 months, the department will have computers coming on board that will be between 50 to 100 times faster than today's computers. ""The improvement in health care, particularly in brain science, is going to be monumental, it's going to be world changing,"" Perry said.

Weill added it was important for the U.S. to beat China in this field.

When asked about current U.S.-China trade relations, Weill said it was important for the United States and China to figure out a way to get along with each other. ""With the two countries partnering for the future, I think we will end up with a better world, a safer world."""
Brighton water treatment plant out of compliance with EPA standards for 3 consecutive years,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/brighton-in-violation-of-epa-drinking-water-standards-for-3-consecutive-years-according-to-report,"BRIGHTON, Colo. -- We knew the water in Brighton was expensive, now - it turns out - it could be dangerous, too.

The same city that could see its mayor recalled over sky-high water rates now admits it hasn't been in compliance with the EPA for three years.

The water scandal continues to mystify even some who sit on the current council.

""The residents don't trust the city,"" said councilman Matt Johnston. ""I, as a city council representative, do not trust our city.""

The latest issue to surface is an EPA summary which concludes Brighton has had ""Significant/Category 1"" violations for 12 of the last 12 quarters.

A city spokeswoman said late Monday those violations are for treated discharge that goes back into the river, not the drinking water.

But, Brighton's former city manager said late Monday that the reverse osmosis treatment facility also supplies Brighton with drinking water, so any violation at the plant should be concerning.

""Someone's at serious risk if the plant is that out of compliance,"" said former city manager Philip Rodriguez, who was fired in the midst of this scandal back in July. ""Either Brighton or its neighbors downstream.""

""We cannot say that 100% for sure all of our water is safe,"" Johnston said. ""We can't say that.""

And, in fact, just last week the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment forced Brighton to send a letter to residents warning them about a dangerous backflow issue that could impact the drinking water supply.

For homeowner's like Jeremy Torgerson, it's mind-boggling.

""You don't want to cook with it, give it to your kids, your dog or anything,"" Torgerson said. ""I don't know how many more punches the residents have to take from their own city before we finally decide that we've had enough.""

The ongoing scandal has resulted in a flood of problems at city hall including the discovery of a $70 million fund from possible water billing overcharges and the subsequent firing of the city manager.

And now – there will be a recall election of the current mayor who insists the water is safe.

""The water here in Brighton is safe,"" said Mayor Ken Kreutzer. ""I drink it. My children drink it. My grandson drinks it. This is another gross exaggeration.""

But Johnston and others, like Torgerson, are no longer going with the flow. They insist city hall is corrupt.

""I'm tired of the backroom,"" Johnston said. ""It's time for the public to know everything about our water system - if it's safe, if it's clean, where the money's at and what it's being spent for.""

And while the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment hasn't issued a boil order, Johnston believes it's only a matter of time.

""This is a pre-boil warning type of scenario,"" Johnston said.

""The city government no longer functions,"" Torgerson said. ""This a basic function of a utility department to make sure the water that goes out is safe. They overcharge, and now we have to drink bottled water.""

Johnston says those who are sick should be particularly cautious.

""They're going through chemotherapy, and they do not know if they should be boiling their water at this point,"" Johnston said."
Trump's North Korea point man gets a look for No. 2 State Dept. job,https://www.politico.com,"['Daniel Lippman', 'Eliana Johnson']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/26/biegun-north-korea-state-dept-1475896,"Special Envoy for North Korea Steve Biegun is being seriously considered to replace deputy secretary of state John Sullivan. | Jeon Heon-Kyun/Getty Images foreign policy Trump's North Korea point man gets a look for No. 2 State Dept. job Taking the deputy secretary position would leave the president without a dedicated envoy to Kim Jong Un.

Steve Biegun, President Trump’s special representative for North Korea, is being seriously considered for the No. 2 job at the State Department, according to two senior administration officials with knowledge of the matter.

The post looks like it’s going to open up soon because the current deputy secretary of state John Sullivan, who met with Trump in the Oval Office last week, is likely to get nominated in the coming weeks to be the U.S. ambassador to Russia, replacing Jon Huntsman, who leaves his post in early October.

Story Continued Below

While it’s early in the selection process for the job, multiple officials said that Biegun, a former auto executive who has been the point man on working-level negotiations with the North Korean regime, is a strong candidate.

Biegun, whose background before the North Korean job was in Russia policy, had also been considered to replace Huntsman and has talked to Trump about being an ambassador. He also reportedly turned down the Russia job.

“It’s good to have someone who is already in the system,” said a senior administration official. “They understand how the process goes. They already have a security clearance.” The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

“The whole building is vying for the job,” according to another senior administration official. One of the contenders could include Brian Bulatao, the undersecretary of state for management, who was chief operating officer of the CIA when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was CIA director, according to a former senior State Department official. Bulatao didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

It could take a while for Sullivan to get confirmed if and when he’s officially selected, since confirming judicial nominees is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s priority, which leads to occasional delays for executive branch nominees. Russia also is likely to take at least two months to approve the U.S. picking Sullivan, a diplomatic protocol known as “agrément.”

Trump has resisted acknowledging that his talks with Kim Jong Un have made little headway, and has sought a third summit with the North Korean leader.

He told reporters at the G7 in France on Monday that Kim “is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.” He had said that he was “not happy” about North Korea’s recent missile tests, which his own national security adviser has said violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.

There has also been some rather public daylight between Biegun and Trump on the progress the U.S. has made in negotiating with North Korea. While Trump bragged last year that there wasn’t a nuclear threat from North Korea anymore, Biegun said earlier this year at Stanford that “it is fair to say we have more work ahead of us than behind us.”

With few signs of any coming breakthroughs with North Korea, Biegun has recently shown signs of wanting to leave his current job. He’s been telling associates he was eager to move on from the envoy post and felt it was a thankless job, according to three people familiar with his comments.

In his job as Trump’s North Korea envoy, Biegun has had difficulty getting meetings with top North Korean officials to advance U.S. goals of denuclearization.

“Not having the North Koreans meet with you and the North Koreans only want to meet with the president is pretty frustrating,” said one Republican foreign policy hand who knows Biegun. “And negotiating with the North Koreans is hopeless. They just want to meet at the presidential level so there’s no real meetings at his level.”

It’s not clear whether Biegun would actually take the deputy job if Trump offers it. He has also told people that he is tired of serving in government and is eager to return to the private sector.

The State Department, meanwhile, is fending off twin challenges: a president whose sudden pronouncements can rewrite policy in mere seconds; and a budget that is constantly under the threat of severe cuts under Trump.

“How are you supposed to come to work and to be a serious professional when you don’t know what’s coming tomorrow?” said another Republican involved in foreign policy in Washington. “Even Pompeo doesn’t know the crazy thing Trump is going to say the next day and it’s really hard to engage with people in the White House” who don’t know what Trump is going to do either.

Weighing against this chaos factor: If Biegun is picked for the deputy job, there’s a possibility he could eventually become the acting secretary of state should Pompeo leave to run for a Senate seat in his home state of Kansas.

Biegun served as executive secretary of the National Security Council in the Bush administration and also had a brief stint as foreign policy adviser to Sarah Palin when she was John McCain’s vice presidential nominee.

Before joining the Trump administration, he worked as the vice president of international governmental affairs at Ford. After H.R. McMaster left as Trump’s national security adviser, Biegun was considered for that job before John Bolton was picked.

Traditionally, the deputy secretary of state position is tasked with managing the State Department’s 69,000 employees, but also usually carves out select foreign policy portfolios of his or her own.

Sullivan, for instance, has focused on a few key issues, including implementing the sanctions against Russia, leading the administration’s diplomatic response to the gas attacks and barrel bombings in Syria, and guiding the Trump team’s efforts to stabilize South Sudan.

Trump told reporters last week that Sullivan “could very well be” picked as the ambassador to Russia and that Pompeo “likes him very much.”

As for Biegun’s suitability for the job, “It’s a really tough and challenging role but I think Steve would be really excellent at it, just because of his work ethic, his style, his intelligence,” another former senior State Department official said. “I’ve always found Steve to be fair.”

Biegun didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

His departure would leave the North Korea envoy role empty -- but Trump has shown few signs of leaning on Biegun in any event.

On Monday, the president said that his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, has also gotten to know Kim Jong Un. That left Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, to quickly clarify Trump’s comments.

“President Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim,” she said in a statement. “And while the first lady hasn’t met him, the president feels like she’s gotten to know him too.”

Treasury yields steady as investors await updates in US-China trade battle,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/treasury-yields-fall-investors-flee-risk-trade-war.html,"Treasury yields held steady Monday despite the rate on the benchmark 2-year note rising above that of the 10-year, triggering again a recession indicator that has dogged financial markets in recent weeks.

At around 1:13 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was trading at 1.533%, below the 2-year's rate of 1.545%, inverting the U.S. Treasury curve further. Such an inversion of the 2-10 yields is viewed by fixed income traders as a recession prognosticator, but trying to forecast exactly when GDP growth contracts is harder to project.

Inversions of that part of the curve have predated every recession over the past 50 years and the last five 2-10 inversions have all led to recessions. Still, even when it does predict a recession, yield curve inversion is, on average, 22 months early, according to Credit Suisse.

An uptick in U.S.-China trade tensions also helped aggravate recession anxieties.

Beijing on Friday announced new tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. goods on Friday in response to the Trump administration's impending tariffs, set to take effect in waves starting Sept. 1. That retaliation prompted Trump to tweet Friday morning that U.S. companies were ""ordered"" to immediately look for alternatives to China.

The U.S. president also lashed out at China President Xi Jinping and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who delivered a speech on Friday in which he said the global economic outlook ""has been deteriorating"" and highlighted the trade war as a major source of business uncertainty.

Trump said after the market closed that he would raise existing duties on $250 billion in Chinese products to 30% from 25%, and that new tariffs on a further $300 billion of Chinese goods, due to take effect on September 1, will now rise from 10% to 15%.

Monday's moves also came after a host of Fed leaders spoke to CNBC from their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Though Powell didn't repeat his now-infamous July 31 comments that the Fed's recent rate cut was merely a ""midcycle adjustment,"" he did not promise additional easing as some investors had hoped. He also focused on the impact the trade war is having on the business outlook.

The President Spent the G-7 Summit Retweeting Conspiracy Theories,https://slate.com,['Ben Mathis-Lilley'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/trump-g7-china-twitter.html,"Donald Trump at the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, on Sunday. Jeff J. Mitchell—Pool/Getty Images

Over the weekend and on Monday, President Donald Trump was in France for the G-7 summit, at which he was supposed to be doing things such as keeping the world economy from crashing and going to meetings about subjects like climate change.

Mostly, though, the president appeared to be self-soothing online. In one four-hour stretch on Sunday, Trump did nine consecutive reposts of tweets from the right-wing group Judicial Watch, in reverse chronological order, as if he were working his way through the feed to make himself feel better. The topics he shared included a conspiracy theory about Rep. Ilhan Omar’s personal life and various paranoid claims about the deep state, one of which featured a video involving, yes, Hillary Clinton’s emails.

What about summit business? On the economic front, Trump told reporters that his aides had been in touch with representatives of the Chinese government about working out a trade deal after the market-assaulting Friday tweet meltdown in which he’d spontaneously announced new tariffs and demanded that U.S. companies stop doing business in the country. According to the Associated Press, the president specifically said that his trade negotiation team had conducted two “very good calls” with the Chinese on Sunday. China, however, had a different take:

JUST IN: China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang says has no info on phone calls to U.S. cited by Trump, adding later “I can tell you clearly that I haven’t heard of such a thing”

* Says China will protect itself on trade if U.S. persists with current approach — Melissa Cheok (@mkcheok) August 26, 2019

So that’s going well. As for climate change, Trump not only missed the meeting but didn’t even know he had missed it. The Guardian:

Trump was later asked by reporters covering a meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, whether he had attended the climate session. He replied: “We’re having it in a little while.” He did not appear to hear when a reporter told him it had just taken place.

On the ball. Good.

Meanwhile, his Twitter feed testifies to what the president has been paying attention to in France. The Judicial Watch fixation was part of a Sunday/Monday spree—again, while he was supposed to be at a series of huge meetings—during which he posted or retweeted others’ posts 46 times. Some of these were pro forma PR messages that were probably put up by his staff, but others were vintage The President Is Mad at the Television material, like this zombie complaint about how well the press treated Clinton in 2016, this denial of the very plausible Axios report that he wants to drop a nuclear bomb on a hurricane, and this Obviously Fabricated Anecdote:

The question I was asked most today by fellow World Leaders, who think the USA is doing so well and is stronger than ever before, happens to be, “Mr. President, why does the American media hate your Country so much? Why are they rooting for it to fail?” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2019

Yeah, that sounds like something Shinzo Abe would say."
Justice Department takes controversial stand on transgender case at Supreme Court,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo J. Scott Applewhite'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/justice-department-takes-controversial-stand-on-transgender-case-at-supreme-court,"In one of the most important cases the Supreme Court will hear this fall, the Department of Justice has taken a stand, along with a number of influential people and organizations. All of them take specific, strong stances on the definition of sex and gender identity, which center around the questions both the LGBT activists, conservatives, and legal experts have been asking for some time: What is sex, who defines it, and what legal protections does it have?

In a brief filed with the Supreme Court, the Department of Justice said they believe transgender discrimination is not prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in October to address the issue. The ACLU will argue on behalf of the transgender woman and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s position, claiming the employee was fired because of her gender identity. R.G & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes maintains that the employee was fired after he transitioned from male to female because he did not wear sex-specific clothing, which is a company policy.

This particular brief is significant because the DOJ represents the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but their brief shows they will depart from the commission’s position that gender identity should be a protected category until Title VII’s sex discrimination clause. In the brief, the DOJ argues that Congress didn’t include transgender people and gender identity when Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was originally passed, and Congress has not passed any efforts to add gender identity to the statute. “Under this Court’s precedent, proving discrimination because of sex under Title VII requires showing that an employer treated members of one sex less favorably than similarly situated members of the other sex,” the Justice Department said in its brief.

The DOJ’s brief isn’t the only noteworthy opinion on the case. Paul McHugh is the University Distinguished Service professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and he filed an amicus brief “not to discuss statutory construction but to critically evaluate, on the basis of his clinical and scientific expertise” in support of the concept that gender identity and sex are not the same thing, which basically supports the funeral home's case. The brief reads that he “seeks to discuss the frequently heard claims about gender identity, which sometimes masquerade as science but are really ideological pronouncements not supported by scientific evidence.”

Just last week a brief was filed by a group of people who appear to have all undergone gender reassignment surgeries or transitioned to some degree, and warn others about the dangers of transitioning through hormone replacement or surgeries. In their brief, they too tackle the subject of gender identity, sex, and transitioning, rather than law. Both amicus briefs provide an insightful look into the world of those who treat or who have identified as a different gender from a cultural, rather than a legal, perspective.

This case will be to gender identity what Obergefell v. Hodges was to same-sex marriage. It will be interesting to see who else steps in to add a perspective to this controversial legal case.

The State Department on Monday announced the political scientist Peter Berkowitz as the head of policy planning, a post that puts him in charge of long-term strategic thinking for the department.

Berkowitz, who was already working in the Office of Policy Planning, will replace his former boss, Kiron Skinner, who was dismissed earlier this month over concerns about her management style.

Story Continued Below

The announcement came in an internal email to select State Department officials on Monday morning, according to one of those officials.

Berkowitz, who has taught both constitutional law and political philosophy, came to the State Department from Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is the author of four books on subjects ranging from conservatism and progressivism to the ethics of Nietzsche.

Under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Department of Policy Planning — which has historically operated as the State Department’s internal think tank — played a key role in the day-to-day management of the department.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who works closely with a team of special envoys, has returned it to its traditional role of churning out papers and proposals on long-range strategic issues.

Separately, meeting German chancellor Angela Merkel, the US president claimed there was “great unity” on how to deal with the Iran crisis. Ms Merkel, however, said there was a long way to go on the issue, which has created considerable headache as tensions have flared between Tehran and Washington.

The snubs came just before Mr Trump attended a joint press conference with French president Emmanuel Macron, where the two leaders claimed to have found unity on many issues — from Iranian nuclear enrichment, to trade.

Later, after Mr Macron left the stage, the American president stuck around for a few questions, where he lavished praise on Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, and at one point called himself an ""environmentalist"".

Mr Trump has also denied at the summit in France that he had suggested firing nuclear weapons at hurricanes — as was reported by Axios — and suggested his own Miami golf club for next year’s G7. He also claimed China had “called” to ask for trade talks – before a top Chinese official said he was unaware of any call.

Elsewhere, the 2020 Democratic primary field saw some heat, with a new poll showing Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Joe Biden all in a statistical dead heat among national voters.

The poll marked a potentially dramatic fall for Mr Biden from the top of the race, and came after Ms Warren attracted a massive crowd in Seattle — one that has received plenty of media attention for its striking visuals.

Also, Mr Trump's own party's primary field has gotten a bit tighter, with the long-shot entry of former congressman Joe Walsh, a one-time Trump supporter who claims the president has simply gotten too cozy with Russia."
Democrats’ bid to get Trump’s tax returns before the 2020 election isn’t looking good,https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/26/20833600/donald-trump-tax-returns-richard-neal-new-york,"As the 2020 election approaches, it appears likely that we won’t get to see President Donald Trump’s tax returns anytime soon.

House Democrats are becoming increasingly resigned to the idea that the battle over the president’s taxes will be a long slog, according to a report from Jeff Stein, Rachael Bade, and Jacqueline Alemany at the Washington Post. The White House has signaled it’s prepared to fight back at every turn. The court battle over Trump’s federal returns, even if Democrats do prevail, will probably drag on for months. And Democrats haven’t even asked for the president’s state tax returns from New York, which in July passed a law that would allow three congressional tax committees to request them.

How to go about getting Trump’s tax returns — and whether House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal (D-MA), who is leading such efforts, is doing enough — has been a matter of debate on the left for months. It is emblematic of a growing feeling among some progressives that Democrats have been too hesitant to take Trump to task since taking back the House in the 2018 midterm elections. The White House’s resistance efforts have worked better than expected, and the Democrats’ strategy has not.

Trump’s tax returns have been treated as a Holy Grail that would unlock the secrets of his wealth and, depending on where you fall on the political spectrum, potentially reveal him as a fraud or as having unsavory ties to foreign interests. If that were the case, it could be an important weapon again him in his reelection campaign — but it looks like Democrats aren’t going to have it.

The efforts to get Trump’s tax returns, briefly explained

On the federal level, Democrats have invoked Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, a statute dating back to 1924, to try to get the president’s returns. It authorizes a handful of congressional committees, including Ways and Means, to get the tax return information of any taxpayer from the Treasury Department. That, conceivably, means the president’s as well. There’s debate about whether those returns could then be made public, but the committees, at least, are supposed to be allowed to request and access them. (I have a full explainer on the legal plan and how it’s supposed to work.)

Democrats asked the IRS for the president’s tax returns in April and in the months leading up to that spent time trying to build a case that leadership says they believe will have a better chance of standing up in court. They want to show that they are requesting the tax returns out of legitimate legislative and oversight duties, not as part of some partisan fishing expedition.

As expected, the Treasury Department has declined Democrats’ request, and in July, they sued to get them. As the Post notes, the judge currently assigned the case is a Trump appointee, which might not bode well for the Democrats’ case.

“The law doesn’t leave any wiggle room, so if the judge does his job, he can resolve the thing in a minute and give Congress the returns. If the judge is a shameless political hack, then it’s another story,” one Democratic aide told Vox.

Whatever decision comes down will likely be appealed, possibly up to the Supreme Court.

On the matter of the state tax returns, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill that would let Ways and Means and two other congressional tax committees request someone’s state tax returns from the New York State Commissioner of the Department of Taxation and Finance. Trump subsequently filed a lawsuit to block New York from releasing his tax returns. But here’s the thing: House Democrats never asked for them in the first place.

A lot of Democrats aren’t particularly thrilled with the way this is going

Neal has been criticized for moving slowly on trying to get Trump’s federal tax returns, and there’s been some head-scratching around his decision not to pursue the state ones at all. The Massachusetts Democrat told Bloomberg in June that his committee doesn’t “have jurisdiction over New York taxes.” He appears to be worried that going after the state taxes would make the federal request look too partisan and potentially weaken his case.

Some Democrats have backed his prudent approach. Others are encouraging him to move faster, including Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ), an early proponent of going after Trump’s tax returns. “The American people deserve to know if their president is a crook,” he said in a statement after the New York law was passed in July.

Neal has also attracted a primary challenger for his 2020 reelection, 30-year-old Holyoke, Massachusetts, Mayor Alex Morse. “[Neal is] the one person that has the authority in Washington to get Trump’s state tax returns from New York, and he’s the one person standing in the way,” Morse recently told me.

Neal’s office did not return a request for comment in this story.

Beyond the ins and outs of the specific battle over the president’s tax returns, the broader question is that of expectation versus reality when it comes to what Democrats can and will accomplish in terms of investigations, subpoenas, and even impeachment now that they’re in control of the House. The White House has stonewalled many efforts to request documents and interviews, and Democrats have been slower than anticipated to launch probes in the first place.

Impeachment has become an especially contentious topic in the wake of the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation. More than half of House Democrats now support opening an impeachment inquiry into the president, but members of leadership, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have been hesitant to move forward and warned that such a move could backfire.

Complicating matters more are comments from House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler (D-NY) in early August that impeachment proceedings were already underway. “The fact is we are doing an investigation. We are investigating the facts. We’re investigating the evidence,” Nadler said in an interview on CNN. (As Vox’s Andrew Prokop explained, it’s not clear anything materially different is happening on impeachment than there was before.)

House Democrats are in a tough spot when it comes to holding Trump accountable. They were propelled back into power, in large part, on hopes that they would be able to take the president to task. Doing so has proven easier said than done for a number of reasons. Democrats waiting for a treasure trove of information they believe will be in the president’s tax returns might be waiting a long time, even forever."
There's no need to focus on anonymously-sourced stories about Trump when he says bonkers stuff out in the open,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/theres-no-need-to-focus-on-anonymously-sourced-stories-about-trump-when-he-says-bonkers-stuff-out-in-the-open,"This past weekend followed a familiar pattern of stories about President Trump based on anonymous sources that get joked about and debated, then eventually denied.

In the most recent case, Axios, citing a number of officials anonymously, reported that Trump repeatedly inquired about the possibility of blasting hurricanes with nuclear weapons to stop them before they hit the shore. The story also quoted unnamed White House officials as defending Trump for having the right objective, downplaying any reason for panic. The reported idea has obviously not come into fruition.

On Monday morning, Trump tweeted, ""The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous. I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!""

Let me say at the outset, I don't question that Axios reporters Jonathan Swan and Margaret Talev were told Trump said such things. Also, there is some room between Trump's denial and the story — i.e., he could have asked about the possibility without actually affirmatively wanting to do it.

The problem with assessing stories such as this is that at this point, we know there are many people within the administration who do not agree with Trump — indeed, who see it as their duty to protect the country from him by reining him in. At the same time, people in position to be cited as high-ranking officials know that based on his statements and behavior in public, people will believe just about any story about Trump, and that there is an insatiable appetite for such stories. So the threshold for selling an outlandish story is much lower than the typical president.

But here's the thing. To me, there's no reason to get so worked about anonymously sourced stories at this point when there's so much that Trump says and does in full public view that's lamentable or absolutely bonkers.

Just last week, Trump vented about the disloyalty of Democratic voting American Jews, canceled a meeting with the leader of Denmark over the sale of Greenland, escalated his trade war with China on Twitter, called his own appointment to lead the Fed an ""enemy"" on par with the ruler of communist China, and then joked about the resulting stock market crash.

So critics and defenders have plenty of stuff to argue about without even debating the validity of the anonymously-sourced stuff."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP

The Trump administration is making changes to the agency that operates the nation's immigration court system, a move immediately denounced by the immigration judges' union as a power grab.

The agency is called the Executive Office for Immigration Review and it is an arm of the Justice Department. Under the interim rule announced Friday, the agency's director will have the power to issue appellate decisions in immigration cases that have not been decided within an allotted timeframe. It also creates a new office of policy within EOIR to implement the administration's immigration policies.

The head of the immigration judges' union accused the administration of trying to strip power away from judges and turn the immigration court system into a law enforcement agency.

""In an unprecedented attempt at agency overreach to dismantle the Immigration Court, the Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) today published a new interim rule, effective next Monday, which takes steps to dismantle the Immigration Court system,"" Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said in a statement. ""DOJ's action ends any transparency and assurance of independent decision making over individual cases.""

The new rule, first reported by The Associated Press, comes after the administration announced an effort to decertify the immigration judges' union. The judges, 440 in total, are employees of the Justice Department and not part of the independent judiciary. The Trump administration has also imposed quotas on judges in an effort to speed up deportations and reduce the backlog of more than 900,000 cases pending in immigration courts.

Tabaddor said the administration is trying to concentrate its power over immigration proceedings.

""The new rule is a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" Tabaddor said. ""While couched in bureaucratic language, the impact of this regulation is to substitute the policy directives of a single political appointee over the legal analysis of non-political, independent adjudicators.""

The EOIR did not respond to a call for comment.

Earlier this week, the EOIR sent the immigration judges a newsletter containing a blog post from VDare, an anti-immigration website, which included an anti-Semitic reference, according to Tabaddor.

"Pence cheered during SC fundraiser amid 2024 rumors, while Sanford told to 'take a hike'",https://www.postandcourier.com,"['Jamie Lovegrove Jlovegrove Postandcourier.Com', 'Jamie Lovegrove', 'Andy Shain Ashain Postandcourier.Com', 'Caitlin Byrd Cbyrd Postandcourier.Com', 'Book', 'Meg Kinnard']",,,,https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/pence-cheered-during-sc-fundraiser-amid-rumors-while-sanford-told/article_425d86ae-c813-11e9-a355-1b23c66833d4.html,"ANDERSON — Vice President Mike Pence told an enthusiastic crowd of 3,000 conservatives Monday night that he was in South Carolina's Upstate for only one reason: to ensure President Donald Trump wins reelection next year.

""It's time for round two, everybody,"" Pence said at U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan's 9th annual Faith and Freedom BBQ fundraiser. ""It's on.""

Pence listed a litany of what he views as the strongest accomplishments of the Trump administration, including low unemployment, increased military spending and a raft of new conservative judges.

But Pence's stated reason for making the trip could not entirely tamp down speculation that 2020 may not be the only election on his mind.

The event marked Pence's third visit this year alone to South Carolina — a state that is unlikely to be particularly competitive in next year's general election but will play a critical early-voting role in the 2024 GOP presidential primaries.

""Any political observer would understand that an incumbent vice president is in good standing for the next open election,"" Greenville GOP chairman Nate Leupp said. ""These are the political players of the Upstate. Five years from now, they're not going to forget that Pence came here.""

Pence previously came down to visit an ""Opportunity Zone"" in Columbia, applauding U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., for getting the development tax credits for economically distressed areas included in the 2017 tax bill. And he helped U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., kick-off his reelection campaign with rallies in Myrtle Beach and Greenville.

The possibility of Pence running for president himself could potentially set him on a collision course with South Carolina's own former Gov. Nikki Haley, who remains popular in her home state and has her own ties to Trump as his former ambassador to the United Nations.

""It would be a hard choice,"" said David Cantrell, 53, a realtor from Anderson, on the possibility of a Pence-Haley primary contest. ""I'd have to do some soul-searching on that one.""

Some in the crowd Monday night said they would hope to see Pence and Haley on the same ticket. Others said they are skeptical that either of them have planned that far ahead — but they acknowledged it would make sense.

""If Pence is planning to run, it's smart of him to do this,"" said Pickens County GOP chairman Rick Tate of the vice president's appearance at Duncan's popular fundraiser. ""But he's playing in Nikki Haley's sandbox, so to speak.""

Touting new trade deal

Another impetus for Pence's S.C. trip was to promote the new trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada that is awaiting congressional approval.

The proposed deal, known as the USMCA, would update but not drastically overhaul the original North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which took effect in 1994 and reduced trade barriers between the three nations.

The Trump administration has made the new trade agreement a top priority and is pushing Congress to approve it when they return from August recess next month, hence Pence's tour of various states to rally public support for it.

Before Pence spoke at Anderson's Sargent Metal Fabricators, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer moderated a panel on the USMCA with three Republican members of Congress from South Carolina: U.S. Reps. William Timmons of Greenville, Ralph Norman of Rock Hill and Tom Rice of Myrtle Beach.

""This is long overdue,"" Timmons said of the deal, complaining that ""politics is the only thing getting in the way"" of ratification. All three said they expect the deal to pass overwhelmingly if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., brings it up for a vote.

Some Democrats have raised concerns about the deal's provisions — or lack thereof — regarding climate, labor, enforcement and pharmaceutical companies. But negotiators on both sides have expressed increasing optimism in recent months that those issues can be addressed.

Pence urged the crowd to tell South Carolina's two Democratic congressmen, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of Columbia and U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham of Charleston, to vote for the deal.

In a statement to The Post and Courier, Clyburn said he is continuing to work with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to improve provisions in the agreement.

""I am hopeful that the ongoing discussions will address the remaining concerns that I share with many of my colleagues and make it possible for Congress to approve the deal,"" Clyburn said.

Cunningham joined several other freshman Democrats in writing a letter to Pelosi last month that praised ""frank and productive"" talks with the Trump administration and called for a vote on the renegotiated trade deal by the end of the year.

""We are optimistic that the remaining gaps can be bridged if all parties engage with good faith and pragmatism,"" the letter said.

Sanford faces hostile crowd

Not everyone received such a welcoming reception at Duncan's BBQ.

Mark Sanford faced some hostile crowds as the former South Carolina congressman and governor continues to consider challenging Trump in a GOP primary.

Several attendees waved Trump campaign signs in front of Sanford's face, and others yelled, ""take a hike"" and ""go back to Argentina"" — a reference to Sanford's 2009 extramarital affair in South America while he was governor.

""He's an idiot,"" said Jim Wheeler, 71, a retired veteran from Greenwood. ""Doesn't he understand that we love Trump? Why would he run?""

Sanford appeared largely unfazed by the reaction, expecting not to be greeted particularly warmly by such a pro-Trump crowd.

An overwhelming majority of Republican in his home state say they don't want him to run, according to a recent Post and Courier-Change Research poll.

“He’s a failed congressman, failed governor, and he’s more than welcome to fail at this too,” said Joe Jackson, the Republican National Committee's South Carolina spokesman.

Still, Sanford said he's continuing to consider the idea and wanted to ""kick around some ideas"" with Upstate conservatives.

""I've been in a lot of different political contests and battles over the years,"" he said. ""Put it his way, I've seen a lot worse and been through a lot worse."""
US Department of Interior meets with tribes in Bethel to hear public safety concerns,https://www.adn.com,[],08-25-2019,2019,8,https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2019/08/25/us-department-of-interior-meets-with-tribes-in-bethel-to-hear-public-safety-concerns/,"Representatives from the U.S. Department of the Interior visited Bethel on Wednesday to hear from tribal representatives about the public safety issues unique to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. The visit comes in the wake of Attorney General William Barr’s tour of the region for similar reasons.

For DOI Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Tara Sweeney, the visit to Bethel was a bit of a homecoming.

“At Kilbuck, Mrs. Han was my fifth grade teacher,” Sweeney said.

Sweeney is the first Alaska Native to be confirmed to her position. Growing up in Bethel and Utqiagvik, she says that she saw the problems with public safety in rural Alaskan communities firsthand.

“The issues that we are discussing today are prevalent in every Alaska Native village. Every family has been impacted by domestic violence, sexual assault, violent crimes,” Sweeney said. “So yes, this is personal.”

Sweeney says that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has heard about these issues for years. Now, DOI Chief of Staff Kate MacGregor says that the bureau has the support it needs to take action.

“The president earlier this year declared May 5 as national missing and murdered Native American Awareness Day,” MacGregor said. “So this is something that has been raised in profile.”

MacGregor said that it was important to note that several members of the White House were in attendance at the listening session. Charles Addington, Director of the BIA’s Office of Justice Services, thinks that funding will be available. The next step is figuring out where the BIA can get the biggest bang for its buck.

“Trying to figure out where do we already have things in place that we can just start enhancing,” Addington said. “Low-hanging fruit that we can start making a difference right away.”

The Association of Village Council Presidents had called for the listening session. Forty-seven of the 56 federally recognized tribes in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta sent representatives. AVCP Director of Communications Azara Mohammadi described some of their suggestions.

“There was a lot about restorative justice, there was a lot about resources for victims, and infrastructure came up again and again. Public safety infrastructure,"" she said.

She said that people in the Lower 48 take holding cells and office space for granted, but in many villages that infrastructure is either falling apart or doesn’t exist.

“I mean, if you just don’t have the physical space for it, it’s very difficult,” Mohammadi said.

Tribal representatives asked for more funding for VPSOs and tribal courts. Another request was for changing the funding process itself. AVCP Director of Tribal Justice Rick Garcia says that there are problems when villages have to apply for competitive grants every year.

“What competitive funding does, it puts neighbors against neighbors, it puts families against families,” Garcia said.

Garcia is hopeful. The listening session came just a few months after U.S. Attorney General William Barr visited Bethel to talk about public safety. Garcia said that this meeting struck a different tone.

“I think this session was much different than Attorney General Barr’s,” Garcia said. “In that they really did come with the intention of listening and getting recommendations directly from our tribal leadership and delegates.”

DOI Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Tara Sweeney said that improving public safety in this region will require creativity and should be developed in partnership with the people who know the issues best."
"Department of Energy Releases Annual Wind Market Reports, Finding Robust Wind Power Installations and Falling Prices",https://www.energy.gov,[],,,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-releases-annual-wind-market-reports-finding-robust-wind-power,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released annual market reports documenting data and trends in wind installations, technologies, costs, prices, and performance through the end of 2018 for three sectors: utility-scale land-based, offshore, and distributed wind.

“Onshore wind energy installation continues to grow across the country, and this Administration has proven that we can pursue renewable energy advancements and deployment, particularly wind energy resources, which are predicted to surpass other sources of renewable power generation this year,” said Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes. “And with over 25 gigawatts in the development pipeline, U.S. offshore wind is poised to be a significant part of our comprehensive energy portfolio in the coming years.”

The utility-scale land-based wind sector had another strong year with 7,588 megawatts (MW) installed during 2018, accompanied by record low costs and prices. The U.S. distributed wind sector now stands at 1,127 MW from over 83,000 wind turbines across all 50 states. And the U.S. offshore wind industry has a pipeline of 25,824 MW in various stages of development.

The 2018 Wind Technologies Market Report, prepared by DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, found the following:

The U.S. wind industry installed 7,588 MW of capacity last year, bringing total utility-scale wind capacity to over 96 gigawatts (GW).

Wind industry employment is at an all-time high, supporting 114,000 jobs.

In total, 41 states operated utility-scale wind projects. Texas leads the nation with nearly 25 GW of wind capacity, while California, Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma have more than 5 GW.

Wind energy provides 6.5% of the nation’s electricity, more than 10% of total generation in 14 states, and more than 30% in Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma.

The trend of installing wind turbines that are larger and more powerful continued in 2018. Read more about these size and performance trends.

The price of wind energy being sold in long-term contracts is at an all-time low. Wind power purchase agreement (PPA) prices are below 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, driven by a combination of higher capacity factors, declining turbine prices and operating costs, low interest rates, and the production tax credit.

The 2018 Distributed Wind Market Report, prepared by DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, highlights the following:

Distributed wind power is used at or near where it is generated, as opposed to wind power from wholesale generation, where power is sent to consumers via transmission lines and substations.

Employed by households, schools, farms, industrial facilities, and municipalities, distributed wind doesn’t only refer to small-scale turbines; it includes any size turbine or array of turbines that generates power for local or on-site use.

U.S. wind turbines in distributed applications reached a cumulative installed capacity of 1,127 MW in 2018. This capacity comes from over 83,000 turbines installed across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam.

The trend of using larger wind turbines in distributed applications continued in 2018. The average capacity of large-scale turbines installed in distributed applications in 2018 was 2.1 MW—almost double the capacity of turbines used in 2003.

Commercial and industrial distributed wind projects increased in 2018, representing 29% of total project capacity. Distributed wind for utility customers remained the most prevalent use, representing 47% of capacity in 2018. Read more about the customers of U.S. distributed wind.

Of small wind turbines (nameplate capacity up to 100 kilowatts) deployed in the United States, very small turbines—less than 1 kW— are contributing an increasingly larger percentage of both the total number of turbines (99%) and capacity (47%) of small wind projects. These systems are often used for battery charging and are sometimes integrated with solar PV panels to power remote infrastructure.

The 2018 Offshore Wind Technologies Market Report, prepared by DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, found the following:

The U.S. offshore wind project development pipeline grew to a potential generating capacity of 25,824 MW across 13 states, including the Block Island Wind Farm commissioned in 2016.

Projects totaling 21,225 MW have exclusive site control, meaning the developer has a lease or other contract to develop the site. Most of these projects are on the Eastern seaboard, with one in the Great Lakes.

California and Hawaii have several early-stage floating offshore wind projects in the planning phase.

The Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) auctions for three lease areas off the coast of Massachusetts brought in winning bids of $135 million—more than three times the value of previous BOEM auctions—indicating strong interest and confidence in the U.S. offshore wind market.

Offtake prices for the first commercial-scale U.S. offshore wind project—Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts—came in lower than expected at $65–$75 per megawatt-hour.

Technology trends toward larger turbines continued, with offshore turbines installed globally in 2018 averaging 5.5 MW, and turbines with capacities of 10­–12 MW coming to market in the next couple years. Read more about offshore trends.

Federal court orders EPA to set stronger smog standards,https://www.nationofchange.org,"['Alexandra Jacobo Is A Progressive Writer', 'Activist', 'Mother Who Began Her Political Involvement In Earnest Passing Out Blankets To Occupiers In Zuccotti Park In She Is Concerned With Educating The Public', 'Inspiring Them To Take Action On Progressive Issues That Promote Positive Change At Home', 'Please Enter Your Name Here']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.nationofchange.org/2019/08/26/federal-court-orders-epa-to-set-stronger-smog-standards/,"The EPA “must go back and fix its mistakes so cherished natural spaces like national parks can thrive.”

The Environmental Protection Agency has failed to set proper regulations on smog and must improve its air quality standards ruled a federal appeals court last week.

In a case fought between Murray Energy Corporation, a massive coal company, and Earthjustice, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reviewed massive amounts of scientific evidence to determine if the EPA’s current air quality standards were sufficient.

The court ruled that current air quality standards for the ozone are too weak to protect the environment and do not meet basic federal requirements for protecting human health.

Although the case is a great win, unfortunately the court only fully recognized the scientific evidence of air pollution on forests and other natural landscapes.

“We are disappointed that the court failed to recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence showing ozone’s potential to cause premature death, difficulty breathing, wheezing and coughing, and asthma attacks at levels previously considered safe,” Harold P. Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. “Such evidence demands that EPA adopt stronger, more protective standards, not backslide on the progress being made toward cleaning up the air we breathe.”

The case was important in highlighting how effective strong scientific evidence can be when arguing during a trial.

“As President Trump’s EPA considers weakening science-based protections, that fact should give the agency pause as it goes out of its way to either dismantle science advisory boards, or fire independent scientists and replace them with fossil fuel lobbyists,” said Senator Tom Carper, a member of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, in a statement.

Murray Energy also attempted to argue that the EPA should consider costs incurred by industry groups and corporations when they are forced to comply with new and updated regulations. The court rejected this argument, stating “The plain text of the [Clean Air] Act unambiguously bars cost considerations.”

Seth Johnson, the attorney who worked the case on behalf of Earthjustice was positive about its outcome. The EPA “must go back and fix its mistakes so cherished natural spaces like national parks can thrive,” he said after the ruling."
Georgia governor on trade war with China: ‘Trust the president’,https://www.ajc.com,['Greg Bluestein'],,,,https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/georgia-governor-trade-war-with-china-trust-the-president/ifYrsLAJixIdkYlPtNB5LN/,"Gov. Brian Kemp had just begun a question-and-answer session with eight Asian-American business owners in Gwinnett County when Tim Le, a real estate investor, asked a question on many of their minds: With threats of a trade war looming, how does the U.S. economy keep growing?

Le and the other executives had spent the first 30 minutes lavishing praise on President Donald Trump and Kemp’s administration, praising the $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts that Congress adopted in 2017 and the governor’s promise to slash regulations.

But with Trump’s ongoing tit-for-tat trade war with China and the constant threat of new tariffs, Le and others wanted to know whether Kemp believed the American economy can withstand new threats of trade turbulation.

The governor said the tariffs have had a scattershot impact on Georgia businesses – some are hurting, other owners told him they are “exhausted” by all the new business. His message: He said he’s hopeful “that a lot of what’s gone on recently is posturing” and that the trade war is easing.

“We have to continue to trust the president, Sen. Perdue, Secretary Perdue – the whole team he’s got working on that,” said Kemp, of Sen. David Perdue and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, two Georgians who supported his campaign.

“China has taken advantage of us for a long time – really, the rest of the world. I’m no expert on trade, but I think we’ve probably waited too long to fight this battle. And people who are getting hurt from it even understand that.”

The event at a Peachtree Corners office park was part of a national series of Republican roundtables to highlight Trump’s economic agenda. But in Georgia it also had a different goal: To boost Asian-American support for Republicans in the 7th District, a competitive territory that stretches across parts of Gwinnett. .

Each of the eight business owners pledged to support Trump’s business agenda and work to encourage voters in the Asian-American community to vote next year.

“Thanks to President Trump’s tax cuts and less regulations, we have more money in our pockets and we’re able to hire more employees. We’re doing great,” Lonnie Vo, the owner of an auto repair shop, said to Kemp.

The sunny economic messaging contrasts with signs of fiscal turmoil ahead. Kemp has ordered 4% budget cuts this year and 6% next year, saying the slash is needed so he can pay for some of his top priorities, including another teacher pay raise.

Democrats have blasted his decision, sharpening their critiques after the Department of Community Health said it might have to lay off workers to meet the edict.

“I look forward to hearing why these cuts are necessary in a growing state with a lean budget and $2.55 billion in rainy day funds,” said Democratic state Rep. Sam Park.

Pressed on that question, Kemp criticized “political posturing” surrounding his orders to cut spending.

“They would be complaining if I took money out of the rainy day fund and kept the budget where it is,” he said. “We’re asking people to make government smaller and more efficient, and I believe you can do that without hurting services and programs.”

"DOJ moves to add more marijuana growers for research - WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio | Columbus News, Weather & Sports",https://www.10tv.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.10tv.com/article/doj-moves-add-more-marijuana-growers-research-2019-aug,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Justice Department is moving forward to expand the number of marijuana growers for federally-authorized cannabis research.

Uttam Dhillon, the acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, says Monday's move would give researchers a wider variety of cannabis to study. He says the DEA supports additional marijuana research.

The DEA says the number of people registered to conduct research with marijuana and extracts has jumped more than 40 percent in the last two years. The agency is also planning to propose new regulations to govern the marijuana growers' program.

Researchers at federally-funded entities have faced legal barriers in recent years because marijuana remains illegal under federal law, even as a growing number of states have legalized medical and so-called recreational marijuana."
"Pro Farmer National Corn, Soybean Yield Estimate Below USDA Forecast",https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/pro-farmer-national-corn-soybean-yield-estimate-below-usda-forecast,"Corn: 13.358 billion bu.; Average yield of 163.3 bu. per acre

Corn +/- 1% = 13.492 billion bu. to 13.224 billion bu.; 164.9 bu. to 161.7 bu. per acre

Soybeans: 3.497 billion bu.; Average yield of 46.1 bu. per acre

Soybeans +/- 2% = 3.567 billion bu. to 3.427 billion bu.; 47.0 bu. to 45.2 bu. per acre

The national estimates above reflect Pro Farmer’s view on production and yields. They take into account data gathered during Crop Tour and other factors, such as crop maturity, acreage adjustments we’ve made, historical differences in Tour data versus USDA’s final yields, areas outside those sampled on Crop Tour, etc. That’s why the state yield numbers below differ from the Crop Tour figures.

Thousands of farmers, agribusiness executives and national and local media attended a series of meetings across the Midwest this week as part of the annual Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour. The Crop Tour focused on crop conditions going into the final stretch of the 2019 growing season.

Pro Farmer, a division of Farm Journal, shared its much-anticipated production estimates for the 2019 U.S. corn and soybean crops after analyzing information from the 27th annual tour and other sources.

The Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour unveiled the stresses the corn and soybean crops faced following an excessively wet spring and record-slow planting pace this year. Scouts on Crop Tour sampled around 3,000 fields across the Corn Belt in seven of the nation’s most important corn and soybean states.

Pro Farmer estimates the 2019 U.S. corn crop at 13.358 billion bushels, based on an average yield of 163.3 bu. per acre. That compares to USDA’s Aug. 1 estimate of 169.5 bu. per acre. For soybeans, the Pro Farmer production estimate is 3.497 billion bushels, with a national average yield of 46.1 bu. per acre, down from the 48.5 bu. per acre USDA estimated in August.

“Ear counts were lower than last year in all of the Crop Tour states as a result of the rough spring conditions,” said Brian Grete, Pro Farmer editor. “We also found a corn crop that was, in many cases, multiple weeks behind in maturity due to the record-slow planting.”

Jeff Wilson, Pro Farmer’s senior market analyst, said, “Soybean pod counts in a 3-foot by 3-foot square were down sharply across the

EPA ordered to set stronger smog standards,https://thehill.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458608-epa-ordered-to-set-stronger-smog-standards,"A federal appeals court has ruled in a case battling Obama-era pollution regulations that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must set stronger regulations on smog in order to protect the environment.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that while the EPA's current air quality standards for ozone are too weak to protect the environment, the standards do meet federal requirements when it comes to protecting human health.

Seth Johnson, an attorney who argued the case on behalf of Earthjustice, said the case gets to the heart of the Clean Air Act’s requirement that the EPA protect forests and natural landscapes from the ozone damage that can inhibit their growth.

The EPA “must go back and fix its mistakes so cherished natural spaces like national parks can thrive,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT

But advocates warned that a win for park was not necessarily a win for people.

“We are disappointed that the court failed to recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence showing ozone’s potential to cause premature death, difficulty breathing, wheezing and coughing, and asthma attacks at levels previously considered safe,” Harold P. Wimmer, national president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. “Such evidence demands that EPA adopt stronger, more protective standards, not backslide on the progress being made toward cleaning up the air we breathe.”

While ozone helps create a protective layer in the stratosphere to protect the earth from the sun’s ultraviolet light, when at ground-level, the gas can contribute to asthma attacks and other respiratory issues.

The suit was initially brought by Murray Energy Corporation, one of the largest coal companies in the U.S.

Environmentalists and Democrats alike said the suit showed the importance of scientific evidence at trial.

Johnson said data from the EPA helped it make its case in portions of the suit, while a lack of scientific data hindered it in other areas of the case.

The court also rejected the argument from industry groups that the EPA should consider costs incurred by industry groups as they try to comply with regulations.

"New VA drug aims to 'make a dent' in vet suicide crisis, Secretary Wilkie says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Melissa Leon'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/va-drug-veteran-suicide-robert-wilkie,"Twenty-two American veterans are said to die by suicide every day, and the Department of Veterans Affairs is taking a step to fight that sobering statistic at the request of President Trump.

The president on Wednesday said he instructed the VA to place a substantial order of Spravato, which is used to help treat depression in patients who might not have seen results from other treatments or drugs, although some medical experts have said the drug's effectiveness is not entirely clear.

Spravato would be part of a new combination of drugs administered in spray form, VA Secretary Robert Wilkie told Fox News on Thursday morning, noting that the VA has prescribed Spravato for years “but in intravenous form and under the supervision of anesthesiologists.”

“What we’re doing now is transitioning to the nasal spray,” Wilkie said on “America’s Newsroom.” “It’s still under the supervision of anesthesiologists at [the] VA, but FDA has approved the combination of several drugs and Spravato [as] a means to combat depression.”

VETERAN WALKS FROM WASHINGTON STATE TO DISNEY WORLD TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR SUICIDE AMONG SERVICE MEMBERS

“We are doing everything we can to address the issues involving depression and mental health. I’ve said many times that we’ve not even had that national conversation about mental health that we desperately need,” Wilkie stressed, pointing also to addiction and homelessness.

“It’s in its opening stages when it comes to that combination of drugs the FDA has approved for us, to see if we can make a dent in depression,” Wilkie told Fox News’ Jon Scott and Sandra Smith.

On Wednesday, before departing for the American Veterans (AMVETS) national convention in Kentucky, President Trump told reporters he had instructed the VA to buy “a lot” of Spravato.

“There’s a product that’s made right now that just came out by Johnson & Johnson which has a tremendously positive, pretty short-term, but nevertheless a positive effect,” Trump said, McClatchy reported. “I’ve instructed the head of the VA to go out and buy a lot of it, and we are buying a lot of it.”

At the AMVETS convention, Trump said there’s been no issue more urgent than the veteran suicide crisis.

“My administration is determined to do everything in our power to save the lives of our heroes,” Trump said.

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER CANCELLING STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR DISABLED VETERANS

The president said earlier at the White House that he hopes the VA is “getting [the medication] at a very good cost” from Johnson & Johnson.

One dose of Spravato is $295, according to McClatchy; a patient’s total daily cost could be more than $700 if they need two and a half sprays, which is common. Since the Food and Drug Administration has approved the treatment for the VA, Medicare and Medicaid would cover 65 percent of each dose, McClatchy noted.

Wilkie told Fox News on Thursday that a veteran can be given the Spravato nasal spray if his or her doctor and team approve its use.

Senior DHS official exits amid department leadership changes,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/dhs-andrew-meehan-leaving/index.html,"(CNN) A senior official in the Department of Homeland Security will leave the agency next month, marking the latest top DHS official to leave the administration in recent months.

Acting DHS public affairs Assistant Secretary Andrew Meehan decided to resign two weeks ago and his last day will be Sept. 20, according to a DHS official. Meehan has been a close confidant of acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, joining him at DHS headquarters to run the public affairs office.

Meehan, who also oversaw public affairs at Customs and Border Protection, is the latest public affairs official expected to leave the department. Earlier this week, Customs and Border Protection press secretary Katharine Gorka told CNN she was leaving her post at the end of the week. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Assistant Director of Public Affairs Carol Danko recently left the agency amid pressure from DHS, according to a source familiar with the decision.

Meehan's departure comes amid speculation that McAleenan won't last in the secretary role. Earlier this summer, McAleenan went to the White House prepared to resign, CNN reported. He was concerned about an immigration enforcement operation and felt he was being undermined by subordinate immigration hardliners who had a direct line to the President.

Meehan is in Panama this week with McAleenan for a ministerial meeting focused on enhancing regional cooperation and combating irregular migration. This, after a tense week between the White House and DHS over the rollout of a new rule on migrant children in government custody , according to a source familiar with the matter. The source said the White House had asked McAleenan to delay his departure for Panama to hold a news conference about the rule.

Meehan's resignation was not connected to the rollout, according to a source.

A separate source familiar with the situation told CNN that ""micromanagement by White House officials have made it close to impossible for the department to carry out its mission.""

Senior policy adviser Stephen ""Miller and others will bypass leadership and communicate directly with lower level staff whom they view as controllable and direct actions. No organization can operate that way and we should expect more senior officials to leave,"" the source said.

CORRECTION: This story has been updated to add ""acting"" to Meehan's job title as DHS public affairs assistant secretary."
Can Trump Actually Buy Greenland? The Short Answer Is No,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Nick Rigillo', 'Morten Buttler', 'August At Pm']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/can-trump-actually-buy-greenland-the-short-answer-is-no/2019/08/21/ec08c1d2-c3f4-11e9-8bf7-cde2d9e09055_story.html,"ILULISSAT, GREENLAND - AUGUST 04: In this view from an airplane icebergs float at the mouth of the Ilulissat Icefjord on August 04, 2019 near Ilulissat, Greenland.

U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed an interest in buying Greenland, the world’s biggest island and a self-ruling territory of Denmark. While the seriousness of his intentions is unclear -- and the response from the other side of the imagined transaction was a sturdy “no” -- the proposal raises questions as to whether such a transaction is even feasible.

1. Why would Trump want to buy Greenland?

A real estate baron before his turn to politics, Trump has a history of analyzing geopolitical issues through the lens of a property developer. During his 2018 meeting with Kim Jong Un, for example, Trump spoke of the potential he sees for beach hotels and condos in North Korea. Plus, as Trump surely knows, other U.S. presidents have made their mark in history for such grand ideas.

2. Why is Greenland interesting for the U.S.?

Besides being bigger than Mexico and Saudi Arabia, Greenland has abundant resources and a strategic location near the warming Arctic. Located in the northern Atlantic Ocean between Europe and America, the island has long been a nexus of tensions among the U.S., Russia, Canada, Denmark and Norway. It’s already home to a strategic U.S. air base and radar station. In 1968, a B-52 bomber carrying nuclear weapons crashed near the Thule base in northwestern Greenland, causing radioactive contamination. More recently, Denmark stopped China from gaining a foothold on its territory by agreeing to co-fund the construction of two new airports.

3. Is the idea totally outlandish?

Until a century ago, these kinds of transactions were not unusual: The U.S. bought the territory of Louisiana from France for $15 million in 1803, and Andrew Johnson is remembered as the president who oversaw the acquisition of Alaska from Russia in 1867. There’s even a precedent involving Denmark. The government in Copenhagen sold what are now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1917. There are in fact plenty of other islands for sale, but they tend to be smaller and located in warmer climates. But as the BBC points out, Joseph Blocher of the Duke University School of Law wrote in 2012 that the “market for sovereign territory seems to have dried up” as it does “not seem to be for sale.”

4. How much would Greenland cost to buy?

Since the 830,000 square-mile (2.1 million square-kilometer) island isn’t currently on the market, there are no valuations available. However, for a sense of how much it might fetch, it’s worth noting that its gross domestic product totaled just over $2.7 billion in 2017. The island receives an annual subsidy of about $500 million from Denmark. For perspective, the purchase price of Alaska in 1867, $7.2 million, would translate to just $125 million today -- which most would agree would be quite a bargain.

5. How would Trump go about buying Greenland?

It’s unclear. Adjunct Professor Rasmus Leander Nielsen of Greenland University has told local media that Denmark can’t sell Greenland because its home-rule law of 2009 “clearly states that Greenlanders are their own people.” Trump’s best hope would be for the territory to gain independence and then choose to arrange a sale to the U.S. As it turns out, breaking away from Denmark has been discussed in Greenland, where advocates of independence have touted 2021, the 300th anniversary of colonization, as a possible leave date. One argument in favor of independence is that Greenland should have a closer association with North America, which is much nearer than Denmark.

6. Could Trump do this on his own?

Under the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Congress would have to approve money for any such purchase. But Trump has shown a willingness to try to go around Congress’s power of the purse. When it refused to appropriate money for more fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump raided the Pentagon’s budget to find funds for it -- and the Supreme Court backed him up.

7. What might the next step be?

According to the New York Times, skeptical Trump advisers have told him they would investigate the matter further, but only because they’d rather not tell him that the purchase is impossible. Trump would have had an opportunity to discuss the matter personally with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, but the president canceled his planned Sept. 2-3 state visit to Denmark after his Greenland scheme was rebuked.

Controversial husband and wife EPA duo to leave Washington,https://thehill.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458605-controversial-husband-and-wife-epa-duo-to-leave-washington,"A controversial husband and wife political duo is leaving the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) D.C. office after nearly two years working there during the Trump administration.

Henry Darwin and his wife Veronica will leave Washington and return to their home state of Arizona, EPA head Andrew Wheeler Andrew Wheeler Five things to watch as Trump heads to G-7 summit Controversial husband and wife EPA duo to leave Washington The Hill's Morning Report - Trump touts new immigration policy, backtracks on tax cuts MORE wrote in an internal announcement sent to staff Friday afternoon obtained by The Hill.

Henry Darwin joined EPA as chief of operations under former Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittControversial husband and wife EPA duo to leave Washington Environmentalists renew bid to overturn EPA policy barring scientists from advisory panels Six states sue EPA over pesticide tied to brain damage MORE and was promoted to deputy administrator under Wheeler last July.

While negotiating his job at EPA in May 2017, Henry Darwin also pitched a role for his wife, who he called a “legitimate environmental professional,"" according to internal emails obtained by ABC.

""It would help our financial decision immensely,"" Darwin wrote to EPA Chief of staff Ryan Jackson in the email. ""If not out of the question, I would be happy to forward her resume and references (which I would suggest you check - everyone loves her almost as much as I do).""

The former Arizona state official’s wife Veronica Darwin was later hired to be a senior adviser to the administrator for Land and Emergency Management.

Pruitt later came under fire for using his position at EPA to try to get jobs for close acquaintances, including a clerking internship for his daughter at the White House and a job for his wife opening up a Chick-fil-A franchise.

Wheeler in his email Friday said Henry Darwin will be stepping down from his role and will once again take the title of assistant deputy administrator at EPA. In the role he will “concentrate on the deployment of EPA’s Lean Management System (ELMS)” which he will do from Arizona.

“Given the amount of time he already spends traveling to the regional offices to deploy ELMS, his relocation to Phoenix should not impact his ability to help us become even more effective in carrying out our very important mission. In addition, Henry will be here at headquarters on a regular basis,” Wheeler wrote.

Wheeler announced Veronica Darwin left the agency on Aug. 9.

“While at EPA, Veronica managed implementation of the Superfund Task Force recommendations, and led other Administrator priorities like children’s health, and the development of the action plan for lead. These key initiatives will remain Administrator priorities, however Veronica’s leadership will be greatly missed,” wrote Wheeler.

When contacted, EPA did not provide details about the nature of the departures. An EPA spokesperson later hailed Veronica Darwin's 18 years of professional experience.

""Veronica Darwin has spent more than 18 years working extensively on environmental waste issues that included roles as a compliance officer at EPA’s Region 9 office (7 years) and as deputy division director for the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s Waste Divisions Program (total of 8 years),"" EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said.

""To only refer to her as Henry’s wife does a disservice to Veronica, but the incredible work she has done her whole career.""
