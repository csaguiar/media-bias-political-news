Trump seizes on NYU professor’s tweet to push change of libel laws,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-seizes-on-nyu-professors-tweet-to-push-change-of-libel-laws,"President Trump on Monday seized on a New York University professor’s false tweet as an example of journalistic malpractice while calling for the U.S. to modify its libel laws to hold news media accountable.

In his early morning tweet while on an overseas trip to Japan, the president said a fake quote attributed to him by Ian Bremmer shows “what’s going on in the age of Fake News.”

“People think they can say anything and get away with it,” Trump wrote. “Really, the libel laws should be changed to hold Fake News Media accountable!”

Bremmer, who is the president and founder of Eurasia Group and a political science professor at NYU, got into trouble Sunday for tweeting a fake quote attributed to Trump.

“Kim Jong Un is smarter and would make a better President than Sleepy Joe Biden,” Bremmer wrote in the now-deleted tweet, attributing it to Trump.

NYU POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR BLASTED FOR TWEETING FAKE TRUMP QUOTE, CALLING IT 'PLAUSIBLE'

North Korea has labeled Biden a “fool of low IQ” and an “imbecile bereft of elementary quality as a human being” after the U.S. presidential hopeful recently called North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a tyrant during a recent speech.

Bremmer later reportedly responded in a now-deleted tweet: “This is objectively a completely ludicrous quote. And yet kinda plausible. Especially on twitter, where people automatically support whatever political position they have. That's the point.”

On Monday, Bremmer issued an apology via Twitter, saying the quote was meant ""in jest.""

""My tweet yesterday about Trump preferring Kim Jong Un to Biden as President was meant in jest,"" he wrote. ""The President correctly quoted me as saying it was a 'completely ludicrous' statement. I should have been clearer. My apologies.""

Before his apology on Monday, Bremmer was called out on Twitter by many notables.

Canadian journalist Daniel Dale tweeted: “This quote is fabricated. As often, no idea what Bremmer is doing.”

Geopolitics analyst Ankit Panda tweeted: “This is not a real Trump quote … If you’re basing your views of reality based on Ian Bremmer’s tweets in 2019, please reconsider.”

Trump has said in the past that he intended on taking a “strong look at our country’s libel laws.”

Brian Hauss, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement January that Trump’s threat lacks teeth.

“There is no federal libel law, and the president does not have the authority to change state libel laws,” he said, adding that the “First Amendment provides strong protections against libel liability, particularly with respect to statements about public figures or matters of public concern.”

""Kim Jong-Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low IQ individual. He probably is based on his record. I think I agree with him on that,"" Trump said.

Trump was asked if he is siding with a dictator over a fellow citizen and former U.S. vice president. Trump responded that he doesn’t take sides and, on foreign soil, went on to call the Obama administration a ""disaster.""

“I can tell you that Joe Biden was a disaster, his administration with President Obama, they were basically a disaster when it came to so many things,"" the president said. ""Whether it was economy, whether it was military, defense, no matter what it was. They had a lot of problems. So I'm not a fan.""

Despite Trump and Abe saying that they are on the same page when it comes to North Korea, Trump has downplayed the North's recent missile tests -- drawing a sharp contrast to the assessment of his own national security advisor and his Japanese host.

North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2019

“My people think it could have been a violation, as you know,"" the president said. ""I view it differently. I view it as a man, perhaps he wants to get attention, and perhaps not. Who knows? It doesn't matter. All I know is that there have been no nuclear tests. There have been no ballistic missiles going out. There have been no long-range missiles going out. And I think that someday we'll have a deal.""

Yet the president’s national security adviser John Bolton said that the recent missile tests are “no doubt” violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions.

Trump said he is in “no rush” for North Korea to denuclearize.

“I am very happy with the way it's going. And intelligent people agree,” he added, praising Kim as a “smart man.”

The president will be back in Japan at the end of next month for the G-20 summit as a trade war with China looms. Though Trump said in the press conference today that the U.S. is not ready to make a trade deal with China, the president’s economic advisor said earlier this month that there is a “strong possibility” of a meeting between Trump and Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, at the meeting."

TRUMP SEIZES ON NYU PROFESSOR’S TWEET TO PUSH CHANGE OF LIBEL LAWS

In tweets from Japan, where he is meeting with leaders over the Memorial Day holiday, the president ripped Democrats as “obstructionists” and questioned their rationale for trying to remove him from office.

“Impeach for what, having created perhaps the greatest Economy in our Country’s history, rebuilding our Military, taking care of our Vets (Choice), Judges, Best Jobs Numbers Ever, and much more?” Trump said. “Dems are Obstructionists!”

In another tweet, Trump referenced Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s completed investigation on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and said, “The Dems are getting NOTHING done in Congress! They only want a Do-Over on Mueller!”

Trump’s tweet about impeachment was in response to comments made on Sunday by freshman Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a vocal proponent of impeachment. During an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Tlaib said she believes House Democrats are “moving towards” pursuing articles of impeachment.

TRUMP, BOLTON APPEAR TO DIFFER ON SIGNIFICANCE OF NORTH KOREA MISSILE TEST

“Look, this is not about the 2020 election,” Tlaib said. “It's about doing what's right now for our country.”

The Republican National Committee hit back at Tlaib over her comments, saying she “continues to obsess over impeachment.""

”Democrats want to impeach @realDonaldTrump because they don’t have any other message heading into 2020 and they’re scared they can’t beat him at the ballot box,” tweeted RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has resisted calls to begin impeachment proceedings, questioning the political wisdom of it. But she has been facing increasing pressure from members inside her caucus to reverse course, amid frustration over the Trump administration's resistance to congressional subpoenas for information related to Mueller's probe."

But how big is that tailwind? Fortunately, economists have worked hard to develop models for predicting election outcomes, and according to one of the best of these, it should be quite large.

One of the first — and perhaps still the best — of these models was created by Ray Fair, a professor at Yale. He found that the growth rates of gross domestic product and inflation have been the two most important economic predictors — but he also found that incumbency was also an important determinant of presidential election outcomes."
A hefty donation to Trump's inaugural comes under scrutiny,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/hefty-donation-trumps-inaugural-scrutiny-63302497,"Real estate mogul Franklin Haney contributed $1 million to President Donald Trump's inaugural committee and all he's got to show for the money is the glare of a federal investigation.

The contribution from Haney, a prolific political donor, came as he was seeking regulatory approval and financial support from the government for his long-shot bid to acquire the mothballed Bellefonte Nuclear Power Plant in northeastern Alabama. More than two years later, he still hasn't closed the deal.

His tale is a familiar one in Washington, where lobbyists and wealthy donors use their checkbooks to try to sway politicians. It's a world Haney is accustomed to operating in and one that Trump came into office pledging to upend. Yet Trump has left in place many of the familiar ways to wield influence.

Haney's hefty donation to Trump's inaugural committee is being scrutinized by federal prosecutors in New York who are investigating the committee's finances. Their probe is focused in part on whether donors received benefits after making contributions.

Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, has given prosecutors information regarding Haney, his son and business associate, Frank Haney Jr., and the nuclear plant project, according to a person familiar with what Cohen told the authorities. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity.

Haney had briefly hired Cohen to help obtain money for the Bellefonte project from potential investors, including the Middle Eastern country of Qatar. Cohen is now serving a three-year prison sentence for tax evasion, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations.

Haney and his attorney did not respond to interview requests.

Prosecutors also are examining whether foreigners unlawfully contributed to the committee. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan issued a subpoena last year seeking a wide range of financial records from the committee, including any ""communications regarding or relating to the possibility of donations by foreign nationals.""

The inaugural committee has denied wrongdoing and said its funds were fully accounted for.

Haney, 79, has previously faced accusations that his political gift giving is aimed at cultivating influence. An investigation by House Republicans in the late 1990s alleged that Haney's money and his political pull with senior Clinton administration officials helped him to get the Federal Communications Commission to move into an office building that he had a major stake in. Haney denied any wrongdoing and the Justice Department declined to pursue the matter.

But he was charged in 1999 with funneling about $100,000 in illegal contributions to President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and other politicians, then acquitted. A federal prosecutor described Haney as a sophisticated fundraiser who hoped to impress potential business clients with his access to elected officials, like Clinton and Gore.

Haney's family-owned real estate business donated thousands of dollars in 2013 and 2015 to political action committees that supported Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, who later recommended that the nuclear plant Haney wanted to buy be put up for sale. Haney also contributed to a nonprofit created to promote Bentley's agenda. The Republican governor resigned in 2017 as he faced impeachment proceedings after an alleged affair with an aide.

In addition to the investigation into Haney's contribution to the Trump inaugural committee, Haney is in an unrelated legal battle with the nuclear plant's owner, the Tennessee Valley Authority. Another Haney company, Nuclear Development LLC, has filed a lawsuit in federal court accusing the TVA, the nation's largest public utility, of illegally blocking the plant's sale to him at the last minute. The utility has argued it couldn't complete the transaction because Haney failed to get the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval for transfer of the construction permits.

A tentative Bellefonte sale in November 2016 involved two partially constructed nuclear reactors and the supporting cooling towers, several other buildings and more than 1,000 acres of land on the Tennessee River. Haney put down $22 million and had until November 2018 to complete the $111-million sale.

On Nov. 29, the day before the sale was to be closed, the TVA scrapped the deal, declaring that Haney's company had not yet secured regulatory approval as required by the Atomic Energy Act. Haney filed a breach of contract lawsuit.

In early April, about five months after Nuclear Development submitted its application for transfer of the construction permits, the regulatory commission's staff told the company it needed to submit more technical details before it could proceed.

Edwin Lyman, a nuclear power expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the response reflected skepticism about whether Haney's company ""is serious about or capable of actually undertaking this project or just wants to put the license in its pocket for purposes unknown.""

But Lyman added the five-member nuclear regulatory board is dominated by Trump appointees and may not want to be seen by Congress and the Trump administration as throwing up roadblocks to a nuclear power expansion.

Haney's Nuclear Development company also has applied to the U.S. Energy Department for financing assistance on the project. The department said it considers the loan application process to be ""business sensitive"" and declined to comment.

Stephen Smith, executive director of the nonprofit Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said Haney faces too many technical and financial hurdles to overcome.

For example, Bellefonte's never-completed nuclear reactors are decades old and are of a unique design that has never received an operating license in the U.S. before. He compared Bellefonte to a Ford Pinto, a 1970s-era vehicle with serious engineering flaws. Smith said it's ""extraordinarily unlikely"" Bellefonte will be allowed to operate.

"Trump awards ""President's Cup"" at prestigious sumo tournament in Japan",https://www.cbsnews.com,[],05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-awards-presidents-cup-at-prestigious-sumo-tournament-in-japan-today-2019-05-26/,"Mobara, Japan — President Trump presented a special Trump trophy to the winner of a sumo tournament in Tokyo on Sunday as he got a taste of one of Japan's most treasured cultural institutions.

The honor given to Mr. Trump was part of a charm offensive Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe continued Sunday as he courted the president with three things close to his heart: wrestling matches, cheeseburgers and golf.

Call it sumo diplomacy.

The president, first lady Melania Trump, Abe and his wife, Akie, joined an estimated 11,500 fans who packed Ryogoku Kokugikan Stadium to watch oversized, muscular men battling in loincloths.

At the end, Mr. Trump stepped into the ring and presented the eagle-topped ""President's Cup"" to champion wrestler Asanoyama, making him the first American president to participate. Shoes aren't permitted in the sumo ring, but Mr. Trump wore dark-colored slippers.

""That was something to see these great athletes,"" Mr. Trump said before dinner at a Hibachi restaurant.

Mr. Trump's four-day state visit to Japan is designed to demonstrate the strength of the bond between the nations. The president received a warm welcome as he arrived at Mobara Country Club, south of Tokyo, for a steamy morning round of golf with the Japanese leader. It was their fifth golf outing.

Abe is pulling out all the stops as he seeks to placate Mr. Trump amid growing U.S.-Japan trade tensions and the threat of auto tariffs. Japan is also contending with the continued threat of North Korea and Mr. Trump's apparent dismissal of Pyongyang's recent tests of short-range missiles that could reach Japan.

But minus several antagonistic tweets, Sunday was all about bromance and keeping Mr. Trump happy.

First it was the golf course, where Mr. Trump and Abe played 16 holes, joined by Japanese professional golfer Isao Aoki. Aoki, who is famous for his putting technique, was expected to present Mr. Trump with a putter he designed.

On the lunch menu: Double cheeseburgers made with U.S. beef.

Next, Abe introduced Mr. Trump to Japan's ancient sport of sumo wrestling — something Mr. Trump has said he said he finds ""fascinating.""

The president was welcomed to the stadium with loud applause and sat ringside at the match in a low-back, breaking the custom of sitting cross-legged on a mat. Once it was done, Mr. Trump climbed on stage to present his cup to wrestler Asanoyama, who clinched the tournament win on Saturday.

Mr. Trump read from a scroll, praising Asanoyama's ""outstanding achievement"" and then hoisted the hefty cup, which the White House said stands 54 inches tall and weighs 60 to 70 pounds, into Asanoyama's arms with the help of an official.

Asanoyama was presented with a trophy by Abe and an emperor's trophy as well.

The president's attendance at the annual summer sumo tournament in Tokyo might have recalled memories of time he spent promoting the World Wrestling Federation. Mr. Trump sponsored major events, appeared in bits and was inducted into the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2013.

On Monday, Mr. Trump will receive another honor when he becomes the first foreign leader to meet with Japan's new emperor, Naruhito, since he ascended to the throne on May 1. Mr. Trump and Abe will also meet in a more formal setting and participate in a joint news conference. In the evening, Mr. Trump will be guest of honor at a banquet hosted by the emperor at Japan's Imperial Palace.

""We've had a great time, a great stay, and tomorrow is really the big event, a very important event in the history of Japan,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It's over 200 years since something like this has happened so it's a great honor to be representing the United States.""

The Abe-Trump bromance began even before Mr. Trump took office when Abe rushed to New York to greet the president-elect at Trump Tower. Japan is deeply dependent on the U.S. for security and Abe has tried to encourage Trump to maintain international agreements and keep pressure on North Korea.

Golf, in particular, has been a bonding activity for the leaders, who both love the game.

""We were able to exchange our views frankly in a cozy atmosphere. It was wonderful,"" Abe told reporters as he returned to his official residence mid-day. He tweeted a selfie photo of him and Mr. Trump, smiling widely on the greens.

Mr. Trump tweeted that he'd had ""Great fun and meeting with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo,"" but also continued to stew about domestic politics, claiming that, ""Numerous Japanese officials told me that the Democrats would rather see the United States fail than see me or the Republican Party succeed - Death Wish!""

There has long been a tradition of American presidents and candidates holding their tongues about rivals while on foreign soil — but Mr. Trump is not one to abide by such norms.

Earlier, Mr. Trump had gone after one of his potential Democratic rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, saying he'd smiled when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse.""

He also downplayed North Korea's recent series of short-range missile tests. He tweeted that the tests weren't a concern for him — even though they most certainly are for Japan, due to the country's proximity to the North.

""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,"" Mr. Trump wrote in a message that appeared to undermine his national security adviser, John Bolton, who told reporters Saturday the tests violated U.N. Security Council resolutions.

The president also sought to manage expectations that he and Abe will make significant headway on trade issues when they hold more formal talks on Monday. Mr. Trump has been seeking a bilateral trade agreement with Tokyo since he pulled the U.S. out of the multinational Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement two years ago, though analysts expect no breakthroughs during Mr. Trump's visit.

""Great progress being made in our Trade Negotiations with Japan. Agriculture and beef heavily in play. Much will wait until after their July elections where I anticipate big numbers!"" he wrote, referring to Japan's upcoming parliamentary elections.

The Trump administration has been threatening Japan with new tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts on national security grounds. Mr. Trump has suggested he will impose tariffs if the U.S. can't wrest concessions from Japan and the European Union. In April, Japan's trade surplus surged almost 18% to 723 billion yen ($6.6 billion)."

""I want all the documents around the FISA warrant application released. I want to find out exactly how the counterintelligence operation began. I think transparency is good for the American people. Not one Democrat seems to care.""

""Did they lie to the FISA court? Every American should want to find that out.""





And joining us now from South Carolina, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.



Senator, President Trump, as we just reported, has given Attorney General Barr, quote, full and complete authority to get in declassify all government secrets related to the Russia investigation. Here is the president.



DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I declassified everything, everything they want. I put it under the auspices of the attorney general. He's going to be in charge of it.



WALLACE: Senator, any problem with that?



SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: No, not at all from my point of view. I was one of the Republicans insisting that Mueller be allowed to do his job.

So, I support Attorney General Barr to make this as transparent as possible.



WALLACE: Critics make two points, particularly about this issue of declassifying, because these are, after all, the crown jewels of the intelligence community, including reportedly the identity of a key informant who is close to Vladimir Putin.



Here are the two questions that they raised: One, can Barr be trusted with these secrets? And two, can he be trusted not to cherry-pick the information to make a case for the president?



GRAHAM: Well, I think he can be trusted. I’m going to look at this. You know, nobody doubted my trust or my ability to be fair when I supported Mueller.



The people who are about this are worried about being exposed for taking the law in their own hands. It doesn't surprise me that the people we are looking at, they don't want transparency.



We’re not compromising national security here. We’re trying to create a system to make sure this never happens again by shedding light on what happened with the FISA warrant process, the counterintelligence investigation. Did they have a lawful reason to surveil President Trump's campaign? Did they lie to the FISA court?

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The Associated Press

By HOPE YEN and CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — Boastful on the occasion of Memorial Day, President Donald Trump and his Veterans Affairs secretary are claiming full credit for health care improvements that were underway before they took office.

Trump said he passed a private-sector health care program, Veterans Choice, after failed attempts by past presidents for the last ""45 years."" That's not true. The Choice program, which allows veterans to see doctors outside the government-run VA system at taxpayer expense, was first passed in 2014 under President Barack Obama.

Trump's VA secretary, Robert Wilkie, also is distorting the facts. Faulting previous ""bad leadership"" at VA, Wilkie suggested it was his own efforts that improved waiting times at VA medical centers and brought new offerings of same-day mental health service. The problem: The study cited by Wilkie on wait times covers the period from 2014 to 2017, before Wilkie took the helm as VA secretary. Same-day mental health services at VA were started during the Obama administration under Wilkie's predecessor, David Shulkin.

The half-truths and exaggerations came in a week when selective accounting was a norm in Trump's rhetoric, extending into his trip to Japan , where he inflated the drop in the U.S. unemployment rate for women.

A look at the claims, about the Russia investigation, the border, drug prices and more:

VETERANS

TRUMP: ""We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability to give our veterans the care that they deserve and they have been trying to pass these things for 45 years."" — Montoursville, Pennsylvania, rally on May 20.

THE FACTS: Wrong. Trump is not the first president in 45 years to get Congress to pass Veterans Choice; Obama did it in the wake of a scandal at VA's medical center in Phoenix, where some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles (65 kilometers) to a VA facility.

Trump did expand eligibility for the program. Now, starting June 6, veterans are to have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive is only 30 minutes.

Still, VA's top health official, Dr. Richard Stone, described the new program's start to ""almost be a non-event"" in testimony to Congress. That's in part because wait times in the private sector are typically longer than at VA. In 2018, 34 percent of all VA appointments were with outside physicians, down from 36 percent in 2017.

Also key to the Choice program's success is an overhaul of VA's electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of them with private physicians, a process expected to take up to 10 years. Wilkie has said full implementation of the expanded Choice program is ""years"" away.

WILKIE: ""The first thing I did was change out the leadership at VA. ... (The president) also allowed me to change out leadership in the VA centers. If someone wasn't walking the post, getting to know the people who work for her or him, or getting to know those veterans, they had to leave. And, as a result, the Journal of the American Medical Association this year said that our waiting times are now as good or better than any in the private sector."" — interview Thursday with Fox News.

THE FACTS: It's true that a study by the medical association came out in January that found wait times at VA medical centers on average were better than the private sector. But the improvement wasn't a ""result"" of anything that Wilkie did: The study involved a period largely covering the Obama administration — and before Wilkie became acting VA secretary in late March 2018.

In fact, in a VA press release in January announcing the study's results, Wilkie credits the department's ""concerted"" effort to improve access to care ""since 2014.""

The study covered four specialties, primary care, dermatology, cardiology and orthopedics.

It found that in 2014, the average wait time at VA medical centers was 22.5 days, compared with 18.7 days in the private sector, which was not statistically different. By 2017, the wait time at VA improved to 17.7 days, while increasing to 29.8 days for private doctors. Wait times at VA medical centers were shorter in all specialties except orthopedics.

According to the study, the number of patients seen yearly in VA increased slightly between 2014 and 2017, to about 5.1 million. VA patient satisfaction also rose, according to patient surveys cited in the study.

___

WILKIE: The VA ""had suffered from bad leadership. And that's a bipartisan comment. And the second thing I had to do was make sure that as we approach our veteran population that we make sure that they are at the center, their needs are at the center of what we do ... I think we've had it backwards at VA for many years. ... One of the things that we're doing at VA is that we have same-day mental health service. ... It is huge."" — interview with Fox News.

THE FACTS: Same-day mental health service started at VA before Trump took office in January 2017, let alone Wilkie.

VA's effort to provide same-day primary and mental-health care when medically necessary at every VA medical center was publicized in April 2016 under the Obama administration. At the time, Shulkin was helping lead the effort as VA's top health official. By late 2016, the department's blog announced that the goal of same-day mental health services would be achieved by year's end.

A Dec. 23, 2016, article in the Harvard Business Review cites new same-day services at all VA hospitals as evidence of notable progress at the department. Shulkin, who was then named by Trump to be his VA secretary, told Congress in late January 2017 the services already were fully in place.

Trump selected Wilkie to be his VA secretary after firing Shulkin in March 2018 because of ethics charges and internal rebellion at the department over the role of private care for veterans. Trump's initial replacement choice, White House doctor Ronny Jackson, withdrew after allegations of workplace misconduct surfaced. While Wilkie has been credited by both parties in Congress for bringing stability to the department, the VA improvements he attributes to himself this past week are misplaced.

TRUMP, on the unemployment rate: ""With women, we have the best numbers we've had in now 71 years. That's going to be, very soon, a historic number, meaning the best ever."" — remarks Saturday with Japanese business leaders in Tokyo.

THE FACTS: The unemployment rate for women is not the best in 71 years.

According to the Labor Department, the women's unemployment rate fell last month to 3.1%. That's just the lowest since October 1953, or 66 years ago, when it also was 3.1%. The lowest on record was 2.4% in May 1953.

TRUMP: ""My Administration is achieving things that have never been done before, including unleashing perhaps the Greatest Economy in our Country's history."" — tweet Wednesday.

TRUMP: ""Most successful economy, perhaps, in our country's history."" — remarks to reporters Wednesday.

THE FACTS: The economy is solid but it's not one of the best in our country's history, no matter how many times he asserts it. Trump is also claiming full credit for an economic expansion that began under Obama in mid-2009.

The economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter of this year. That growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter.

In the late 1990s, growth topped 4 percent for four straight years, a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under Trump. Growth even reached 7.2 percent in 1984.

While the economy has shown strength, it grew 2.9% in 2018 - the same pace it reached in 2015 — and simply hasn't hit historically high growth rates.

TRUMP claims ""the best unemployment numbers in history."" — Pennsylvania rally on May 20.

THE FACTS: The 3.6% unemployment rate in the latest report is not the best in history. It's the lowest since 1969, when it was 3.5%. The U.S. also had lower rates than now in the early 1950s. And during three years of World War II, the annual rate was under 2%.

TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS

TRUMP: ""I don't do cover-ups."" — Rose Garden remarks Wednesday to reporters.

THE FACTS: Federal prosecutors may not agree with that assertion, which he made in response to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's accusation that the president was engaged in a cover-up. Trump spoke after breaking off an infrastructure meeting when Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., came to the White House for it.

Prosecutors' court filings in December said Trump directed his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to make payments to buy the silence of porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal during the 2016 presidential campaign. Both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which the White House denies.

In particular, the Justice Department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election. That assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws, which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions.

Trump has said the payments were ""a simple private transaction,"" not a campaign contribution.

Separately, the Mueller report found that Trump dictated his son Trump Jr.'s misleading statement about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower to cloak its purpose.

Cohen, who pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance crimes in connection with those payments, had previously implicated Trump. The department's filings backed up Cohen's claims.

The Mueller report said Trump learned in summer of 2017 that the news media planned to report on the meeting at Trump Tower between senior campaign officials and Russians offering derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.

Trump directed aides not to disclose the emails setting up the meeting. Before the emails became public, the president also edited a press statement for Donald Trump Jr. by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was ""with an individual who (Trump Jr.) was told might have information helpful to the campaign"" and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions.

That episode was among 10 identified by the Mueller investigation of possible obstruction of justice by Trump. Mueller said in his report that he could not conclusively determine that Trump had committed a crime or that he hadn't.

___

TRUMP: ""The greatest Hoax in American History."" — tweet Wednesday.

THE FACTS: A two-year investigation that produced guilty pleas, convictions and criminal charges against Russian intelligence officers and others with ties to the Kremlin, as well as Trump associates, is not a hoax.

Mueller charged 34 people, including the president's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and three Russian companies. Twenty-five Russians were indicted on charges related to election interference, accused either of hacking Democratic email accounts during the campaign or of orchestrating a social media campaign that spread disinformation on the internet.

Five Trump aides pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mueller, and a sixth, longtime confidant Roger Stone, is awaiting trial on charges he lied to Congress and engaged in witness tampering.

Mueller's report concluded that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was ""sweeping and systematic."" Ultimately, Mueller did not find a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign. But the special counsel didn't render judgment on whether Trump obstructed justice, saying his investigators found evidence on both sides.

TRUMP ON BIDEN

TRUMP, on Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden: ""He's not from Pennsylvania. I guess he was born here but he left you, folks. ... He left you for another state and he didn't take care of you because he didn't take care of your jobs. He let other countries come in and rip off America."" — Pennsylvania rally on May 20.

THE FACTS: It's true that Pennsylvania-born Biden left the state without taking care of jobs for the people he left behind. He was a boy, 10 or 11, when his family moved to Delaware in 1953.

___

TRADE

TRUMP on his trade dispute with China: ""I'll be honest, we are getting hundreds of millions of dollars brought into our country. We've never gotten 10 cents. We are getting hundreds of billions of dollars coming into our country."" — remarks to reporters Thursday.

THE FACTS: This is not true. The tariffs he's raised on imports from China are primarily if not entirely a tax on U.S. consumers and businesses, %href_on(file:

Trump Tweets Lose Their Sting: The President's Interaction Rates Have Plummeted Since He First Took Office,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Audrey Mcnamara'],05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-tweets-lose-their-sting-the-presidents-interaction-rates-have-plummeted-since-he-first-took-office,"Trump's Twitter presence is losing its sting. A measure of the president's “interaction rate” shows that the president has been packing less of a punch with each month he's been in office, according to data from CrowdTangle. Trump's interaction rate has fallen from 0.55 percent in November 2016, the month he was elected, to 0.16 percent so far this month. The metric measures retweets and likes per tweet divided by the size of his following. May is set to be the lowest month for Trump's Twitter interaction rate since January 2016. One explanation for the commander in chief's “bad ratio” could be that his inflammatory tweets, which were once novel, have now become customary. Attacking the FBI and accusing government officials of treason are near-daily tweet fodder for the president. Since April 1, Trump has tweeted the phrase “no collusion” 54 times, “no obstruction” 30 times, and “witch hunt” 20 times."

President Donald Trump’s declassification order Thursday night has set up a showdown between his own Justice Department and the intelligence community that could trigger resignations and threaten the CIA’s ability to conduct its core business — managing secret intelligence and sources.

Trump’s order directed intelligence agencies to fully comply with Attorney General William Barr’s look at “surveillance activities” during the 2016 election — a probe that Trump’s allies see as a necessary check on government overreach but that critics lambaste as an attempt to create the impression of scandal. Numerous former intelligence officials called the move “unprecedented,” saying it grants the attorney general sweeping powers over the nation’s secrets, subverts the intelligence community and raises troubling legal questions.

“There’s nothing CIA or NSA, for example, guards more jealously than sources and methods,” said Larry Pfeiffer, a 32-year intelligence veteran who served as the chief of staff to CIA Director Michael Hayden. “It is not hyperbole to say that lives are at stake.”

“I doubt any of the [CIA directors] or [directors of national intelligence] that I worked with would have sat by silently if their president contemplated or made such a decision,” added Pfeiffer, who also served as senior director of the White House Situation Room.

It’s the latest chapter in Trump’s rocky relationship with his own intelligence community. During the election, Trump cast doubt on Russia’s role in hacking Hillary Clinton’s campaign. As president, Trump has publicly disagreed with his own intelligence agencies on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, the threat posed by the Islamic State, the situation in Afghanistan and whether the Saudi crown prince ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The two sides have usually papered over their differences, but national security veterans said this time might be different.

“I could see something of a showdown happening here, where the CIA says, ‘We’re not comfortable with the declassification of this material and we won’t provide it without the assurance that you won’t declassify it,’” said a former senior Justice Department official who served under both Trump and President Barack Obama, and requested anonymity to discuss the directive more freely. “They feel that these are their sources, their connections.”

If that happened, Trump’s order leaves it unclear who would prevail.

Trump on Friday defended his decision as a pro-transparency move that will give the public insight into nefarious government activity. And he praised Barr as the ideal person to judge what should be released.

Barr is “a great gentleman and a highly respected man, so everything that they need is declassified and they’ll able to see how the hoax or witch hunt started and why it started,” Trump told reporters before leaving for a trip to Japan. “It was an attempted coup, an attempted takedown of the president of the United States.”

Later on Friday, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats issued a carefully worded statement, confirming that his agencies will turn over “all of the appropriate information” for the DOJ review. But, Coats added, “I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the [intelligence community] in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-sensitive classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk.”

Numerous national security veterans did not share Coats‘ confidence. They said Trump’s order has challenged those “long-established standards” and raised questions about how the government’s legal power structure might shift in the months and years ahead.

Under the National Security Act, a post-World War II overhaul of the country’s military and intelligence structure, intelligence agencies are legally required to protect the unauthorized declassification of their secretive sources and information-gathering tactics. But Trump’s directive seemingly gave the attorney general the power to determine what should be declassified, potentially upending decades of precedent.

“The president's memo effectively revises the executive order on classification and gives the AG the authority — previously assigned to the head of the agency that originated the information — to declassify information related to the election inquiry,” said Steven Aftergood, a classification expert who directs the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy.

While the order includes a caveat that the directive should not impair “the authority granted by law” to agency heads on classification, it also notes that Barr has to consult these agency heads only “to the extent he deems it practicable” about declassification decisions.

And if intelligence chiefs and Barr disagree on what to reveal, Trump retains final say.

“Does an agency head or the DNI have any recourse? Sure — a direct appeal to the president … or threatening to resign over a bad decision,” Pfeiffer said. “Neither is good governance.”

April Doss, who served in the NSA from 2003 to 2016 and as its head of intelligence law from 2014 to 2016, said she hoped Barr would consult with the intelligence community heads and heed their advice. “But under this memo he is not required to,” she noted.

And that has created a once-unthinkable situation for intelligence professionals — they could lose control of what remains a secret.

“I can’t remember a time when a non-IC officer was given declassification authority over intelligence information,” said Michael Morell, the former acting director of the CIA under Obama and the host of the Intelligence Matters podcast.

The result, Morell added, is a loss of faith in the U.S. intelligence system. “It is yet another step that will raise questions among our allies and partners about whether to share sensitive intelligence with us,” he said.

Particularly curious to many intelligence veterans and experts is the fact that Barr asked for this new authority from the president, as well as the breadth of the directive. The memo targets not only the FBI — which Trump has repeatedly accused of hatching a “deep state” plot to overthrow him — but also the CIA, which is fiercely protective of its sources and methods. In particular, Barr is seeking more information about the foreign sources the FBI used in 2016, according to a New York Times report.

The result is a shifting perception of the attorney general’s role.

Since Watergate era, the DOJ chief has been seen as the legal check on intelligence agency overreach, said David Kris, a former Obama-era head of DOJ’s national security division who also held a high-ranking DOJ position during the George W. Bush administration, and the founder of Culper Partners consulting firm.

“Now,” he added, “many observers have the opposite fear; that the AG, rather than the IC, is the real danger, the real threat to apolitical intelligence under law. Whether or not that fear is entirely valid, it is deeply concerning because it threatens the foundations of intelligence oversight that has protected us for more than 40 years.”

Steve Hall, a former CIA chief of Russian operations, said Trump’s actions are likely to have a chilling effect on the government’s ability to recruit both agents and informants.

The revelation that longtime Cambridge University professor Stefan Halper, for example, was used as an FBI informant in 2016, and the microscopic focus placed on former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele — another longtime FBI source — has made the intelligence community, and its sources, extremely wary.

“Put yourself in the position of considering working for CIA at this moment,” Hall said. “You’d probably want to wait until this all blows over.”"
47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans,https://www.npr.org,['Cat Schuknecht'],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/25/727002406/47-states-call-on-betsy-devos-to-forgive-student-loans-for-disabled-veterans,"47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Updated Sunday at 2:14 p.m. ET

On Friday, three days before Memorial Day, attorneys general for 47 states wrote to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asking her to automatically forgive student loans for eligible disabled veterans.

The Department of Education has identified more than 42,000 veterans who qualify for a federal program known as Total and Permanent Disability Discharge, or TPD, that offers to relieve borrowers from repaying certain government student loans. These veterans, the letter says, shoulder over $1 billion in education debt that could be forgiven.

To get the benefit, veterans must first apply for the program. According to information obtained by the group Veterans Education Success through a Freedom of Information Act request, almost 60 percent of eligible veterans had defaulted on a loan payment as of April 2018. Yet only about 20 percent had applied to the loan forgiveness program.

The attorneys general want that to change. In the letter — which was also signed by attorneys general for the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories — they propose making the forgiveness program automatic for veterans who have been identified by the Department of Education.

""As a nation, we have a moral obligation to assist those who have put their lives on the line to defend us,"" the letter reads. ""There is no statutory or legal requirement that the Department of Education demand that eligible veterans affirmatively apply for TPD discharges before the Department will forgive their loans.""

In a statement to NPR, the Education Department said it recognized the sacrifices that veterans make for their country, adding that it has worked to streamline the TPD discharge process.

""While we have worked to make this process as easy and as seamless as possible for veterans, the last thing we want to do is cause unintended consequences for them,"" according to the statement.

The department said discharges could raise veterans' tax bills or inhibit them from taking out more student loans.

In their letter to DeVos, the attorneys general dismissed the department's concern about increasing borrowers' tax bills.

""[F]ederal tax law now excludes loan discharges for disabled borrowers from taxable income, and most states' tax codes do likewise,"" said the letter. ""Moreover, we think it likely that most borrowers would prefer to have one hundred percent of their outstanding loans discharged, even if this resulted in an increase to their state tax bill.""

The letter from the attorneys general follows at least two other similar letters that Republican and Democratic members of Congress sent to DeVos last year."
Trump: Japanese officials told me Democrats have a 'death wish',https://www.aol.com,['Aol Staff'],05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/05/26/trump-japanese-officials-told-me-democrats-have-a-death-wish/23735126/,"President Trump took a moment during his visit to Japan to slam Democrats and pass along remarks from Japanese officials.

“Great fun and meeting with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo,” Trump tweeted Saturday. “Numerous Japanese officials told me that the Democrats would rather see the United States fail than see me or the Republican Party succeed – Death Wish!”

The remark follows increasing tensions between the president and Democrats over the investigations launched against him.

“I think the Democrats are obstructionists,” Trump said in his remarks to reporters on Friday. “They’re hurting our country very, very badly.”

“They’re very unhappy with the Mueller report,” Trump continued. “No collusion, no obstruction. No nothing. They’re very unhappy. They’re angry about it. They have to get over their anger.”

“They want to do a redo,” Trump added. “Like even the fact that they’re asking Bob Mueller to come and testify. He just gave them a 434-page report, which says no collusion, which leads to absolutely no obstruction. He just gave that report. Why does he have to testify? It’s ridiculous.”

Graham says intel officials concerned about exposure of 2016 misbehavior,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/graham-says-intel-officials-concerned-about-exposure-of-2016-misbehavior,"Amid investigations into potential misbehavior by intelligence officials during the 2016 presidential campaign, Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday, “It doesn't surprise me that the people we are looking at, they don't want transparency.”

The South Carolina Republican told ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace he agreed with President Trump's decision to give Attorney General William Barr “full and complete authority” to work with the intelligence community in declassifying documents related to the origins of the Russia investigation and the conduct of the Justice Department and the FBI.

Barr's move has drawn strong criticism from former FBI Director James Comey, ex-CIA Director John Brennan, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Each has said the declassification process could lead agencies vulnerable to revelations about intelligence sources and methods.

But Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it's the ex-intelligence and Justice Department officials who should be on the defensive about their conduct in the 2016 campaign and early into Trump's tenure.

“The people who are worried about this are worried about being exposed for taking the law in their own hands,"" said Graham, 63, without identifying specific officials.

Wallace pressed him on this, calling these government secrets “the crown jewels of the intelligence community” and saying that critics had raised questions about whether Barr can ""be trusted with these secrets” and whether Barr can ""be trusted not to cherry-pick the information to make a case for the president.”

Graham said that Barr can be trusted and insisted that “we’re not compromising national security here. We’re trying to create a system to make sure this never happens again by shedding light on what happened.""

Republicans have long argued that the launch of the Trump-Russia investigation was politically motivated, that its use of a dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele was improper, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was abused. Democrats have defended the actions taken by the DOJ and FBI.

Graham said that his support for this probe was a matter of consistency, since he’d publicly supported special counsel Mueller’s investigation too. “I was one of the Republicans insisting that Mueller be allowed to do his job. I never thought it was a witch hunt. The Mueller report is in. No collusion. Mueller didn't do anything on obstruction,” Graham said. “Now I'm insisting that we get to the bottom of this.”

“I want all the documents around the FISA warrant application released,” Graham explained. “I want to find out exactly how the counterintelligence operation began. I think transparency is good for the American people.”

Graham also criticized Democrats for not wanting answers, saying, “Not one Democrat seems to care. I was the hero when I said, ‘Let's support Mueller.’ I wish some Democrat would come forward to find out if the FISA court was defrauded by the FBI and the Department of Justice.”

Barr has been reviewing the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign for weeks now. Not only has he tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham with reviewing the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, but he has also enlisted the help of CIA Director Gina Haspel, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, and FBI Director Christopher Wray.

Although Trump said his order empowering Barr could lead to the declassification of ""millions of pages of documents,"" Coats quickly tamped down expectations about how much might be released, saying “I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the IC in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk."""

Opinion writer

Because this is the Donald Trump era, the news that the president has “repeatedly urged” the Army Corps of Engineers to give a lucrative contract to a GOP donor and frequent Fox News guest is only the second most scandalous story of the day. The most scandalous is this one:

President Trump has granted Attorney General William P. Barr “full and complete authority” to declassify government secrets, issuing a memorandum late Thursday that orders U.S. intelligence agencies to cooperate promptly with Barr’s audit of the investigation into Russia’s election interference in 2016. The president’s move gives Barr broad powers to unveil carefully guarded intelligence secrets about the Russia investigation, which the attorney general requested to allow him to quickly carry out his review, according to the memo.

Barr’s “investigation” is nothing but a propaganda exercise, an effort to provide ballast to the lunatic idea that there should never have been any investigation at all into Russia’s attempts to help Trump get elected president. But we have to be clear about just how shocking this order from Trump is.

The executive order not only gives Barr permission to “declassify, downgrade, or direct the declassification or downgrading of information or intelligence” to whatever degree he likes, but also orders the leaders of every intelligence agency to give him whatever he wants. If he wants to declassify something and they object, tough luck for them. The New York Times reports that this is “likely to irk the intelligence community”:

One official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified matters, said previously that Mr. Barr wanted to know more about what foreign assets the C.I.A. had in Russia in 2016 and what those informants were telling the agency about how President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 election.

Needless to say, the identity of foreign assets is one of the most sensitive categories of information intelligence agencies hold. If we had a different attorney general, you might say, “Well, surely he’ll exercise the utmost care in what he reveals to the public.” But with virtually every action Barr has taken and statement he has made, he has shown himself to be someone who is only too happy to deceive the public, mislead Congress, go on Fox News to spin on the president’s behalf, and generally act as though the only purpose of his office is to cover up for Trump. The idea that this political hack would conduct any investigation related to this president with any other goal in mind is, at this point, not even worth discussing.

Which is why it’s so important to emphasize that his investigation is a propaganda exercise. Its purpose is not to discover some unknown truth, because despite what Trump and Barr have said, we know exactly how the Russia investigation began. It began, as the Mueller report states, when Trump aide George “Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of [Australia] that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the campaign through the anonymous release of information that could be damaging to Hillary Clinton,” and the Australians informed the FBI.

Barr is not trying to learn more about whether there was something fishy about that investigation. He’s looking for information that can then be selectively declassified in order to help Trump and undermine his perceived enemies. If that involves compromising sensitive intelligence, he won’t hesitate for a moment.

We can be pretty sure of what’s going to happen. Barr will scour every record he can to learn as much as possible about the Russia investigation. Whenever he comes across something that can be spun to make the FBI or anyone Trump has decided is his enemy look bad, he’ll put it in the “Declassify” pile. Then he’ll release it all to the public and hold a news conference where he suggests that there was a conspiracy to take down Trump. The president will then take to Twitter to proclaim that he was indeed the victim of a vile witch hunt that has at last been exposed. The news media, in possession of only the materials Barr has chosen to give them, will struggle to avoid amplifying and reinforcing Barr’s claims.

In case you were wondering what happens when an infinitely corrupt president decides to use the powers of the federal government for his own self-interest with the help of lackeys he has installed to protect him, this is it.

Like a nagging toothache, public opinion indicators keep showing that Americans, and particularly Democrats, don’t like the idea of having a really old president. It’s hard to square with an early 2020 Democratic presidential contest in which the two front-runners are over 75.

Back in late February an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey of adults without regard to party asked about desirable and undesirable traits in presidential candidates. A full 62 percent said they’d either have reservations about, or would be very uncomfortable with, such a prospect (ranking second only to “a socialist” as a discomforting characteristic, which was less than great news for the 77-year-old self-described socialist Bernie Sanders).

A Reuters/Ipsos poll in April showed that among Democrats over half said they’d be less likely to support a presidential candidate if they discovered he or she is over 70.

An April Gallup survey showed 35 percent of Democrats expressing unwillingness to vote for an otherwise qualified over-70 candidate of their party.

And then a May Pew survey of Democrats asked the best age for a president. Only 3 percent reported a preference for septuagenarians (at 47 percent, the 50s were the plurality winner as ideal for presidents).

So what’s up with that? Are Democrats simply finding other qualities of oldsters that outweigh age considerations? Is Perry Bacon Jr. correct in suggesting voters who as an abstract matter prefer younger candidates may feel differently about an individual pol whom they know? Is Helaine Olen right that when pressed voters really just don’t care about age?

It’s possible voters simply don’t know these popular public figures are as old as they actually are. I can’t find any research testing that hypothesis. But whether it’s a matter of ignorance or not thinking deeply about it, this data does open up some possibilities for the campaigns of younger candidates.

First, they could do the research that the public pollsters apparently aren’t doing about voter awareness of candidate age, and whether being informed that a candidate has achieved advanced geezerhood might have an impact.

And second, they could subtly get their comparative youthfulness across in ads that touted their energy and fresh ideas, while presenting images that silently conveyed the decrepitude of the old folks. It could serve as a rehearsal for general election reminders that the junk-food-devouring Donald J. Trump will turn 74 next year.

One objection to age-based comparisons like this is that it might honk off older voters. But there’s some evidence (notably in the Ipsos/Reuters survey) that seniors are more concerned about age-related candidate impairment than anyone, perhaps because they understand what it’s like to lose a step.

There’s also scientific research on the cognitive consequences of that lost step, as Robert Kaiser recently explained:

Studies of old people conclude that between 16 percent and 23 percent of Americans over 65 experience some form of cognitive impairment. Researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology found that these subjects performed worse than others on tasks involving working memory — the ability to remember information while manipulating it, as when calculating the tip on a restaurant bill — and that they’re more impaired when those tasks become more complex. Older adults also have difficulties with tasks that require dividing or switching attention, like cooking while chatting on the phone. On tests of reasoning, memory and cognitive speed, the average scores for adults in their early 70s were near the 20th percentile of the population, whereas the average performance for adults in their early 20s was near the 75th percentile. A Mayo Clinic study of 161 cognitively normal adults between 62 and 100 years of age showed that declines in learning ability closely track the passage of time. “Research has shown that concept formation, abstraction, and mental flexibility decline with age, especially after age 70, as older adults tend to think more concretely than younger adults,” according to researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who surveyed several studies. I would hope that impaired executive functioning is not the sort of torture Americans want their president to suffer.

If the 2020 general election really does match Trump against either Biden or Sanders (or arguably Elizabeth Warren, who turns 70 next month, though women’s brains tend to age more slowly than men’s), looking at such sobering evidence could even be conducted on a bipartisan basis, perhaps in conjunction with a closer look than is customary at the qualifications of the Democratic and Republican veep nominees. If it’s indeed the golden age for Golden Girls and Boys in politics, it might be good to get a sense of when “maturity” reaches the point of diminishing returns."

U.S. District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam’s ruling also blocks the administration from tapping into $1 billion of Pentagon funds to construct the border wall and restricts construction to only certain portions of Texas and Arizona.

“The case is not about whether the challenged border barrier construction plan is wise or unwise. It is not about whether the plan is the right or wrong policy response to existing conditions at the southern border of the United States,” Haywood wrote.

“Instead, this case presents strictly legal questions regarding whether the proposed plan for funding border barrier construction exceeds the Executive Branch’s lawful authority under the Constitution and a number of statutes duly enacted by Congress,” he wrote.

USDA staffers quit en masse as Trump administration eyes moving offices out of DC,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/usda-staffers-quit-en-masse-as-trump-administration-eyes-moving-offices-out-of-dc,"Employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are quitting at a rapid clip as Secretary Sonny Perdue prepares to move forward with plans to relocate two offices far outside the Washington, D.C., Beltway.

Federal employees at the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) – two small but important agencies within the USDA – are unhappy with Perdue’s plan, announced last August, to move the majority of their staff from current offices in the capital to an area closer the country’s agricultural centers.

“This move does not serve a public purpose,” Peter Winch, a representative for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents ERS workers, told Fox News. “Employees don’t want to move, and it doesn’t make sense for them to move.”

US FARMERS HURT BY TRADE WAR GETTING $16 BILLION BOOST, US AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SAYS

Winch added that since ERS employees joined AFGE earlier this month, six employees have already quit their jobs with the government agency in response to the planned move. He said overall staffing is down to 209 from 300 during the Obama administration.

A Washington Post report cited an estimate that the ERS used to see roughly one “non-retirement” departure per month – but that pace has doubled since October. NIFA reportedly has also seen people leave.

Perdue said in a statement to Fox News that the move was meant “to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.” The secretary of agriculture added that the planned move would bring the department’s scientists closer to “stakeholders” and “customers” such as Midwest farmers.

“It’s been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient, and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” Perdue said. “We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.”

Perdue added: “We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

The goal of the ERS, however, is to provide statistical information to lawmakers in Washington, while NIFA works to fund hundreds of millions of dollar annually in research in the agricultural sector.

HISTORIC FLOODS IN MIDWEST HAVE FARMERS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE

Congressional Democrats are scrambling to try and block the move.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, told The Washington Post. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

Critics, including former USDA officials, say the move would weaken the agencies, reduce their influence with lawmakers and provide little benefit to the farming community.

Winch argued that weakening the agencies' influence in Washington is at least part of the point. The NIFA funds grants that go into researching the effects the agriculture sector has on climate change – which the Trump administration has tried to downplay – and Perdue was allegedly upset by NIFA’s policy to support LGBT members of the 4-H youth farming organization.

The president’s 2020 budget has also proposed slashing funding to ERS research from $87 million to $61 million and cutting 160 jobs, while Perdue has suggested moving the agency from under the USDA’s science arm to being supervised by the USDA’s chief economist, a political wing of the department.

“There is some sort of punitive motivation,” Winch said. “Someone has made a negative judgment about these agencies.”

Perdue and his staff have narrowed the list of places where the two agencies could go down to three from an original 130 -- with Kansas City, the state of Indiana and North Carolina’s research triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area on the shortlist. St. Louis, Mo., and Madison, Wis., are two alternate locations.

Perdue is expected to make the announcement of where the agencies will move as soon as Friday, but it remains unclear whether the two agencies will actually leave Washington.

The USDA’s own inspector general is currently looking into whether Perdue has the legal authority to move these agencies, while the House Appropriations Committee’s draft bill of agricultural appropriations, which was released earlier this week, prohibits the USDA from using funds to move agencies outside of the Washington area. Trump’s 2020 budget proposal wants $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA.

“We continue to believe that the USDA lacks the legal authority to carry out this proposal,” Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said in a statement earlier this spring. “However, even if it had such authority, USDA has not done the proper analysis of the cost and benefits, and this proposal will harm agriculture research and our constituents.”"
California probably will pick next president,https://www.sfchronicle.com,"['Joe Mathews', 'Syndicated Columnist', 'Past Articles This Author', 'Gregory Thomas', 'Henry Schulman', 'Aidin Vaziri', 'Bill Van Niekerken', 'Peter Hartlaub']",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/California-probably-will-pick-next-president-13896017.php,"Beto O’Rourke falls face first into the water while trying to surf off La Jolla.

Joe Biden dons a paper hat to take orders — “I love mine ‘animal style’ too, ma’am” — in an In-N-Out drive-through.

Bernie Sanders, desperate to catch front-runner Biden, packs a bong with legally grown California cannabis — and smokes it. The meme breaks the internet.

For now, these scenes are merely the product of one columnist’s imagination. But in the next 10 months, don’t be surprised if they show up in the reality show we call the presidential race.

Traditionally, California has had little say in picking presidents. Other Americans — out of a commitment to electing steady, even boring presidents — allowed dull states — Iowa and New Hampshire — to drive the process.

But Americans no longer are attached to sober-minded presidents. That cultural shift — in combination with an early California primary (March 3), and an unpopular Republican president — means that the Golden State might well pick the next president.

The process of selection should involve the whole state — because Democrats decided to allocate delegates to anyone who wins at least 15% of the vote in any California congressional district. While more delegates are allocated to districts with more Democrats — which will push candidates to spend more time in Democratic-heavy coastal districts — lesser-known contenders are likely to make hay by going into the state’s interior to pick up delegates, in districts where there may be less competition.

The race will not be easy for anyone, even California’s own Sen. Kamala Harris, who could struggle to meet expectations that she should win her home state. And while California has been represented in the Senate exclusively by women since 1992, it remains to be seen whether it is favorable turf for women seeking the presidency. Yes, Hillary Clinton won the 2008 and 2016 presidential primaries here, but, as a state, we’ve been less inclined to select women to executive positions. California has never had a female governor, and Los Angeles has never had a female mayor.

California is also not fertile ground for a Republican challenger to the president. Republicans here like Trump nearly as much as Republicans nationally.

But it’s not just about the candidates; California is likely to shape the issues of the presidential campaign. Previous presidential races have focused on the economy, health care and national security, but housing and homelessness, as the top priorities of many Californians, will become national issues next year. Other lower-profile issues that divide Californians — like water and high-speed rail — also should become big points of contention as presidential candidates spend more time here. And California teachers’ unions have been asking candidates to back federal regulations to curtail the growth of charter schools as a condition of their support.

Climate change debates — over the state’s policies to curtail it through cap-and-trade, and growing anxiety over disasters like the fire that destroyed Paradise — also could move from California to the national arena. And our state’s commitment to protecting immigrants and their families, regardless of legal status, should shape the race. In California, perhaps more than anywhere else, Biden is likely to face potent attacks from rivals who point to his service in an Obama administration that engaged in massive deportation of immigrants.

But our votes are not the only way that Californians will impact the selection of the president. Despite new methods of online fundraising from small donors, the state’s richest people will have even more power and influence than usual, as candidates grow desperate for funding in such a large field. The struggle for attention also could make the backing of Hollywood figures even more important. Look for next year’s Oscars, which will take place just three weeks before the California primary, to be the most political in history, with perhaps some candidates walking the red carpet to boost their name recognition.

But it is through technology that Californians are likely to have the most impact on the identity of the next president. This cuts many ways. The decisions made by Menlo Park-based Facebook in handling political content will affect Americans’ very perceptions of the contest. And, of course, the other California titans of the internet, including Google and Twitter, could potentially be harnessed by those who mean American democracy harm. At the same time, Facebook and other tech giants are becoming a major issue in the race. Should they be broken up? How do we defend our privacy from them?

There are reasons to worry about a president picked by California. This is a wonderful place of beaches and innovation, but it is also the volatile, crazy state that gave us Proposition 13 and the Kardashians. If we Californians give America a president who reflects our state’s true preferences and character, the whole world may feel as though it has smoked something.

WASHINGTON — Newly released emails show that Environmental Protection Agency scientists raised strong objections to a 2018 decision by Scott Pruitt, who was head of the agency at the time, to exempt most of southeastern Wisconsin from federal limits on smog.

The decision by Mr. Pruitt was notable because it came as Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was campaigning for a third term and trying to bring a Foxconn factory, and thousands of new manufacturing jobs, to a part of the state where pollution levels already exceeded federal limits.

Mr. Walker ultimately lost his re-election bid to Tony Evers, a Democrat. And Foxconn , the Taiwanese consumer electronics giant, announced in January that it was reconsidering its plan to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin, though the company later said it would build a smaller factory in the state.

But, in spring 2018, as the governor’s race was heating up, Mr. Walker championed the Foxconn deal and the 13,000 jobs it promised to create. The factory, however, also threatened to create a new source of pollution in the region."
Mark Meadows views fresh 'Strzok coverup' material at DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-views-fresh-strzok-coverup-material-at-doj,"Rep. Mark Meadows said he was at the Justice Department to review new information about former FBI agent Peter Strzok.

The North Carolina Republican was spotted at Justice Department headquarters in D.C. with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Thursday.

Asked by a reporter why he was there, Meadows said, ""I was reviewing text messages and new correspondence that pertains to the Strzok coverup.""

Hours after their visit, President Trump gave Attorney General William Barr ""full and complete authority to declassify information"" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Meadows and Jordan's visit to the Justice Department also comes after House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes said he learned that an August 2016 text from Strzok about an ""insurance policy"" had to do with the FBI's use of an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to wiretap Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server.

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Both Strzok and Lisa Page, who are no longer with the FBI, have been a focus of GOP investigators concerned about potential bias within the Justice Department and FBI."

EPA wants to triple level of rocket fuel chemical allowed in drinking water,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-rocket-fuel-chemical-drinking-water-e6ee56c9ee13/,"The Trump Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wants to raise the threshold for a chemical found in rocket fuel to triple the previous limit allowed in drinking water supplies. This is the first new drinking water rule introduced by the agency since the George W. Bush administration.

In the EPA’s latest move to weaken environmental and health protections, it released a notice on Thursday requesting public comment on its proposal to raise the maximum level allowed for the chemical perchlorate — which is linked to thyroid problems — to 56 micrograms per liter.

This is three times higher than what the EPA previously recommended as a safe level for drinking water (15 micrograms per liter). The previous recommendation was just an advisory to help guide states, as opposed to an enforceable limit, which is what the agency is now proposing.

In addition to this change, the EPA is seeking comment on three other alternate options: setting the level to 18 micrograms per liter, to 90 micrograms per liter, or simply abolishing the rule regulating perchlorate in drinking water.

The news comes after a decade-long delay following a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) demanding the EPA set an enforceable standard for the chemical.

“This is enough to make you sick—literally,” Erik Olson, senior director for health and food at NRDC, said in a statement on the new proposed limits. “As a result, millions of Americans will be at risk of exposure to dangerous levels of this toxic chemical in their drinking water.”

In addition to rocket fuel, perchlorate is found in fireworks, airbags, matches, signal flares, some food packaging, and munitions. Health risks from exposure include disruption to the thyroid’s ability to produce hormones needed for normal growth and development, along with potentially causing reproductive problems.

According to NRDC, scientists recommend a limit that is “10 to more than 50 times lower” than what the EPA is currently proposing. Two states currently have much stricter, enforceable standards than required by the EPA: California (at 6 micrograms per liter) and Massachusetts (at 2 micrograms per liter).

The EPA’s proposal comes as the agency has been dragging its feet on implementing a similar legally enforceable standard for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — a group of man-made chemicals that are toxic to humans and can increase the risk of cancer — in drinking water. Currently there is no maximum level for PFAS chemicals under EPA rules. Numerous communities in 43 states are currently suffering from the toxic chemical polluting their water.

These delays or weakening of chemical standards come despite EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler recent arguments that water issues are the world’s leading environmental crisis.

“This is another Trump administration gift to polluters and water utilities that have lobbied to be off the hook for cleaning up the problem,” Olson said of the proposed change to perchlorate.

The Trump EPA features several top officials who once worked for the chemical industry. This includes a former Koch Industries staffer, David Dunlap, who worked on water and chemical policy and now serves as deputy EPA assistant administrator for research and development, and a former chemical industry attorney, Steven Cook, who oversees Superfund sites. Meanwhile, Nancy Beck, the Trump administration appointee who oversees the EPA’s toxic chemical unit, previously worked as an executive at the American Chemistry Council, one of the industry’s main lobbying groups.

What’s more, a 2009 House Committee report found that Beck, a former Bush administration official, was slowing progress in confirming the health threats from chemicals like perchlorate found in drinking water. The committee concluded she had been “inappropriately intervening in agency science.”

Ties to the chemical industry also extend to Wheeler. In a letter sent to the EPA administrator last month, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D- MD), accused Wheeler of failing to disclose his previous lobbying on behalf of Darling Ingredients, which is involved in making fuel and fertilizers regulated by the EPA."

USDA to shift some inspector tasks to pork plant workers — in everything but name,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'Kimberly Kindy Is A National Investigative Reporter For The Washington Post.

The Agriculture Department is attempting to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

At a Smithfield hog plant in central Illinois, federal meat inspectors examine pig carcasses on the slaughter line, remove diseased and contaminated meat, and mark it “condemned.” They have the exclusive responsibility for performing this work.

At another hog plant about 75 miles away, JBS USA Food Co. employees are part of a long-running test program in which they perform tasks similar to those done by federal inspectors. When plant employees do this food safety work, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says they are “sorting” and “removing” or “disposing” of the meat, not inspecting or condemning it.

The shift in language is central to the USDA’s efforts to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors.

The proposed new inspection system transfers some responsibilities that traditionally have been handled by USDA inspectors to employees of pork plants. The USDA says it has studied the new inspection system for 20 years and that pork products from the test plants are at least as safe as those produced by traditional inspection. They say federal inspectors will spend less time visually assessing pork and more time ensuring sanitary conditions are maintained throughout the plant.

Several food safety lawyers, Democratic members of Congress and a former agriculture official say that the USDA is using sleight-of-hand tactics to get around legal mandates that have been in place for more than a century. Those mandates require federal regulators to inspect — and either pass or condemn — every live hog that arrives at a slaughterhouse and every hog carcass on the slaughter line.

“They are playing these linguistics games,” said Rena Steinzor, a food safety expert who teaches law at the University of Maryland. “What they are doing is illegal. If they have a problem with the statute because they think it’s a waste of energy for federal inspectors to eyeball every single animal, they could go to Congress. . . . The Constitution requires them to do that, not gut the law by regulation.”

The test hog-inspection program is expected to expand this summer after the agency approves new rules. Certain pork plants would have the option of using the new inspection system. Thirty-five plants plan to join the five test plants in using the new program; they would produce 90 percent of the pork consumed in the United States.

The number of federal inspectors on hog slaughter lines at the plants new to the program will be reduced from 365 to 218, a 40 percent cut, according to a USDA analysis published in the Federal Register. The overall number of inspectors at those plants will drop from 400 to 288, a decline of 28 percent, according to figures provided by the USDA.

The new rules will allow slaughter-line speeds to run as fast as the plant desires. The current cap on line speed is 1,106 hogs per hour, or 18 per minute.

Records show there have been no serious public health problems or pork food poisoning outbreaks linked to the test plants. Critics of the test plants say they have more food safety problems than the traditional plants; the USDA disputes that.

A half-dozen food safety groups, along with the USDA inspectors’ union, say they are concerned that increased line speeds and federal staff reductions on those lines will cause diseased and contaminated meat to slip by the remaining inspectors. They also cite an inherent conflict of interest among plant employees because they work for pork producers and not the public. Training for those workers, they point out, is also done entirely at the plant owners’ discretion.

Pat Basu, a former chief veterinarian for the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) who retired in 2018, is critical of the proposed regulation. He says the agency is using semantic tricks as it reassigns duties to plant employees that the law says inspectors should perform.

“These are word games they are playing,” Basu said. “What they are really doing is removing hogs that are diseased and contaminated. Why are these suddenly not inspections?”

USDA officials say that they are modernizing the inspection process and that the new system will not violate existing laws and regulations. They say the agency has the authority to change how federal inspections are performed so long as a carcass-by-carcass inspection is performed on all of the hogs presented by the plant as fit for human consumption.

“In the proposed rules, we are just giving the plant employees the opportunity to more fully execute their [food safety] plan before we make that final verification that the product is safe,” said Phil Bronstein, an assistant administrator with the FSIS.

Bronstein acknowledged that under the proposed rules, the number of USDA inspectors on the slaughter line in most large plants will be reduced from seven to three. Bronstein said the remaining inspectors would be more experienced and have a higher level of training. Also, the number of USDA inspectors who will roam large plants to ensure sanitation procedures are in place and to check on animal welfare will grow from one to two, officials said.

At least 17 members of Congress, all Democrats, have stated their opposition to the new system. “It is appalling to watch the Trump Administration and [USDA] leadership justify their gutting of hog slaughter inspections with meaningless technicalities and semantics,” Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), vice chair of the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee and chair of the Food Safety Caucus, said in a statement to The Washington Post.

“Who do they think they are fooling? This giveaway to corporate special interests means company-based employees will carry out responsibilities that are currently performed by government inspectors.”

Defining inspection

In addition to the term “condemnation,” other transferred tasks have also been given different names under the proposed new program, records show.

For example, when plant workers have examined a hog’s head and internal organs, looking for and removing signs of disease and contamination, they have “trimmed dressing defects and contamination, and identified pathology defects on the carcasses,” the proposed regulation says. They have not inspected the animal, the USDA says.

“The agency has trivialized what we have done and what we do by calling it sorting and other consumer protections,” said Charles “Stan” Painter, chairman of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, which represents inspectors. “The plant workers are clearly expected to do food safety inspections.” Painter said that given the increased role plant workers will have on slaughter lines, he believes federal inspectors are “now nothing more than window dressing at the end of the line.”

The USDA has long used different terminology for the same tasks, depending on whether they were performed by federal inspectors or employees in the test plants. But it has become more steadfast in asserting the need for others to adopt its language, and the proposed new inspection system has focused attention on the matter.

The proposed regulation emphasizes that plant employees’ primary jobs involve “non-food safety standards concerned primarily with diseases of no public health significance.”

However, records show that nearly every transferred task involves food safety issues. For example, when plant workers are removing defects, such as blemishes, from a carcass, they might also trim abscesses that could be a sign of a serious disease or trim spots with fecal contamination that may contain dangerous pathogens.

When they remove internal organs and examine them, they are looking for signs of disease such as septicemia, which would mean the entire carcass could be filled with harmful bacteria.

[After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’]

“They are, in a sense, performing part of the inspection process, doing a pre-screening,” said Daniel Kovich, director of science and technology with the National Pork Producers Council. “Yes, they are looking at it, and they are supposed to move things from the line that are not supposed to pass inspection. But only FSIS can inspect an animal.”

In an interview, USDA officials acknowledged that many of the tasks handled by plant workers would be related to food safety but said they are not inspections.

Although there is no cap on how fast line speeds may run, the USDA anticipates about a 12.5 percent increase at the large plants under the new system, records show.

Zach Corrigan, an attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Food & Water Watch, said that means the fewer remaining inspectors would need to examine an average of 6.1 heads per minute versus about 2.7 heads per minute in the traditional system.

Corrigan said the new system places a heavy burden on the USDA inspectors who remain on the line and must inspect every carcass. He said the new system will sometimes make it impossible for the USDA to comply with the law.

“The definition of inspection is a ‘critical appraisal,’ ” said Corrigan, citing a 2000 court case that dealt with USDA inspections. “That legal threshold cannot be met when you remove inspectors from the lines and you increase the line speeds.” He called the USDA’s varying terms for the same food safety tasks “Orwellian doublespeak.”

The USDA said a 2002 legal ruling found that the hog test program did not violate the Federal Meat Inspection Act. However, that court decision was limited to the test program and said it “may not necessarily foreshadow the outcome of judicial review of such future regulations.”

The USDA says only a federal inspector or veterinarian has the power to place the department’s mark of inspection on the pork — under the traditional and the alternative new system.

The department also says the word “inspection” is a technical term and can be applied only to situations in which a USDA inspector or veterinarian has performed a food safety oversight task. At meat plants, veterinarians are typically the highest-ranking federal official.

In response to a recent Washington Post article that said the proposed rules would shift much of the power and responsibility for food safety inspections at hog plants to plant employees, the USDA wrote: “By law, only federal inspection personnel conduct inspections of animals, carcasses and parts — and USDA inspection personnel inspect every carcass and part before it leaves the slaughterhouse and processing plant.”

However, inside the test pork plants, USDA inspectors use the term “inspector” — as in “TS [trimming and sorting] inspector” — to refer to their plant employee counterparts. For example, in a 2013 citation for a food safety violation, a USDA inspector said a diseased hog had “passed all three of your TS inspectors” without them spotting the problem, and the carcass had to be condemned.

And in job advertisements, owners of the test pork plants consistently call some employees inspectors or use the word inspector in job descriptions. In a recent job posting by JBS, “quality control inspector” was used as a job title, and it said tasks include performing “various quality control functions including but not limited to line inspection, audits.” JBS did not respond to several requests for comment.

Spotting problems

Five USDA inspectors said in sworn affidavits, taken by the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, that plant workers routinely miss problems in the test plants that they believe are potential food hazards.

They also said plant workers aren’t in a position to stand up to plant supervisors when they do spot problems.

“On numerous occasions, I witnessed them fail to spot abscesses, lesions, fecal matter and other defects that would render an animal unsafe or unwholesome,” said one inspector, who was not named. “Furthermore, plant inspectors don’t actually want to shut off the line to deal with the problems they spot on the job. . . . Obviously their employer will terminate them if they do it too many times.”

Outside evaluations of the test plants have exposed problems. The most recent review was done in 2018 by Food & Water Watch. In its assessment, the group compared USDA inspection reports from the five test plants with those of five comparably sized traditional plants.

The group received copies of citations from 2013 to 2016 through a Freedom of Information Act request. In all, more than 3,500 citations were issued by USDA inspectors to the 10 plants. Food & Water Watch determined that 73 percent of citations issued for a carcass contaminated with feces, bile, hair or dirt were at the five test plants.

In the five test plants, 32 citations were issued after inspectors spotted carcasses that were “so infected that consumption of the meat may cause food poisoning.” Five comparably sized traditional hog plants received no citations for this offense, which is considered to be one of the most serious food safety violations because it can lead to possible recalls and food-poisoning outbreaks.

Carmen Rottenberg, who runs the FSIS, said the evaluation was not a meaningful comparison. She said citations to the test plants were higher because plant workers had assumed more responsibilities. When they fail to properly perform these new jobs, she said, the plants are then cited for those failures.

“We are holding the plants accountable for a lot more tasks,” Rottenberg said.

[Pork industry soon will have more power over meat inspections]

Inspection reports illustrate some of the problems USDA inspectors found with the work done by plant employees.

At one test pork plant in Michigan, employees assigned to remove sick and diseased live hogs overlooked one that had collapsed and died, then presented it to USDA inspectors as fit for slaughter.

At an Illinois test plant, its workers failed to identify more than a dozen abscesses in the internal organs of a slaughtered hog — a clear sign that the entire carcass was contaminated with dangerous bacteria.

And in Minnesota, employees at a test plant overlooked patches of yellow and green material on the chest wall and hindquarters of a hog carcass. It was fecal matter that could have contained dangerous pathogens.

The Food & Water Watch evaluation followed two independent government audits of the test program that were critical of the alternative inspection system. In 2013, the USDA’s inspector general found that three of the five test plants were among the worst in the nation for food safety and sanitary problems. Also in 2013, the Government Accountability Office raised food safety concerns due to the faster line speeds in those plants.

In the USDA’s self assessment the following year, the agency said its data showed the test plants “are performing as well as comparable large [traditional] market hog establishments and are meeting FSIS expectations.”

Rep. Marcy Kaptur (Ohio) and 16 other Democratic lawmakers opposed to the new inspection system asked the USDA inspector general’s office last month to investigate whether the department properly disclosed data on worker safety during the public review and comment period for the proposed regulations.

In a statement to The Post, Kaptur cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that say 1 in 6 Americans get sick and 3,000 die because of foodborne diseases each year: “If we are to improve those numbers, we cannot hand over the integrity of inspections to an industry focused more on profit and less on human and animal welfare.”"

Among the charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. | Jack Taylor/Getty Images legal DOJ accuses Assange of violating Espionage Act

The Justice Department has hit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with Espionage Act charges, escalating a legal fight against the high-profile activist and alarming press freedom activists.

DOJ had previously only indicted Assange on a single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Thursday’s revelation of the additional 18 charges, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, means Assange could face significantly more prison time if found guilty.

Story Continued Below

The alleged Espionage Act violations relate to Assange’s complicity with Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army soldier who was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act after she shuttled troves of classified government information to WikiLeaks. Officials said Assange solicited the information from and then brazenly published details that put the government's human sources at risk, disregarding explicit warnings from the government.

Traditionally, the Espionage Act has been used against government officials, like Manning, who reveal such classified information, rather than the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information.

As a result, the use of the Espionage Act against Assange set off alarm bells among press freedom activists on Thursday. While WikiLeaks isn’t a conventional news organization, press advocates have long feared that charging Assange for the publication of government secrets could open the door to prosecuting reporters for doing the same.

""Any government use of the Espionage Act to criminalize the receipt and publication of classified information poses a dire threat to journalists seeking to publish such information in the public interest, irrespective of the Justice Department’s assertion that Assange is not a journalist,"" said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in a statement.

Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who also touched off a debate about the media's role in publishing secret files when he leaked classified information to reporters in 2013, proclaimed: “the Department of Justice just declared war – not on Wikileaks, but on journalism itself.”

John Demers, head of DOJ’s national security division, pushed back at that argument on Thursday, insisting Assange is “not a journalist,” and alleging that the WikiLeaks founder “purposely published names he knew to be confidential human sources in warzones.”

It's a debate that Justice Department officials have grappled with for years. The Obama administration previously looked into bringing similar charges against Assange, but decided against it.

“We didn’t bring this [Espionage Act] case for a couple of reasons,"" said Matt Miller, an Obama-era DOJ spokesman. ""First, we thought it was a dangerous precedent to prosecute Assange for something that reporters do all the time. We didn’t believe Assange was a journalist, but the Espionage Act doesn’t make any distinction between journalists and others, so if you can apply it to Assange, there’s no real reason you couldn’t apply it to [The New York Times]. Second, and it’s related, it’s not at all clear that charging someone with the publication of classified information could survive court scrutiny.”

Assange’s legal case took off in April after Ecuador revoked its seven-year asylum, forcing him out of the embassy in London and paving the way for his extradition to the United States for one of the biggest ever leaks of classified information. Justice Department officials said they could not comment on how this might affect Assange’s extradition from the U.K. to the U.S.

Among Thursday's charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. The Justice Department alleged that Assange published select State Department cables that contained the unredacted names of human sources in Iran, China and Syria. He also published Afghan activity reports and Iraq activity reports that endangered local Afghans and Iraqis, prosecutors alleged.

“It was explicitly stated in the State Department cables that the identity of sources was to be protected,” a Justice Department official told reporters on Thursday. “Assange was warned by the State Department not to release the names but he did so nevertheless.”

However, the government has not identified any individuals who were directly killed a result of Assange's disclosures. The U.S. counterintelligence official who led the Pentagon's review of the bombshell leaks told a court during Manning’s sentencing hearing in 2013 that investigators had not been able to find any such instances.

Still, Zach Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, stressed that the government was “not charging Assange for passively obtaining classified information.” Rather, he is being prosecuted for publishing “a narrow set of classified documents in which Assange also published the names of innocent people who risked their safety” to help the United States.

“Assange is not charged simply because he is a publisher,” Terwilliger told reporters on Thursday.

Prosecutors said Manning had contacted Assange as early as November 2009, responding ""to Assange’s solicitation of classified information made through the WikiLeaks website."" The appeal included a “Military and Intelligence Most Wanted Leaks” category that solicited CIA detainee interrogation videos.

Assange also encouraged Manning to transfer him Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs in March 2010, according to chats obtained by the government, as well as Iraq rule of engagement files and 75,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports.

John Brown, the FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said the indictment was “the result of nearly a decade” of work.

The original Assange indictment, brought in March 2018 and unsealed in April of this year, charged the WikiLeaks founder with conspiring with Manning to hack a government computer to obtain hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about U.S. wars in the Middle East. WikiLeaks later published the leaked information.

Assange faces up to 10 years in prison on each count.

Manning was jailed in March after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury about Assange. She is still in prison, and DOJ officials would not comment on her situation on Thursday.

"Arkansas housing authorities in pot quandary; they weigh tenants’ use in situation where state, federal laws at odds",https://www.arkansasonline.com,['Ginny Monk'],05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/may/26/housing-authorities-in-pot-quandary-201/,"About 70 people were in line outside Green Springs Medical, a marijuana dispensary on Seneca Street in Hot Springs, when it opened after 8 a.m. on May 13. The dispensary was one of two to open in the state over the weekend; the other, Doctor’s Orders RX, also is in Garland County. - Photo by Richard Rasmussen

Many Arkansas housing authority officials hadn't developed policies on what to do about medical marijuana when the first ounces were sold earlier this month.

Although medical marijuana is legal in 33 states, including Arkansas, it's still a Schedule 1 drug under federal law. The collision of state and federal law means local housing officials must decide whether to evict residents who use cannabis, even if the residents have state-issued medical marijuana cards.

The issue has been debated nationwide for years as various states have legalized medical marijuana. Conflicting policy has resulted in evictions of some and denial of rental assistance for others.

The Hot Springs Housing Authority has banned use of the drug.

""Until we hear something from HUD, it's still illegal,"" said Richard Herrington, the agency's executive director, referring to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Both of the state's currently operating medical cannabis dispensaries are in Hot Springs. There are 30 more dispensaries across the state yet to open.

Other housing authority officials plan to consider each request for use on a case-by-case basis, and some haven't developed any policies on the matter.

[RELATED: Complete Democrat-Gazette coverage of medical marijuana in Arkansas]

At the Texarkana Housing Authority, executive director Dub Wingfield says his agency will likely take an approach to medical marijuana different from the Hot Springs agency, although the board hasn't addressed the subject yet. He said two authority members have been unavailable because of work responsibilities and illness for the past two months, but he's hopeful the authority will address a medical marijuana policy at its next meeting.

""We don't have anything in place at this time for medical marijuana,"" Wingfield said. ""Government regulation says that any narcotics are not allowed on public housing, so it is a question. But if you have a medical need for it, I would think that we would probably be compliant with that issue.""

HUD's official stance is that residents of public housing, about 20 percent of whom are disabled, aren't allowed to use cannabis, even for medicinal purposes.

""From the federal point of view, marijuana remains a controlled substance and is illegal,"" said Patricia Campbell, a HUD regional public affairs officer.

HUD put out a memo in 2014 and two in 2011 on the topic but hasn't issued any guidance to local-level authorities since. HUD officials in Washington, D.C., sent the 2014 memo to directors of multifamily housing programs.

Its directives make it clear that public housing agencies can't accept new applicants who are taking medical marijuana, said David Gates, Arkansas' chapter president for the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. The group advocates for ""adequate and affordable housing and strong, viable communities,"" according to its website.

Gates, who is also the executive director at the Lonoke County Housing Authority, said that when voters passed the state's medical marijuana constitutional amendment in 2016, association members began talking about what to do.

The association hasn't taken a stance on medical marijuana, he said.

Gates added that while he sees a potential for conflict with residents who have medical marijuana cards, that problem hasn't arisen in the weeks since the two Hot Springs dispensaries opened.

One 52-year-old woman in Northwest Arkansas, who has a Section 8 voucher for her housing, said she has a medical marijuana card, but because she lives in government-assisted housing, there isn't a way for her to use the drug. It's the only thing that keeps the pain from injuries related to past abuse as well as scoliosis and fibromyalgia, among other ailments, at bay, she said.

Her income comes from Social Security because she is disabled, she said.

The woman, who spoke to the newspaper on the condition of anonymity because she fears eviction, said the ban on marijuana was included in a ban on smoking at HUD properties in a document sent to residents earlier this year. She refused to sign the document, which requires tenants to smoke tobacco or any other product at least 25 feet away from their homes.

For her, that means either smoking the medical marijuana in public, which isn't allowed under state regulations, or on someone else's property.

""Their rules require us to BREAK the rules we agreed to as patients,"" she said via text message. ""I can literally lose ALL federal assistance ... I'm unable to work ... so that leaves a lot of us homeless and destitute.""

Herrington said that while no medical marijuana will be allowed for Hot Springs tenants, no matter what program they are in, officials don't drug-test residents and won't ""go in their units and go through their personal things.""

The Hot Springs Housing Authority provides rental assistance to just over 1,000 low-income people.

""It's still an eviction issue,"" he said ""It's a termination issue from the program, so HUD's going to have to make a decision on what they want, but right now we tell people if you take it ... we don't do drug tests on residents.""

The drug policy of Little Rock's Metropolitan Housing Alliance bans all residents from ""engaging in illegal use of a drug."" The policy doesn't specifically mention marijuana. The alliance is the largest housing authority in the state and serves about 8,000 people.

The policy refers to HUD regulations that deny admission to applicants and require removal of tenants from the housing program if they use illegal drugs.

Kenyon Lowe, a commissioner at the Little Rock agency, has been outspoken in past meetings about a need for the five-member board of commissioners to establish a policy.

""That's already been taken care of in our drug use policy,"" Lowe said in an interview. ""All you have to do is get a copy of that, and it's all spelled out.""

Across the river, the North Little Rock Housing Authority remains undecided.

Executive Director Belinda Snow said the board hasn't made a decision on a policy and that the agency's attorney was researching the best steps to take.

""We haven't had a reason at this point,"" Snow said.

Legal and bureaucratic snags delayed the sale of medical marijuana in Arkansas for months.

In Lonoke County, Gates said his agency has decided to follow a federal no-smoking policy for public housing that was enacted last year. But when it comes to oils and edibles, he said all requests will need to go through the agency housing manager.

The Lonoke authority will review each case, along with doctors' notes, to ensure that using medical marijuana ""would not impact the housing authority in any negative way,"" he said.

None of the housing directors interviewed by the Democrat-Gazette said they had received any ""reasonable accommodation"" requests for medical marijuana.

A reasonable accommodation, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act, is a change in rules, policies, practices or services to help someone with a disability use his home. Failure to provide these changes is a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act.

But a 2011 HUD Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity memo stated that although many states had legalized medical marijuana, HUD tenants can't receive reasonable accommodations for their prescriptions or protest evictions if they are caught using medical marijuana.

""Accommodations that allow the use of medical marijuana would sanction violations of federal criminal law and thus constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature of the housing operation,"" the memo reads in part. ""Indeed, allowing such an accommodation would thwart a central programmatic goal of providing a safe living environment free from illegal drug use.""

Campbell said that in the five-state region she serves, there has been only one Fair Housing complaint regarding medical marijuana since 2016. HUD determined that there was ""no cause"" to investigate, she said. The region includes Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.

Carol Johnson, the executive director of the Arkansas Fair Housing Commission, said her office hadn't received any complaints and wasn't surprised ""given the newness of the law.""

Over the past year, Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who serves as a nonvoting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives from Washington, D.C., has twice proposed bills that would allow public housing residents to use medical marijuana, in compliance with state law.

The first, from 2018, died. The second, which Norton introduced April 18, is in committee.

Ingraham exclusive: Homeland Security boss defends against family-separation accusations at border,https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ingraham-exclusive-dhs-head-defends-against-family-separation-accusat-at-the-border,"The acting head of the Department of Homeland Security is disputing accusations that U.S. authorities are continuing to separate children from their families.

""First of all, that is not happening. We're separating children in maybe one case a day out of the 3,000 families arriving,"" Kevin McAleenan said Thursday in an exclusive interview on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle.""

""It's very rare,"" he added. ""It's for the safety of the child first and foremost.""

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

McAleenan, 47, a native of Hawaii, was appointed to DHS by President Trump in April, after the departure of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He previously served as a commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a unit of DHS.

On Thursday's show, McAleenan responded to a clip of MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski talking about family separations on Thursday morning.

""This is our responsibility as a country and as a nation,"" Brzezinski said. ""We are not being given answers as to what is happening to small, young children, to teenagers, to girls, to boys [who were] being taken away from their families, from their parents and left alone in our custody.""

McAleenan also discussed his recent appearances on Capitol Hill asking for funding, including a hearing where Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that children in U.S. custody were living in poor conditions and alluded to news reports that several children in U.S. custody had died.

McAleenan told Ingraham that he objected to Underwood's depiction of the situation.

""It's a sad state of affairs in our politics but we have an actual crisis and we have solutions on the table and clarity of what the men and women on the border need from Congress and yet that is the kind of thing we are hearing,"" McAleenan said.

McAleenan also spoke about illnesses afflicting migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""We are seeing younger children arriving sicker every single day. We had an H1N1 outbreak yesterday at McAllen [Texas] station, the infectious disease with the teenager who passed away on Monday. It looks like he had the flu, a very virulent strain of the flu, H1N1. We have seen measles, we've seen mumps, folks in ICE custody that are quarantined due to mumps. It's a tremendous challenge,"" McAleenan said, adding that the situation with smugglers exacerbates the illnesses."
Veterans Affairs employee charged for recording women in department restroom,https://www.cnn.com,['Devan Cole'],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/23/politics/veterans-affairs-hidden-restroom-camera-arrest/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A Department of Veterans Affairs employee was charged Wednesday for allegedly recording multiple women without their knowledge in a restroom at the department's headquarters near the White House, according to court documents.

Authorities arrested Alex Greenlee on four charges of voyeurism for ""surreptitiously"" recording four women, one of them multiple times, in late January, according to the documents. Investigators say he recorded a fifth woman whom they have yet to identify.

The VA said in a statement to CNN that it ""immediately notified law enforcement after learning about this abhorrent behavior"" and that Greenlee is in the process of being fired.

According to the documents, Greenlee used two micro cameras to record the women in a restroom at the VA's office in downtown Washington.

The first camera was discovered by a woman who said it was attached to the stall next to the one she had used in the restroom, according to the documents. After leaving the restroom and reporting the camera to another female employee, the woman -- who authorities said was not captured on the camera -- saw Greenlee outside the restroom on his cellphone. She said he asked her if everything was OK and ""attempted"" to go inside the restroom, saying he needed to get paper towels.

President Donald Trump's snap decision to send billions of dollars in new aid to farmers could be bad for the farm economy and the federal budget.

Many farmers are still deciding what to plant this spring and could be swayed toward crops that receive higher payouts from the aid package, such as soybeans. That would add to already record supplies and further depress prices that have been falling for five years.

Story Continued Below

Trump tweeted about the new bailout for farmers earlier this month, soon after he decided to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China and Beijing retaliated by raising duties on $60 billion in U.S. products, many of them agricultural. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who weeks earlier denied the White House was discussing another round of aid so soon after a $12 billion bailout last year, suddenly interrupted a trip to South Korea to announce a second program.

Farm groups are headed to the White House on Thursday afternoon to join Trump as he announces a $16 billion boost for agriculture. The American Farm Bureau Federation and groups representing soybean, corn, wheat and pork producers are expected to attend, as well as lawmakers including Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who has worked closely with the administration on the aid package.

“We want to make sure that the farmers are being protected as we go through the process of negotiating new trade deals,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday outside the White House.

But the Trump administration’s decision to roll out the program now is drawing critics.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the White House should have been more cautious about the timing of the announcement because farmers are still planting.

“[W]e want farmers to make decisions on how many acres of corn and soybeans to plant based on the market and not something the government’s doing,” he said.

“The timing couldn’t have been worse,” said Jonathan Coppess, an agricultural policy professor at the University of Illinois, and a former head of the USDA Farm Service Agency during the Obama administration.

Rainfall in the Midwest has delayed planting, so many farmers can still switch up their crops. Even the prospect of another round of trade assistance could encourage them to plant more soybeans, Coppess said.

""There is certainly enough experience at USDA to know that announcing payments during planting might well cause more problems,"" Coppess said.

USDA’s first trade aid package sent the bulk of direct payments to soybeans given the significant damage that China’s 25 percent tariff on U.S. imports has done to prices and demand. China, the world’s top pork producer, is expected to need fewer soybeans to feed its hogs this year because African swine fever has forced the government to kill more than a million animals.

This year, the amount of money farmers receive will largely depend on the county in which they live in, instead of what they grow, the USDA announced on Thursday.

USDA officials estimated the amount of economic damage inflicted on different counties as a result of the trade disputes and will multiply that by what was planted in the area this year.

“We wanted to make sure producers are planting for the market,” Bill Northey, USDA undersecretary for farm production and conservation, told reporters Thursday.

The 2018 trade package was based on what crops farmers actually planted that season — bucking Congress' efforts over the years to make subsidy programs more market-oriented by tying them to farmers' average historical acres and yields.

The aid programs in both years primarily involve sending direct payments to farmers and ranchers using funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era financial institution under the USDA that has broad authority to stabilize the farm economy.

But it is unclear whether the CCC has enough borrowing authority to fund another tariff-relief program. It is only allowed to borrow $30 billion per fiscal year from the U.S. Treasury to fund its work, and last year’s bailout used a big chunk of that. The CCC also is used to fund traditional farm subsidies authorized every five years by Congress.

Lawmakers last September included language in a short-term spending bill that effectively gave the CCC more flexibility to keep money flowing.

Hoeven, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subpanel overseeing USDA, told reporters last week that Congress can easily reimburse the financial institution if needed.

Trump is using taxpayer money to help just one industry harmed by trade policy. Other industries reeling from the tariff battles, from car manufacturers to shoe retailers, are not expected to receive financial aid.

Some farmers recognize the disparity, and stress that they would prefer to have open access to markets.

Fact-checking Trump claims he's 'the most transparent' president in US history,https://www.cnn.com,"['Marshall Cohen', 'Holmes Lybrand']",05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/24/politics/trump-claims-most-transparent-president-fact-check/index.html,"(CNN) Before heading out on his trip to Japan, President Donald Trump spoke with the press Friday reasserting his claim that he is the ""most transparent"" President.

""I was the most transparent, and am, transparent President in history,"" Trump said , going on to cite how many interviews and documents special counsel Robert Mueller's team went through.

While it's difficult to judge levels of transparency between US presidents, Trump has worked to hide personal information from the public and did not fully cooperate with the Mueller investigation.

Facts first: Trump has refused to release his tax returns, has battled congressional subpoenas for his financial information and refused to be interviewed in person by Mueller's team.

Breaking decades of precedent, Trump never released his tax returns to the public and is working to block subpoenas from the House to access his financial records."

Dem rebuked after calling child deaths ‘intentional’ in fiery exchange with DHS boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-rebuked-after-calling-child-deaths-intentional-in-fiery-exchange-with-dhs-boss,"A hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee came to a screeching halt Wednesday when a Democrat had her words struck from the record after calling the deaths of children in custody at the border an ""intentional"" policy decision.

Rep. Lauren Underwood's questioning of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was contentious from the beginning, when the Illinois lawmaker asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that the continued poor conditions in which children allegedly were being kept, and the recent death of a fifth child in custody, showed that this was the administration's goal.

""At this point, with five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their families, I feel like, and the evidence is really clear, this is intentional,"" Underwood said. ""It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane.""

McAleenan fired back, disputing Underwood's characterization.

""That's an appalling accusation, and our men and women fight hard to protect people in our custody every single day,"" he said. McAleenan added that his department asked for resources prior to the latest fatality and that Congress has not responded. He also said that DHS asked for changes ""that would have prevented this from happening.""

Underwood's comments were in reference to the government's announcement that a 16-year-old Guatemalan died Monday at a South Texas Border Patrol station. He was diagnosed with the flu on Sunday at a border facility, which was then temporarily closed.

Last week, a 2-year-old died after he and his mother were detained. Government officials said the child was taken to the hospital the same day his mother reported he was sick, and he was in the hospital for weeks. On April 30, a 16-year-old boy also died after officials at a Health and Human Services detention facility noticed that he was sick.

Underwood was given an opportunity to clarify her remarks, and she said the same thing, using virtually identical language. ""With five children dead and 5,000 separated from their families, this is intentional. It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane,"" she reiterated.

Ranking Member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., came to McAleenan's defense, calling out Underwood for her remarks.

""Mr. Chairman, you cannot impugn the character of the witness by stating that he intentionally murders children,"" he said. ""That is completely inappropriate, and her words should be taken down. She was very explicit.""

Underwood defended herself, saying she did not use the word ""murder,"" but said that deaths were the result of policy choices.

""He has said that he stands by the policy decisions of this administration, that's what he said at the beginning of his testimony.""

McAleenan said he ""did not say that at all.""

FORMER OBAMA DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY ON INCREASING NUMBER OF BORDER APPREHENSIONS

Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., first allowed Underwood's words to remain on the record, stating that ""the language is approprite and that it should not be taken down.""

This eventually led to a vote over whether to take down Underwood's words from the record.

After a 9-7 vote, Underwood's words were taken down.

Underwood later took to Twitter to comment on what happened.

""For over a year, it’s been clear that policies at the border have harmed the physical and mental health of migrant children,"" she said. ""I believe, at this point, failure to change these broken policies based on that knowledge is intentional and unacceptable.""

DOJ Attorneys Reportedly Ready to Block T-Mobile/Sprint Merger,https://gizmodo.com,"['Dell Cameron', 'About The Author', 'Privacy', 'Security', 'Tech Policy', 'Email', 'Dell Gizmodo.Com', 'Xmpp', 'Dell Jabber.Ccc.De']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/doj-attorneys-reportedly-ready-to-block-t-mobile-sprint-1834961808,"Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP

To literally no one’s surprise, the head of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday announced Monday that he’d recommend approving the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. But it now looks as if the Justice Department’s own attorneys vehemently oppose the merger.



Reuters reported Wednesday that the DOJ’s antitrust division has recommended filing a lawsuit to block the $26.5 billion deal. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, the news agency said the division’s staff have long been “skeptical” of the proposed merger, in that it does not appear to be in the best interests of consumers.

Per Reuters: “T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.”

Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, said earlier that commitments by T-Mobile and Sprint to close “the digital divide in rural America” and advance “United States leadership in 5G, the next generation in wireless connectivity,” has persuaded him to approve the deal.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr—only days after accepting an award from the nation’s largest wireless industry trade association—announced that he, too, was also swayed by the companies’ commitments and would support the chairman’s decision.

Praising his “ongoing leadership,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere thanked Pai for his support in a statement Monday, while promising the commitments T-Mobile agreed to are “verifiable, enforceable and specific.” But consumer advocacy groups and legal experts following the news disagreed entirely.

“Rather than actually examine the competitive impact, Chairman Pai’s recommended approval points to T-Mobile’s commitments and behavioral conditions,” said Yosef Getachew, media and democracy program director for Common Cause. “Not only are these commitments and conditions unenforceable and riddled with loopholes, they do nothing to address the blatant competitive harms the merger poses to consumers.”

Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, echoed those concerns in a Wired op-ed this week, writing that Legere’s assurances “are speculative, unsubstantiated, and entirely unenforceable.” Sohn went on to call T-Mobile’s vow not to raise prices for three years an “admission” that, should the merger be approved, “there would not be enough competition in the wireless market to constrain price increases.”

Pai’s announcement was also rebuked by, among others, New America’s Open Technology Institute and the Rural Wireless Association. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is Democrat, compared the merger to “consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,” which she argued, “hasn’t worked out well for consumers.”

“The inadequate conditions [Pai] and his fellow GOP commissioners so readily and rapidly blessed are a tiny Band-Aid on what would be a fatal wound to wireless competition and affordability in this country,” said Matt Wood, vice president of policy at the advocacy group Free Press. “DOJ’s staff seems to get that, even if some of the political appointees leading the FCC don’t.”"

President Donald Trump won’t release White House visitor logs, he refuses to hand over his tax returns, he made staffers sign non-disclosure agreements and he’s balking at congressional investigators.

Yet during a Rose Garden speech on Wednesday, he again proclaimed himself “the most transparent president” in U.S. history, adding to the reporters gathered before him, “I think most of you would agree.”

Story Continued Below

It may be true that Trump reveals more of his personal thoughts and emotions than any of his predecessors. But by most other measures of presidential transparency, including the congressional oversight at issue during his White House appearance Wednesday, Trump operates behind dark-tinted windows.

The end to White House visitor logs, a way for the public to see who is getting direct access to the most powerful man in America, is a break from Obama administration practice. He’s the first president in decades not to release his tax returns. No modern White House has held as few daily press briefings as Trump’s, a ritual his Pentagon and State Department have also largely phased out. And while many presidents have battled Congressional oversight requests, Trump has dismissed the queries of House Democrats as illegitimate partisan inquests.

All of which has many critics saying that Trump has it backwards.

“It is for sure the least transparent administration in modern history,” said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a prominent Washington consumer advocacy group.

Norm Ornstein, a longtime government reform advocate and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, called the Trump administration “the opposite of transparent.” Trump’s statement, he deadpanned, “made me laugh -- before I cried again.”

Even by the standards of Trump’s penchant for embellishment and falsehoods, Trump’s claim of unprecedented transparency — which he and his aides have made repeatedly — is particularly outrageous to the cadre of outside groups who’ve spent the last 2.5 years clashing with an administration they view as deeply secretive.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/2659/1155968404_6039857995001_6039857592001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

There is no universal definition of government transparency. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service defines transparency as “the disclosure of government information” that can be used to “hold the federal government more accountable for its actions or inactions.”

Measured by that sort of standard, critics say, Trump has fallen far short.

Within the first year of Trump’s presidency, the federal government denied or censored more public information requests than at any time in the last decade. And Freedom of Information Act lawsuits intended to force the administration to turn over records reached a record high last year, increasing by nearly 70 percent compared with the last full fiscal year of President Barack Obama’s term.

“There’s only one way in which he’s the most transparent president and that’s that we can see him broadcasting his thoughts on Twitter when he gets angry in the morning,” said John Wonderlich, the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government accountability group. “Otherwise, it’s ridiculous.”

White House officials counter that Trump is more accessible than any modern president, broadcasting his thoughts to his millions of followers everyday, answering shouted questions from reporters and granting regular print, television and radio interviews. By that measure, the public likely has a better understanding of Trump’s minute-to-minute opinions than they did of other recent presidents, who were often reluctant to spout off in public until their ideas had been vetted by their advisers.

Though White House aides hold up Trump as a pillar of accessibility, they have also sought to tightly control Trump’s interactions with the media. Trump’s exclusive interviews tend to be with friendly news outlets. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last appeared in the press briefing room in April to answer children’s questions during “Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day,” and White House officials argued that her answers should be off the record.

Watchdog groups said accessibility alone isn’t enough to claim the transparency mantle.

“I don’t think that’s meaningful transparency,” said Liz Hempowicz, public policy director at the Project on Government Oversight, adding that the true transparency requires a government-wide commitment across federal agencies.

Hempowicz and other experts noted that the lack of transparency at federal agencies has massive consequences for the public, but often gets less attention than Trump’s headline-grabbing statements.

Just this week, for example, the Washington Post disclosed the existence of an internal Defense Department memo restricting the way the Pentagon shares information with Congress. And POLITICO recently detailed efforts by the Agriculture Department to reassign nearly all its researchers who study the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps, in what employees call a crackdown on economists whose assessments don’t square with Trump’s policies.

Then there is Trump’s categorical rejection of House Democratic oversight requests, including the extraordinary use of lawsuits to fight back against his investigators.

Trump’s claims of unprecedented transparency seem to be increasing as he grows more frustrated with the investigations encircling him. Aides and associates say Trump is furious that the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report has not dampened appetites for more investigation into subjects like his finances and tax returns.

“The President was fully transparent during the Mueller investigation. He made all requested White House staff available for interviews, produced tens of thousands of documents, and answered questions about the ridiculous ‘collusion’ allegations,” White House spokesman Steven Groves said in a statement. “The White House and the Administration will continue to cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight while protecting Executive Branch rights and privileges. In addition, the President and his staff engage with the press and answer their questions almost every day.”

On Wednesday, Trump lashed out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for accusing him of engaging in a “cover-up,” countering that his administration had cooperated extensively with Mueller’s inquiries. Trump did give current and former staffers the green-light to participate with Mueller, although he himself refused to sit for an in-person interview, answering written questions instead.

“I think most of you would agree to this,” Trump said after abruptly ending a meeting with Democrats and vowing not to work with them until they end their investigations. “I’m the most transparent president, probably, in the history of this country. And instead of walking in happily to a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said I was doing a cover-up. I don’t do cover-ups.”

Trump isn’t the first president to throw around transparency-related superlatives. Soon after winning the presidency, Barack Obama vowed to make his administration the most transparent in history. And he did take steps toward that goal, including through the first-ever release of White House visitor logs. But watchdog groups often complained that Obama was betraying that promise when he blocked access to records or his Justice Department prosecuted government leakers.

“The [Obama] administration’s war on leaks and other efforts to control information are the most aggressive I’ve seen since the Nixon administration,” former Washington Post editor Len Downie wrote in a 2013 report.

“It’s unwise for a president to make a statement like that” unless he can back it up, Hempowicz said of Obama’s boast, noting that good government groups criticized the 44th president throughout his time in office. “It makes it very easy for us to push back.”"

""Despite the fact that you were briefed on these concerns before the rule was proposed, you have continued to make assertions about the proposal that you must know do not reflect the views of EPA's expert staff,"" the lawmakers wrote.

The EPA’s controversial proposal would freeze emissions standards set by the Obama administration in 2020 rather than have them tighten into 2026. Vehicle manufacturers oppose the plan, and the proposal has sparked a lawsuit with California, with the state threatening to enact other tough measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

An EPA spokesperson told The Hill when asked to comment on the letter that the agency ""will respond through the proper channels.""

In a letter to the agency, the Democrats homed in on one particular comment Wheeler made to Congress in April.

“I have been told by my staff that the CO2 reductions, the impact of the CO2 reductions are pretty similar to what the Obama administration proposal would have received under their — would have gotten under their proposal. Because the Obama proposal had a number of exemptions and off-ramps. And the car, automobile manufacturers aren’t complying with the Obama standards today,” Wheeler told the House Energy and Commerce Committee then.

The legislators said that was demonstrably false.

“These and other statements like it are remarkable since analysis in the proposed rule clearly demonstrates that carbon pollution will increase by 8 billion tons during this century if the Trump Administration proposal is finalized,” they wrote in the letter.

The Democrats argued that the only discernible purpose for the proposed rollback is to increase the profits of the oil industry and said the request for documents was to shed light on how outside groups may have influenced the agency.

The two are asking the agency to turn over a number of materials, including briefing slides prepared by EPA staff, a list of meetings held with a number of fuel industry and conservative groups and any correspondence between them and political appointees.

The legislators also ask for information presented to Bill Wehrum, the head of EPA’s air office and a former lobbyist who Democrats have probed on a number of issues."
Impeaching a president has little historical precedent,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Valerie Richardson']",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/26/impeaching-president-has-little-historical-precede/,"With Democrats debating whether to impeach President Trump, it’s worth remembering that no president has ever been removed via the impeachment process. Not so for the governors of Oklahoma.

After Oklahoma gained statehood in 1907, the Legislature went on an impeachment tear, bringing charges against four governors and booting two from office. Still, voters didn’t hold it against them: One of the ousted governors later served in the state Senate, and the other was elected to the state’s Corporation Commission.

Outside the Sooner State, however, impeachment has been used sparingly. Only eight governors have been forced to leave office after being impeached, and only two presidents — Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton — have undergone impeachment, with neither being removed.

Matthew Spalding, a constitutional studies professor at Hillsdale College’s extension center in Washington, D.C., said that’s by design. The Founding Fathers wanted a fail-safe against tyranny and despotism, but they also wanted to make the process extremely difficult.

“It was intended to be a very significant action, a co-equal branch of government removing from office someone in another branch,” said Mr. Spalding, associate vice president and dean of educational programs for the Allan P. Kirby Jr. Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship. “This is, to some extent, a nuclear option in the separation of powers. This was not meant to be an everyday occurrence.”

For all the talk of impeaching Mr. Trump, which began even before he assumed office in January 2017, Democrats would face an arduous climb if they decide to go that route.

The process begins after a complaint or petition has been filed alleging that the president has committed “high crimes and misdemeanors,” which need not be an actual crime.

Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University, said the founders discussed making the standard for impeachment “maladministration” before rejecting that term in favor of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

“What they really were concerned about was a president who was doing something that would damage the country in some way, which is why they came up with this term, ‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’ which all of them completely understood,” Mr. Engel, co-author of “Impeachment: An American History,” said at a recent forum. “We don’t, but they did.

When asked in 1970 to define “impeachable offense,” then-Rep. Gerald R. Ford famously replied, “An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.”

The House Judiciary Committee would refer the matter to its Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee for investigation. If the complaint were found to have merit, the subcommittee would prepare articles of impeachment, which would go to the full committee for a vote.

If passed, the full House would vote on the articles of impeachment, and if approved, they would be sent to the Senate, which “then becomes a courtroom for a full-scale trial, with the senators serving as the jury,” said David Barton in a post for the National Center for Constitutional Studies.

A two-thirds majority Senate vote is required to convict the president, who then would be removed from office.

In the cases of Johnson and Mr. Clinton, the Senate vote fell short, and both presidents resumed their “full practice, responsibilities, and privileges” until the end of their terms.

Confusion about impeachment is common. For example, impeaching a president doesn’t remove him from office — the Senate must vote to do so following a trial. Another misconception is that President Richard M. Nixon was impeached. He resigned in 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee had approved articles of impeachment.

While impeachment is most often associated with presidents, federal and state officials in the executive and judicial branches are also subject to the process. Fifteen federal judges have been impeached, with eight convicted by the Senate, four acquitted and three resigning before the outcome.

Only one Supreme Court justice has been impeached: Justice Samuel Chase, who was accused of “arbitrary and oppressive conduct of trials” and was acquitted in 1805, according to Ballotpedia.

“That was really the first big case,” said Hillsdale College’s Mr. Spalding. “That was after the election of 1800, and the Jeffersonians didn’t like the fact that all these Federalists were taking over the Supreme Court. They went after him in broad terms, and it was a mostly political question.”

The impeachment of Justice Chase “helped define what an impeachment is. It established the fact that you really can’t impeach someone because you don’t like their politics,” Mr. Spalding added. “All the cases, in their way, underscore the fact that this is not to be done for light or frivolous reasons.”

Ford, who became president after Nixon’s resignation, tried in 1970 to have Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas impeached and even testified before the House Judiciary Committee, but no vote was taken.

While impeachment is rare, calls for impeachment are on the upswing. The House referred an impeachment resolution to the Judiciary Committee against President George W. Bush over his conduct of the Iraq War in 2008, but no further action was taken.

Efforts by a few House Republicans to impeach President Barack Obama also went nowhere. Still, the frequency of such demands may have diluted their impact.

Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center of Public Affairs, noted that more than 100 years separated the Johnson and Nixon impeachment proceedings.

Today, however, the frequency of impeachment calls “may have become white noise” to the voters, she added.

“Now it’s becoming part and parcel — sadly — of our polarization, of our polarized polity,” Ms. Perry said. “And that may have an impact on how people see it, that they come to see it as a purely partisan element.”

“Recent DHS statistics on the number of arrivals at our southern border are clear proof that what is currently being done, is not enough,"" the group wrote.

The letter noted that two weeks ago U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost told the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration that, ""as of March 31, 2019, 361,087 migrants have been apprehended between the points of entry (POEs) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, representing a 108 percent increase over the same time in FY 2018.”

“Current projections are that more than 1 million people will have crossed our southern border illegally this year. Our constituents, the American public, are confounded as to why more is not being done by your Department,” the letter said.

Proposals include expanding a training program for border patrol agents to conduct fear interviews, where an undocumented immigrant is referred to an asylum officer if they express fear of returning to their home country.

Other proposals include limiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement's parole policy, limiting work authorization to only those whose asylum applications have been approved, increasing asylum fees and terminating the Flores settlement agreement.

“As the President continues to show leadership on this issue, we strongly encourage you to exercise the same manner of enthusiasm for fixing this crisis,” the letter says. “Included in this letter are proposals that would undoubtedly slow the surge at the border and provide context for long term immigration solutions.”

The group of immigration hard-liners also called for a third country agreement to be negotiated to allow undocumented immigrants to be relocated to another country that didn’t pose a threat in addition to enforcing “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which would require individuals from Central America to remain in Mexico while they await their immigration hearings."
This veteran population map shows VA healthcare access is wildly unequal throughout the U.S.,https://www.fastcompany.com,[],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.fastcompany.com/90355253/veteran-population-map-shows-unequal-access-to-va-healthcare?partner=rss,"Unequal access to Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities has long been a topic of concern for veterans and their advocates, and debate over how to deal with the issue has increased in recent years as VA facilities have struggled to keep pace with an influx of service members whose tours of duty in Iraq or Afghanistan have left them in need of care.

At the heart of the issue is the time it takes for patients to travel from their homes to a VA facility. In January, the Trump administration proposed new rules that would allow veterans who live as close as 30 minutes from a facility to opt instead for private care—a controversial policy that some critics say will have a corrosive effect on the VA healthcare system as money is diverted into the private sector, the New York Times reports. The proposed plan is expected to take effect this summer.

Regardless of where you stand on the new plan, it’s clear that access to VA facilities is wildly uneven throughout the country, and that veterans in larger states, particularly in the Western half of the country, often carry a burden of longer-than-average transportation times.

Now, just in time for Memorial Day, spatial-analytics firm Esri is releasing a new interactive map that sheds light on which areas are more seriously affected. The map uses a color spectrum of dark blue, light gray, and red to visualize the amount of time it takes to drive from each census-designated place in the United States to the nearest VA medical facility.

In the map, veterans who live in the blue areas have drive times of 45 minutes or less, while those in the red areas have drive times of 45 minutes or more. When zoomed out, the map shows the largest swaths of long drive times spread throughout the Deep South, Great Plains, Rocky Mountain states, and the Pacific Northwest.

If you zoom into the map and click on any of the points, you can see additional details about the designated area, including trip time, trip distance, the name of the closest VA facility, the veteran population of the area, and the veteran share of the total population.

At the state level, according to Esri’s analysis, the District of Columbia has the shortest average drive time at just four minutes, while Alaska has the highest at 603 minutes—however, both of those areas are outliers given their size.

The Agriculture Department is moving nearly all its researchers into the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps – subjects of controversial Trump administration initiatives – outside of Washington, part of what employees claim is a political crackdown on economists whose assessments have raised questions about the president’s policies.

Since last year, employees in the department’s Economic Research Service have awaited news of which members of their agency would be forced to relocate, after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stunned them by declaring he was moving most of the agency to a location outside the capital. The announcement sparked claims that Perdue was trying to pressure economists into leaving the agency rather than move their families.

On March 5, the department began notifying people who were allowed to stay in Washington, but didn’t provide a comprehensive list, only telling employees in person if they made the cut.

But current and former employees compiled one anyway, covering all 279 people on staff, 76 of whom are being allowed to stay in Washington.

The current and former employees, all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, say the specialties of those who are being asked to move corresponds closely to the areas where economic assessments often clash with the president’s policies, including tax policies, climate change, and the farm economy. The list, shared exclusively with POLITICO, shows a clear emphasis was placed on keeping employees whose work covers relatively non-controversial issues like crop planting over those whose research focused on areas sensitive to the administration.

“This was a clear politicization of the agency many of us loved for its non-partisan research and analysis,” a current ERS employee told POLITICO, claiming that department leaders picked those whose work was more likely to offend the administration and forced them to move “out or quit.”

A former researcher who left last month in anticipation of being moved put it this way: “You can draw the conclusion that these are the less valued activities that are undertaken by ERS. They view ERS as being useful in that it produces data and statistics that can inform policy but the research that’s done by the economists and geographers and statisticians at ERS is less valuable and that they’re not concerned with a significant deterioration in ERS’ ability to do research.”

A USDA spokesman declined to directly address the employees’ allegation of political bias, but provided a written statement from Perdue saying that the moves were not prompted by the work being done by ERS

“None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our . . . employees, and in fact, I frequently tell my Cabinet colleagues that USDA has the best workforce in the federal government,” Perdue said. “These changes are more steps down the path to better service to our customers, and will help us fulfill our informal motto to ‘Do right and feed everyone. . .”

“We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide. We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run. And we are increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture, many of whom come from land-grant universities.”

But employees claim the department’s leadership, including Perdue, turned against the research service after an estimate early last year suggested that the Republican-backed tax plan would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers.

Perdue’s decision to move ERS came several months after news outlets highlighted the USDA study on the Republican tax changes. In response to Perdue’s move, cities from all over the country submitted bids to host the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which will also move. The finalists, announced May 3, were the greater Kansas City area, North Carolina‘s Research Triangle Park and multiple locations in Indiana.

Accompanying his announcement of a final selection, which is expected as early as this week, Perdue has promised to provide Congress with a cost-benefit analysis detailing why USDA says the move makes financial sense.

The impending announcement comes as pressure builds on Capitol Hill to stop the move. On Thursday, the House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to consider a spending bill that includes a provision barring the Agriculture Department from moving the two agencies out of the national capital zone. It also would block Perdue’s decision to put ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, a move that placed oversight of the agency closer to the secretary’s office.

Employees said that moving nearly all researchers out of Washington would have a clear impact on the agency’s work. Researchers said they usually draw on information from other USDA divisions, members of Congress and Washington-based stakeholder groups, which would be more difficult from a remote location. Allowing 76 members of the agency to stay in Washington while the other left also impacts morale, they said, and limits collaboration.

Among the employees staying in Washington are senior analysts who conduct global market and crop-outlook estimates and administrative personnel. According to the list, approximately 49 percent of agricultural economists will be allowed to remain in Washington, compared with 14 percent of researchers.

Rumors had been swirling among staff for months about who would be allowed to remain in Washington when all ERS employees were called into an auditorium in March to be briefed by Acting Administrator Chris Hartley. He then read aloud the names of those who qualified to stay. But it wasn’t until employees compiled a full roster of who was staying and going that they got a clear picture of how the agency would be split up.

Decisions on who would stay in Washington were made by ERS leadership and approved by Perdue, according to a “Frequently Asked Questions” document distributed at the March meeting. The FAQ states that “every ERS employee had the ability to provide input” on the move. Senior managers “proposed critical ERS functions” that they believed needed to remain in Washington.

Some employees said that description of the decision-making process validates their concerns that Perdue was behind the move.

“They went in and handpicked who they wanted and called them ‘critical,’” said a current ERS employee.

Neil Conklin, a former senior administrator at ERS under the George W. Bush administration, said the agency stands to be fundamentally changed by the relocation.

“This is going to be very destructive of the agency, as certainly as we’ve known it,” Conklin said.

Four senators, in a Thursday letter to the agency, called on the EPA to modify an existing policy so that “similar abuses of agency funds are not permitted to reoccur.”

A recent Office of Inspector General (OIG) report found that Pruitt incurred thousands of dollars in “excessive airfare expenses ... without sufficient justification to support security concerns requiring the use of first- and business-class travel.”

The OIG last week said the agency should recover thousands of dollars from Pruitt spent on upgraded travel.

Democrats say the EPA’s decision not to pursue collection of the funds excuses Pruitt’s behavior contrasts with other agency heads who have paid back funds in similar situations.

“It is disappointing to learn that the EPA decided not to heed the Acting Inspector General’s findings and recommendations,"" the senators wrote in their letter. ""These findings and recommendations were based on a meticulous analysis of the EPA’s own records. Failing to heed them essentially writes Mr. Pruitt a blank check for his lavish travel.""

“A decision to ignore these findings puts EPA at odds with other federal agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Veterans Affairs, that have required senior officials to pay the agency back for similar transgressions,” the senators wrote.

When reached for comment, the EPA reiterated its earlier position on many of the OIG report’s findings.

“The basis for the recovery of these funds rests on OIG contesting whether there was a proper delegation within EPA to approve first-class travel and whether that travel was justified,” the agency said in a statement Friday. “In evaluating the delegation EPA believes that the trips were authorized by an appropriate official, making cost recovery inappropriate.”

The agency added that it also recently provided “retroactive approval” of each trip Pruitt took as administrator.

“EPA believes it has also complied with Federal Travel Regulations making cost recovery inappropriate,” the agency wrote.

The senators asked the EPA to provide an explanation of its decision by June 7."
U.S. State Department misses deadline to explain Iran arms control report: aide,https://www.reuters.com,"['Arshad Mohammed', 'Min Read']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-armscontrol/u-s-state-department-misses-deadline-to-explain-iran-arms-control-report-aide-idUSKCN1ST2VY,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department failed to meet a deadline on Thursday to provide information to three congressional committee chairmen looking into whether an annual arms control report slanted and politicized assessments about Iran, a congressional aide said.

In a May 16 letter, the Democratic chairmen of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence committees asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to provide a State Department briefing and documents no later than Thursday.

The chairmen’s letter cited a Reuters article on April 17 about how the administration’s annual report to Congress on global compliance with international arms control accords provoked a dispute with U.S. intelligence agencies and some State Department officials.

The dissenting officials, sources said, were concerned that the document politicized and skewed assessments against Iran in a bid to lay the groundwork to justify military action.

A U.S. official familiar with the issue and speaking on condition of anonymity said the chairmen were to be invited to a briefing by State Department and other government experts about the report on “adherence to and compliance with arms control, nonproliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments.”

The congressional aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said no such communication had been received.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S.-Iranian tensions rose following U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal last year from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and his reimposition of tough economic sanctions. They sharpened earlier this month after Trump tightened sanctions to try to eliminate Iran’s oil exports.

Strains further deepened with Saudi Arabia accusing Iran of ordering armed drone attacks on two oil pumping stations and the May 12 sabotage of four vessels, including two Saudi tankers, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

U.S. government sources said Washington strongly suspects militias with ties to Tehran were behind those attacks as well as a rocket strike in Baghdad’s Green Zone.

Iran denied involvement in the incidents.

In their May 16 letter to Pompeo, the three chairmen said they were “deeply concerned” the arms control report may have been produced by political appointees “disregarding intelligence or distorting its meaning.”

The State Department, they noted, was legally bound to submit to Congress a “detailed report” on compliance by the United States and other countries with international arms control accords.

Instead, they wrote, this year’s report was only 12 pages long, “contains no meaningful discussion” of U.S. and Russian compliance with such agreements and “consists largely of hypotheticals or opinion.”

Several sources told Reuters that the report made them wonder if the administration was painting Iran in the darkest light possible, much as the George W. Bush administration used bogus and exaggerated intelligence to justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq."
