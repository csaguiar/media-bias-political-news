Todd Starnes: Anti-Trump Rep. Castro taught a lesson by Texas barbecue lovers who support president,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Todd Starnes', 'Todd Starnes Is Host Of']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/todd-starnes-anti-trump-rep-castro-taught-a-lesson-by-texas-barbecue-lovers-who-support-president,"Rep. Joaquin Castro learned a very important life lesson the other day. It turns out the gun-toting, Bible-clinging Trump supporters in San Antonio don’t take kindly to a politician who disrespects their brisket.

Castro, D-Texas, recently published a list of President Trump's top San Antonio donors. He also doxed their places of employment.

“Their contributions are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as ‘invaders’,” Castro wrote on Twitter.

One of the businesses the congressman targeted for political retribution was Bill Miller Bar-B-Q, one of the most popular brisket and sweet tea joints in San Antonio.

For those of you north of the Mason-Dixon line, eating brisket is something of a worship experience. I’ve heard stories from the Hill Country that some Baptist churches in those parts actually serve brisket and sweet tea for the Lord’s Supper.

Castro must have imagined thousands of San Antonians converging on the barbecue joints armed with torches and pitchforks, terrorizing customers in the drive-thru and staging boycotts. He must have dreamed about literally running the pit masters out of town.

But there are some rules about living in the Lone Star State. You go to church on Sunday. You don’t talk bad about somebody’s momma. And you don’t mess with the brisket.

The day after Castro published that hateful screed, thousands of Texans piled into their pickup trucks and drove to the nearest Bill Miller Bar-B-Q.

Social media reports flooded in showing massive drive-thru lines backing up onto busy streets. Hungry customers patiently waited in lines out the door.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted a photograph of a plate piled high with barbecue noting it was a “perfect night for @BillMillerBarBQ.”

Conservatives have rallied to the restaurant’s defense, much like they did when Chick-fil-A was victimized by leftist bullies over the company’s Christian beliefs. Remember that story?

In my forthcoming book, “Culture Jihad: How to Stop the Left From Killing a Nation,” I urge conservatives to stand up to the militant thugs and bullies who want to destroy this nation. And we cannot allow ourselves to be intimidated by a bunch of pajama boy liberals and their pink-hat-wearing gal pals.

In the days after Castro’s attempt to dox and destroy Trump supporters, something unusual happened. Instead of being afraid, conservatives decided to rise up – and fight back.

“We found that our fundraising actually has gone up since the congressman tried to out those people and shame somebody for supporting President Trump,” Lara Trump told me during an interview on “The Todd Starnes Radio Show.” She said Castro’s hate-tweet was “sick and twisted.”

“People don’t like this,” Lara Trump, who is the president’s daughter-in-law and a senior adviser to his reelection campaign, told me. “This is not acceptable. When has it ever been OK to harass people and try and silence them and make an effort to stop them from contributing to a political campaign just because you disagree with it?”

The Republican National Committee also reports an uptick in donations after the recent attacks on Trump donors. And it’s clear to me that Americans are sending a message to political punks who think it’s OK to bully private citizens.

“This isn’t how we do things in this country,” Lara Trump said.

Amen! God bless Texas and God bless barbecue.

Trump says he received 'small apology' from Kim Jong Un for missile tests,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-apology-kim-jong-un-missile-tests,"President Trump said Saturday that he had received a “small apology” from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for testing short-range missiles -- while appearing to side with him on what he called “ridiculous and expensive” joint exercises conducted by the U.S. and South Korea.

""In a letter to me sent by Kim Jong Un, he stated, very nicely, that he would like to meet and start negotiations as soon as the joint U.S./South Korea joint exercise are over,” Trump tweeted. “It was a long letter, much of it complaining about the ridiculous and expensive exercises.”

NORTH KOREA AGAIN FIRES PROJECTILES INTO SEA OF JAPAN, OFFICIALS SAY

He went on to say that he is looking forward to meeting with him soon.

“It was also a small apology for testing the short range missiles, and that this testing would stop when the exercises end. I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un in the not too distant future!” he said. “A nuclear free North Korea will lead to one of the most successful countries in the world!”

Trump’s tweet comes as the isolated country continued, as Trump indicated, to continue to test short-range missiles on Saturday. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missiles were fired from the North’s east coast and landed in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.

Pyongyang has claimed that the U.S.-South Korea exercises force it to ""develop, test and deploy the powerful physical means essential for national defense.""

Trump has made unprecedented efforts to resolve the crisis in the Peninsula, shifting dramatically from warnings of “fire and fury” for North Korea if it continued to defy the international community in 2017 to two friendly summits in 2018 and 2019. He said on Friday that he received a ""beautiful"" three-page letter from Kim and predicted more talks.

However, this year talks have stalled on the question of Pyongyang’s denuclearization. Seoul and Washington have scaled down exercises since the first talks in 2018, but North Korea has continued to insist that even those violate agreements between Trump and Kim.

"Scenes from Iowa's rowdy, anti-Trump Wing Ding",https://www.politico.com,"['Natasha Korecki', 'David Siders']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/10/iowa-wing-ding-2020-1456224,"Sen. Cory Booker speaking to supporters before the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding on Friday in Clear Lake, Iowa. | John Locher/AP Photo 2020 elections Scenes from Iowa's rowdy, anti-Trump Wing Ding In a shift, Democrats train their attacks on the president, not each other.

CLEAR LAKE, Iowa — There was a moment of silence, friendly candidate-to-candidate photo bombs, even an extended exchange of hugs between candidates.

On Friday, the same crowd of 2020 Democrats that ripped each other apart on the national debate stage in Detroit transformed into a paragon of “Iowa nice” at the Wing Ding — making their best pitches to potential Iowa caucus-goers without eviscerating each other.

Story Continued Below

Instead, the 22 candidates unloaded on President Donald Trump in a parade of speeches that framed the fight for the White House as a battle against hate and bigotry. Invoking last weekend's mass shootings, they joined in calling for stronger gun laws. And they called for different approach to immigration.

The event came as the primary season in the first-in-the-nation voting state kicked into high gear with start of the annual state fair. The enthusiasm of voters was palpable: thousands packed into the historic venue, which at times grew so loud that speakers had to yell to be heard.

Cory Booker dedicated all of his time to gun violence, delivering what was perhaps the most fiery performance of the night.

“It is time for us to stand up with faith in our country, faith in our ideals, faith in each other and come together again. And stand together. And work together. And love together. And overcome his darkness with our light,” Booker roared as a thunderous crowd rose to its feet. “This is the call of our country and it is time for the United States of America to rise again!”

The affair, which stretched for three-and-a-half hours, offered a peek into what Democratic candidates believe motivates Iowa caucus-goers most: Beating Trump. The display of tenderness toward each other was a sharp contrast to last week’s debates in Detroit, where multiple on-stage skirmishes broke out among Democrats, pitting moderates and progressives against each other and even diminishing Barack Obama’s legacy.

Some Democrats later expressed concern over the perception that the primary was turning into an ugly, months-long spectacle of Democratic infighting that would only make Trump's reelection that much more likely.

In contrast to the debates, Friday's format of successive individual speeches did not encourage candidates to lay into their primary rivals. Trump was a more logical target.

And so it went.

“Trade war by tweet is not working for our farmers,” Elizabeth Warren told the crowd, whose cheers and whistles grew so deafening by the end of her address, she struggled to shout over it.

Billionaire Tom Steyer took the stage in his Iowa debut as a presidential candidate and drew robust applause after referring to Trump as the “criminal in the White House,” and calling for the ouster of Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell.

Pete Buttigieg accused Trump of “coddling white nationalists.” Alluding to the president’s clash with minority members of Congress, he spoke about his reverence for the American flag and how it symbolizes “the idea that we are able and indeed sometimes required to be critical of our leadership and when we do, no one will question our loyalty to the republic for which it stands, let alone tell us to go back to where we came from.”

A different scene played out just outside the venue before the event, where groups of supporters for each campaign formed cheering sections in an attempt to show organizational strength in the state.

But by early evening, the shouting on the street quieted — in one of the more poignant moments of the campaign — for a moment of silence for the victims of gun violence, an event put together by Beto O’Rourke’s staff. The former congressman from El Paso skipped the Wing Ding and state fair to support his home town in the aftermath of the shooting.

Walking to a plaza about a block from the venue, candidates including Buttigieg, Bill de Blasio, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet — and representatives of nearly every other campaign — were instructed to hug someone from a competing campaign and say, “I love you.”

Bennet hugged Klobuchar. Buttigieg and Gillibrand embraced. So too did Andrew Yang and Klobuchar, as well as Bennet and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

“When you hug somebody, I want you to hug them and tell them … ‘I love you, and we will win,’” said Iowa state Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad.

The night also offered a glimpse into the unwieldiness of the two-dozen candidate Democratic field. In order to cram in that many speeches, time was limited to five minutes per person, barely giving contenders — or the audience — time to convey an argument for the nation's highest office.

A sellout crowd of some 2,100 stood shoulder to shoulder, stuffing themselves into the iconic Surf Ballroom, the site of the last concert by Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P “the Big Bopper” Richardson before their death in a plane crash in 1959.

“This is a chance for people in this room to see how strong the candidates are and how they’re connecting,” Iowa Democratic Party State Chair Troy Price said. “For caucus-goers, there’s still people who haven’t plugged in yet. There are people who have been paying attention, who haven’t made up their minds yet.”

Candidates who hoped to have a chance at winning Iowa, were well aware of the must-show nature of the event, with 22, including all of the top tier contenders, offering a presence both inside and outside the venue.

“To have this caliber of candidates all under one roof might be historic,"" said Wing Ding chair Randy Black. “We’ve got a little bit of Senate, we have members of Congress, governors, state reps, mayors. Somewhere in there, we’ll have a Democratic presidential nominee.”

The world wonders what's happened to America,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Nick Paton Walsh'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/10/americas/america-guns-world-analysis-intl/index.html,"Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the United States has been the leader of the free world economically, militarily, but also -- as communism and fascism fell by the wayside -- as an idea.

They went too far in Iraq in 2003 , got too greedy before 2008, and let Syria down in 2013. But still, the US' obsession with painstakingly transparent self-analysis, allocation of blame and rooting out failure, got it back on top. However much you hate it, the idea seemed to justify its existence.

But this has been a difficult month. Well, a difficult year. Actually, scratch that too: everything since November 2016 has been discombobulating. I recall watching American expats, Europeans, Lebanese aghast in Beirut when Donald Trump won. It seemed to them like the wheels were coming off civilization. But surely, they could not forever, as the idea of the United States was designed to be tamper-proof?

Yet this is what the American people wanted -- the electoral college at least. Trump's rise reflected what Europe was already doing to itself: a reaction to rampant globalization, to an era of migration and economic freedoms no generation had seen before. But America was supposed to know better -- to lead us forward, not backward, to know the way.

Winston Churchill said you could always count on the Americans to do the right thing once they had tried everything else. Now, it's not clear who would know what the right thing is when it happens. Twitter, other social networks and websites mean it would be under assault by automated bots, the moment it put its head above the parapet.

When it comes to racism it's not just America, it's everywhere. Europe has been having its own ugly dance with it. Brexit is a form of xenophobia masked behind dislike at European trade regulations few voters know much about. And it was championed by a man who once said women in full-face veils looked like letter boxes. He is now Britain's prime minister. Germany has the Alternative for Deutschland. Italy has Matteo Salvini.

But America has taken it a step further. Burning lanterns, protestors being run over with cars, dog-whistles in mainstream politics. It is strange to live in a time when the then prime minister of the UK, Theresa May, had to publicly admonish the US president for racist comments, like President Trump's tweet that four congresswomen should ""go back"" where they came from. And to have the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, stand in ""solidarity"" with those targeted women.

We watch the downward spiral helpless, trying not to be dragged in. America's ugly obsession with guns and mass shootings blended this month predictably with the far extremes of anti-immigrant sentiment. But the rest of the world is used to American intransigence after killings like that in El Paso -- to seeing Americans bafflingly discuss cracking down on websites and mental health issues, and not the glaringly obvious problem of battlefield weapons (with magazines used in Dayton unlike anything I've ever seen in a warzone) being available to teenagers.

It is extremely hard to understand the American obsession with the gun, unless you are an American obsessed with the gun. Those Americans who believe in their right to bear arms look in revulsion at foreigners who think a person's right to safety is more important. The outside world just doesn't get it. And even places like Serbia -- just behind the US and Yemen in terms of legal gun ownership with a whopping 39 guns per hundred people (the US has 120) -- manage to have very low murder rates. 1.39 murders per hundred thousand people compared to the US' 5.35 in 2016. America seems a violent and angry place , and it didn't even have a civil war just over 20 years ago.

Japan just this week warned its tourists going to the US that it is a ""gun society"" where ""gunfire incidents could occur anywhere."" In Japan, you have an almost 0% chance of being murdered, by the way, and need to pass a long list of tests to own a firearm, including being 95% accurate at target practice. Japanese people are much, much safer with fewer guns. Even Serbian people are safer with not quite as many guns. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern summed up in May how many feel when they look on aghast and fatigued at another mass shooting in an American mall, ""to be honest I do not understand the United States,"" she said.

Part of that violence feeds the American myth the world loves through Hollywood. The lone hero always vanquishes his persecutor with a 45. But compassion is also vital. The intense cruelty of US Customs and Border Protection facilities, separating children and parents, and of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, all fall foul of the rosy-eyed view outsiders have of America as a place where anyone can come and make it. The huddled masses were always the point of the United States, but now they seem to have become the enemy within.

The cruelty of how the US persecutes those who have broken its laws is something many Europeans marvel at. But we tend to forgive the American cruelty towards failure and sin. It's part of their winner-only culture, of the hope that eventually they will realize who was wrong and who was lazy and who had the better idea. That the meritocracy will resume its normal service shortly.

But with Trump it is different. His genius for retail politics isn't bound by truth or -- it seems -- decency. It feels like the American idea has been hacked. We don't know if it ends, ever, or whether, as Michael Wolff wrote, the biggest problem America will have now is getting back to politics being boring.

What comes next? Does it lead the free world again, or allow China's alien authoritarianism to fill the vacuum? Has America peaked? Will it eventually do the right thing, and who will be left to know when it does?"
Trump administration says it won't approve Roundup cancer-warning labels,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roundup-labels-trump-administration-says-it-wont-approve-glyphosate-warning-labels/,"The Trump administration has told companies not to warn customers about products that contain glyphosate, a decision targeted at a California regulation that requires labels to warn consumers that the Roundup ingredient is potentially cancer-causing.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it will no longer approve labels warning glyphosate is known to cause cancer. The chemical, marketed as a weed killer by Monsanto under the brand Roundup, is currently the focus of lawsuits from thousands of consumers alleging it caused their cancers.

Such labels are ""irresponsible,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. He cited the EPA's conclusions that the chemical doesn't represent a cancer risk.

The decision from the EPA highlights the growing debate over the safety of glyphosate, with scientific research often reaching contradictory conclusions. The World Health Organization's cancer agency has said that the chemical is ""possibly carcinogenic to humans,"" yet on the other side of the debate are studies that refute reports of glyphosate's risks, such as a long-term study of agricultural workers that didn't find a link between Roundup and cancer.

What you need to know about glyphosate, the cancer-linked chemical found in Cheerios

Since Bayer bought Roundup maker Monsanto in June 2018, the company has lost lost three high-profile court cases that alleged the chemical caused cancer.

""It is critical that federal regulatory agencies like EPA relay to consumers accurate, scientific based information about risks that pesticides may pose to them,"" Wheeler said in the statement. ""EPA's notification to glyphosate registrants is an important step to ensuring the information shared with the public on a federal pesticide label is correct and not misleading.""

California's law

California requires warning labels on glyphosate products because the International Agency for Research on Cancer has said it is ""probably carcinogenic.""

Monsanto has sued to block California's warning label requirements. A federal judge blocked California from enforcing the labels while the lawsuit continues."
Chinese reports on U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong 'have gone from irresponsible to dangerous': State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Brunnstrom', 'Min Read']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-usa/chinese-reports-on-u-s-diplomat-in-hong-kong-have-gone-from-irresponsible-to-dangerous-state-department-idUSKCN1UZ2HK,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Official Chinese media reports about a U.S. diplomat who met with student leaders of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement “have gone from irresponsible to dangerous” and must stop, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Friday.

“Chinese authorities know full well, our accredited consular personnel are just doing their jobs, just like diplomats from every other country,” Ortagus added in a tweet.

She did not elaborate on the nature of the reports, but said: “This must stop.”

On Thursday, Ortagus called China a “thuggish regime” for disclosing photographs and personal details of the diplomat, identified by a Hong Kong newspaper as Julie Eadeh of the U.S. consulate’s political section.

“I don’t think that leaking an American diplomat’s private information, pictures, names of their children — I don’t think that is a formal protest ... That is not how a responsible nation would behave,” she told a briefing.

The Hong Kong office of China’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday asked the United States to explain reports in Communist Party-controlled media that U.S. diplomats were in contact with student leaders of protests that have convulsed Hong Kong for nine weeks.

The denunciations from the State Department are unusually sharp and have come as tensions between Washington and Beijing surge over an expanding trade war and military rivalry in the western Pacific, among other disputes.

The Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao published a photograph it said showed Eadeh talking with student leaders in the lobby of a luxury hotel. It appeared under the headline “Foreign Forces Intervene”.

The State Department has not identified the diplomat and has not elaborated on what kinds of private information or children’s details were disclosed.

In subsequent tweets on Friday, Ortagus said “foreign diplomats in the United States, including Chinese ones, enjoy open access to all elements of American politics, civil society, academia, and business.”

“China has a long record of broken commitments; it’s their duty under the Vienna Conventions, to which China is a party, to treat our diplomats and consular officers with due respect and take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their person, freedom or dignity,” she said.

China has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States, of fomenting the demonstrations in Hong Kong.

Earlier on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and even called a September round of trade talks into question, reviving concerns in financial markets that the bilateral dispute is unlikely to end anytime soon."
Trump's DOJ hid shocking report on growing terror threat from white supremacists,https://www.salon.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.salon.com/2019/08/09/trumps-doj-hid-shocking-report-on-growing-terror-threat-from-white-supremacists/,"The Justice Department suppressed a report showing that suspected white supremacists were responsible for all race-based domestic terror incidents last year.

The report by New Jersey’s Office of Homeland Security Preparedness was distributed throughout DHS and to federal agencies like the FBI earlier this year before it was obtained by Yahoo News. The document includes data Congress has sought from the Trump administration but the Justice Department has been “unable or unwilling” to provide.

The report shows that 25 of 46 suspects in 32 domestic terrorism incidents were identified as white supremacists. The 25 suspected white supremacist suspects were responsible for all “race-based” incidents while others were deemed “anti-government extremists” and “single-issue extremists.”

“This map reflects 32 domestic terrorist attacks, disrupted plots, threats of violence, and weapons stockpiling by individuals with a radical political or social agenda who lack direction or influence from foreign terrorist organizations in 2018,” the report said.

The map and data in the document were circulated through the DOJ and law enforcement agencies in April, which is around the time that the Senate Judiciary Committee requested the DOJ provide data showing the number of white supremacists involved in domestic terrorism.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., told Yahoo News that the committee still has not received the data.

“I’m troubled by the lack of transparency, given that we haven’t received this critical information after several requests to the FBI and DOJ,” Booker said. “They cannot and should not remain silent in the face of such a dangerous threat.”

An aide to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who also sits on the committee, told the outlet that the DOJ and FBI both told the panel they were “unable or unwilling to provide precise data on white supremacist terrorism, and neither agency has responded to our repeated follow-up questions since the briefing.”

The request to the DOJ came after the Trump administration consolidated 11 categories it used to identify domestic terrorism to four. One of the categories was a catch-all “racially-motivated violent extremism.”

“This new category inappropriately combines incidents involving white supremacists and so-called ‘Black identity extremists,’ a fabricated term based on a faulty assessment of a small number of isolated incidents,” the committee’s Democrats said in a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray. The letter said the senators were “deeply concerned that this reclassification downplays the significance of the white supremacist threat.”

The letter also noted that the senators were not provided with data they had requested at earlier hearings and briefings.

Durbin’s aide accused the Trump administration of trying to make it more difficult to track violence by white supremacists by obscuring it under the “race-based extremists” label.

“The Trump administration’s irresponsible decision to stop tracking white supremacist incidents as a separate category of domestic terrorism obfuscates the extent of this threat,” Durbin’s aide told Yahoo News. “This highlights the problem with not specifically tracking white supremacist attacks. If we do not understand the scope of this problem, we cannot effectively combat it.”

Obfuscation appears to be the game plan. Asked what he would do to combat white supremacy on Wednesday, Trump both-sided the issue like he did after Charlottesville. “I don’t like it,” he said,” whether it’s white supremacy, whether it’s any other kind of supremacy. Whether it’s antifa.”

It isn’t just rhetoric. The Trump administration has taken numerous steps to roll back efforts to combat white supremacist groups while pushing for increased legal action against Antifa by labeling them a terrorist group.

Under Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has redirected resources away from fighting far-right and white supremacist groups. The Los Angeles Times reported that DHS had slashed its office handling domestic terrorism from $21 million and 41 full-time or contracted employees to just $2.6 million and 10 full-time employees in 2017.

The Trump administration also declined to renew an Obama administration Countering Violent Extremism Grant Program and canceled the only grant specifically aimed at combating white supremacism. Since Trump took over, 85 percent of the DHS “Countering Violent Extremism” have instead targeted Muslims and other minority groups, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice.

“While white supremacy is not a new phenomenon in America, it’s incredibly troubling the way the movement has been emboldened,” Sen. Booker told Yahoo News, “and the administration’s efforts to obfuscate the data on these terrorist incidents simply defies logic.”"
EPA drops protection for wild salmon Alaska Bristol Bay,https://www.cnn.com,"['Scott Bronstein', 'Curt Devine', 'Drew Griffin', 'Ashley Hackett']",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/us/epa-alaska-pebble-mine-salmon-invs/index.html,"(CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency told staff scientists that it was no longer opposing a controversial Alaska mining project that could devastate one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries just one day after President Trump met with Alaska's governor, CNN has learned.

The EPA publicly announced the reversal July 30, but EPA staff sources tell CNN that they were informed of the decision a month earlier, during a hastily arranged video conference after Trump's meeting with Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The governor, a supporter of the project, emerged from that meeting saying the president assured him that he's ""doing everything he can to work with us on our mining concerns.""

The news came as a ""total shock"" to some top EPA scientists who were planning to oppose the project on environmental grounds, according to sources. Those sources asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.

The copper-and-gold mine planned near Bristol Bay, Alaska, known as Pebble Mine, was blocked by the Obama administration's EPA after scientists found that the mine would cause ""complete loss of"" the bay's fish habitat.

EPA insiders tell CNN that the timing of the agency's internal announcement suggests Trump was personally involved in the decision.

Dunleavy met with Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26, as the President's plane was on the tarmac in Alaska. The President had stopped there on his way to the G20 summit in Japan.

A controversial mining project in Bristol Bay, Alaska, that was all but killed by the Obama administration is now moving forward under President Trump's EPA.

Four EPA sources with knowledge of the decision told CNN that senior agency officials in Washington summoned scientists and other staffers to an internal videoconference on June 27, the day after the Trump-Dunleavy meeting, to inform them of the agency's reversal. The details of that meeting are not on any official EPA calendar and have not previously been reported.

Those sources said the decision disregards the standard assessment process under the Clean Water Act, cutting scientists out of the process.

The EPA's new position on the project is the latest development in a decade-long battle that has pitted environmentalists, Alaskan Natives and the fishing industry against pro-mining interests in Alaska.

In 2014, the project was halted because an EPA study found that it would cause ""complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of Bristol Bay. The agency invoked a rarely used provision of the Clean Water Act that works like a veto, effectively banning mining on the site.

Some current and former EPA officials say the decision to remove the Clean Water Act restriction ignores scientific evidence. The decision follows a series of regulatory rollbacks and political appointments within the Trump administration's EPA that have been criticized by former EPA administrators as favoring industry interests over the environment.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy met with President Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26.

The June 26 meeting between Trump and Dunleavy marked the fourth time the two had met since December.

Dunleavy has publicly supported the mining project and wrote a letter to Trump in March protesting the EPA's prior handling of the matter. He had dinner with Tom Collier, the CEO of Pebble Limited Partnership, the project's developer, in February and spoke to him on the phone in May, according to copies of Dunleavy's calendar reviewed by CNN. A member of Dunleavy's administration used to work on the Pebble project in public relations.

In response to CNN's question about whether Dunleavy asked Trump to direct the EPA to lift the restriction during the June meeting, Dunleavy's press secretary said the two discussed mining and a public land order, but he declined to provide specifics of the conversation.

Dunleavy said in a statement, ""This project, like all projects, should be scrutinized and examined under a fair and rigorous permitting process prescribed by law. That was not the case under the EPA's unprecedented preemptive veto.""

Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to CNN's question on whether the White House directed the EPA to lift the restriction on the mine.

The same day Trump and Dunleavy met in June, the EPA publicly announced that it would begin reconsidering whether to withdraw the Clean Water Act restriction on the Pebble Mine. EPA scientists and staff believed that they would then have weeks or months to reassess previous findings and potentially permanently stop the project, according to the sources.

Instead, immediately after Trump met with Dunleavy, EPA officials received an invitation from EPA headquarters to attend the video conference the next day, June 27.

During that video conference, EPA General Counsel Matthew Leopold said that a decision had been made to lift the restriction on the Pebble Mine proposal and that no further consideration of the matter was needed, sources said.

""I was dumbfounded,"" an EPA insider said. ""We were basically told we weren't going to examine anything. We were told to get out of the way and just make it happen.""

Leopold took over EPA responsibility for the Pebble Mine proposal since EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who previously worked for a law firm that provided services to Pebble, recused himself.

When CNN first asked about the June 27 meeting, EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said that Leopold told him he did not attend any meeting involving Pebble on that day, and therefore any announcement at any such meeting would lack authority.

After CNN told the EPA on Friday that evidence showed that Leopold organized and attended the June 27 meeting, Abboud contradicted his prior statement and said Leopold participated in an internal meeting that day to discuss an EPA memo as well as comment letters related to the project. Abboud said an EPA regional office decided to withdraw from the restriction on July 30.

The Bristol Bay watershed is one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries.

This is the second time the EPA under the Trump administration has sought to remove the Clean Water Act restriction and clear the way for the Pebble Mine project.

In 2017, as CNN previously reported , top EPA officials directed staff to withdraw that protection and allow the project to move forward. That decision was made within hours of a meeting between then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Pebble CEO Collier. However, in January 2018, Pruitt flip-flopped and announced that the protections would stay in place as the EPA gathered more information. The EPA said at the time that the Pebble project could still apply for a permit, but ""their permit application must clear a high bar, because EPA believes the risk to Bristol Bay may be unacceptable.""

When the EPA publicly announced the decision to withdraw from the Obama-era restriction on July 30, the EPA's Chris Hladick, an administrator who presides over Alaska, said the preemptive veto that previously blocked the project ""does not account for the full record and does not grapple with differing conclusions"" about the mine's potential environmental impacts.

EPA spokesman Abboud said in a statement to CNN, ""The previous administration's preemptive veto of this project, without a permit even being submitted, was a departure from regular order and the Trump administration is seeking a return to the correct process.""

Abboud added that the decision to withdraw the restriction does not guarantee that the mine will receive a permit but said the EPA will now focus on the permit-review process.

Pebble Limited Partnership praised the decision in a news release last week that said the EPA's previous objections to the project were based on ""'hypothetical mining scenarios' prepared by EPA itself, and assessed in an 'alleged' scientific study."" The company also said that its most recent permit application has a ""substantially smaller development footprint and enhanced environmental safeguards"" and that the project would employ about 2,000 people in Alaska.

The company's CEO, Collier, also ""expressly thanked Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy for his leadership in encouraging EPA to withdraw"" its earlier decision.

Christine Todd Whitman, who served as an Environmental Protection Agency administrator during the George W. Bush administration, said the EPA's decision to lift the restriction on the mine before the agency's scientists fully reviewed the matter could violate the Clean Water Act.

""It's politics trumping policy and good science,"" said Whitman, who in 2017 joined two other former EPA administrators who served under Republican presidents in opposing the mine due to its estimated environmental impacts. ""If this goes forward now with all the holes and the insufficiencies ... there'll be a lawsuit, no question about that.""

Bristol Bay-area tribes have protested the mine and say it would not only harm the environment, it would ruin their way of life.

""If that mine gets put in, it would ... completely devastate our region,"" said Gayla Hoseth, second chief of the Curyung Tribal Council and a Bristol Bay Native Association director. ""It would not only kill our resources, but it would kill us culturally."""

Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff have been briefed by the State Department on the case of Matthew Gebert, a foreign affairs officer in the department's Bureau of Energy Resources, after he was identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch initiative on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday. One of the sources said the committee was learning about the facts of the situation and why he had been placed on leave.

In an extensive report released Wednesday, Hatewatch alleged that Gebert ""oversaw the Washington, D.C.-area chapter of a white nationalist organization, hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online."" According to the report, Gebert used a pseudonym to express ""a desire to build a country for whites only.""

""That's all that we need. We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles,"" Gebert, speaking as ""Coach Finstock,"" reportedly said on a white nationalist podcast in May 2018. Hatewatch claims it has matched Gebert to the pseudonyms he used online.

The report said that in August 2017, on that same podcast, ""Coach Finstock"" said he was prepared to lose his career for the cause of white nationalism.

Judge punts on speedy verdict for possible Mueller records release,https://www.politico.com,['Darren Samuelsohn'],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/09/mueller-judge-justice-1456165,"A FOIA request filed last November by the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center asked for a broad range of special counsel Robert Mueller materials. | Alex Wong/Getty Images legal Judge punts on speedy verdict for possible Mueller records release The nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center is seeking to uncover a broad range of Robert Mueller's materials.

A federal judge on Friday rejected a request to fast track a review of Robert Mueller’s records for potential public release.

U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton sided with Justice Department lawyers who were asking him to stick to the normal schedule for Freedom of Information Act cases as he considers a lawsuit seeking a variety of underlying records tied to the now-concluded special counsel investigation.

Story Continued Below

At issue is a FOIA request filed last November by the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center that asked for a broad range of Mueller materials, including any reports connected to the end of the probe, congressional briefing materials and any referrals the special counsel made outside the criminal justice system.

DOJ on Thursday responded to EPIC by saying that it had found only 17 pages with records responsive to its FOIA request. The pages, DOJ said, were status updates the special counsel had prepared in the course of its investigation. Other than that, DOJ said it had not found anything applicable for release that wasn’t already public.

In court Friday, EPIC lawyer John Davisson questioned the validity of DOJ’s record search, citing as one example Mueller’s late March letter to Attorney General William Barr that confirms the special counsel’s office had summary documents on the investigation ready for public release — meaning they likely also had underlying drafts and other supporting materials.

“We view this as a canary in the coal mine,” Davisson said in a critique of DOJ’s insistence it had no underlying drafts, outlines or other supporting material that were prepared for members of Congress.

Davisson requested that Walton order DOJ to submit a sworn statement backing up its claims that it had conducted a complete search of the Mueller files. But the George W. Bush-appointed judge punted on that question, saying an affidavit would need to be produced once the case advances to a later stage in the legal fight.

For now, Walton signed off on DOJ’s request to take until Sept. 12 to tell EPIC whether it will hand over the 17 pages in total or impose redactions under various exemptions to the FOIA statute. In court Friday, Davisson had asked the judge to speed that step up to take only three weeks.

EPIC’s request for a variety of underlying Mueller materials is tied to a separate case in which the advocacy group is seeking access to the entire special counsel report. On Monday, Walton signaled he’s considering siding with EPIC and its co-plaintiff, BuzzFeed.

But the judge first is considering an initial step where he’d review the unredacted Mueller report to see if the FOIA exemptions that DOJ is citing to block release of the full document actually line up with what’s allowed under the law."
EPA reauthorizes use of ‘cyanide bombs’ to kill wild animals,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/09/epa-reauthorizes-use-of-cyanide-bombs-to-kill-wild-animals/,"The Trump administration has reauthorized the use of controversial traps dubbed “cyanide bombs” to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals across the US.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced this week that it would allow, on an interim basis, the use of M-44 devices, which trap wildlife with bait before spraying sodium cyanide into their mouths, according to CBS News.

The spring-loaded devices, which have killed more than wild animals since they were first introduced in the 1960s, have been blasted as inhumane.

“Cyanide traps can’t be used safely by anyone, anywhere,” said Collette Adkins, carnivore conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

“While the EPA added some restrictions, these deadly devices have caused too much harm to remain in use. We need a permanent nationwide ban to protect people, pets and imperiled wildlife from this poison,” she said.

The EPA has updated its rules to include some restrictions on the use of the devices, including banning their placement within 100 feet of a public road or pathway, increased from 50 feet. Warning signs also must be placed within 15 feet of each device, decreased from 25 feet.

A final decision on the use of the M-44s is expected to come down after 2021.

In 2017, a child was temporarily blinded and three pet dogs killed in two incidents involving the use of M-44s in Idaho and Wyoming, the BBC reported.

Canyon Mansfield’s family successfully sued the US government for $150,000 last year. One of the devices had been placed near their property in Pocatello, Idaho, and his dog triggered the device, The Guardian reported.

The EPA allows use of the devices by Wildlife Services, the animal-killing program of the US Department of Agriculture — and also authorizes their use by state agencies in South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico and Texas.

Last year, Wildlife Services got rid of over 1.5 million native animals — from beavers to black bears, wolves, ducks and owls, primarily for the benefit of private farmers and ranchers, according to The Guardian. About 6,500 of them were killed by M-44s.

At the end of last year, the EPA proposed the renewed use of sodium cyanide, allowing time for public comment until March, CBS News reported.

More than 99.9 percent of the comments urged the agency to ban M-44s, according to the Center for Biological Diversity and Western Environmental Law Center.

“The overwhelming majority of comments from the general public, including the more than 20,000 letters from the write-in campaign, did not support the continued registration of sodium cyanide predacide uses (M-44 devices),” the EPA wrote in its proposal."
USDA eases relocation timeline as researchers flee agency,https://thehill.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456921-usda-eases-relocation-timeline-as-researchers-flee-agency,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reversed course late Friday, agreeing to key union demands as nearly two-thirds of its research staff will leave the agency rather than move to new headquarters in the Kansas City area.

The announcement follows a tumultuous few weeks at the USDA where employees were given a month to decide if they would uproot from D.C. by Sept. 30 or lose their jobs that same day.

Employees at both the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) — two of the major research wings within USDA — unionized in the wake of the agency’s relocation plans and the USDA has been heavily criticized by lawmakers for the short timeline and chaos surrounding the decision.

The Friday contract will allow employees who agreed to relocate to telework through the end of the year, including the option to extend the time period.

Employees who make the move will also be given a bonus equal to one month’s pay “to help compensate for the loss of income incurred by employees moving from the higher wage D.C. area,” according to a press release from the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA employees.

Two-thirds of the staff at the two agencies told USDA they would forfeit their job rather than move to Kansas City in a plan many say is politically motivated and poorly organized.

“Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers. A lot of the research that scientists and economists do at [the USDA] has policy implications, and members of Congress need this information and need to have face-to-face meetings with these researchers,” Rebecca Boehm, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Hill when the move was first announced.

“It keeps science out of the policymaking process. And we’ve seen many times that this administration doesn’t like facts or research that isn’t convenient or [is] an impediment to their agenda, so I think moving them away helps accomplish that,” she added.

Democrats have repeatedly questioned the wisdom of the move.

Those outside of political circles have also questioned the planned relocation and whether it’s entirely legal. A Tuesday report from USDA’s Office of Inspector General said the decision may have violated the law.

The USDA’s general counsel, Stephen Vaden, has argued that the department is not bound by laws requiring it to secure congressional approval to spend the money to relocate, claiming the law in question is unconstitutional.

The inspector general’s report counters that Vaden's claim is “not consistent with prior positions taken by the Department.”

“To reach management decision on this recommendation and to ensure consistent treatment going forward, the Department needs to communicate, in writing, this change of interpretation to USDA leaders at the Sub-Cabinet and Agency levels,” the report states.

The USDA did not respond to a request for comment.

State Department foreign service officer resigns in blistering criticism of Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/fso-resigns-washington-post-op-ed/index.html,"(CNN) A foreign service officer resigned from the State Department effective Thursday, writing in a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post that he could no longer serve in ""The Complacent State,"" particularly in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting.

Chuck Park wrote in the op-ed that during his almost 10 years in the foreign service he ""worked to spread what (he) believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance.""

""But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home,"" he wrote.

Park said that after the election of President Donald Trump, he had remained ""complacent"" and had ""let career perks silence (his) conscience.""

""I let free housing, the countdown to a pension and the prestige of representing a powerful nation overseas distract me from ideals that once seemed so clear to me. I can't do that anymore,"" Park wrote.

""My son, born in El Paso on the American side of that same Rio Grande where the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter were discovered, in the same city where 22 people were just killed by a gunman whose purported 'manifesto' echoed the inflammatory language of our President, turned 7 this month. I can no longer justify to him, or to myself, my complicity in the actions of this administration. That's why I choose to resign,"" he said.

In an email to CNN, Park clarified that he made the decision to resign before the El Paso shooting, ""though it certainly reaffirmed it.""

Writing in the Post, Park noted that he has not seen an ""organized resistance from within"" to the Trump presidency, but rather ""The Complacent State.""

""Among my colleagues at the State Department, I have met neither the unsung hero nor the cunning villain of Deep State lore,"" he wrote.

""One thing I agree with the conspiracy theorists about: The Deep State, if it did exist, would be wrong,"" he said, noting that foreign service officers pledge to serve at the pleasure of the President -- or else they should quit.

Park told CNN that the reception to the piece has been ""almost uniformly positive"" with ""some mea culpas from personal friends still in the service; some offers of support as I transition to whatever is next.""

Asked why he chose to highlight his resignation in such a public way, Park said, ""I meant the piece more as allocution than a call to action or challenge to people in a similar situation, though most have read it as the latter.""

""Though we are keeping the metaphorical lights on, we are not the heroes that some make us out to be. The real 'resistance' must come from American voters in 2020,"" he said.

Park's cutting public rebuke is the latest by a former diplomat of the sitting President.

John Feeley, the former US ambassador to Panama, retired in March 2018. He wrote in The Washington Post that he made his decision shortly after the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, noting ""The President's failure to condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who provoked the violence made me realize that my values were not his values.""

""I resigned because the traditional core values of the United States, as manifested in the President's National Security Strategy and his foreign policies, have been warped and betrayed. I could no longer represent him personally and remain faithful to my beliefs about what makes America truly great,"" Feeley wrote.

Roberta Jacobson, who resigned as US ambassador to Mexico in May 2018, told NPR shortly after that Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policies were ""draconian and frankly un-American.""

She said ""part of the impetus"" for her departure ""was the increasing difficulty I had in trying to defend some of these policies and in trying to work with a Mexican government that was quite keen to work with us, only to see that sort of blown up periodically by tweets or rallies about the wall or about, you know, characterizing Mexicans, which was not what I experienced.""

Jacobson also penned a New York Times op-ed later that year detailing the ""disorder"" of working under the Trump administration and warning of deteriorating trust between Mexico and the US.

James Melville stepped down as US ambassador to Estonia in 2018 because he ""could no longer support President Trump's policies and rhetoric regarding NATO, our European allies and Russia."""
VA cuts off Van Nuys assisted living home that reported visit to veteran who had died,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'Gale Holland Is A Staff Writer For The Los Angeles Times Covering Homelessness', 'Poverty. She Has Also Worked For The Paper As An Editor', 'Columnist', 'Is A Recipient Of The Worth Bingham Investigative Reporting Award.']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-08/va-cuts-off-retirement-home-van-nuys,"Federal officials pulled veterans from a Van Nuys assisted living home after finding that the facility had reported a social worker visiting a veteran who had been dead for four days, according to a report released Thursday.

The investigation by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs also found serious medication errors at the California Villa home. A 100-year-old veteran with sepsis was denied prescribed antibiotics because they were “not covered by Medicare” and ended up hospitalized a second time, the report said.

Another veteran received a double dose of medication and a third was denied prescription drugs and charged $5 a meal because he preferred eating in his room rather than the cafeteria.

Authorities from Washington, D.C., blamed the VA’s Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System for failing to investigate and address “serious residential care concerns” at the facility, but added that program administrators had not reported the problems to upper management.

The healthcare system had California Villa on an approved list, and helped place veterans there, but suspended referrals and relocated most of their clients during the investigation in 2018.

The investigation was initiated by the U.S. Special Counsel based on whistleblower complaints.

“I am shocked that such lax oversight of facilities providing critical care for vulnerable veterans ever occurred,” Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner said in a letter Thursday to the White House. The investigation findings were also relayed to congressional oversight committees.

The California Department of Social Services had sought to revoke California Villa’s license after finding that the facility in 2017 had not addressed serious safety issues stemming from a resident’s repeated assaults on other residents, which resulted in at least one hospitalization, state records show.

The state agency also found that staff did not adequately clean feces from the furniture.

A new license for the facility was issued in March under the name California Green Tree Villa Ast Lvg & Memory Care. It is licensed for 200 residents.

Administrator Jacqueline Beltran said the facility changed hands Aug. 1, and added that she would relay questions to the new owners, who did not respond.

Kerner, in his letter, said VA investigators found California Villa facilities in “disrepair” and its medicine room disorganized.

The false report of the visit to a dead veteran stemmed from a misidentification by California Villa staff, investigators said.

The veteran was living on a locked ward for residents with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, or who were at risk of wandering. When a case worker arrived for a visit, California Villa staff directed her to the wrong resident, the investigation found. After the mix-up was discovered, an addendum was added to the veteran’s case notes saying “Please delete, wrong veteran.”

Investigators said the confusion called into question whether other residents had received incorrect medication.

The VA investigators did not uphold a whistleblower complaint that a VA manager had improper relationships with patients.

Werner praised the whistleblowers for bringing the problems to light and said one of them hoped the VA would investigate further allegations of a bedbug infestation and other problems."
Graham: New Bruce Ohr docs show FISA warrant against ex-Trump campaign aide a 'fraud',https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/graham-new-bruce-ohr-docs-fisa-warrant,"New documents highlighting top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr's contact with ex-British spy Christopher Steele are the latest troubling development for the DOJ in 2016.

That's the claim from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who said Thursday on ""Hannity"" that he believes there was deep corruption in the department during that year's U.S. presidential election.

""Here's what we're looking at: Systematic corruption at the highest level of the Department of Justice and the FBI against President Trump and in favor of Hillary Clinton,"" Graham said.

FBI KEPT USING STEELE DOSSIER FOR FISA APPLICATIONS DESPITE DOCUMENTING EX-SPY'S BIAS, DOCUMENTS SHOW

Host Sean Hannity then asked Graham whether officials ""lied purposefully"" on a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant application to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

""The best you could say is that they were incompetent,"" Graham responded. ""The most likely outcome is that they wanted a result.""

""I think the insurance policy is what we're seeing here, getting into the Trump campaign,"" Graham continued. ""The FISA warrant against Carter Page was a fraud, I believe. The counter-intelligence investigation is something we have to look at very closely.""

On Thursday evening, newly released records obtained by Fox News showed the FBI formally documented the bias of Steele shortly after the November 2016 presidential election, yet continued to use his unverified dossier in multiple FISA court warrant application renewals.

The documents, first obtained by Judicial Watch, also reveal that top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr maintained contact with Steele for at least six months after Steele was fired by the FBI for unauthorized media contacts in November 2016.

The summaries of FBI interviews with Ohr, known as 302s, show that Ohr knew by September 2016 -- a month before the initial application to surveil the Trump campaign -- that Steele was ""desperate"" that Donald Trump not be elected president.

A source close to the matter told Fox News ""this had the effect of putting a senior DOJ official on notice that a witness/source had an extreme bias"" -- yet the FISA warrant application went through in October 2016 with multiple renewals.

In his interview with Hannity, Graham claimed if a Republican operative acted in a way similar to Steele, the news would receive wall-to-wall media coverage.

""You could not turn on your television,"" he said.

"Trump's EPA grants 31 small refinery waivers from biofuel laws, angering corn lobby",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ethanol-epa/trumps-epa-grants-31-small-refinery-waivers-from-biofuel-laws-angering-corn-lobby-idUSKCN1UZ2AV,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has granted 31 small refinery biofuel waivers for 2018 on Friday, infuriating the ethanol and corn producers who blamed the Trump administration for bailing out the oil industry when U.S. farmers were suffering due to trade tariffs and low prices.

FILE PHOTO: AltEn LLC ethanol plant is seen in Mead, Nebraska, U.S., March 21, 2019. REUTERS/Humeyra Pamuk/File Photo

The waivers from the country’s biofuel laws were fewer than previous year’s and marked an increase in the number of petitions rejected, but the EPA’s decision was still unlikely to satisfy the powerful U.S. corn lobby which wants a broad retrenchment of the biofuel waiver program it blames for undercutting ethanol demand.

“At a time when ethanol plants in the Heartland are being mothballed and jobs are being lost, it is unfathomable and utterly reprehensible that the Trump administration would dole out more unwarranted waivers to prosperous petroleum refiners,” said RFA President and Chief Executive Geoff Cooper said in a statement.

Small Refinery Exemptions are available to small U.S. refineries that can prove they are in financial strife, and the waivers free them from their obligation under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to blend biofuels like ethanol into their gasoline or purchase credits from others that do.

Since Trump took office, the EPA has more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted to refiners, saving the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars, corn growers, who claim the move threatens ethanol demand. Refiners dismiss the argument.

The agency rejected six of the applications, while three were declared withdrawn, according to the EPA website.

The RFS was enacted more than a decade ago to help farmers and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The waiver program, however, has emerged as a battlefield between the rivaling oil and corn industries.

American farmers, a key constituency for Trump as he eyes re-election in 2020, have been among the most hurt by his trade war with China, a key buyer of U.S. farm exports before the dispute began.

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) Executive Director Monte Shaw called EPA’s decision “devastating.”

“With this action, President Trump has destroyed over a billion gallons of biofuel demand and broken his promise to Iowa voters to protect the RFS,” Shaw said.

Trump’s EPA granted 35 of the 37 applications it received for the 2017 year, including for refineries owned by companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp, and billionaire investor Carl Icahn, vastly expanding the program.

Both the oil and corn industries have been awaiting the 2018 decisions for months.

Those decisions had been ready in June, industry sources told Reuters, but Trump intervened after a trip to Iowa where he heard angry feedback from farmers about the waiver program. He ordered members of his Cabinet to review the waiver program based on those complaints.

The EPA, the Agriculture Department and the Department of Energy have been in discussions about the program since, but no reform proposal has emerged. Sources briefed on the matter have said the oil lobby appears to have garnered support for a mostly-unchanged waiver program.

Renewable fuel (D6) credits for 2019 last traded on Friday at about 11 cents each, down from 20 cents on Thursday, traders said, following news of the looming waiver decisions.

The EPA also said it was going to look at ways to boost growth to natural gas, flexible fuel vehicles and E85 fuels, a blend with higher level of ethanol, which is a move aimed to ease potential wrath of the corn lobby and farmers."

"Kevin McAleenan prepared to resign in June, felt undermined by subordinates",https://www.cnn.com,"['Geneva Sands', 'Priscilla Alvarez', 'Pamela Brown', 'Jeremy Diamond']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/mcaleenan-immigration-hardliners-white-house/index.html,"Washington (CNN) On Friday, June 21, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan went to the White House prepared to resign.

Days earlier, President Donald Trump had issued a vague threat to deport ""millions"" of undocumented immigrants, providing few details of the effort and surprising officials within his own administration. McAleenan was concerned that the operation was half-baked and too far-reaching in scope. And he felt undermined by subordinate immigration hardliners who had a direct line to the President over the issue that Trump cares most about, two sources familiar with the matter said.

Then-acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Mark Morgan had begun hyping an upcoming operation targeting undocumented migrant families for deportation and was speaking directly with the President about it, according to a source familiar with the situation.

Arriving at the White House, McAleenan met with the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and his deputy Emma Doyle, to make his case. The raids, he said, would anger Democrats and jeopardize the administration's request for emergency funding for the border; they should be conducted in phases rather than all at once; and he argued the department needed more time to build out the proper messaging, said a former senior administration official.

On June 22, Trump suspended the operation, citing objections from Democratic lawmakers. But it's not clear Democratic objections drove his decision and sources said Trump's decision to postpone the operation allayed McAleenan's concerns that his advice as the DHS chief was not being heeded. And, days later, Congress passed the $4.5 billion emergency border funding bill that McAleenan thought the ICE raids could undermine.

Immigration hardliners accused McAleenan, without direct evidence, of leaking details of the ICE operation, charges he has denied. The operation targeting 2,000 families ordered removed by an immigration judge eventually took place a month later, but fell short of its goal -- resulting in the arrest of 35 migrants

The episode put into view the tensions within the Department of Homeland Security and the rocky relationship between McAleenan and the White House. McAleenan, who has been increasingly surrounded by Trump loyalists and immigration hardliners, has at times been frustrated that some officials go around him, as he has grappled for control of the department, multiple administration officials tell CNN.

McAleenan took over in April after Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was pushed out of her role at the urging of White House senior adviser and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller. McAleenan, who was commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, had the backing of the President's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.

But while Trump elevated McAleenan, he still sees the acting secretary -- a career official who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- as having an allegiance to the previous administration.

In a meeting with congressional Democrats about the government shutdown earlier this year, the President referred to McAleenan, then at CBP, as an ""Obama guy,"" Axios first reported in April.

McAleenan served under the former president, eventually rising through the ranks to the highest-ranking career position at Customs and Border Protection.

The President often still makes comments that McAleenan should go talk to Democrats since he knows how to deal with them, according to a source.

The relationship, however, runs hot and cold based on the numbers of migrants crossing the border and headlines the President doesn't like, sources tell CNN.

Deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley praised McAleenan in a statement after this story published.

""In just a short time at the helm of DHS, Acting Secretary McAleenan has already substantially reduced illegal border-crossings, greatly expanded regional burden sharing, advanced vitally-important regulations, and significantly boosted the rapid removal and return of illegal aliens -- despite relentless obstruction from activist far-left judges and belligerently open-borders Democrat Lawmakers,"" Gidley said in a statement.

Four months into the role, McAleenan has had to navigate a migration crisis at the southern border and a White House that has shunned the traditional policy processes, all while leading the third largest federal department in the wake of a purge that left DHS and many of its component agencies without permanent leadership.

""It's arguably the most politically-charged job in government right now,"" said a senior DHS official about the acting secretary role.

In recent months, the three main immigration components in DHS have had a change in leadership -- Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The President's decision to swap out leadership appeared to be motivated by his desire to go in a ""tougher direction,"" as he once said, amid a swell of migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border.

Trump's personnel choices have, on occasion, have had ideological conflicts with McAleenan. In addition to Morgan, Ken Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner and former Virginia state attorney general, took over as acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services in June.

The White House, led by Mulvaney, previously looked into replacing McAleenan with Cuccinelli, who's been a public face on television on the President's policies, as acting secretary. A senior administration official said that option is no longer being considered.

A White House official told CNN that the ""President expects the acting secretary to continue his work"" on ""many additional policy changes,"" regulations, and foreign cooperative agreements.

However, McAleenan isn't expected to be offered the permanent secretary position, according to sources.

""There's still some apprehension. Everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop,"" said a DHS official about concerns over more leadership changes to come.

Trump told Fox News in June that McAleenan was ""doing a nice job,"" when asked about whether he will nominate him for the permanent secretary role.

""McAleenan, he is doing a very nice job. We're going to see. I've got to get used to him because it's a very important thing to me, the border. We need strong people at the border. And if people aren't strong, they're not going to do a good job.""

Despite the uncertainty that an acting role brings, multiple current and former DHS officials have praised McAleenan's depth of knowledge, operational experience and leadership.

""I think it's really hard being acting,"" said a former official. ""He is taking, if you will, taking the bull by the horns and spent his time doing the job.""

Trump focuses on numbers

US-Mexico border apprehension numbers are particularly important to Trump, who reviews the numbers at the beginning of each month and views them as a barometer of the situation along the southern border, according to administration officials.

Under his tenure as acting secretary, border apprehensions continued to soar to their highest level in a decade -- more than 130,000 -- before falling 20% in June and 24% in July , a drop that McAleenan attributes in part to a recent agreement with Mexico on immigration enforcement.

The numbers continue to go down for now, according to a source familiar with the trajectory, though they still exceed levels a year ago.

The White House has taken a retaliatory approach to immigration, rolling out policies that seek to discourage those who journey to the US-Mexico border. In March, the US announced it was cutting off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, which the President accused of having ""set up"" migrant caravans for entry into the US.

McAleenan, who has been a proponent of regional investment in Central America, was not supportive of the move to freeze aid to the Northern Triangle, according to a former administration official.

During a visit to Guatemala at the end of May, McAleenan told CNN Trump was looking for investments that have a return on US interests, including the ability to address the causes of migration. The ""key measure"" of success is whether aid leads to a halt of migration to the US, he said.

""I think there's some very valid aid efforts that are ongoing but we got to assess them all carefully and make sure we're making the right investments,"" he said.

The architect at the core of the administration's immigration policies is White House senior adviser Miller, who had a hand in the purge within DHS earlier this year.

""I don't think anybody that works in the [immigration enforcement] space is eager to participate with him,"" said a former administration official, referring to Miller.

But McAleenan ""understands what Stephen's role is,"" the official added. Still, the two have clashed over Miller's attempts to make personnel changes within DHS, like placing Morgan into the role of acting CBP chief, according to a source familiar with the disagreement.

But McAleenan has forged a relationship with Kushner, the President's son-in-law, according to current and former administration officials, who released a proposal to reform the country's immigration system earlier this year.

During White House meetings, ""you could tell"" they had a ""close working relationship,"" said a former official.

A department roiled by turnover

Since assuming the acting secretary role, McAleenan has focused almost all of his public attention on immigration issues, while running a department that is also responsible for terrorism prevention, election security and natural disaster response. The acting secretary recently canceled a trip to London to travel to Guatemala to work on a new asylum deal that would return most migrants to Guatemala if they did not try to seek asylum there before journeying to the US.

At the end of July, Trump, standing behind McAleenan announced the asylum deal in the Oval Office.

The tension within the department's leadership ranks has become evident over time amid conflicting immigration views.

""The clash of those two views has caused a dysfunctional relationship within the leadership"" at the department, said the source, referring to diverging views on immigration enforcement. ""How do you repair the working relationships between the White House, and the [DHS] components? That seems ambitious, 'they are pretty frayed.'""

Morgan, who clashed with McAleenan over the raids, has since moved to Customs and Border Protection as acting commissioner, replacing John Sanders.

Sanders left the administration in part over concerns about the administration's rhetoric on ICE deportations, after the White House chose Morgan to serve at the acting commissioner, according to a source familiar with the personnel change.

McAleenan fought to keep Sanders at CBP, according to the source. With his departure McAleenan lost an ally at DHS.

""We've been surprised by the twists and turns in personnel,"" said a senior DHS official, who added that leadership appears to be in a ""decent place now."""

There are times when retired Staff Sgt. Matt Lammers doesn't look like he needs anyone's help — like when he was competing, and winning, races at the Department of Defense Warrior Games in Tampa, Fla., this summer.

""We don't like to say the word 'can't' in our family,"" says Matt, who lost both his legs above the knee and his left arm to an explosion during his second deployment to Iraq in 2007.

Then he goes on to list all the things he just can't do without help from his wife, Alicia.

""She helps me shower. ... She helps me transfer in my wheelchair, drives me to my appointments,"" says Matt, while on a break between events at the games. ""I'd honestly say, not to be smart, but the question is, What she doesn't do?""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

Matt won medals at the games in Tampa for sitting volleyball, swimming and indoor rowing. At the end of the games, the U.S. Army gave him the ""heart of the team"" award. But he and his wife almost didn't attend, because they were short on cash to make the trip after Alicia was cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs' caregiver program last December because Matt had not ""consistently engaged in treatment,"" according to a letter from the VA. Alicia had been Matt's official caregiver for most of eight years.

""It felt like a stab in the back, like what I do is not worth it in their opinion, like I'm not part of their team like I thought I was,"" she says.

Uneven standards and implementation

The VA program provides support and a stipend to caregivers for post-Sept. 11 veterans, usually a wife or parent. It got going in 2011 and was instantly popular among vets as recognition of the billions of dollars worth of labor performed by family members for disabled veterans through the decades. The program was prepared for only a small number of applications and was overwhelmed by the tens of thousands of veterans who applied.

Almost from the start, that meant problems with uneven standards and implementation around the United States. NPR has reported on hundreds of caregivers being arbitrarily cut from the program; so has the Government Accountability Office and the VA's inspector general. Twice in two years, the VA has frozen the process of discharging people from the caregiver program, most recently last Dec. 20.

""It is essential that we get this right,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said at the time. ""This affects one of our most vulnerable veteran populations, and we need to make sure we have consistency on how we process and evaluate benefit applications across VA.""

Unfortunately for Matt and Alicia, that freeze came six days after a letter from the VA in Fayetteville, N.C., on Dec. 14.

""I got a letter saying that I was out of the program because the veteran hasn't shown any progress since 2011,"" said Alicia. ""I asked them, 'What do you mean by progress?' ""

That question is at the heart of a fundamental problem with the way the VA caregiver program was created. Originally it was intended as a temporary intervention.

""Well, amputations and paralysis are permanent conditions,"" says Sherman Gillums, a former Marine who is paraplegic. ""It's not about recovery. It's about sustaining your life. Even if they're cut off from the program, they're still needing that care.""

Gillums is with the group AMVETS, but he's also on the VA's caregiver advisory committee. He's concerned that the VA needs to change the ""recovery based"" model now, before a planned expansion to older vets that could double or even triple the number of caregivers enrolled. And he says the program should be permanent for catastrophically injured vets such as Matt.

""No significant improvement""

Not that Matt's case is without its complications. Besides his missing limbs, Matt has PTSD and brain injuries.

""Not just the physical but the mental disabilities too — that is very challenging. It's every day. It's a constant change,"" says Alicia.

She says that's why the VA's assessment that Matt hasn't improved hurt. He's doing better now than he has in years. He has struggled in the past with drug abuse and even ended up homeless. He has been abusive to his wife and others, sometimes physically.

""He has progress daily,"" says Alicia. ""But sometimes he has bad days or weeks. ... Life is like that.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

The Fayetteville VA told the couple in the Dec. 14 letter that ""there has been no significant improvement"" since Matt entered the program in 2011 and that he ""has not consistently engaged in treatment.""

In response to a query from NPR, the Fayetteville VA said that for Matt, the program ""was no longer in his best interest. He refused to follow his care plan, seriously endangering his health and that of those around him.""

The VA was alluding to his abusive behavior in the past. But Alicia says she has stuck with him through that.

""I'm not leaving. I'm still with him, and I'm still gonna do what I do,"" she says. ""I still have to help him. I still have to drive him. I still have to take him to appointments. I'm still gonna do this if you pay me or not.""

The VA also reached out to the couple and encouraged them to follow the VA's care plan and then reapply for the caregiver program in six months. They say they will, but Matt says he's still stung by the assessment that he hasn't made progress since 2011.

""All three of my limbs are still amputated, as they were June, 10 June 2007. Those have not grown back,"" says Matt. ""I wouldn't change anything for the world. I'm not complaining.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP

Updated at 9:48 p.m. ET

John Gore, the main Justice Department official behind the Trump administration's failed push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, is set to leave the department Friday.

A person familiar with the matter tells NPR Gore plans to spend time with his family while he is ""discerning next steps.""

Gore, who has been serving as the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, is among the administration officials currently facing allegations of providing false testimony and concealing evidence as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question. In a recent court filing, Gore denied the claims made by advocacy groups represented by the ACLU, New York Civil Liberties Union and the Arnold & Porter.

Gore did not immediately respond to an email and a phone call requesting comment.

A partner at the law firm Jones Day before he joined the administration in 2017, Gore previously led the Civil Rights Division as its acting head. He ghostwrote the Justice Department letter to the Census Bureau that formally requested a citizenship question, which three federal courts have permanently blocked from 2020 census forms.

That letter, which was sent to the bureau in December 2017, claimed the administration wanted to add the question to the census in order to better protect the voting rights of racial minorities — a justification that a majority of the Supreme Court found to appear ""contrived"" and three lower courts have dismissed as a sham.

Pressed by plaintiffs' attorney Dale Ho of the ACLU during a deposition this past October, Gore testified that including the question is ""not necessary"" for enforcing the Voting Rights Act.

Earlier last year, Gore was criticized by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers for failing to appear at a House Oversight committee hearing after he was invited to testify about the DOJ's request for a citizenship question. When he finally showed up at a follow-up hearing, he refused to answer lawmakers' questions beyond information that was publicly available.

Gore did later provide a written response to a question from Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a Democratic committee member from California, about the confidentiality of census responses. Current federal law prohibits the Census Bureau from sharing information identifying individuals until 72 years after the information is collected, and the data cannot be used against individuals.

An internal email released as part of the citizenship question lawsuits later showed that Gore and his staff crafted an intentionally vague response after discussing that the sharing of individuals' census information with law enforcement and national security officers may ""come up later for renewed debate."""
"EPA plans to downgrade Denver, northern Colorado to 'serious' violator of clean air rules",https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/epa-plans-to-downgrade-denver-northern-colorado-to-serious-violator-of-clean-air-rules,"DENVER (AP) — Denver and northern Colorado's urban corridor failed to meet federal ozone pollution standards, and the state will have to come up with a new plan to clean up the air, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday.

The move was expected after Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in March the state would no longer ask for an exemption from the standards by claiming some of the pollution was drifting from China and elsewhere, rather than being created in Colorado.

The EPA said it plans to downgrade Denver and eight other counties in northern Colorado from ""moderate"" to ""serious."" The classifications refer to how far out of compliance the area is with agency standards.

In addition to Denver, the area includes Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Douglas, Jefferson, Larimer and Weld counties.

Colorado is already working on steps to reduce pollution, including writing new rules for the oil and gas industry and encouraging more electric cars, said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

""Whether Colorado is classified as moderate or serious doesn't affect our commitment to doing what is necessary, as swiftly as possible, to make sure every Coloradan has clean air to breathe,"" Ryan said in a written statement.

Ground-level ozone, the main component of smog, can aggravate asthma and contribute to early deaths from respiratory disease. Ozone is created from pollution emitted by vehicles, industries, solvents and other sources.

Denver and the northern Front Range have struggled to meet EPA ozone standards since at least 2004.

States can lose some federal highway funding if they don't come up with a plan to correct ozone violations. The EPA says states are not penalized for violating the standards, but only for not developing an agency-approved plan to improve.

Thursday's announcement by the EPA opens a 30-day period for the public to comment on the agency's plan to downgrade the area's status. A public hearing is scheduled for Sept. 6.

""One of the first acts of our administration was to withdraw the waiver request for ozone non attainment to stop sugar-coating the bad state of our air quality. Seniors and kids have been affected the most by our smog this summer,"" Polis said in a statement. ""Moving to 'serious' status finally helps us stop sweeping our air quality crisis under the rug and gives us additional tools to move urgently to make our air cleaner."""

Another official acknowledged to CNN Breier didn't get along with Miller but she often clashed with many White House staff members, and many White House officials are relieved to see her go.

Breier, whose office was in charge of the Trump administration's attempts to control immigration from Mexico, took issue with the power the White House exerted over immigration and trade issues, according to The Post.

Hundreds of USDA employees to be removed from their jobs in September,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue speaks during a Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing in 2018. (Andrew Harnik/AP)

The Agriculture Department is preparing to issue hundreds of termination letters to employees who have not agreed to move from the District of Columbia to Kansas City. The notices, arriving sooner than some workers and their supporters expected, will accelerate a controversial relocation process that has already stripped two USDA agencies of key research staff.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced he would relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio of scientific grants, and the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency. The agencies rent office space in Southwest Washington near the waterfront.

In June 2019, Perdue declared the Kansas City region as the site of the new offices. USDA’s cost-benefit analysis suggests the move will save taxpayers $300 million over 15 years. The department has not said whether the employees will work in Kansas or Missouri; instead, it has set aside temporary office space for staff in its Beacon Complex in Missouri.

On June 13, USDA sent reassignment letters giving workers until 11:59 p.m. on July 15 to respond. Those who declined or who did not respond would lose their jobs, the letter warned.

The American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403, the union that represents the agencies, requested an extension for the deadline. Given the 900-mile distance from Washington to Kansas City and the uncertainty around which state to move to, the union considered 30 days insufficient time for employees to make a commitment.

In a phone call with Sen. Christopher Van Hollen (D-Md.) on July 14, Perdue told the senator the deadline would be extended until Sept. 30, according to the senator’s description of the call.

Two days later, Van Hollen and 18 other Democratic members of Congress wrote a letter to Perdue to confirm the Sept. 30 deadline. Also that day, USDA announced that 250 USDA employees, two-thirds of those reassigned, declined to relocate and would lose their jobs.

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney recently praised the USDA attrition as a way to “drain the swamp.”

On July 17, Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) wrote a letter to Perdue asking why he had not yet responded to the extension request. “We have heard from numerous federal workers who have requested personal extensions to this July 15 deadline, yet none has been approved,” Wexton wrote. “One such extension request would allow a current employee undergoing chemotherapy to continue their treatment with their trusted team of physicians.”

In a letter to Van Hollen in late July, the secretary said the July 15 deadline was final but that the department would evaluate employee extensions on a case-by-case basis.

Perdue never replied to Wexton’s letter, the congresswoman said in a statement to The Post on Wednesday. The department also “failed to respond to the employees who made requests for extension — yet they are able to issue termination letters to hundreds of dedicated public servants,” she added. On Tuesday, USDA notified the union that employees would soon begin receiving the termination letters.

A draft termination letter obtained by The Washington Post, whose authenticity was confirmed by two USDA employees and Wexton’s office, states that employees will be fired Sept. 27.

USDA did not respond to questions from The Post. The department provided a statement: “While USDA did not extend the notification deadline of July 15, we have continuously maintained that employees have until the report date to amend their decision which may include changing from a no to a yes. We are actively working with employees so they can make the decision in a timely manner to ensure they are able to take advantage of all available resources. The mandatory report date for relocating employees in Kansas City is Sept. 30, 2019.”

An investigation by the USDA’s Office of Inspector General, published Monday, determined that money already spent on the relocation violated the 2018 spending bill, because USDA did not acquire congressional approval.

USDA’s general counsel argued that the requirement for congressional approval was unconstitutional. In a letter to employees on Wednesday, Scott Hutchins, the USDA deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, said the department attorney’s opinion is binding.

“No one should be concerned about being accused of, or punished, for violating the Antideficiency Act when they incur and submit requests for reimbursement for relocation costs,” Hutchins wrote. Some USDA employees, he said, have already arrived in Kansas City.

Wexton called for the relocation to be halted immediately. “Secretary Perdue is ignoring his own inspector general, he is ignoring Congress,” she said, “and he is ignoring many of the farmers he supposedly serves.”

MGM Files Lawsuit Against U.S. Department Of Interior Over Third Connecticut Casino,https://www.cardplayer.com,[],,,,https://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/24171-mgm-files-lawsuit-against-u-s-department-of-interior-over-third-connecticut-casino,"MGM Resorts doesn’t want the two Connecticut Indian Tribes to build a third casino in the state and they are suing the federal government to keep it from happening.

The casino giant filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the U.S. Department of Interior for granting Connecticut’s two tribes approval to build a third casino in East Windsor, just outside of Hartford, and 13 miles south of MGM’s latest casino in Springfield, Mass.

Last March, the DOI approved plans for a joint venture between the Mashantucket Pequot tribe and the Mohegan tribe to build Tribal Winds Casino in East Windsor. Just a couple weeks ago, lawmakers in the state drafted legislation that would allow the two tribes to build a casino in Bridgeport, a city in which MGM had interest in building a casino of their own.

Regardless of which city they try to break ground in, MGM is going to use legal channels to stop it from happening.

According to the Middletown Press, MGM decided to file their lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. instead of making it a constitutional case in the state of Connecticut. The company is arguing that the DOI made an error in the way it approved changes to the pacts between Connecticut and its tribes.

Attorneys for MGM claim that the DOI ‘was only authorized to approve amendments related to casinos on tribal lands or on parcels that are considered in a “land-in-trust,” per the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The land in East Windsor and in Bridgeport do not fit those requirements.

“The amendments thus confer a statewide, perpetual competitive advantage to the joint venture, MMCT,” The MGM lawsuit states. MMCT is the company name of the tribes’ joint venture.

The proposed legislation that would allow a Bridgeport casino would also allow the tribes to operate sports betting both online and in-person, a market that MGM would certainly like to have access to.

The DOI issued a statement saying that it will not comment on the lawsuit while it is ongoing.

Regardless of the outcome, the lawsuit will likely leave Connecticut as a two-casino state for the foreseeable future as this is likely going to take years to play out in the courtroom."
Maryland REAL ID Requirements Approved By Homeland Security,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/08/08/maryland-real-id-requirements-approved-by-homeland-security/,"



The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has given MDOT MVA the green light on its REAL ID requirements.

The Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration officially has approval for its compliance with the federal REAL ID requirements, the agency recertified them on Wednesday- making Maryland the first state to achieve that designation.

The recertification affirms that Maryland has all documentation and security procedures in place that are required to make their REAL ID driver’s licenses and identification cards compliant with federal law.

Maryland became one of the first states in the nation to have it certified in 2011.

The REAL ID Act requires all states to recertify periodically. It was passed by Congress after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The law creates standards for secure driver’s licenses and identification cards nationwide.

RELATED COVERAGE:

By October 1, 2020, all Marylanders must have documents on file and be REAL ID-compliant to use a state-issued driver’s license or identification card to board an airplane or enter federal government facilities.

The documents required include a birth certificate or passport, proof of social security and two documents proving Maryland residence.

As of late June, more than half of Maryland drivers are compliant with the REAL ID requirements.

With millions still yet to obtain a REAL ID, the Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration has extended branch hours and opened additional offices to handle the influx of customers."

This year’s August reports will include more information than ever before, including the resurvey announced in June, satellite data and, for the first time ever, FSA acreage certification information.

This report has the potential to be a market mover and hold several surprises, market analysts say.

“There is no question that the upcoming reports are critical as they should technically set the baseline for production that should have been set six weeks ago, and as such, holds the potential to generate quite a bit of excitement either higher or lower next week,” says Dan Hueber, general manager of The Hueber Report.

Hueber has one big prediction for Monday: “We will experience 30 seconds to a minute of market insanity when the figures are released.”

“Of course, there is a lot of talk about this report,” says Joe Vaclavik, founder and president of Standard Grain. “A lot of people think the USDA will provide us with more clarity in regard to the production situation for corn and soybeans.”

Vaclavik says USDA should provide some certainty around the acreage situation, based on the extensive resurvey it did in July. But yields remain a huge question market.

“I think will continue to be debated through harvest,” he adds. “In any year, it is difficult to predict yields in August. This year, the crop is very late, and maturity is lagging, along with enormous variability.”

Heading into the report, analysts expect a decline in planted and harvested corn acres and a rise in soybean acres, reports Kevin McNew, chief economist at Farmer's Business Network. That’s based on the Reuters pre-survey poll of analysts.

For corn, the average estimate for planted acres is 88 million acres. That’s 3.1 million acres lower than the July WASDE. Harvested acres are pegged at 80 million acres, which is 3.4 million acres lower than the July estimates.

Corn yields are predicted to be 164.9 bu. per acre, which is down 1.1 bu. from July.

For soybeans, the average estimate for planted acres is 81 million acres, which is up 1 million acres from the July WASDE. Harvested acres are predicted to be 79.9 million acres, which is up around 0.6 million acres form July.

Soybean yields are predicted to be 47.6 bu. per acre, which is down 0.9 bu. from July.

“At FBN, we believe that the range of estimates for corn planted, harvested acres and the yield number was large,” McNew adds. “We believe that given the range of estimates for 2019/20 corn production the August WASDE can contain surprises. For soybeans the range of production related estimates was much narrower suggesting that a general directional consensus on the direction of the 2019/20 crop.”

"US State Department employee is prominent white nationalist leader, report says",https://www.independent.co.uk,['Chris Riotta'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/white-nationalist-matthew-gebert-trump-state-department-us-racism-a9047356.html,"An explosive new report says a US State Department official was the head of a Washington chapter for a white nationalist group and published extremist propaganda online.

Matthew Gebert, who serves as a foreign affairs officer in the State Department’s Bureau of Energy Resources, actively promoted white nationalist sentiments and was a prominent member of white nationalism circles, the Southern Poverty Law Centre’s Hatewatch reported Wednesday.

Hatewatch said Mr Gebert often discussed the need for a country exclusively built for white people that featured a “nuclear deterrent.” His wife, Anna Vuckovic, was also a blogger who published white nationalist views, according to the report.

They also regularly invited other white nationalists over their house in Leesburg, Virginia, Hatewatch reported.

“[Whites] need a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split,” Mr Gebert reportedly said on a podcast last year while using his alias.

“That’s all that we need,” he added, “we need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles.”

Mr Gebert first joined the State Department as a fellow in 2013 before eventually being promoted to his current position at the Bureau of Energy Resources.

In 2017, Mr Gebert said he was “prepared” to lose his career and paycheck in order to continue promoting white nationalist ideologies, according to Hatewatch.

“There are bigger things than a career and a paycheck, and I don’t want to lose mine,” he reportedly said in a podcast at the time. “I am prepared to lose mine. Because this is the most important thing to me in my life … in tandem with my family, of course.”

The team of researchers at Hatewatch said they used open-source intelligence methods to connect Mr Gebert to the Twitter handles and online pseudonyms he used to reportedly promote his ideologies.

His wife also reportedly shared racist sentiments while offering dating and parenting advice for white nationalists on the right-wing site The Right Stuff.

It was previously reported in July 2018 that Mr Gebert donated $200 (£165) to a Republican congressional candidate in Wisconsin who was condemned for promoting anti-Semitic views on Twitter.

Neither Mr Gebert nor the State Department have commented on Hatewatch's reporting."
White House rebuffed attempts by DHS to make combating domestic terrorism a higher priority,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jake Tapper', 'Anchor', 'Chief Washington Correspondent']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/politics/white-house-domestic-terrorism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) White House officials rebuffed efforts by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, current and former senior administration officials as well as other sources close to the Trump administration tell CNN.

""Homeland Security officials battled the White House for more than a year to get them to focus more on domestic terrorism,"" one senior source close to the Trump administration tells CNN. ""The White House wanted to focus only on the jihadist threat which, while serious, ignored the reality that racial supremacist violence was rising fast here at home. They had major ideological blinders on.""

The National Counterterrorism Strategy , issued last fall, states that ""Radical Islamist terrorists remain the primary transnational terrorist threat to the United States and its vital national interests,"" which few experts dispute. What seems glaring to these officials is the minimizing of the threat of domestic terrorism, which they say was on their radar as a growing problem.

""Ultimately the White House just added one paragraph about domestic terrorism as a throw-away line,"" a senior source involved in the discussion told CNN. That paragraph mentions ""other forms of violent extremism, such as racially motivated extremism, animal rights extremism, environmental extremism, sovereign citizen extremism, and militia extremism."" It made no mention of white supremacists. (A separate paragraph in the report mentions investigating domestic terrorists with connections to overseas terrorists, but that does not seem to be a reference to white supremacists.)

The document mentions that domestic terrorism is on the rise, but the subject is only briefly addressed, all the more stark given that FBI Director Christopher Wray's July testimony that there have been almost as many domestic terror arrests in the first three quarters of the fiscal year -- about 100 -- as there have been arrests connected to international terror. Wray noted that the majority of the domestic terrorism cases were motivated by some version of white supremacist violence, adding that the FBI takes the threat ""extremely seriously.""

STEAMBOAT SPRINGS — The Yampa Valley Housing Authority is working toward a new affordable housing project on Steamboat Springs’ west side with the developer Gorman and Co.

The development is planned for a corner lot at the northwest side of the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and the newly built Sunlight Drive on Steamboat’s West End.

While the specifics of how many units will serve what income level hasn’t been determined, current plans for the project call for 84 rental units deed-restricted to Routt County households earning 80% to 120% of area median income with an average income of tenants in the project earning 100% of area median income.

Routt County’s area median income is currently $60,300 for a single-person household and $86,100 for a four-person household.

These income limits would be enforced by a perpetual deed restriction which could not be lifted should the property be foreclosed on.

Kimball Crangle, Gorman’s Colorado market president, said her company had been “talking peripherally” with the Housing Authority for a couple of years. The company responded to a recent request for qualifications from the Housing Authority.

“We started digging into Steamboat to see what you all probably live daily, that there is a housing crisis up here and that affordability for the local workforce is quickly evaporating, if not completely evaporated already,” she said.

Gorman operates in multiple states. In Colorado, the company has developed workforce housing projects in Vail and is in the process of completing a project in Keystone, according to Crangle and the company’s website.

The Housing Authority and Gorman aim to begin construction by May 1, 2020, and to complete the project by 2021.

“We committed to the voters that we were going to build a new project every year, and this is keeping that momentum going and building units for our local workforce and really providing more options for our local workforce, which is really important,” Housing Authority Executive Director Jason Peasley said.

Unlike the Housing Authority’s recent projects, this project would not be financed using the sale of tax credits. This means the Housing Authority will be investing more of its own money, generated by a property tax approved by voters in 2017, to subsidize each unit to undercut market rental prices. The Housing Authority will contribute $1.4 million in capital to the project.

“From a cost standpoint, it’s really no different, but on the sources side, because there are no tax credits, it means we have to target a higher income level,” Peasley said. “With higher incomes, we have more revenue, and we can, therefore, borrow more to help pay for the cost of it. Also, we as the Housing Authority will invest more money per unit.”

Terms of the project will be hashed out under a draft letter of intent that was approved in essence by the Housing Authority board Thursday. With direction from the Housing Authority board, attorneys between the two parties will be hashing out some final sticking points before it is granted final approval by Peasley and the Housing Authority board’s development committee.

Board member Catherine Carson was the sole nay vote against the approval. While she “loved the concept,” she was not comfortable with the mechanism in which the price of rent would be determined within the project.

The Housing Authority is also making progress on its other developments.

Peasley said Alpenglow Village closed Aug. 2 on the sale of its tax credits with Wells Fargo. The complex, located on Pine Grove Road, kicked off vertical construction last month and is expected to begin leasing in spring 2020.

The Housing Authority is also pursuing state tax credits to finance another project that would break ground in 2021.

Peasley said there are currently no waitlists or leasing information available for any of these housing units. Those interested should watch for information about leasing Alpenglow Village in the spring by visiting yvha.org.

“There’s essentially no way to get on a waiting list for that project (Alpenglow Village), and really any of those units, even the project we just agreed to work on,” he said.

Nikola receives $1.7M grant from US Department of Energy for fuel cell research,https://www.teslarati.com,['Simon Alvarez'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-semi-rival-nikola-get-1-million-us-department-of-energy-fuel-cell-research/,"Nikola Motors was recently awarded by the US Department of Energy with a $1.7 million grant to help the startup advance its research into fuel cell membrane electrode assembly (MEA) technology. The grant comes amidst the potential Tesla Semi rival’s continued efforts to develop durable hydrogen technology for commercial trucking.

In a press release, Jesse Schneider, Nikola’s executive vice president of Hydrogen & Fuel Cell Technologies, stated that the Department of Energy’s grant would allow the aspiring truck accelerate the development of hydrogen technology for its vehicles, which the company believes could potentially disrupt the lucrative trucking market.

“This award provides an opportunity for the highly talented Nikola team to leverage expertise in academia and exceptional resources within the DOE Fuel Cell Consortium for Performance and Durability to accelerate a breakthrough that will benefit the entire hydrogen and fuel cell industry and community,” Schneider said.

Nikola’s grant was given by the US Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Transportation Office, as part of the recently announced FY19 Commercial Trucks and Off-Road Applications FOA. NEL Hydrogen of Oslo, Nikola’s hydrogen partner, was also awarded a $2 million grant by the DoE.

The trucking startup’s fuel cell membrane electrode assembly (MEA) research is aimed at developing an architecture that could satisfy the power output needs and durability requirements of heavy-duty applications, such as the operations of the company’s long-haul vehicles like the Nikola One. The truckmaker noted in its press release that its research is being conducted alongside academics from Carnegie Mellon University, Northeastern University, and Georgia Institute of Technology.

Nikola claims that it currently has 14,000 orders for its Class 8 trucks. The vehicles are expected to be manufactured in a factory in Coolidge, AZ. Testing is expected to begin on Arizona roads this year, with full production to commence in late 2022. Nikola is yet to reveal if its initial production runs will involve the original Nikola One sleeper truck, or the smaller, newer Nikola Two daycab, which was formally unveiled last April.

This timeframe would likely result in Nikola’s electric trucks entering the market later than the Tesla Semi, which is already undergoing extensive testing on multiple states across the US. Production of the Tesla Semi is expected to begin sometime next year, as noted by the electric car maker’s executives in the company’s first-quarter earnings call."
Verdeca Receives USDA Approval of HB4® Drought Tolerant Soybeans,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verdeca-receives-usda-approval-hb4-003000980.html,"-- Novel trait stack expected to help growers facing climate and production challenges --

-- HB4 trait now has regulatory approval in more than 80 percent of the global soybean market --

DAVIS, Calif. and ROSARIO, Argentina, Aug. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Verdeca, a joint venture between Arcadia Biosciences, Inc. (RKDA) and Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NYSE American: BIOX), announced today it has successfully completed the regulatory review process and received approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for its HB4® drought tolerant soybeans, which will allow for commercialization in the U.S. market. The approval comes two years after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) approval of Verdeca's HB4 trait in 2017.

Arcadia Biosciences (RKDA) Logo (PRNewsfoto/Arcadia Biosciences, Inc.) More

The HB4 stack is Verdeca's newest product release from its pipeline of traits developed to benefit soybean producers through quality improvement, stress mitigation and management practices.

""HB4 is a novel soybean trait that enhances the traditional herbicide tolerance package to provide yield stability across diverse environments,"" said Martin Mariani Ventura, general manager of Verdeca. ""Approval of this technology in the United States is a significant step for the successful commercialization of HB4 technology in the global soybean market.""

With USDA approval, the HB4 trait now has regulatory approval in more than 80 percent of the global soybean market. The HB4 trait has already been approved in Argentina and Brazil, with regulatory submissions currently under consideration by China, Paraguay, Bolivia and Uruguay. Import approval from China is needed for commercial launch in Argentina, and is now expected in 2020.

More than 30 million of the world's soybean hectares are grown in the United States. While the 2019 growing season has challenged many U.S. soybean growers with too much water, key soybean production areas – including some areas within the United States – just last year suffered reduced yields due to water and heat stress.

""Trials in Argentina have shown a positive impact of the HB4 trait stack on soybeans there,"" said Raj Ketkar, president and CEO of Arcadia Biosciences. ""The USDA and FDA approvals are important steps in our continued drive to commercialize this trait in key markets.""

""This approval in the U.S. is an important step for Verdeca. The HB4 trait was recently approved by Brazil as well, and we now expect approval in China in 2020 to launch our commercial efforts in Argentina,"" said Federico Trucco, CEO of Bioceres Crop Solutions.

Arcadia Biosciences and Bioceres Crop Solutions formed Verdeca in 2012 to deploy next-generation soybean traits in all key production regions, beginning in South America and North America, which together represent nearly 80 percent of the harvested soybean hectares globally.

Senate Republican calls out Trump’s DOJ for not responding to his domestic terrorism questions,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/republican-senate-chairman-slams-trumps-doj-over-domestic-terrorism-non-response-b903f3de5f75/,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, is typically a loyal ally of President Donald Trump and his administration. But on Wednesday, he went on Fox News and scolded Trump’s Justice Department and FBI for failing to provide even basic information about a major domestic terrorism threat.

In early May, Johnson and the committee’s top Democrat — Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) — authored bipartisan letters that were sent to Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, Attorney General William Barr, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. These letters asked for information about domestic terrorism and how each is addressing it. DHS responded, but four months later, the Justice Department and the FBI — which operates within the DOJ — have not.

In a new letter on Monday, Johnson and Peters noted that there have been several domestic terrorism attacks since their first letter. “Since the date of our request, there have been numerous mass attacks, including Virginia Beach, VA; Gilroy, CA; El, Paso, TX; and Dayton, OH… These continued mass attacks make it clear that the federal government has more work to do in preventing domestic terrorism.”

On Tuesday, Johnson took the issue directly to the Trump administration — by raising it on Fox News.

“On May 8th, ranking member Sen. Peters and I sent a letter to the Department of Justice and the FBI, asking them how do they keep track of these domestic terrorist attacks? What kind of resources do they have and what are they devoting to different aspects of this? We got a response from DHS. We haven’t got a response from the FBI or attorney general,” he complained.

“Monday, we asked them to respond. I’m not sure you’ll ever have enough resources in terms of what people will be requesting. This is a serious issue, though. We expect answers out of the FBI director and the attorney general.”

In 2009, the Obama administration’s Department of Homeland Security produced a lengthy report on the risk of right-wing domestic terrorism. Congressional Republicans accused then-Secretary Janet Napolitano of insulting “American citizens who disagree with the direction Washington Democrats are taking our nation” and got the report removed from the DHS website.

In May, Trump was asked whether he saw white nationalism as a rising global threat. “I don’t really, ” he replied."
"Withdrawal of US troops in Syria strengthened ISIS resurgence, DOD watchdog says",https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/08/withdrawal-of-us-troops-in-syria-strengthened-isis-dod-watchdog-says.html,"A convoy of US forces armoured vehicles drives near the village of Yalanli, on the western outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Manbij, on March 5, 2017.

Syrian forces backed by the United States are struggling to contain ISIS following President Donald Trump's partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country, a Defense Department watchdog warned in a report released this week.

The report, produced by the department's office of inspector general, found that between April and June the so-called Islamic State consolidated its power in Iraq and mounted a resurgence in Syria.

Trump announced in December that the U.S. would soon reduce its fighting force in Syria, surprising allies and prompting the departure of then-Defense Secretary James Mattis.

""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" he wrote in a post on Twitter announcing the decision.

""I defeated 100% [of the] caliphate,"" Trump said during an interview with C-SPAN last month. ""That doesn't mean ISIS doesn't go running around bombing a store and doing what they do, because they're stone cold crazy, but we've done a great job.""

But the report, which largely summarizes the views of the U.S.-led military task force overseeing operations against ISIS, says that the group remains a threat in Iraq and Syria despite the loss of its final stronghold in Syria earlier this year.

The report says that ISIS retains between 14,000 and 18,000 members in Iraq and Syria, including about 3,000 foreign fighters. It also retains an extensive, global social media operation to recruit fighters.

In both countries, ISIS fighters carried out targeted assassinations, ambushes, suicide bombings in public places, and set fire to fields of crops, the report said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The insurgency did not carry out conventional attacks or attempt to take back territory, the report said, instead it sought to wreak havoc and decrease support for government institutions.

In Syria, it also began to reestablish ""illicit fundraising capabilities"" which the report likened to ""taxes"" on residents and businesses where it operates, the inspector general found. In Iraq, it was able to establish logistics nodes for coordinating attacks, bolstered by fighters who arrived from Syria following their final territorial defeat in March.

The group is strongest in Syria in the Dayr az Zawr province, parts of Raqqah province, and Homs province near Palmyra, the report said.

The report says the U.S. drawdown, completed in the spring, left American-backed Syrian forces ill-prepared to develop trust with local communities and develop human-based intelligence ""necessary to confront ISIS resurgent cells and insurgent capabilities in Syria.""

""Despite losing its territorial 'caliphate,' the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) solidified its insurgent capabilities in Iraq and was resurging in Syria this quarter,"" the report says.

In one massive camp in Syria, Al Hol, the absence of U.S. troops has left Syrian partners without the ability to provide more than minimal security, leading to the ""uncontested conditions to spread of ISIS ideology.""

""ISIS is likely exploiting the lack of security to enlist new members and re-engage members who have left the battlefield,"" the report says.

The withdrawal also limited the U.S. capacity to track the humanitarian situation at the camp, which is home to 70,000 people, two-thirds of which the International Committee of the Red Cross estimates are children.

The United Nations estimates that 11,000 residents of the camp are relatives of ISIS fighters, and the U.S. military estimates that as many as 45,000 are ISIS supporters.

In the coming months, the U.N. estimates that upward of 30,000 Iraqi residents at al Hol, primarily women and children, will return to Iraq.

Neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of State responded to a request for comment.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that he had not read the report, The Wall Street Journal reported, but noted that the administration ""is incredibly mindful of the success we've had versus ISIS, and the challenge that it continues to present to the world."""
EPA proposes downgrading Denver and northern Front Range to “serious” violator of air quality standards,https://www.denverpost.com,"['Jessica Seaman', 'Jessica Seaman Covers Health For The Denver Post. A Native Of North Carolina', 'Jessica Joined The Post After Stints As A Reporter In Greensboro', 'North Carolina', 'Little Rock', 'Arkansas. She Is A Graduate Of Unc-Chapel Hill.']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/08/colorado-air-quality-violations-epa/,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it wants to reclassify the region encompassing Denver and the northern Front Range as a “serious” violator of federal health standards after ozone levels failed to meet air quality standards.

The move, which will require public comment, was expected as Gov. Jared Polis earlier this year directed state air officials to not pursue an exemption that would have reduced Colorado’s responsibility under the federal Clean Air Act.

The Denver region has been classified as a “moderate” violator of ozone standards since 2016. That region, as classified by the EPA, includes Denver, Greeley, Fort Collins and Loveland.

“We recognize how vital it is for the department to act and assertively reduce ozone pollution in the Denver Metro/North Front Range area — as well as throughout Colorado,” said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of the state health department, in a statement.

“With the backing of the state legislature and governor, we are moving forward on developing strategies to reduce emissions from oil and gas facilities, electrify the vehicle fleet and look for other ways to reduce pollutants that cause ozone.”

The EPA is making its decision to reclassify the Denver area based on air quality data collected between 2015 and 2017. The new designation will require new measures to be implemented to reduce emissions, according to a news release.

When Polis opted to forgo an exemption, he ordered work to reduce pollution in the state through measures that include using electric vehicles, adopting renewable energy and reducing oil and gas emissions.

Polis, in a statement, said his administration didn’t seek the exemption because it was time “to stop sugar-coating the bad state of our air quality.”

“Seniors and kids have been affected the most by our smog this summer,” he said. “Moving to ‘serious’ status finally helps us stop sweeping our air quality crisis under the rug and gives us additional tools to move urgently to make our air cleaner.”

The move comes as air quality in the Front Range has worsened in recent years, including as oil and gas companies have expanded in Colorado, causing ozone readings to exceed the 2008 health standards.

Other sources of ozone air pollution include cars and pollution from other states and countries. In Colorado, some air pollution has come from China, possibly from coal-burning power plants.

Ozone affects lung tissue and can aggravate diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, and it can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the EPA.

“EPA is proposing this action as required by the Clean Air Act,” said Gregory Sopkin, EPA Regional Administrator, in a statement. “We will continue to support the state as they revise plans and implement new measures that will reduce ozone-forming emissions across the many sources contributing to air quality impairment along Colorado’s Front Range.”

The agency will be accepting public comments on the proposal for 30 days starting Aug. 15. It will also hold a public hearing at its office in Denver on Sept. 6, the news release said."

Miller told Breier that it was ""her job"" to defend the agreement, which requires Central American migrants to seek asylum in Guatemala before applying for asylum in the U.S., the official added. The Post notes that it is unclear whether this was a primary cause of her resignation.

China responds to US after Treasury designates Beijing a 'currency manipulator',https://www.cnbc.com,['Sam Meredith'],08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/trade-war-china-responds-to-us-after-claim-of-being-a-currency-manipulator.html,"China's central bank has firmly rejected the U.S. Treasury's designation of Beijing as a currency manipulator, saying the accusation has ""seriously"" undermined the international financial order and risked further market turmoil.

The response from the People's Bank of China comes at a time of rapidly intensifying trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.

On Monday, the U.S. Treasury accused Beijing of deliberately influencing the exchange rate between the yuan and the U.S. dollar to gain an ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade.""

The move fulfills President Donald Trump's promise to recognize China as a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994.

The announcement followed a sharp drop in the yuan against the dollar, with the Chinese currency breaching the 7-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008. A drop in a currency's value makes that country's products cheaper on the international market.

""The United States disregards the facts and unreasonably affixes China with the label of 'currency manipulators,' which is a behavior that harms others and oneself,"" the PBOC said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The Chinese side firmly opposes this.""

The PBOC said it would not only ""seriously undermine the international financial order, but also trigger financial market turmoil. It will also greatly hinder international trade and the global economic recovery, and ultimately will suffer from it.""

China's central bank set the yuan's official reference point at stronger than the key 7 yuan-to-the-dollar point on Tuesday.

The move appeared to calm financial markets, initially rocked by fears the U.S.-China trade war was devolving into a currency war.

Late last week, China promised to fight back after Trump vowed to impose 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports that had not been hit with U.S. duties."
DHS Official: Trump Can’t Admit ‘This Is Terrorism’,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-06-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dhs-official-on-el-paso-and-dayton-trump-cant-admit-this-is-terrorism,"After a weekend of carnage, President Trump said some things that sounded heartening. But current and former law enforcement officials say the president’s words aren’t enough—and they fear it’s all he has to offer.

Thirty-one people were killed between attacks on public places in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in the span of 12 hours this past weekend. While authorities say they have no motive yet for the Dayton attack, officials said the accused El Paso attacker wrote a manifesto justifying the mass murder of Hispanic people to stop their “invasion” of the U.S. Federal prosecutors said they’re considering domestic terrorism charges for the attacker. (Days earlier, a gunman expressing similar racist views killed three people at a food festival in California.)

“This is a clear manifestation of the political discourse that has taken place in the country over the past two years or so,” one Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told The Daily Beast. “It cannot be blamed on mental health. This is an ideology-driven hate crime. This is terrorism and the White House has trouble labeling it as such. It is very frustrating.”

In remarks Monday from the White House, the president blamed violent video games and mental health problems for the carnage. He called for the implementation of red flag laws, also known as risk protection orders, that let people petition a judge to have the guns of their friends and family taken away if they worry that person will harm others. He even went so far to say “ our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy” —something he has shied away from in the past.

The DHS official called the remarks “demoralizing,” noting the president’s effort to spread the blame around.

Despite the president’s call for reforms, current and former law enforcement officials say they aren’t satisfied. Sources say white supremacy is a significant threat to U.S. national security, and one mention in a 10-minute presidential speech won’t cut it.

“It is a good step to recognize the threat of white supremacy, but words alone cannot solve the problem,” said Ali Soufan, a former FBI agent who specialized in counterterrorism cases. “Action speaks louder than words. What kind of policy, legislations, designation, and funding is the administration willing to propose, support, and authorize in order to counter this emerging threat? This is where the rubber meets the road.”

Some officials said they put little stock in Trump’s words, worrying that the president would, as in the past, backtrack on his statements on white supremacy.

Others said Trump’s brief condemnation of the ideology meant little following his statements earlier in the day that linked the weekend’s shootings to the need for new immigration legislation—the accused El Paso shooter said immigration was destroying the country.

“I am concerned that white supremacist thought leaders will view his tweet linking immigration reform with background checks as a tacit signal that he still supports their agenda,” said John Cohen, the former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “It is mind-boggling he would blend the two issues. I don’t think there is a thorough understanding of the issues at the White House.”

Despite the concern surrounding Trump’s rhetoric on white supremacy, the intelligence community appears to be taking a new, active step in addressing the threat. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) is hosting a conference on domestic terrorism with the FBI and DHS next month, according to a person familiar with the plans. An invitation to the event said the conference will scrutinize the federal government’s response to the threat in light of the recent deadly attacks by white supremacists on synagogues in Pennsylvania and California and mosques in New Zealand.

If Trump’s speech was any indication of where the White House plans to focus its efforts following the fatal shootings over the weekend, it seems white supremacy is an afterthought.

The president focused his speech on tracking individuals with mental illnesses.

“Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,” Trump said. “We must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement.”

Authorities have not offered evidence that the accused gunmen in El Paso and Dayton were mentally ill. The American Psychological Association said in response to Trump’s remarks: “Blaming mental illness for the gun violence in our country is simplistic and inaccurate and goes against the scientific evidence currently available.”

Trump went on to say that he directed the Department of Justice to work with other law enforcement agencies and social media companies to better detect people he said were mentally ill and liable to kill.

“We must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs,” Trump said.

Federal law enforcement agencies have in the past worked with DHS as well as state and local law enforcement to track people who may endanger others, including veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with criminal pasts. National Security Agency software company Beware at one point let local police departments calculate individuals’ threat levels by collecting things like arrest reports, property records, and social media postings. Meanwhile, the FBI tracks potential terrorist attacks by opening official investigations. Many of those probes have focused on Muslim terrorist suspects following 9/11 and the rise of ISIS.

The only question now, law enforcement officials say, is whether the president will order a crackdown on white supremacist violence.

“The president did what presidents should do, which is condemn bigotry and hatred,” said George Selim, a former DHS official who now works at the Anti-Defamation League. “But what’s needed is resources, strategy, and policy. And the real measure of these horrible atrocities is if the resources, strategy, and policy of the federal government matches the president’s comments today.

“How many lives need to be lost before action is accelerated and the administration works with Congress? The time is now.”"
USDA’s August Reports Could Be Data Dump Rivaling January Reports,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/usdas-august-reports-could-be-data-dump-rivaling-january-reports,"USDA is set to release several reports on Monday. Farmers, traders and report watchers will get a better look at USDA’s resurveyed acreage reports, yield, crop production and even a first look at Risk Management Agency’s (RMA) prevent plant acreage results.

“This is a data dump that probably rivals only the January crop report in scope and scale,” said Ed Prosser, vice president of Commodity Risk Management for Scoular.

Jarod Creed of JC Marketing Services said he’s most interested in getting a better idea of what final carryout could be.

“My personal opinion is that prevent plant conversations, the acreage conversations, the yield conversations—they're getting to be peak noise,” said Creed. “We know the demand piece but we have so many questions around the supply. So, if you start to hone in on a little bit better of an idea of what we actually have planted, you can obviously start using best-case and worst-case yield scenarios to hone in on what our production is and what our demand has to do to potentially ration demand or pick it back up.”

Prosser said he wants to see carryout ranges narrow to get a better idea of what type of supply load the market could face heading into 2020.

“I think there are a lot of credible people that are in mid 150s in corn yield, and I think there are some credible people that want to be in the high 160s [for yield],” said Prosser. “We're going to start to narrow that. For right now, I think what we can hope for is that we're somewhere within plus or minus half a billion [bushels on carryout range] when we get done on Monday.”
