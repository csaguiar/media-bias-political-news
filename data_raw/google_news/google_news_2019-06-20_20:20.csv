"Drone shooting raises risk of war, exposes Iran divides in Trump team",https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/us-iran-drone-shooting-risk/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Iran's downing of a US drone takes the bitter foes one step higher in a cycle of escalation that could soon overwhelm each side's reassurances that they have no desire to tumble into war .

The showdown with Iran has now become the grave foreign policy crisis for President Donald Trump that many analysts have long predicted and into which the administration is entering without any obvious end game in mind.

""I find it hard to believe it was intentional,"" Trump said, seemingly looking for a way out of direct confrontation with Iran.

The situation is a huge test for an erratic and unpredictable President and the hawkish strategy of advisers who may be leading him into a dangerous dead end he is desperate to avoid.

Already, it is making Trump's protests that everything is just fine look out of date and superficial -- at a time when his 2020 campaign's claims to have restored leadership in the world are being outpaced by events.

""Don't worry about a thing, everything's under control, don't worry about a thing,"" Trump told Fox's Sean Hannity on Wednesday.

The events of recent weeks, including attacks on several energy tankers in the Gulf of Oman -- which Iran has been blamed for and denied -- and Tehran's warning that it will break internationally agreed limits on uranium production -- have heightened attention on a regime that has long been seen as a threat to US and Western interests. Tehran is accused of destabilizing its neighbors, supporting terrorism and abusing human rights.

But US allies see rising tensions as the logical result of Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, a move that was wildly popular with his base but threatened inevitable strategic reverberations that are now beginning to unfold. The administration is now for instance demanding that Iran honor a nuclear deal which it abandoned.

The turbulence in the Gulf and in Washington leaves Trump wrestling with how to respond to an Iranian assault on US prestige without setting off a chain of events that could escalate into a full-scale war between the US and Iran and the Islamic Republic's proxy forces in the region.

""What worries me is that the President's decision space gets further limited and smaller,"" said John Kirby, a retired navy admiral and CNN military and diplomatic analyst.

""Some of it is of his own doing and the fact that his own team is not on the same page but also now the Iranians are closing that decision space and they are pushing him into a corner and I don't think that is good for anybody,"" Kirby said.

Relentless pressure on Iran through economic sanctions and other means is being cranked up by two long-term enemies of the Islamic Republic — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump's national security adviser John Bolton.

There is a strong suspicion among many analysts that the pair, and other outspoken Iran hawks like Republican Sens Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are trying to maneuver Trump into a position where a military confrontation becomes inevitable without an Iranian capitulation that seems highly unlikely.

Graham told Fox News Wednesday that Trump had ""had it"" with Iran. Cotton said on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" over the weekend that the tanker attacks -- already merited ""retaliatory military strikes.""

A manageable crisis could spin out of control

While the current standoff is alarming, it is currently playing out within manageable parameters. The risk is that with every inflammatory step, available off-ramps disappear.

The shooting down of the drone — Iran claims over its territory while the US says it was over international waters — is a dangerous uptick but will not in itself cause war.

Tehran does have the capacity to cross the line into a serious conflict — with thousands of US troops in the region in range of its proxies and militia allies and the world economy hostage to the flow of oil in the Gulf.

If Iran were to move on those fronts, a military confrontation that could quickly spill out of control would become inevitable. But there are still hopes that cool leadership on both sides of the conflict could avoid a disastrous war that would hammer the global economy, cause huge loss of life in the region and again expose America's inability to shape events in the Middle East to the liking of hawkish foreign policy experts in Washington.

After more than a year of fierce US economic pressure that has battered its economy, Iran is not caving, as some US officials hoped. Instead, it's using its points of leverage to make the US pay a price for its policy, to divide the allies, to probe at fractures in the administration and to put Trump on the spot.

But Trump has signaled he has no desire to get dragged into another war in the Middle East — a core political principle — especially with his reelection campaign cranking up.

Earlier this week, the President described attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman — a possible warning by Tehran of the chaos it can bring to oil supplies and the global economy — as ""very minor"" in an interview with Time magazine.

But now, the President must work out how to respond to the drone attack, to halt Iran's escalatory gamble while not making the situation worse and making a new gambit by Tehran inevitable.

In recent weeks, Washington has dispatched an aircraft carrier group to the vicinity of the Gulf and said it will send a moderate detachment of 1,000 more troops to the region.

Were Iran to try to impede the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz, the administration could be forced into a major naval operation to protect tankers and guarantee free navigation.

But the effort would require a massive financial and military commitment that would be complicated by the skepticism of US allies over the White House's Iran policy.

US Iran policy exposed

Trump has banked on Iran's clerical leaders being forced back to the negotiating table by relentless economic pressure. But such a view appears to discount 40 years of lessons about the antagonistic Iran-US relationship following the 1979 revolution.

Trump's view -- that international relations can be conducted with the former tactics of a real estate magnate -- is being seriously exposed. None of North Korea, Iran and China have reacted to massive US economic pressure by abandoning what they see as their core national interests.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last week he would never sign off on talks with Trump, and there is no reason to doubt his word.

The White House's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal appears to have been read by Iran's leaders that Washington can never again be trusted to stick by the terms of a deal.

Diplomats from international powers who joined the deal say that recent events are the logical payoff from a Trump foreign policy that is geared to domestic political wins and wiping out the legacy of President Barack Obama — for whom the Iran agreement was a centerpiece.

Former Vice President Joe Biden -- the leading Democratic presidential candidate -- quickly inserted himself in the growing Washington debate over the downing of the US drone.

""President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster,"" Biden said in a statement.

""By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need.""

The administration argued that the Iran deal -- which froze Iranian enrichment of uranium that could be used to make a nuclear bomb -- was flawed because it did not take into account Iran's nefarious behavior in its region -- including missile tests and support for extremist groups like Hezbollah.

But the deal did at least put on hold the kind of crisis that Trump is now facing."
Trump administration threatens layoffs in fight to eliminate major federal agency,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-threatens-layoffs-eliminate-agency,"Trump administration officials have put the Office of Personnel Management on the chopping block in an ambitious but controversial bid to reorganize the federal government -- and they are ready to furlough or even lay off workers if Congress stands in their way.

According to an internal document obtained by The Washington Post, workers could be sent home on Oct. 1 and laid off 30 days later, if Congress will not agree to their plan to eliminate the agency -- which essentially serves as HR of the federal government.

TRUMP VOWS TO DEPORT 'MILLIONS' OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AS MCCONNELL PLANS TO FORCE VOTE ON BORDER FUNDING

“This is a crisis building for years,” acting OPM Director Margaret Weichert told the Post. Weichert said furloughs are a “last resort we are trying to avoid,” and that “a legislative solution would be the most straightforward answer.”

The administration’s plan is to eliminate the OPM, which manages 2.1 million civilian federal workers, and divide its roles among three other agencies. Recent legislation has already called for its security clearance system to move to the Department of Defense. Most of OPM’s responsibilities would fall under the General Services Administration, and a new GSA deputy who would be appointed by the president to take over for OPM’s current agency director.

According to administration officials, the OPM’s current problems include a backlog of retirement-related paperwork, poor hiring practices and weaknesses in their security that left them open to a breach of their data system.

Weichert has stressed the urgency of the situation, reportedly telling staff she is “planning to play chicken with Congress.” She told the Post the administration has “made it very clear we can’t wait without action.”

The looming shift of security clearance responsibilities from OPM to the DoD is expected to strip OPM of $70 million from its budget. If OPM is to continue to exist, they would have to make up the difference, and Weichert believes furloughing 150 employees would help achieve that by saving $23 million.

""As the Administration has shared publicly on many occasions, the Congressionally mandated move of background investigations to DOD leaves OPM with a major funding shortfall,"" OMB spokesperson Jacob Wood told Fox News. ""We continue to work with Congress to find a solution and sustainable path forward that avoids unacceptable impacts to the staff at OPM. Unfortunately, issues of funding and appropriations law leave OPM with few options. It is our sincere hope that Congress helps us find a way to address the funding gap created by their decision to move a major funding source away from OPM.""

Democrats are working to block the elimination of OPM, and the House Appropriations Committee passed a bill that would prohibit the White House from using government funds to “reorganize or transfer any function” of OPM.

BIPARTISAN SENATE DEAL REACHED ON $4.5B BORDER-HUMANITARIAN AID PACKAGE

Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., chairman of the House Oversight Committee’s government operations panel, told the Post, “the Trump Administration is taking 150 federal employees hostage unless we consent to a plan that has no rationale and is nothing more than a political gambit to give the White House control of our long-standing merit-based civil service system.”

Weichert said earlier this year that the plan could save between $11 million and $37 million per year from the consolidation of facilities and contracts. President Trump's budget request for 2020 requested $50 million for the reorganization."
Nadler: Hope Hicks broke with Trump on accepting foreign dirt,https://www.politico.com,['Andrew Desiderio'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/20/hope-hicks-trump-foreign-election-interference-1373017,"Former White House communications director Hope Hicks is seen behind closed doors during an interview with the House Judiciary Committee. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congress Nadler: Hope Hicks broke with Trump on accepting foreign dirt

Hope Hicks broke with President Donald Trump during her interview with the House Judiciary Committee this week, telling lawmakers that offers of foreign assistance in U.S. elections should be “rejected and reported to the FBI,” Chairman Jerry Nadler said on Thursday.

Hicks, the longtime former Trump confidante, sat for nearly eight hours behind closed doors with the committee on Wednesday and fielded questions on several subjects related to her tenure as a senior aide on the Trump campaign, the presidential transition period, and in the White House as communications director.

Story Continued Below

Nadler indicated during a Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday that Hicks was also asked about Trump’s recent comments to ABC News in which he suggested that he would accept a foreign adversary’s offer of damaging information about a political opponent.

According to Nadler, Hicks “knew that the president’s statement was troubling” and “understood the president to be serious.”

“She also made clear that even she knew that such foreign assistance should be rejected and reported to the FBI,” added Nadler.

Nadler did not quote Hicks directly, but the transcript of her testimony is set to be released later this week.

Trump on Thursday praised Hicks' testimony, saying, ""She was great. I heard she was terrific.""

A White House lawyer was present for Hicks’ interview in order to assert the White House’s position that Hicks was “absolutely immune” from answering questions about her tenure in the Trump administration. Democrats expressed frustration with the interview, and some suggested that the committee could soon take Hicks to court to enforce its subpoena.

"Trump is giving up on regime change in Venezuela because it's complicated and he got bored, report says",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Tom Porter'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-bored-of-venezuela-as-maduro-clings-to-power-report-2019-6,"President Donald Trump is losing interest in Venezuela after a bid to remove President Nicolás Maduro failed, officials told The Washington Post.

In April, a US-backed bid by the Venezuelan opposition to remove Maduro failed, when senior Venezuelan government and military officials reneged on promises to switch sides and instead stood by the president.

According to US officials who spoke with The Post, Trump had viewed the prospect of a US-backed toppling of Maduro as an ""easy win"" at a time when other foreign-policy initiatives had stalled.

A former administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the publication that Trump had always thought of Venezuela as ""low-hanging fruit"" on which he ""could get a win and tout it as a major foreign policy victory.""

""Five or six months later ... it's not coming together,"" the official said.

Current and former officials told The Post that Trump had ""chewed out"" national security adviser John Bolton and Mauricio Claver-Carone, the Latin America policy director, because they ""got played"" by both the US-backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó and Maduro regime figures — who said they supported ousting Maduro.

In January, when Guaidó declared himself interim president of Venezuela and urged the military to turn against Maduro, the US was quick to declare its support, imposing sanctions on Venezuelan government officials sending food aid to the country and pressing allies to recognize Guaidó as the country's rightful leader.

The Pentagon even refused to rule out using military force to aid in ousting Maduro, a move which experts told Business Insider could have resulted in the US being bogged down in a protracted conflict similar to those in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The issue has largely fallen off Trump's Twitter feed, with the president last mentioning Venezuela on June 4, when he said Russian forces had withdrawn from the country. Russia denied it discussed with the president withdrawing its defense personnel."
Hundreds of migrant caravan members found to have US criminal histories: DHS files,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hundreds-of-migrant-caravan-found-to-have-criminal-histories-dhs-files,"Hundreds of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the southern border as part of massive migrant caravans were found to have criminal histories in the U.S., according to newly obtained Department of Homeland Security documents.

The DHS files were provided to House Oversight Committee Republicans in May and included internal data showing more than 1,000 migrants traveling as part of caravans to the border within the past nine months had “U.S. criminal histories” and hundreds had “U.S. criminal convictions.”

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

The files detailed one migrant caravan of nearly 8,000 individuals that started toward the border in October 2018 and arrived south of California by December. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 660 of them had U.S. criminal convictions—with 40 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and three convicted of murder.

In January 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracked another caravan that left Honduras with more than 3,300 migrants. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) team identified that 860 of those individuals had U.S. criminal histories, including more than 20 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, nearly 30 convicted of sexual offenses, two convicted of violence against law enforcement, and one convicted of attempted murder.

The documents, provided to House Oversight Republicans, also revealed that CBP is currently monitoring another “movement of several groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 4,000” in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Veracruz, but did not specify how many of those migrants are believed to have criminal records.

In a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday, committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, requested further information about caravan members with criminal backgrounds to “assist” in their “oversight of the crisis at the southern border and better understand the threat posed by large caravans.”

Jordan requested arrest warrants, court documents and other materials detailing the criminal histories of the migrants in the January 2019 and October 2018 caravan; an update of CBP’s monitoring of the caravan movement in Mexican states; and summaries of ICE HSI materials by July 5.

In his letter, Jordan referred to President Trump’s decision in February to declare a national emergency and referred to his comments that the “southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics” threatening “core national security interests.”

The newly revealed DHS information comes amid a stunning surge across the border this year. Last month, the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border skyrocketed to levels not seen in over a decade, with CBP reporting nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible—more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. The number was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years, officials said.

“We are in a full-blown emergency,” Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said earlier this month. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

FOOTAGE SHOWS MIGRANTS WALKING AROUND BORDER WALL TO ENTER US

McAleenan, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also warned that 90 percent of asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the U.S.

The continued crisis at the border comes as Trump has sought to extend and shore up the border wall, declaring a national emergency in a bid to divert billions toward construction -- an effort being challenged in the courts.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

Through the agreement, the U.S. is slated to extend its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. also committed to accelerating asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare, and education according to its principles.”

The deal also stated that Mexico will take “decisive action” to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border.

E.P.A. Finalizes Its Plan to Replace Obama-Era Climate Rules,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html,"The new rule, which is expected to come into effect within 30 days, assumes that the forces of the market will guide the country to a future of cleaner energy by naturally phasing out coal over time. It imposes only modest requirements on coal plants.

While it instructs states to reduce emissions, the new measure sets no targets. Instead, it lets states decide how much carbon reduction they consider reasonable and suggests ways to improve efficiency at individual power plants.

Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell, said he thought the current Supreme Court would be skeptical of any presidential effort to regulate carbon emissions under existing law.

“I t will establish what the E.P.A. can and can’t do,” Mr. Holmstead said of the new Trump rule. “I think it really will tie the hands of future administrations.”

Environmental groups say the Trump rule will slow the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at a time when scientists warn that countries must rapidly decarbonize to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, including heat waves, extreme storms, droughts and floods.

Mr. Wheeler has said the Trump administration’s plan is legally sound, will not damage the economy and will still go a long way toward reducing carbon .

He maintained that, when the new measure is fully implemented, it will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by 34 percent below 2005 levels, roughly equal to the goals of the Clean Power Plan."
Trump tells Fox News DOJ looking into whether his phone calls were monitored,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'President Trump', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hannity-campaign-launch-justice-department-phone-calls-monitored,"One day after formally launching his 2020 presidential bid, President Trump told Fox News' ""Hannity"" exclusively on Wednesday that investigators are working to determine whether his personal phone calls were secretly monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 campaign -- a possibility he called ""the ultimate.""

Trump also hammered House Democrats for putting his former top communication advisor Hope Hicks ""through hell,"" after pictures of Hicks testifying before a closed-door session on Capitol Hill earlier in the day leaked on social media.

Hicks is the Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer for Fox Corporation, and Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation.

""What's happened to the Democrats -- and in the meantime, they're not doing any work in Congress,"" Trump told Sean Hannity, calling the party ""unhinged.""

""They're not allowed to do that. It's probably illegal,"" Trump said, referring to the leaked pictures of Hicks. Some Democrats complained that Hicks, in her appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, was ordered by the White House to stay quiet about her time as an aide to Trump, citing legal privileges.

But, Trump condemned Democrats' ongoing hearings on collusion and obstruction as an attempt at a ""do-over"" of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Take a look at Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""How come the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC? Just think about that one, Sean."" That was a reference to the DNC's decision in 2016 to turn over its server to the private security firm Crowdstrike, rather than the FBI, after what prosecutors said was a Russian-led hack.

The Hill's John Solomon reported earlier Wednesday that the FBI, in search warrant affidavits, relied heavily on leaked Ukrainian financial documents concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- even though the bureau was repeatedly warned that the documents were untrustworthy and likely fake.

Earlier this year, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko opened a probe into the so-called ""black ledger"" files that led to Manafort's abrupt departure from the Trump campaign. The investigation commenced after an unearthed audio recording showed that a senior Ukrainian anticorruption official apparently admitted to leaking Manafort's financial information in 2016 -- including his ties to pro-Russian actors in Ukraine -- to benefit Clinton.

CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' TRUMP SAYS

A Ukrainian court recently ruled that the Manafort leak amounted to illegal interference in the U.S. election. A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one."" — President Trump

Trump told Hannity the episode was hardly surprising, given that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), through the firm Fusion GPS, funded British ex-spy Christopher Steele's creation of an unverified and largely discredited dossier. The FBI went on to cite the dossier in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

""I think it's a disgrace,"" Trump said.

Numerous issues with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Mueller's report made plain, for example, that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

""The fact is, they were spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies to do it. ... We're trying to figure out whether they listened to my calls. That would be the ultimate. We'll see what happens. If that happens, we'll probably find out. If they spied on my campaign and they may have, it will be one of the great revelations in history of this country. It will be very interesting. I think we're gonna find out.""

Trump said Attorney General Bill Barr is working ""very hard"" to get to the bottom the matter.

DOJ INVESTIGATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AS PART OF ONGOING REVIEW OF FBI MISCONDUCT

The lengthy phone conversation began with Trump recounting the Tuesday night launch of his campaign in the jam-packed Amway Center in Orlando. Thousands of Trump supporters arrived more than 40 hours in advance to secure a spot, despite sweltering Florida heat. Some had been camped in chairs for several nights.

""It was an incredible scene -- and outside there were thousands of people,"" Trump told Hannity, comparing the atmosphere to that of a national college football championship. ""It was just an electric evening. ... It's a tailgate party for our country.""

Trump noted that the U.S. has become ""number one in the world in energy,"" referring to the fact that the U.S. is the world's leading crude oil producer. The head of the International Energy Agency said in 2018 that, because of the ""shale revolution,"" the U.S. ""is becoming the undisputed leader of oil and gas production worldwide.”

The positive economic indicators, Trump said, have led Democrats to desperately pivot to discussing obstruction, now that Mueller's report found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign, despite multiple efforts by Russian-linked actors to involve the Trump team in its hacking efforts.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one,"" Trump said, before touting his administration's economic successes. ""We have the best, lowest unemployment rate for blacks, Asians, Hispanics -- nobody's ever seen numbers like this... If the other side had won, we'd have gone into a depression.

""We have more poeple working today -- almost 160 million people -- than have ever worked in the history of our country,"" Trump added. ""Think of it -- it's a great number.""

Trump also denied a Wall Street Journal report that he will live-tweet the upcoming Democrat primary debates, but suggested it might not be a bad idea.

""Instead of fake news, I'll make them correct news -- and maybe that's OK,"" Trump joked.

""When I make a speech, like last night -- there was a fantastic woman in the front with a sign, 'Please keep tweeting, it matters,'"" Trump continued. ""And, I think it does matter. I don't do it because I enjoy it. When somebody says an outright lie on MSNBC or CNN ... I can counteract those lies, and I have many more followers than they do."""
"Marine general 'bullied' subordinates, 'devalued women': Pentagon inspector general",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marine-general-bullied-subordinates-devalued-women-pentagon-inspector/story?id=63814450,"A Department of Defense Inspector General report concluded that a Marine Corps general ""disparaged, bullied, and humiliated subordinates, devalued women, and created a negative ... work environment that led to a general distrust of his impartiality and leadership.""

In response, the Marine Corps said it would ""take appropriate action in light of the substantiated misconduct.""

Brig. Gen. Norman Cooling was serving as the Legislative Assistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps when the Senate Armed Services Committee sent a complaint to then-Defense Secretary James Mattis about Cooling's conduct, leading to the DOD IG investigation which was initiated on March 15, 2018.

The IG concluded that Cooling violated sections of U.S. Code, as well as Defense Department and Navy regulations. He is currently serving as the Assistant Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policies and Operations for the Marine Corps, after being removed from his previous position last year due to the investigation.

United States Marine Corps

After reviewing the IG's draft report, Cooling acknowledged that he ""fell short of maintaining a positive climate throughout the Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA)"" and accepted responsibility for that shortfall, but said the report did not provide ""sufficient evidence by any legitimate legal standard to support a finding that I created a hostile work environment or that I made demeaning remarks about women,"" according to the IG.

""The Marine Corps takes all allegations of misconduct seriously, regardless of rank,"" Marine Corps spokesman Maj. Brian Block told ABC News in a statement on Wednesday. ""The Marine Corps is currently reviewing the DoD IG's report and will take appropriate action in light of the substantiated misconduct.""

""The Marine Corps expects every Marine, uniformed and civilian -- and particularly those in leadership positions -- to hold themselves to the highest standards in their personal and professional conduct. When Marines fall short of our standards they are held accountable,"" he said.

Sgt. Joseph Johnson/U.S. Department of Defense

The IG interviewed over three dozen witnesses and reviewed 11,650 official emails, along with other relevant documents before determining, according to the report, that ""on numerous occasions ... Cooling’s comments and conduct demeaned, bullied, and humiliated his subordinates.""

Among the details of the report:

""BGen Cooling told a female [non commissioned officer] who aspires to be a Marine Corps pilot that he would rather have his daughter work in a brothel than be a pilot.""

""He loudly and publicly berated two staff members whom he accused of trying to 'f**k' him and asked them repeatedly, 'Where the f**k have you been?'""

""He publicly yelled to a staff member that if the staff member did not give him requested budget information he would castrate the staff member.""

""In a staff meeting, he bullied a staff officer when he publicly berated, belittled, and singled her out for ridicule in front of her peers when a Member of Congress canceled a meeting with the Assistant Commandant. He then told his entire staff in the same meeting that if any of them failed to get an office call for the Assistant Commandant with a Member of Congress, he was 'going to jump out this f**king window.'""

""He bullied a subordinate when he attempted to damage her reputation by spreading a rumor about her and potentially damaging her future career by warning the most senior Marine Corps officer in the subordinate’s career field, 'watch yourself, you’ve got to watch out' for her. BGen Cooling further blamed the subordinate for the SASC complaint against him, his removal from the Legislative Assistant position, and this investigation into his conduct.""

Cooling further told the IG that the report ""can only legitimately establish that I made a few isolated comments that some construed in the worst possible way and told third parties so that they ended up in the [SASC complaint].""

""At no time during that brief assignment, nor at any other time during my career, did I ever discriminate against anyone for anything other than their performance,"" he said in the report.

Cooling graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1986 and has deployed multiple times to Iraq and Afghanistan throughout his military career."
"1,500 migrants in two caravans had US criminal histories",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/1-500-migrants-in-two-caravans-had-us-criminal-convictions,"More than 1,500 migrants who traveled as part of two caravans from Central America in the past year had U.S. criminal histories, indicating they had been deported in the past, according to government data obtained Thursday by the Washington Examiner.

House Oversight Committee Republicans released information from a February request they had sent the Department of Homeland Security asking for details on any known criminals hiding within the caravans of families arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border largely seeking asylum.

Exactly 660 people, or 8%, of the 8,000-person caravan that traveled to Mexico’s northern border city of Tijuana in November had criminal convictions, according to information obtained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations.

Of those 660, about 260 had been convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Three people were convicted of murder.

A second caravan of 3,300 people that originated in Honduras in April contained 860 individuals with criminal histories, though the document did not state how many had actual convictions.

Of the 860, 20 people were convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon; nearly 30 others had been convicted of sexual offenses; two people had been convicted of violence against law enforcement; and one was convicted of attempted murder.

"Report: Marine general's crude remarks, treatment of women, created a negative work environment",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Tom Vanden Brook', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/19/marine-corps-general-rebuked-bullying-devaluing-women/1498965001/,"CLOSE A study by the Pentagon reveals that cases of sexual assault in the military ranks has increased 38% from 2016 to 2018. Buzz60

WASHINGTON — The Marine Corps Commandant's former representative to Congress bullied his staff – including saying he'd castrate one of them – devalued women and created a negative work environment, according to a Pentagon Inspector General report released Wednesday.

Brig. Gen. Norman Cooling was the focus of the inspector general's investigation after the Senate Armed Services Committee complained about his behavior in February 2018. The inspector general referred Cooling's case back to the Marine Corps for discipline, and officials there are reviewing the report, Maj. Brian Block, a Marine spokesman, said Wednesday.

In a letter to investigators, Cooling challenged their findings. He wrote that ""'aggressive leadership is incorrectly deemed by the investigator to be negative.

""It was my responsibility to maintain the trust and confidence of my subordinates and I clearly pressed them to the point where some experienced work-related stress and may have questioned my motivations,"" he wrote. ""It should be noted that the comments perceived by some as inappropriate were related to substandard performance.""

Who is Mark Esper?: He's the new acting Defense Secretary. Here's what you need to know about him.

The Marine Corps removed Cooling from his post after seven months. He is currently assigned to the Marine Corps headquarters, Block said.

In a statement, Cooling said the investigation showed that he broke no laws. He also thanked the Marine Corps, which he called his life for 33 years.

“My intent was always to increase the performance of the office, but I did not account for the politically charged environment in which it operates,"" Cooling said. ""I inadvertently offended some through random remarks that were taken in a different context than I intended.""

The report on Cooling comes as the military continues to address abuse in its ranks, including sexual harassment and assault. In its latest report, the Pentagon found that reports of sexual assault, for example, had increased 38% from 2016 to 2018.

On the decline: Misbehavior by top officials and officers is declining, Pentagon says

Among the allegations substantiated by the inspector general against Cooling:

""He publicly yelled to a staff member that if the staff member did not give him requested budget information he would castrate the staff member.""

The Senate complaint alleged that Cooling told ""members of his staff and a female Marine who was aiming to be a Marine pilot that he would rather have his daughter work in a whorehouse than be a female Marine pilot.""

In a meeting with Senate staff, Cooling ""made the statement that opening combat roles to women had negatively impacted men because women are physically inferior to men and men could no longer refer to their rifle parts by the names of female body parts.""

Cooling disputed many of the findings in the report. For example, he wrote that the castration comment was a joke and that he had used the term ""brothel,"" not whorehouse. He denied making the comments about women in combat.

The inspector general largely disagreed. Investigators interviewed 37 witnesses and reviewed 11,650 emails.

""We substantiated the allegation that Brig. Gen. Cooling's overall course of conduct toward subordinates disparaged, bullied, humiliated them and devalued women,"" the report concluded. ""We determined that Brig. Gen. Cooling conducted himself in a less than exemplary manner in his treatment of subordinates or in comments that devalued women on seven occasions during his 7 month and 17 day tenure at (the Office of Legislative Affairs.)""

Defense chief steps down: Acting Defense Secretary resigns after scrutiny of 2010 domestic fight

The Marine Corps is reviewing the report and will take appropriate action, Block said.

""The Marine Corps expects every Marine, uniformed and civilian – and particularly those in leadership positions – to hold themselves to the highest standards in their personal and professional conduct,"" Block said in a statement. ""When Marines fall short of our standards they are held accountable.""

Justice Dept. lawyer suggests 'toothbrush and soap' not required for detained migrant kids,https://thehill.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/449506-justice-dept-lawyer-suggests-toothbrush-and-soap-not-required-for,"A Justice Department lawyer suggested at a recent hearing that a toothbrush and soap were not necessarily required to fulfill sanitary conditions for detained migrant children laid out in a years-old agreement, The Associated Press reports.

According to the news agency, Sarah Fabian, a senior litigation counsel for the department, made the suggestion while discussing a 1997 settlement agreement that requires certain sanitary and safety standards be met for detained persons during a recent hearing at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

The hearing was centered around the government’s appeal of a ruling handed down by a federal judge in 2017 that found authorities violated the settlement after a group of detained migrant children reportedly said they were forced to sleep in inadequate conditions and not provided with sufficient food.

Fabian argued at the recent hearing that the agreement failed to provide specificity as to what items must be provided to ensure sanitary and safety conditions are met, including a toothbrush and soap.

“There’s fair reason to find those things may be part of safe and sanitary,” she said, according to the publication.

When pressed further by a judge about whether a toothbrush and soap should always be provided to detainees, Fabian reportedly said the items aren’t necessarily required depending on the person’s length of stay.

The government reportedly argues in its appeal that the 2017 ruling is based in “new substantive requirements” that aren’t outlined in the decades-old agreement between activists and the U.S. government.

However, activists say the settlement’s requirements that conditions in which detained migrant children be “safe and sanitary” extends to basic items maintaining personal hygiene, like a toothbrush and soap, according to The Associated Press."

“DARPA launched three balloons from Cumberland, Maryland, in a flight test for the Adaptable Lighter Than Air Program,” said Heather Babb, spokeswoman for the Department of Defense. “ALTA will demonstrate capability for wind-borne navigation of a lighter-than-air vehicle over extended ranges.”

>> PREVIOUS: What was that bright, white dot hanging over parts of the Miami Valley?

Babb stopped short of confirming that the bright, white dot spotted by numerous News Center 7 viewers was indeed a DARPA balloon, however another spokesperson for DARPA said given the location it was likely one of their balloons.

Sightings of the object were reported Tuesday to News Center 7 from viewers in Xenia, Englewood, West Milton, West Carrollton and Eaton.

DARPA’s ALTA program’s balloons can fly at altitudes of more than 75,000 feet.

“While they do not have independent propulsion, the ALTA vehicle is designed to navigate by changing altitude and thus taking advantage of different wind profiles aloft,” according to DARPA’s website.

DARPA dates back to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and also has played roles in precision weapons and stealth technology, and other technology advances such as the Internet, automated voice recognition, language transition and GPS.

DARPA is comprised of about 220 government employees in six technical offices, who oversee about 250 research and development programs."
"10-year Treasury yield drops as low as 1.97%, first time below 2% since November 2016",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"A chart showing the U.S. 10-year treasury yield below 2% as of 11:49 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016 on Wednesday — breaching a key psychological level — after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate, that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

At around 11:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, declined below 2% to 1.9821% — around its lowest levels since November 2016. The yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.7209%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.175%, as of 7:30 p.m. ET.

While stock investors and home buyers may initially cheer the drop in the benchmark for corporate bond and mortgage rates, the return to levels not seen in more than two years raises serious questions about the state of the economy.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report — which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions — and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities — bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices — show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Trump also said Tuesday he will be having an ""extended meeting"" next week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy in the coming months if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

Schiff: House in the dark about DOJ’s 2016 campaign spying probe,https://www.politico.com,"['Natasha Bertrand', 'Kyle Cheney', 'Andrew Desiderio']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/19/schiff-doj-campaign-spying-probe-1370713,"House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said that Justice Department investigations into the origins of the Russia probe were part of an effort to ""ignore what the Russians did, and what they will do in the next election."" | Damian Dovarganes/AP Photo congress Schiff: House in the dark about DOJ’s 2016 campaign spying probe Attorney General Bill Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government “spying” on the Trump campaign.

The House Intelligence Committee has “very little visibility” into the three Justice Department investigations into the intelligence officials who launched the Russia probe, the panel’s chairman Adam Schiff said on Wednesday.

It’s a situation that has Schiff concerned, given his fears that the probes are politically motivated.

Story Continued Below

“It’s an effort to amplify the counter-narrative, and to ignore what the Russians did, and what they will do in the next election,” Schiff said at a National Press Club event on Wednesday. ""We’ve already seen a disturbing erosion of our checks and balances” with regard to the White House’s contact with DOJ, he added.

DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General has been investigating the origins of the Russia probe since last year. Attorney General Bill Barr launched a parallel investigation in May, tapping John Durham to spearhead the inquiry around the time special counsel Robert Mueller was wrapping up the two-year probe, which concluded Trump’s campaign did not criminally conspire with Russian intermediaries to disrupt the 2016 election. Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government “spying” on the Trump campaign that drove suspicions of a Kremlin link.

According to The New York Times, Durham’s efforts have since zeroed in on the CIA analysts responsible for the conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the 2016 election specifically to help Trump win. The focus has alarmed some in the national security community who worry that Durham’s probe will cast doubt on the apolitical nature of intelligence gathering and give credence to the president’s misleading claims that Obama-era officials tried to sabotage his campaign.

Those fears have been exacerbated by Trump’s decision to give Barr sweeping declassification authority, a power usually delegated to intelligence leaders for their own evidence.

Schiff indicated that, despite asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department to keep him informed about any official declassification requests from Barr, the House Intelligence Committee — which oversees the intelligence community — remains largely in the dark about what the agencies are having to produce and whether their cooperation is voluntary or being compelled.

“I have discussed personally with the Director of National Intelligence [Dan] Coats my profound concern about what Bill Barr is doing in particular,” Schiff said. “Namely, his desire to provide cover to the president by investigating the investigators.”

Others are less anxious about Durham’s probe, noting that the CIA has been investigated by Durham before and is accustomed to this kind of oversight. They point to 2008, when Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed Durham to conduct a criminal investigation into the destruction of torture tapes made by the CIA years earlier. That probe was expanded and later resulted in full criminal investigations into the deaths of two detainees, which ultimately wrapped in 2012 with no charges brought against anyone in the agency.

It’s unclear, though, what mandate Durham is operating under and whether he is looking at the intelligence agencies with an eye to recommending criminal charges. He has not been appointed to lead a criminal investigation, and the Justice Department has formally described the inquiry as only as a “review.” Durham also won’t be leaving his day job as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut.

Schiff, meanwhile, said he is still trying to get answers from the FBI about the counterintelligence findings of Mueller’s investigation, and whether the counterintelligence investigation launched in early 2017 into Trump himself was ever formally closed.

While the FBI has “started to provide some answers” and increased briefings, Schiff said, they’ve been reluctant to go into any detail. “They’re just telling us about process,” Schiff said. “Like everything else, it’s like pulling teeth, and our patience is growing fatigued at this point.”"
VA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides,https://thehill.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/449444-va-chief-pressed-on-efforts-to-prevent-veteran-suicides,"Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie Robert Leon WilkieVA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides VA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides VA bans smoking, vaping at its hospitals MORE told lawmakers his agency is stepping up efforts to prevent veteran suicides during testimony before a Senate panel Wednesday.

Wilkie testified before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing, where he was pressed on efforts the Trump administration is taking to address what many have called a growing epidemic of suicide among former military servicemembers.

Wilkie said the issue called for a collaborative approach across government.

""Suicide is a national public health issue that affects communities everywhere. Just as there is no single cause of suicide, no single organization can end veteran suicide,"" Wilkie said in his remarks provided to the panel.

""We must work side-by-side with our partners at all levels of government and in the private sector to provide our veterans with the mental health and suicide prevention services they need.""

Wilkie highlighted the problem of firearm-related suicides, which he said accounted for 70 percent of veteran suicides. And he said officials would do more to prevent such deaths.

“The goal is to build time and space between the impulse to harm oneself and the act,” the secretary said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed Wilkie on that promise.

“The time and space between someone who overdoses on prescription drugs, you have hours,"" Blumenthal said. ""For someone who uses a gun, you have no time.”

Wilkie told the senator he was open to look at legislation that would take guns away from people if a judge deems those individuals a threat.

Wilkie said education was an important aspect as well, noting that more must be done to talk to servicemembers about mental health issues and to train those in the military from the start of basic training to recognize warning signs of mental illness and depression.

“Educating family members is absolutely key in things as simple as gun storage,” he added.

Lawmakers from both parties said officials must do more on suicide prevention.

Testifying alongside Wilkie was Dr. Keita Franklin, the executive director of the Suicide Prevention Program at the Veterans Health Administration.

Isakson asked Franklin about veteran suicide prevention hotlines. Franklin said the help offered over the hotlines had improved and veterans are now able to receive same-day support.

Wilkie added that the average wait time for callers is 8 seconds and there are no voicemail boxes."

Columnist

The State Department official in charge of U.S. arms control negotiations with Moscow and her husband had a years-long friendship with GOP operative Paul Erickson, the former boyfriend of convicted unregistered Russian agent Maria Butina — ties this official did not disclose to her superiors or to Congress during her confirmation process in the spring of 2018.

Erickson officiated the June 2017 wedding of Andrea Thompson, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, and David Gillian, a former senior Australian army officer, three administration officials and Erickson’s lawyer have confirmed. At the time, Thompson was serving as national security adviser to Vice President Pence. Four months before the wedding, Gillian had transferred Erickson $100,000, which federal officials allege Erickson stole from Gillian, FBI and court documents show. Thompson never disclosed these ties to her superiors until approached this week by this columnist, the three administration officials said.

The wedding took place about six months before Erickson and Butina were publicly identified as being connected to Russian influence operations inside the United States. But by the time of Thompson’s confirmation, allegations of the couple’s influence activities had been widely reported.

Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told me that his panel will investigate Thompson’s lack of disclosure to both Congress and the FBI.

“These reports about Under Secretary Thompson raise questions about how forthcoming she was with all relevant information during her confirmation process,” Menendez said. “I hope that any relevant connections implicating financial interests, or to someone who our government has charged with being an agent of a foreign power, would have been fully reviewed and vetted by the FBI during the security clearance process, and disclosed to the Foreign Relations Committee. It is not clear that happened.”

Thompson’s failure to disclose her contacts and her husband’s business dealings with Erickson is viewed inside the administration as a serious lack of judgment — considering that her former boss, then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, was fired for lying about his contacts with Russian officials.

Several administration officials told me Thompson should have disclosed these connections voluntarily, since she holds top security clearances and has worked for decades as a U.S. intelligence officer. Her failure to report this information, these officials suggested, represented an intelligence vulnerability that could have been used against her.

“When the person who marries you gets into trouble with the Russians and your job is to negotiate with the Russians, you have to disclose that,” a senior administration official told me. “Everybody with an intelligence clearance knows that.”

Butina attended the Thompson-Gillian wedding in South Dakota as Erickson’s guest, according to Erickson’s lawyer, William Hurd. Butina did not have significant interactions with either Thompson or Gillian at the wedding, beyond greetings and congratulations, Hurd told me.

“Paul Erickson had known Andrea Thompson and David Gillian for years. He considered them both friends and agreed to officiate at their wedding in 2017,” Hurd told me. “Maria Butina came to the wedding because Paul Erickson was dating her. If Paul had been dating a different woman, then that woman would have come to the wedding.”

The State Department declined to comment on the record. Thompson, through a State Department spokesperson, also declined to comment. Butina’s lawyer declined to comment. Gillian and the McChrystal Group, the consulting firm where he now works, did not respond to requests for comment.

As a career intelligence officer, Thompson would have been required under updated executive branch regulations to self-report any significant unofficial contacts with a foreign national or any attempt by a foreign national to gain influence.

There is no evidence to suggest Thompson or Gillian had significant interactions with Butina outside the wedding, either. Sources close to Thompson told me that Erickson had known the Thompson family for many years in South Dakota.

Thompson is not alleged to have been involved in her husband’s business dealings with Erickson. Additionally, there is no evidence Thompson was deliberately untruthful to her bosses, federal investigators or congressional officials during her vetting or confirmation process, which took place from late 2017 until her confirmation on April 26, 2018.

In December 2017, after Thompson had left the vice president’s office and was working at the State Department before being nominated for her current role, the New York Times revealed that Erickson had emailed top Trump campaign officials in May 2016 offering to set up a high-level back channel with the Russian government led by President Vladimir Putin.

Under the subject line “Kremlin Connection,” Erickson proposed that Trump could “make first contact” with “President Putin’s emissary” at an upcoming event hosted by the National Rifle Association, of which Erickson was a long-time member. The planned meeting did not take place, according to the Times.

But according to federal prosecutors, this was just one of a series of actions Erickson took in cooperation with Butina to make connections in Republican political circles and set up meetings for Alexander Torshin, who was then a deputy governor of the Russian central bank.

In July 2018, the Justice Department unveiled a criminal complaint against Butina, charging her with “conspiracy to act as an agent of the Russian Federation within the United States without prior notification to the Attorney General.” In an accompanying affidavit, the FBI claimed that ""U.S. Person 1,"" whom several reports have identified as Erickson, worked closely with Butina to build her influence inside the United States and “advance the interests of the Russian Federation.”

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has opened an investigation into Butina, Torshin and their activities inside the United States. The FBI is also reportedly investigating whether Torshin helped funnel Russian money through the NRA to help the Trump campaign.

Erickson has never been charged with any crime related to Butina, Torshin or the NRA. In February, he was indicted in a seemingly unrelated matter, accused by federal prosecutors of defrauding dozens of investors related to a plan to build retirement facilities and housing for oil workers in North Dakota. According to an April 2018 FBI affidavit in that case, one of Erickson’s last investors was Gillian.

“Erickson told David Gillian he would receive a return of between 25 percent and 75 percent within approximately one year,” the affidavit alleges.

“In reality, the bank records indicated that Gillian’s $100,000 was not invested in real estate or anything else,” the affidavit continues. “In fact, that money was used to pay routine expenses and to pay off a previous investor, Congressman Marshall Sanford. Some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina.”

The criminal complaint against Erickson alleges he wired more than $20,000 to American University, where Butina was studying, three months after taking Gillian’s money. Gillian is now suing Erickson in civil court in South Dakota regarding the investment. Hurd, Erickson’s lawyer, has previously called the fraud charges against Erickson “unfounded.”

To be clear, Thompson’s connections with Erickson are not a crime and Erickson is innocent until proven guilty. Gillian is not accused of wrongdoing and is allegedly a victim of Erickson.

Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Thompson’s situation was symptomatic of larger staffing issues plaguing the Trump administration.

“From clumsy vetting to chronic failure to fill vacant positions, it’s no wonder there’s such dysfunction in the executive branch,” Engel said. “The White House needs to get its act together to make sure the officials in charge of protecting our national security meet the highest standards and comply fully with all laws and regulations on disclosure.”

Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK Clean car advocates and state leaders gathered in Fresno on Monday, Sept. 24, 2018 for an EPA hearing against the plan to revoke California's authority on vehicle pollution.

The tensions between California and Trump administration environmental officials spilled into the open Thursday in a remarkably personal way.

In a letter to Republicans in Congress, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler accused California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols of lying to lawmakers about the nature of their negotiations over California’s fuel economy standards, which the Trump administration is trying to preempt.

Wheeler, a former energy lobbyist, wrote GOP members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that it was “false” to claim that Nichols “operated as a good faith actor,” in California’s negotiations with the Trump administration. And he blamed the failed talks on “California’s lack of effort.”

Wheeler’s letter was a response to Nichols’ prepared testimony, submitted to the House ahead of Thursday’s hearing on the administration’s proposal to roll back Obama-era emissions standards, in which she claimed “the oil industry drove this action.”

The administration’s proposal would also revoke the waiver California received under the 1970 Clean Air Act, allowing the state to set fuel economy standards that are stricter than the federal government’s.

In her remarks before the committee Thursday, Nichols said she wanted to respond to Wheeler’s “rather shocking letter” by reiterating several lines from her written testimony.

“We have been open to accommodations,” Nichols said. But “the Trump administration has been unwilling to find a way that works. Their claim that California offered no counter-proposal is false. They unilaterally decided to cut off conversations.”

“I stand by every single word in that paragraph,” Nichols told lawmakers. “I would state categorically that we proposed areas where we would be willing to compromise with the administration and we were never told precisely what was wrong with those proposals.”

Wheeler, however, wrote in his letter that several parts of Nichols’ testimony were false and said the fact that “California was cut out of the development of this proposal was her own doing.”

He also wrote that Nichols’ “conspiracy theories that ‘the oil industry drove this action’ ... are beneath the responsibilities of the substantial position she holds.”

“I take offense at this letter,” Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Michigan, said of Wheeler’s letter. “I have talked to Mary Nichols regularly, I know she’s wanted to come back to this table and you all, quite frankly, have not put this table together.”

“If we hear Mary Nichols on the next panel say she’s willing to go to the table, will you commit to resume discussion immediately on a compromise, yes or no?” Dingell asked EPA Assistant Administrator William Wehrum and National Highway Safety Transportation Deputy Administrator Heidi King.

Neither Wehrum or King would commit to that.

“I don’t know whether that would actually achieve the goal,” said King.

Rep. Doris Matsui, D-Sacramento, slammed Wheeler for sending a letter to Republicans lawmakers rather than testifying in person before the committee. “It is hardly surprising that Wheeler is hiding behind a letter instead of joining us under oath.”

“This is a pattern of behavior – refusing to negotiate with California in good faith and refusing to have an EPA official testify side by side with Mary Nichols,” she said. Nichols appeared on the hearing’s afternoon panel with non-governmental witnesses, instead.

The finger pointing comes as the EPA is preparing to finalize its proposed regulation.

Officials from the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wouldn’t confirm at Thursday’s hearing that the administration intends to move forward with its plan to revoke the waiver.

“No decision has been made yet,” Wehrum told lawmakers. But they are widely expected to move forward with that plan, something the growing acrimony between the state and federal negotiators only reinforces.

That could cost California billions in federal transportation funding, Matsui warned at Thursday’s hearing.

“Under the Clean Air Act, federally funded transportation projects must demonstrate that they meet air quality goals,” she said. Reducing California’s emission standards means the state “would be compromised in their ability to meet federal air quality standards.”

Wehrum, however, denied that was a foregone conclusion. He told Matsui that while the California Air Resources Board has suggested “this is going to create a great problem,” a recent letter they submitted to the EPA doesn’t “conclude that it does.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Xavier Becerra have already indicated they will sue to protect California’s standards and its waiver authority, setting up what could be years of conflicting mandates for carmakers.





“You and I both know this is going to end up in the courts and that is an uncertainty they don’t want,” Dingell said. “The administration needs to respect, it just needs to respect California’s role in this process. And I say this as a Michigander who’s had real, you know, it’s been a history.”"
Working BlueKeep Exploit Developed by DHS,https://threatpost.com,"[""Lindsey O'Donnell""]",,,,https://threatpost.com/working-bluekeep-exploit-developed-by-dhs/145784/,"The Department of Homeland Security urged system administrators to update their Windows machines after testing a working BlueKeep exploit for Windows 2000.

The Department of Homeland Security has confirmed it has developed a working exploit for the “wormable” BlueKeep vulnerability. The agency issued an alert on Monday urging Windows users to update their machines as soon as possible.

The alert heightens concerns that malicious actors could soon also develop their own exploits of the BlueKeep flaw. The critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2019-0708), though fixed during Microsoft’s May Patch Tuesday Security Bulletin, continues to plague the security industry. Experts have warned that it could pave the way for a similar rapidly-propogating attack on the scale of the devastating 2017 WannaCry attack.

The The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed on Monday that it was able to exploit the flaw on a Windows 2000 machine, which marks another operating system impacted by the flaw that was not part of Microsoft’s original alert: “CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep,” according to its advisory.

The critical bug exists in Remote Desktop Services and impacts older versions of Windows, including Windows 7, Windows XP, Server 2003 and Server 2008, Microsoft said in its original alert. This original alert did not mention Windows 2000 machines.

While Microsoft has released patches for a number of operating systems that are no longer officially supported, including Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, the company will not patch Windows 2000 systems, according to a TechCrunch report.

“We strongly recommend that any customers using Windows 2000 should update to a supported operating system as soon as possible,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Threatpost. “Modern operating systems include built-in protections against this, and many other threats.”

Support for Windows 2000 machines ended in 2010. For Windows users running on systems that cannot be patched, CISA recommended that they upgrade end-of-life operating systems, disable unnecessary services and enable network level authentication.

For those who are running on systems for which patches are available, CISA joined Microsoft, the National Security Agency and others in urging system administrators to update as soon as possible, warning of the potential WannaCry-level event.

“The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is issuing this Activity Alert to provide information on a vulnerability, known as ‘BlueKeep,’ that exists in the following Microsoft Windows Operating Systems, including both 32- and 64-bit versions, as well as all Service Pack versions,” according to CISA’s alert.

The multiple warnings are warranted. As of the end of May, one million devices were still vulnerable to BlueKeep.

Worries around the vulnerability are mounting: Earlier in June, a researcher created a proof-of-concept Metasploit module for the critical BlueKeep vulnerability, which successfully demonstrates how to achieve complete takeover of a target Windows machine.

At the same time, threat actors are actively sniffing out vulnerable devices. Researchers with GreyNoise in May said that they are “observing sweeping tests for systems vulnerable to the RDP ‘BlueKeep’ (CVE-2019-0708) vulnerability from several dozen hosts around the Internet.”

Satnam Narang, senior research engineer at Tenable, said that the level of attention by CISA and other organizations is “certainly warranted.”

“The writing is on the wall; BlueKeep has the potential to cause widespread devastation, similar to the Wannacry worm in 2017,” he said in an email. “Organizations must act and patch vulnerable systems, or implement mitigations if patching isn’t easily viable.”

Ex-Mueller counsel retiring from DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-mueller-counsel-retiring-from-doj,"A top Justice Department official who served as a counsel for special counsel Robert Mueller is retiring.

An expert on criminal law, Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben is leaving the agency after more than 30 years of service.

“On behalf of the Office of the Solicitor General, I thank Michael for his many years of service to the Department. We wish him the best of luck in the next chapter of his career,"" Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in a statement.

Dreeben's long career at the DOJ hit a milestone in 2016 when he made his 100th oral argument before the Supreme Court on behalf of the U.S. government.

During his final years in office, Dreeben defended Mueller's mandate against legal challenges and fought against appeal efforts.

"State Department identifies 23 violations, 'multiple security incidents' concerning Clinton emails",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department-violations-security-incidents,"The State Department revealed Monday that it has identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Hillary Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the Department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and 7 infractions incidents. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

ATTEMPT TO HACK CLINTON EMAILS STUNNED AIDES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, DOCS SHOW

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

The State Department, calling the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude the investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the Department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the Department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending.

""In every instance in which the Department found an individual to be culpable of a valid security violation or three or more infractions, the Department forwarded the outcome to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's Office of Personnel Security and Suitability (DS/PSS), to be placed in the individuals' official security file,"" Taylor wrote. ""All valid security incidents are reviewed by DS and taken into account every time an individual's eligibility for access to classified information is considered.

""This referral occurred whether or not the individual was currently employed with the Department of State and such security files are kept indefinitely,"" Taylor added. ""Consistent with the referral policy, for individuals who were still employed with the Department at the time of adjudication, the Department referred all valid security violations or multiple infractions to the Bureau of Human Resources.""

The State Department declined to release the names of the employees, consistent with its procedures. The department promised another update once its review is completed.

NEWLY RELEASED EMAILS SHOW CLINTON TEAM DISCUSSING 'PRIVATE' COMMS CHANNEL WITH ISRAEL

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- remarks that were watered down from their original draft -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

It emerged earlier this year that then-FBI general counsel James Baker testified that he thought Clinton should have been prosecuted until he was convinced otherwise ""pretty late"" in the investigation.

And, last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And in March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

""A significant filter team"" was employed at the FBI, Strzok said, to ""work through the various terms of the various consent agreements."" Limitations imposed on agents' searches included date ranges and names of domains and people, Strzok said, among other categories.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

Former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee until 2017 and is now a Fox News contributor, said the arrangement signaled that agents wanted willful blindness.

""What's bizarre about this, is in any other situation, there's no possible way they would allow the potential perpetrator to self-select what the FBI gets to see,"" Chaffetz said, noting that the FBI was aware that the servers contained classified information in unclassified settings. ""The FBI should be the one to sort through those emails -- not the Clinton attorneys.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""
Shanahan withdraws as Trump's defense pick as domestic incidents resurface,https://www.cnn.com,"['Zachary Cohen', 'Curt Devine', 'Drew Griffin', 'Michael Warren']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/shanahan-out-defense-secretary/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has ""decided not to go forward with his confirmation process."" Shanahan's withdrawal was announced shortly after the Washington Post published a report detailing a violent incident in 2011 in which his son attacked his own mother with a baseball bat.

""Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who has done a wonderful job, has decided not to go forward with his confirmation process so that he can devote more time to his family,"" Trump tweeted.

""I thank Pat for his outstanding service and will be naming Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, to be the new Acting Secretary of Defense. I know Mark, and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job!"" he added.

Trump announced his intention to nominate Shanahan on May 9, but the paperwork necessary to begin confirmation hearings hadn't been filed.

On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported details related to a November 2011 incident in which Shanahan rushed to defend his then-17-year-old son, William, in the days after the teenager brutally beat his mother with a baseball bat.

Two weeks later, Shanahan wrote a memo to prepare his son's initial court appearance, arguing that he had acted in self defense, according to the Post.

But in an interview on Monday, Shanahan told the Post that he later regretted writing the memo and never intended for anyone other than his son's attorneys to read it.

""Quite frankly it's difficult to relive that moment and the passage was difficult for me to read. I was wrong to write those three sentences,"" Shanahan told the Post.

""I have never believed Will's attack on his mother was an act of self-defense or justified. I don't believe violence is appropriate ever, and certainly never any justification for attacking someone with a baseball bat,"" he said.

Later Tuesday, Shanahan released a statement saying he withdrew from consideration after details surfaced related to ""a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago.""

""After having been confirmed for Deputy Secretary less than two years ago, it is unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way in the course of this process,"" he said.

""I believe my continuing in the confirmation process would force my three children to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life and reopen wounds we have worked years to heal. Ultimately, their safety and well-being is my highest priority,"" Shanahan added.

Shanahan's decision

Shanahan, who was struggling with how the details surrounding his contentious divorce have resurfaced in recent days, met with Trump in the Oval Office on Monday. The President said his outgoing acting defense secretary informed him on Tuesday morning that he was withdrawing from consideration for the permanent post.

""Pat Shanahan, who is a wonderful person, is, as you know, going to take some time off for family matters,"" Trump told reporters before heading to Florida for a campaign rally.

""I didn't ask him to withdraw. He walked in this morning"" to withdraw, he added.

The President praised Shanahan as a ""terrific person"" and said he only recently learned of the domestic violence allegations.

""I had heard about it yesterday for the first time,"" Trump said of the allegations, which Shanahan had been discussing in interviews with The Washington Post for months, according to the newspaper.

Trump also denied there was an issue with his administration's vetting process, despite multiple individuals withdrawing from consideration for posts after being announced as intended nominees.

""We have a very good vetting process,"" he said.

It was after Shanahan made the decision to withdraw, not Trump, that the President started calling aides and allies asking who should be his next pick. He wanted to be able to name who would take over for Shanahan as soon as he announced his withdrawal, sources said.

An administration official told CNN that Shanahan was fully vetted and that the White House was aware of the domestic abuse allegations in his family -- though not every single detail.

The view early on was that it was not him personally. But as previously reported, even though he was never arrested or charged, there had been growing concerns in recent days his ex-wife would resurface and publicly accuse him of domestic abuse which would then cause parallels to be drawn about the situation involving former White House aide Rob Porter

Court filings detail 2010 incident

In court filings, Shanahan's ex-wife Kimberley accused him of hitting her during a dispute at their home in August 2010.

A police officer who responded to the dispute noted that ""Patrick had a black eye and a bloody nose"" and that Kimberley did not have ""any visible marks"" on her, though Kimberley told the officer Patrick struck her several times in the stomach, according to a police incident report.

His ex-wife, who later changed her name to Kimberly Jordinson, was arrested and charged with assault for the incident. The charges against her were later dropped.

In an unrelated incident, Jordinson was also charged in Florida in 2014, for smashing a car's front and back windshields with a sledgehammer according to a police report, but she was not convicted.

Jordinson told CNN on Tuesday that the FBI never asked her about the 2010 domestic violence incident or the couple's contentious divorce until a few weeks ago.

Jordinson said she has been interviewed by the FBI a total of three times. The first two times were before Shanahan became deputy secretary of defense. She said during those earlier interviews, the agents focused on the incident in which her son beat her with a baseball bat, causing severe injuries.

The FBI returned for a third interview two or three weeks ago, to ask about the 2010 argument, Jordinson said.

Jordinson says she asked the FBI agents why they hadn't asked her about the fight before, and they said a note had previously been placed in the file to conduct a follow-up interview about the 2010 incident, but that interview was never conducted.

When CNN first spoke to Jordinson in January, she said she had not spoken to Shanahan since the 2010 incident, and that the two only communicated through attorneys.

""He is just going to spend the rest of his life hiding the truth, because he does not want the truth to come out,"" she said on Tuesday.

Jordinson also countered reports that she is mentally ill or has a substance abuse problem. ""I have never been diagnosed with a mental condition. I do not take medication for a mental condition,"" she said. She added, ""I have gone to therapy to deal with fallout from this divorce. I'm deeply saddened by what has happened to this family."" She also said she has never abused alcohol or drugs, and has never done illegal drugs.

She told CNN that she is still in the process of suing Shanahan for an additional $300,000-$400,000 for money owed from the divorce and expenses related to the raising of their three children.

Shanahan addressed the issues in a statement earlier this week.

""Though my marriage ended in sorrow and disappointment, I never laid a hand on my then-wife and cooperated fully in a thorough law enforcement investigation that resulted in her being charged with assault against me—charges which I had dropped in the interest of my family,"" he said.

Patrick and Kimberley's daughter Kayla Shanahan released her own statement saying: ""I never once saw my father raise a hand against my mother or against his children. To the contrary, my mother has a history of domestic abuse and physical violence, victimizing my father and her children, as well as having been subject of a restraining order unrelated to our family.""

Their son, Will Shanahan defended his father as a ""source of stability.""

""I and my brother and sister were subject to emotional and physical abuse by our mother. My father was and is the source of stability in our lives, in contrast to the constant physical and emotional trauma inflicted on us by our mother,"" he said in a statement.

Trump taps Esper as acting secretary

Esper, who Trump named as acting defense secretary on Tuesday, has been floated within the administration as a potential Pentagon chief for months — both before and after Trump said he would nominate Shanahan to the post.

Now, as Shanahan withdraws, the President is again considering the former Army secretary for the permanent job — though has only named him to the acting post for now. One White House official said the administration is still regrouping and figuring out their next steps after Shanahan's withdrawal.

Trump said Tuesday that he ""most likely"" will nominate Esper for the permanent job soon.

Ryan McCarthy, the under secretary for the Army, is expected to be named as the new acting Army secretary in the coming days, a person familiar with Trump's thinking said.

Esper was Trump's third pick for army secretary, and has been involved in efforts to secure funding for the border wall and to deploy US troops to the southern border.

Esper received a call from the White House about 30 minutes before the tweet announcing him as acting secretary, according to a US defense official.

The service secretaries, including Esper, will meet later Tuesday afternoon with Shanahan to discuss a transition.

""This is a good move by the administration,"" a senior GOP aide on the Senate Armed Services Committee said, predicting a smooth confirmation should the White House name Esper to the permanent post.

""They don't make him acting without nominating him,"" the aide said. ""Esper would be a very smart pick for the White House.""

Trump was generally aware for months of the rumors about Shanahan and domestic violence allegations, though it's not clear to what extent he knew the details.

The White House had grown increasingly concerned in recent days over Shanahan's issues with his background check, a White House official said. Additionally, Trump began having second thoughts about nominating him after initially telling Shanahan in the Oval Office he would, according to the official.

The official added that Shanahan stylistically didn't fit Trump's mold of what he wanted in a defense secretary and he began to question whether that was the right role for him. Shanahan is more reserved and is not an aggressive and forward type of leader. He also doesn't have military experience.

""The defense secretary plays a leadership role, not a business management role. Huge difference,"" the official said.

Asked about Esper's interest in the secretary of defense role, his spokesman pointed to a December statement in which the Army secretary told the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram: ""I'm very happy and privileged to be secretary of the Army.""

A senior GOP aide on the Senate Armed Services Committee told CNN Tuesday that naming Esper to replace Shanahan was ""a good move by the administration"" and said he would be ""a very smart pick"" should the White House choose to nominate him.

""He would have a very smooth confirmation,"" the aide said, adding that Esper is ""the most qualified in the Department.""

The aide also told CNN that most committee staff are relieved about Trump's announcement.

""We don't have to go through that confirmation battle,"" they said, referring to Shanahan.

An administration official said Esper is ""potentially qualified"" for the permanent job but that several other people are also being considered.

The source added that the White House wants someone as quickly as possible, but that it is just starting the replacement process."
The VA is improving because it's using more private healthcare,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-va-is-improving-because-its-using-more-private-healthcare,"Recently, the battle over the future of veterans healthcare increased in intensity because arguably the two most prominent politicians in the country weighed in on the issue, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and President Trump.

At a town hall in April, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Trump administration’s efforts to expand healthcare choice for veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs and said in regards to the VA that “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It isn’t surprising that Ocasio-Cortez would vigorously defend the VA while attacking reforms meant to give veterans more private healthcare options. Many of her ideological partners, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., consider the VA a model government-run healthcare system and a positive example of “socialism in action.”

A week later, Trump responded to Ocasio-Cortez with a tweet that seemingly agreed with her assertion that the VA is performing well. Underlying his tweet was the implication that the uptick in performance is due to legislation he signed into law that increased choice for veterans and accountability for VA employees — bills Ocasio-Cortez and her allies have criticized.

This exchange between the president and AOC predictably set off a debate about who was right and who was wrong about the VA. Unfortunately, in a world of 280-character tweets and cable news segments that are clipped and shared without context, it is difficult to convey a nuanced position about any public policy issue, including the future of the VA. The reality is the VA is neither completely fixed nor completely broken but is instead an institution at a crossroads with an opportunity to break the cycle of reform and failure that has plagued it since its inception. This is especially true with the recent launch of the Veterans Community Care Program which, if properly implemented, will substantially increase healthcare freedom for veterans through the VA and improve access to medical services.

Even as someone who has been highly critical of the agency for years, I have to admit the VA has made some improvement since the deadly 2014 waitlist scandal.

Between 2014 and 2017, according to a study by the JAMA network, wait times across the VA have generally gone down. However, this decrease occurred while the VA increased the number of private sector appointments by over 50%, demonstrating better use of non-VA providers and the introduction of the albeit imperfect Veterans Choice Program helped improve wait times for veterans.

Despite this good news, the VA still faces many systemic issues that need to be dealt with. Too many VA hospitals are delivering sub-standard care and hundreds of thousands of veterans are still waiting long periods of time for appointments. Additionally, most of the VA’s healthcare facilities are over 50 years old, meaning not only are the buildings increasingly aged but they are not in locations best suited to serve the more dispersed veterans population of the future.

The VA MISSION Act, signed into law last year by Trump, was designed to address these issues. Over the next few years the VA will continue implementing the law, and it faces its first major test with the rollout of the Veterans Community Care Program.

It is critical for the future of veterans healthcare that the VA properly implement all the major components of the VA MISSION Act. Failure to do so will undermine the Trump administration’s VA reform agenda and compromise healthcare for millions of veterans. In addition, any attempts to roll back the VA MISSION Act by members of Congress who oppose giving veterans more healthcare choice — like Ocasio-Cortez — should be strongly resisted.

Finally, as more veterans get care from outside of the VA, elected officials at the state and federal levels must explore ways to eliminate barriers standing in the way of veterans making full use of their new private sector healthcare options. Critical reforms include expanded use of telehealth (as Virginia did) and repealing certificate-of-need laws (as Florida did this year). These and other patient-centered reforms, expand access to health care for both veterans and non-veterans while encouraging innovation.

The VA has improved since 2014, but challenges remain. We all want veterans to get the care they need and deserve. To achieve that, everyone needs to acknowledge that VA healthcare still needs some major improvements and to commit ourselves to ensuring the necessary reforms are made.

How EPA Administrator Wheeler completely misinterprets science,https://thehill.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/449465-how-epa-administrator-wheeler-completely-misinterprets-science,"In his recent comments to the EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB), EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump EPA finalizes rule to kill Obama climate plan | Trump officials delayed releasing docs on Yellowstone superintendent's firing | Democrats probe oil companies' role in fuel rule rollback Overnight Energy: Trump EPA finalizes rule to kill Obama climate plan | Trump officials delayed releasing docs on Yellowstone superintendent's firing | Democrats probe oil companies' role in fuel rule rollback Trump admin submits final rule to kill Obama Clean Power Plan MORE demonstrated that he is doubly blind. He is blind to the definition of a double-blind study, which he completely misinterpreted, and he is blind to the value of accurate scientific advice.

First, some background: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) depends on double-blind studies for its decisions. But EPA is not FDA, and limitations on the ability of environmental health scientists to do double-blind studies are a major reason.

EPA has proposed a rule, inaccurately calling it a ""transparency rule."" It virtually requires EPA to discard any study for which the raw data is not made publicly available from consideration in agency rulemaking. Transparency, of course, sounds like a good idea as does the ability to replicate studies. But those who support the so-called transparency rule implausibly argue that EPA should align with the FDA’s rules for studies submitted in support of new drugs or medical devices. This is totally misleading.

What do health scientists mean by a double-blind study? Imagine a study in which patients with an existing disease are asked to volunteer for a study — a clinical trial — of a potentially valuable new therapeutic drug and the individual is randomly assigned to the group receiving the placebo or the drug. A single-blind study is usually one in which the patient does not know whether she or he is receiving the new drug or a placebo. But the gold standard is a randomized double-blind study in which neither the patient nor the observing health professional is aware of which group the patient is in until the study is completed and analyzed.

Why won’t this work for almost any environmental health studies? Simply put, would you willingly volunteer to be exposed to a pollutant, not to see what good it does, but what harm it might cause?

Environmental health studies look at what evidence is available, generally studies of populations that have been exposed to pollutants as a result of bad practices or ignorance, to determine the health effects of pollutants on humans. We must depend on the published scientific web of multiple studies done by different authors on different populations using different research approaches.

To study pollutant effects, we take advantage of differences in exposure due to geographical factors, such as a source of a pollutant located in one city but not another; temporal factors such as evaluating communities before and after hydrofracturing for shale gas; or idiosyncratic differences in exposure perhaps related to a pollutant-laden tanker overturning in a community.

FDA drug studies are also different in other ways. Consider the many possible difficulties in measuring actual human exposure under environmental situations as compared to FDA studies in which the dose of a new drug and the health impact of concern is specified in the study design. In addition, FDA studies specify the required number of study subjects through a power calculation based upon relatively rigid determinations of the differences among the subject groups that would be meaningful — something much more subject to argument after environmental health studies are completed.

The likely goal of the transparency rule promoted by Wheeler and his industry supporters is to obtain raw data that can be used by paid industry consultants who then nitpick to find minor blemishes in each study. These blemishes are then falsely magnified into issues that seemingly affect the validity of the study, as occurred with the study of the hazards of exposure to formaldehyde.

So how did Wheeler react to criticism that he is misapplying FDA’s approach to transparency? First, it seems clear that his objective is to marginalize science review. At the long-delayed June 5 meeting of the SAB, Wheeler finally allowed the members to consider the transparency rule long after it was released for public comment. Normally, the SAB provides input before the agency issues a proposed rule for public comment. Wheeler is reshaping the process to turn SAB review into just another public comment, contrary to longstanding EPA practice under multiple Republican and Democratic administrations.

Then Wheeler showed his ignorance by saying “FDA routinely uses the double-blind scientific studies for their work where they have two teams of researchers replicating the same data, both teams don’t know each other exist and where they are.” He added, “that federal research would be more accepted by the public if you used the double-blind standard for everything,” providing a rationale that misstates how research on human exposure to pollution is conducted.

The problem with this mistaken interpretation goes beyond its implications for the proposed EPA rulemaking on transparency. The definition of a “double-blind study” is not insider baseball known only to a few technical experts. It is widely known and used within the scientific community. One can be certain that virtually all of EPA’s scientific staff knowledgeable about health science would be able to correctly define the term. It’s likely Wheeler is too aware of his personal scientific limitations to have made this mistake on his own. He arguably needed someone whom he thought was scientifically knowledgeable to feed him this ludicrous misinformation about double blind studies. This is further evidence that EPA leadership is taking advice from political outsiders, not experienced EPA career scientists. One possible interpretation is that Wheeler is a gullible tool of the industry for whom he was a lobbyist before coming to EPA.

This obvious mistake also highlights the failure of Wheeler and former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittTrump directs agencies to cut advisory boards by 'at least' one-third Trump directs agencies to cut advisory boards by 'at least' one-third Overnight Energy: Former EPA chiefs say Trump has abandoned agency's mission | Trump in Iowa touts ethanol and knocks Biden | Greens sue Trump over drilling safety rollbacks | FDA downplays worries over 'forever chemicals' MORE to successfully recruit a nominee for the position, in which I formerly served, of assistant administrator for Research and Development to be submitted by President Trump Donald John TrumpBooker hits Biden's defense of remarks about segregationist senators: 'He's better than this' Booker hits Biden's defense of remarks about segregationist senators: 'He's better than this' Trump says Democrats are handing out subpoenas 'like they're cookies' MORE for confirmation by the Senate.

NYT reporter flagged Jared Kushner meetings with Russians to FBI,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nyt-reporter-flagged-jared-kushner-meetings-with-russians-to-fbi,"A New York Times reporter fed information about Jared Kushner meeting with Russians to the FBI, newly released emails show.

Journalist Michael Schmidt sent an email on March 24, 2017, to FBI Assistant Director for Public Affairs Michael Kortan, stating that his colleagues were reporting on the FBI's Russia investigation and had stumbled onto some information about President Trump's son-in-law and top adviser.

""Wanted to flag you on something. Three of my colleagues are working on a story about the Russia investigation. They’re told that Jared Kushner is among the individuals who the F.B.I. is scrutinizing for their meetings with Russians,"" Schmidt said. ""My colleagues were told that Ambassador Kislyak, after meeting Kushner and General Flynn in early December at Trump Tower, set up a meeting with Kushner and a Russian banker. Kushner ultimately met with the Russian banker. The banker worked for Alpha Bank. Thanks. Mike.""

Kortan forwarded the email to FBI special agent Peter Strzok, who was leading the bureau's Russia investigation, and Jonathan Moffa, an FBI counterintelligence officer.

The Washington Examiner has reached out to Schmidt for comment.

The email was obtained by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, released in response to a May 21 court order by U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton to the FBI to process 13,000 pages of records. Thursday's release by Judicial Watch, which it claimed to show ""FBI-media collusion,"" also revealed interactions between the FBI and other media outlets, including ProPublica asking for a fact check for an upcoming report.

An email exchange on April 10, 2017, involving Strzok, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, and other bureau officials, appears to be about getting a preview of an upcoming Times report. ""The editing is nearing completion and we have one last shot to hear what the end result is. Do you have time later today or tomorrow that is convenient for a listening session? Likely by phone in Mike’s office,"" said an email that was part of the thread with the subject line ""NYT Last Shot.""

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team focused on two meetings Kushner and his top aide Avi Berkowitz held with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and with Sergey Gorkov, the head of a state-owned Russian development bank VEB.

Mueller's report, released this year, found no evidence that Kushner received Russian funding to cover a troubled New York City real estate loan, a press scandal that dogged the top presidential adviser despite his denials. Mueller's team also was unable to find sufficient evidence of any criminal conspiracy between the Trump team and the Kremlin.

In July 2017, Kushner sent a statement to Congress before he was to testify before the House and Senate intelligence panels that said he had just four meetings with Russian officials during and after the 2016 campaign. Kushner stressed he was never close to the Russians, and insisted there was no improper collusion with Russia in these contacts as Democrats had charged. ""I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,"" Kushner said. ""I had no improper contacts."""
State Dept. says no 'uptick' DR deaths of Americans after a string of fatal incidents,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-state-dept-uptick-deaths-americans-dominican-republic/story?id=63806929,"Despite a string of high-profile deaths this year of Americans from illnesses in the Dominican Republic, the U.S. State Department said Wednesday there has not been an ""uptick"" in fatal incidents of Americans in the Caribbean country.

The State Department confirmed at least nine American tourists have died in the Dominican Republic in roughly the past 12 months, and some of their families say they became gravely ill before they perished.

""We have not seen an uptick in the number of U.S. citizen deaths reported to the Department"" in the Dominican Republic, a State Department spokesperson told ABC News.

The spokesperson said that more than 2.7 million U.S. citizens visit the Dominican Republic each year and, as in most countries, ""the overwhelming majority travel without incident.""

The U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo said last week that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is now helping to probe the deaths of at least three Americans who perished in a five-day span at neighboring hotels in the same resort run by Bahia Principe Hotels & Resorts.

Dominican authorities asked for the FBI's help in conducting toxicology analysis in the investigations stemming from the deaths at the luxury destination, according to officials at the U.S. Embassy.

Nathaniel Holmes, 63, and his fiancée, Cynthia Ann Day, 49, of Maryland were found dead on May 30 in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana Resort in San Pedro de Macoris on the southeast coast of the Dominican Republic.

Autopsies performed in the Dominican Republic determined preliminary causes of death for both Holmes and Day were respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, or water in the lungs.

A lawyer for the families of Day and Holmes said they are awaiting the results of independent autopsies on the couple.

The couple died just five days after Miranda Schaupp-Werner, 41, of Allentown, Pennsylvania, was found dead at the Luxury Bahia Principe Bouganville hotel at the same resort.

An autopsy performed on Schaupp-Werner determined that she also died from respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, according to the Dominican Republic National Police.

The FBI, at the request of Dominican officials, is conducting toxicology analysis to determine how Holmes, Day and Schaupp-Werner died. The results of the analysis have not been completed.

""The safety of U.S. citizens that live in, work in, and visit the Dominican Republic remains our highest priority,"" Robin Bernstein, the U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, said in a statement earlier this month. ""These incidents are tragic and we offer our deepest condolences to those personally impacted.""

According to the U.S. State Department's website, 13 Americans died in the Dominican Republic in 2018, but those deaths were not all from natural causes and included homicides, drownings and vehicle accidents.

Nathaniel Holmes/Facebook

The State Department confirmed this week the Jan. 26 death of Thomas Jerome ""Jerry"" Curran, 78, of Bedford, Ohio, who became ill while staying at a different Dominican Republic resort.

Curran's death brings the total of Americans who died in the Dominican Republic since June 2018 to nine.

Other Americans who perished after coming down with illnesses while in the Dominican Republic were Yvette Monique Sport, 51, of Pennsylvania, in June 2018; David Harrison, 45, of Maryland, in July 2018; Robert Wallace, 67, of California, on April 14; Leyla Cox, 53, of New York, on June 10; and Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, on June 13.

It's unclear if Sport and Harrison's death were included in the U.S. State Department's report of Americans who perished in the Dominican Republic in 2018.

Dominican officials are working to reinforce the island's food and beverage safety standards amid the deaths, following reports that some Americans died after consuming beverages from their hotels and suddenly falling ill.

Dominican Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia said in a statement last week that his agency is working with the National Hotel Association ""to reinforce safety conditions and quality control in food, beverages and any other element that has a positive impact on the satisfaction of those who visit our county as tourists.""

But Garcia cautioned against a rush to judgment.

""While what happened is tragic and regrettable,"" García said, ""it is important for everyone who wishes to disseminate information about the situation to do it in context and with perspective. It is advisable to wait for the official reports before speculating on the causes of death."""
"Waves, Sun, Grill and Food Safety",https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Janice López-Muñoz', 'Bs', 'Msih', 'Public Affairs Specialist', 'Fsis In']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/06/19/waves-sun-grill-and-food-safety,"Posted by Janice López-Muñoz, BS, MSIH, Public Affairs Specialist, FSIS in Health and Safety

Cooking outdoors is challenging, especially during the summer. Be sure to follow these steps to food safety to prepare for the occasion!

The summer months are the perfect excuse to spend time at the beach. The best memories in my childhood are with my family enjoying a day at the beach grilling. My parents organized every detail of the trip but looking back and knowing what I know now about food safety, our beach grilling fun could have easily been spoiled with bacteria that could have made us sick.

There are always challenges when cooking outdoors, but a little bit of preparation can have you basking in the sun, enjoying some well-deserved beach time with the family.

Before Firing Up the Beach - Grill

Make sure local ordinances allow grilling activities. If yes…it’s time to pack!

Only pack the amount of food you will consume to avoid leftovers.

Season your favorite meats, poultry or seafood at home before packing them for the trip. Remember to wash your hands before handling the raw items and in between spice containers when seasoning.

Pack perishable foods directly from the refrigerator or freezer into the cooler.

Be sure to keep raw meat and poultry tightly wrapped and store them at the bottom of the cooler. This will help keep any running juices away from cooked foods or foods meant to be eaten raw (e.g. fruits, veggies, salsas, guacamole or bean salad).

Pack the drinks in a separate cooler so the food cooler is not opened frequently.

A full cooler will maintain its cold temperatures longer than one that is partially filled. If you still have space in your portable cooler, pack it full with more ice.

Don’t forget to bring moist towelettes and the food thermometer!

Keeping Food Safe Ashore

Once you arrive at the beach, partially bury your portable cooler in the sand, cover it with blankets or towels, and shade it under a tree or with a beach umbrella.

Do not open the lid of your cooler containing perishable foods unless necessary. This will keep perishable foods colder for a longer time.

Don't leave any perishables sitting out in the hot sun for more than 2 hours (1 hour when the temperature is above 90 °F).

Start setting up your grill and get it clean before bringing the food out.

Clean your hands before placing any foods on the grill.

Beach - Grill Time

Make sure your grilled items are safe to eat by using a food thermometer and checking to see if they reached the right minimum internal temperatures: Beef, pork, lamb and veal (steaks, roasts and chops): 145°F with a three-minute rest. Fish: 145°F Ground beef, veal, lamb, or pork burgers: 160°F. Poultry (whole or ground): 165°F.

Serve all your delicious food using clean plates and utensils.

Remember: Clean your hands before starting to eat!

If you have a question about food safety for your summer activities, call 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854). Hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, ET. Callers may also listen to food safety messages on various topics, recorded in English and Spanish, 24 hours a day. You can also email or chat via Ask Karen."
"EPA fast tracking chemical reviews amid Trump deregulation push, environmental group reports",https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['James Osborne', 'Washington Energy Correspondent', 'Follow James On', 'Past Articles This Author', 'Alison Cook', 'Chandler Rome', 'Andrea Leinfelder', 'Staff Writer', 'David Barron']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/EPA-fast-tracking-chemical-reviews-amid-Trump-14015893.php,"WASHINGTON - New chemicals coming into the marketplace are getting fast tracked for approval by the EPA, despite bipartisan reforms in 2016 designed to increase scrutiny over chemicals and reduce public health risks, according to a new report by the Environmental Defense Fund.

Researchers at the advocacy group found over the past year the Environmental Protection Agency was approving 80 percent of the new chemicals that came before it, a rate in line with EPA approval rates before Congress passed the reforms in 2016.

“Political appointees at EPA have taken every opportunity to undermine the 2016 [reforms] and elevate the industry’s interests over public health,” said Richard Denison, lead senior scientist at EDF. “The consequences of these mistakes will be felt by generations to come.”

The controversy comes amid a wider deregulatory push by the Trump administration, which has criticized EPA for holding up industrial expansion that could add jobs and boost the U.S. economy.

The shift described by Environmental Defense Fund. comes as a boon to many Houston-area chemical manufacturers, which have already seen restrictions on chemicals including trichloroethylene, an industrial cleaning agent, and methylene chloride, a paint stripper, rolled back under the Trump administration.

On HoustonChronicle.com: In Washington, politics around oil, climate in flux

The American Chemistry Council, a trade group representing chemical companies, described the Environmental Defense Fund’s report as “false” and an attempt to “undermine the implementation of [the reforms] and disparage the dedicated staff at EPA and the chemical industry.”

“The 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) are being effectively and efficiently implemented,” Jon Corley, a spokesman for the trade group, said.

An EPA spokesman said the agency was “ensuring the safety of chemicals in the marketplace, protecting human health and advancing the agency’s core mission.”

But concern is mounting in Congress that the Trump administration is going too far to appease chemical manufacturers.

“At almost every turn, the Trump administration has failed to live up to the letter and spirit of the historic bipartisan reform,” said Senator Tom Udall, D-N.M. “EPA leaders - starting with [Administrator] Andrew Wheeler - must change course, commit themselves to protecting the public, and carry out the [reforms] as Congress wrote it.”

In one instance, staff at EPA recommended restricted use for a chemical used in air and laundry fresheners called jeffamine diacrylamide because it’s in a class of chemicals commonly associated with elevated risk of cancer. But that recommendation was overruled and the chemical approved without the recommended restrictions, Denison said.

“We don’t know who made decision,” he said. “We’re lucky we know the original decision because EPA posted it on its website, but in response to this and other incidents, they stopped doing that,”

So far the company that makes the chemical, International Flavors and Fragrances of New York, has not released products containing jeffamine diacrylamide onto the market, Denison said.

Critics say Interior's top lawyer came 'close to perjury' during Hill testimony,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449176-critics-say-interior-top-lawyer-came-close-to-perjury-during,"A green group is requesting an investigation of the Department of the Interior’s top lawyer, arguing he downplayed his role in the department’s controversial public records review process while testifying in May.

Daniel Jorjani, the principal deputy solicitor at Interior, told senators he did not regularly review documents requested through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) before their release.

But a batch of documents released through a public records request from EarthJustice shows the confusion that stemmed from the policy and how Jorjani was involved in processing the requests.

“He misled Congress and stepped very close to perjury,” said Aaron Weiss, deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities, arguing that Jorjani held back information from lawmakers who inquired about the public record process.

Interior has long been criticized for its policy of allowing political appointees to review FOIA requests about them or their work before being released to reporters and other requesters, including environmental groups.

In addition to his role in the solicitor’s office, Jorjani is also the department’s chief FOIA officer and employees were directed to copy him in their discussions of public records requests.

“It doesn’t pass the smell test to ask him to be sent all these things so he can not look at them,” Weiss said. “There’s clear documentation showing he has been looped in the entire time, so you can't deny that to the Senate in writing -- that’s just lying.”

Jorjani was recently nominated to be the solicitor for Interior, a post that has remained vacant under the Trump administration. Several Democrats have said they will not support his nomination in part because of his lack of response to questions on Interior’s public records policy.

“The Interior Department under President Trump Donald John TrumpBooker hits Biden's defense of remarks about segregationist senators: 'He's better than this' Booker hits Biden's defense of remarks about segregationist senators: 'He's better than this' Trump says Democrats are handing out subpoenas 'like they're cookies' MORE has treated information as a political weapon, regardless of what our laws require or what democracy demands of its leaders,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-A.Z.) chair of the House Natural Resources, said in a statement. “[Interior’s] top lawyer shouldn’t sign off on it.”

Molly Block, a department spokeswoman, said “the process ensures that matters of concern to Department leadership are flagged for awareness. This also allows a FOIA officer to receive contextual information in order to help them better apply the relevant legal standards.”

EarthJustice requested an investigation of Interior’s public records review process from the department's Office of Inspector General (OIG), arguing it imposes barriers and delays in getting information.

Records requested by EarthJustice and included in their complaint to the OIG also answer other questions Jorjani didn’t answer in his testimony to Congress.

Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenOvernight Defense: House passes T spending package with defense funds | Senate set to vote on blocking Saudi arms sales | UN nominee defends climate change record Overnight Defense: House passes T spending package with defense funds | Senate set to vote on blocking Saudi arms sales | UN nominee defends climate change record Grassley announces opposition to key Trump proposal to lower drug prices MORE (D-Ore.) pressed Jorjani to disclose how many times Interior’s record review process caused the department to miss litigation deadlines.

In a written response to Wyden, Jorjani said he could not comment on individual litigation matters.

But a review of documents released to EarthJustice suggests there are at least three instances where Interior did not meet court deadlines because they were waiting for political appointees to review FOIA requests.

In a meeting in late May to discuss Jorjani’s nomination, Senate Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Joe Manchin Joseph (Joe) ManchinCritics say Interior's top lawyer came 'close to perjury' during Hill testimony Critics say Interior's top lawyer came 'close to perjury' during Hill testimony The Hill's 12:30 Report — Presented by MAPRx — Trump takes heat for remarks on help from foreign governments MORE (D-W.V.) said Wyden’s questions “lacked the response it deserved” from Jorjani.

“The solicitor must uphold the law above all else, above party politics and ideology. That was not the sense I got,” about Jorjani, Manchin said at the time.

Beck, the Interior spokeswoman, maintained that Jorjani’s role does not often require reviewing FOIA requests.

“He is responsible for providing direction to a FOIA program of over 140 employees working on a caseload that has increased more than 25 percent during this administration. In this role he does not typically review individual FOIA requests,” she said.

Other emails released from EarthJustice show Interior’s career staff were confused by how to process FOIA requests once political appointees were involved.

“What response is needed for us to release the documents? For example, several people responded by saying, ‘Thanks for sharing,’ or just ‘Thank you.’ Is that enough? Can I presume that we can release the records? Do I need to wait for all the people on the email chain to respond a certain way?” asked Clarice Julka, a FOIA public liaison for Interior wrote in April of 2018. “Right now, I’m holding up releases because I’m not sure what response I need to have before I can release. Should I continue to wait on these releases or should I go ahead?”

Later that month she expressed annoyance at delays and other issues stemming from political appointee review.

“It’s very confusing and I feel that we shouldn’t be responsible to read your or their minds about how to handle this since from the past, it’s been very clear that my office will be blamed for anything deemed to be a mistake,” she said.

Interior policy notes that if political appointees do not respond when notified about a FOIA request, it will be considered a green light to proceed with the request.

Despite that, numerous emails between FOIA staffers and other employees at Interior show employees were often seeking explicit approval before fulfilling FOIA requests.

But one email shows Interior Sec. David Bernhardt was hesitant to put his own approval in writing.

An email from a FOIA officer to Julka references a conversation with a woman listed only as Rachel.

“She met with Bernhardt this morning to discuss an upcoming release for litigation that is supposed to go out this Friday, April 27. She indicated that Bernhardt said it could go out then, but she also indicated he will not be putting this affirmation into writing and that if he said it could go out, we do not need to hear from anyone else. I explained that per my most recent understanding, we all need approvals in writing from both the comms office and himself. Rachel told me that was not going to happen this time,” the email said.

Weiss said such a move lacks transparency.

“It begs the question of what else David Bernhardt doesn’t want to put in writing?” he said."
First on CNN: Controversial political appointee expected to be named Customs and Border Protection press secretary,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/katharine-gorka-customs-and-border-protection/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Katharine Gorka, a political appointee at the Department of Homeland Security who has stirred controversy for her views on terrorism and her role in the department's efforts to combat violent extremism in the US, is expected to be the new press secretary at Customs and Border Protection.

Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders told CNN Tuesday that Gorka is expected to take the position and he advocated for her to join the agency.

The move comes as President Donald Trump continues his rhetoric against undocumented immigrants and the increasing number of migrants crossing the southern border and claiming asylum.

Customs and Border Protection is the agency responsible for policing the US borders and facilitating legal trade and travel. It is also the frontline agency dealing with the surge of migrants at the southern border. If Gorka steps into this new role, she will be taking on the public face of the agency at the center of the President's attention, which has been struggling with capacity and resource issues.

The Department of Homeland Security has also seen a major turnover in senior staff in the wake of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's forced departure in April. Several CBP officials joined Kevin McAleenan at DHS headquarters when he was named acting Homeland Security secretary.

In response to a request for comment on her new post, Gorka told CNN Tuesday, ""I am honored for this opportunity to serve at CBP.""

Gorka is married to Sebastian Gorka, the former deputy assistant to Trump, who was an outspoken and combative defender of the President's national security agenda, known for his dire warnings of Islamic terrorism while writing for Breitbart.

Sebastian Gorka left the White House in August 2017, in the wake of chief White House strategist Steve Bannon's forced departure.

Both Gorkas wrote for Breitbart, where Bannon served as an executive before and after his time at the White House.

In a 2014, Breitbart story, Katharine Gorka, under the name Katie Gorka, wrote that ""Presidents Bush and Obama both publicly declared Islam to be a religion of peace, which has struck a sour chord for many. ""

""To date, American and Western leaders have preemptively shut down any debate within Islam by declaring that Islam is the religion of peace and that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam,"" she wrote

In another 2014 article, she wrote that the Obama administration ""narrowly defined the enemy as only the most violent jihadists: first Al Qaeda and now ISIS.""

""This inaccurate assessment of the enemy has its roots in left-wing theories about social movements,"" she wrote in part.

Gorka has supporters within the administration and department and was recommended by various people for a DHS policy job. ""She was very good at her job and is very intelligent,"" said the senior official about her time at DHS.

Gorka, who has been with the Trump administration since its beginning, was under consideration to lead the new DHS terrorism prevention office, but was not offered the position, according to two sources. An administration official said DHS did not want her past controversies to be a distraction from the work of the department.

While at DHS, she worked in the policy office on what is known as ""countering violent extremism"" issues, according to the official. Countering violent extremism efforts have historically been associated with preventing individuals from radicalizing and joining or carrying out attacks on behalf of Islamic terror groups, but some activity has been focused on thwarting threats from domestic terror movements, like white nationalist extremists.

In August 2017, the Huffington Post reported that Gorka and other aides worked to eliminate a DHS grant for Life After Hate, which would have been used to expand its outreach and intervention services for former white supremacists and others in the ""criminal underground."" Earlier that summer, DHS, under the leadership of then-DHS Secretary John Kelly, cut some organizations out of grant money to counter violent extremism -- including nearly a dozen that the Obama administration considered worthy of receiving the funds.

A DHS official also previously told the Huffington Post that the department, and Gorka, ""has a productive relationship with (Life After Hate) and has recently met and participated in events with its new leadership.""

A DHS spokesperson told CNN, ""Katie has been a valuable member of the DHS team, helping to advance the department's mission of preventing targeted violence and countering terrorism, regardless of ideology. We look forward to her continued service with the department in her new position at CBP as we work to secure the border and enforce our nation's immigration laws.""

In March, the legal watchdog group Democracy Forward sued the department for records detailing Gorka's role as a senior adviser at DHS, after it was unsuccessful with a Freedom of Information Act request.

""The public deserves to know what Katharine Gorka is doing at DHS, but the Trump administration isn't saying,"" said Democracy Forward spokeswoman Charisma Troiano at the time. ""We're suing to find out whether her extreme and biased views are driving Homeland Security resources away from real threats.""

Troiano said that the organization has yet to receive records and the lawsuit is ongoing.

Earlier this year, American Oversight also requested records from the department for Gorka ""to shed light on DHS counterterrorism efforts.""

""Katharine Gorka, an advisor in DHS's policy office has a long history of working with far-right national security groups, and her writings have been described as anti-Muslim in sentiment,"" wrote Executive Director Austin Evers in a letter to DHS in January.

It is unclear if the press secretary role has been finalized or when Gorka will begin at CBP. The agency's last press secretary left in March to join the communications team at the Environmental Protection Agency."

Paul Manafort leaves the federal courthouse in Washington in 2017. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Contributing columnist

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s legal troubles didn’t end when he was convicted on bank and tax fraud charges in 2018. He’s facing state-level mortgage fraud charges, and because his case is going to trial in New York City, he needed to be transferred between penitentiaries. That is a routine matter and regularly results in the defendant’s transfer to a state penitentiary, here Rikers Island.

But in this case, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen intervened, forwarding to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. a letter from Manafort’s attorney suggesting that it would not be safe for Manafort to be held on Rikers Island. The result? Manafort will be housed at a federal penitentiary rather than going to Rikers. Should we really care?

Yes we should. If the decision was motivated by politics — and it is very hard to formulate a plausible alternative explanation — it’s an injustice in itself and an indication of rotten goings-on at the Justice Department.

Consider first the magnitude of the favor that the department provided Manafort. Any prisoner would greatly prefer incarceration in either of the two institutions where Manafort will remain to Rikers’ Island, which is a notorious hellhole. (Why Rikers continues to operate at all in its current state is a subject for another column.) Manafort would surely be kept in isolation for his own protection in Rikers, but the difference in the overall conditions at these facilities is enormous.

Now consider how rare it is that Manafort’s request was granted and the role that Rosen, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, played in facilitating it. It is not simply unusual but unprecedented. I have canvassed colleagues with combined decades of service at the Justice Department, and to a person they aver that they have never heard of a similar situation.

That is not because prisoners don’t ask. It is, in fact, routine to field requests for placement in certain institutions; I did so regularly as a U.S. attorney. The standard-issue response is to let the defendant know that, by law, the decision was for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to make, and that at most, a Justice Department representative could transmit a recommendation.

Finally, consider the reasoning: A spokesman for the Justice Department said the decision was justified by Manafort’s “unique health and safety needs.”

This is bunk of the first order. No doubt Manafort is ill, and no doubt he requires special protection. But are his circumstances unique? Absolutely not. Manafort’s situation is not meaningfully different from dozens of others who are routinely, in fact invariably, resolved many levels below the deputy attorney general and in favor of state incarceration pending state trial.

So we have a one-of-a-kind decision, made at an unprecedented level and justified by fanciful reasoning. Some special factor was obviously at play. It is entirely possible that there were political implications in doing a good deed for Manafort.

It’s not hard to see what those implications might be. Manafort has been the closest thing to a stand-up wise guy in the Trump drama: He managed through squirrelly doublespeak to avoid giving special counsel Robert S. Mueller III the full book on President Trump, and he paid for it in added prison time.

In return, Manafort’s transfer makes it look as though Trump, or Attorney General William P. Barr channeling Trump, is showing him some love with a special favor nobody else ever gets. That’s good for Manafort in the immediate run, and at the same time, it would communicate even more strongly that the way to a pardon is continued noncooperation with federal authorities.

This is all very bad news coming from the Justice Department.

For starters, though we hardly remember this principle because it has been so thoroughly trammeled in the Trump years, it would be a serious breach of protocol if anyone at the White House even communicated with the Justice Department to urge special treatment for Manafort. Any such overture should have been immediately rebuffed.

If that didn’t happen, it would almost be worse because it would mean that the department acted out of subservience to the president’s political goals on its own motion. It is the antithesis of doing justice without fear or favor — rewarding a political ally of the president because he resisted pressure from the Justice Department.

The overall turning of tables could not be more dramatic. Manafort did his best to wriggle out from under the lawful Justice Department investigation of him and the president. Now that same department is acting as his friend, as well as the president’s friend; and friends look out for one another.

That suggests a final lesson from Manafort’s relatively sweet accommodations: Rosen, who was Barr’s handpicked choice, likely comes to the department with a staff that is already integrated with Barr’s. That happens in the case of particularly strong attorneys general. Barr is that, by virtue of his own force of character and his preeminent standing in the Trump universe. As long as Trump is president, Barr enjoys total dominion at the Justice Department. The department’s special treatment of Manafort illustrates why that state of affairs is so worrisome.

Opinion | A New Trump Battleground: Defining Human Rights,https://www.nytimes.com,['Carol Giacomo'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/opinion/editorials/trump-human-rights-natural-law.html,"After the horrors of World War II, the United States led in adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, recognizing the “inherent dignity” and “equal and inalienable rights” of all people to life and liberty. For three-quarters of a century it has stood for the protection of human rights by the rule of law.

Now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is establishing a Commission on Unalienable Rights to “provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” according to a notice in the Federal Register.

Fresh thinking isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But tampering with a legacy built over decades raises serious questions, especially when the State Department’s human rights bureau and Congress have so far been excluded from the process.

One concern is the reference to “natural law,” which is held to be more powerful than the laws people write, and can suggest a narrower, religious sensibility. When the term natural law has been thrown about, it’s often been by people concerned with what they think is unnatural — homosexuality, transgender rights, reproductive choice and sexual equality."
HOWEY: Gauging President Trump’s reelection prospects,https://www.wthr.com,['Brian Howey'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.wthr.com/article/howey-gauging-president-trumps-reelection-prospects,"CHICAGO (Howey Politics) – Psssst, Mr. President, you will not be running against Hillary Clinton in 2020.

This past week, President Trump and Vice President Pence kicked off their reelection campaign in Orlando. While he repeated the premise for another four years - “Promises made, promises kept” - it was also an exercise in grievance, with nary an aspirational echo from those like Presidents Kennedy or Reagan.

“Our political opponents look down with hatred on our values and with utter disdain for the people whose lives they want to run,” Trump said. ""They tried to take away your dignity and your destiny. But we will never let them do that, will we? They tried to erase your vote, erase your legacy of the greatest campaign — probably the greatest election in the history of our country.""

Trump brought up Hillary Clinton’s ""33,000 emails"" as the capacity crowd chimed ""Lock her up!""

Trump won his historic upset in 2016 in part because of his own shrewd strategies and fulsome use of social media. But there were many of his supporters, particularly in Indiana, who loathed Hillary Clinton and voted for the billionaire. But folks, Hillary ain't runnin​' this time. She’s back in Chappaqua.

While the economy is humming, GDP is meeting his prediction of close to 3 percent growth and jobless levels are at 50-year lows, Trump is not reaping the political windfall that most presidents do with such a positive economy. He appears to have survived the Robert Mueller investigation and the American people have little appetite for impeachment.

A Fox News poll released last Sunday showed Joe Biden leading Trump by 49-39 percent, while socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders held nearly the same advantage over the president at 49-40 percent. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg leads Trump 41-40 percent. Polls show the right/wrong tracks are working against Trump, standing at 44/52.7 percent by the Real Clear Politics polling composite as of June 13.

In Indiana, Morning Consult notes that since Trump took office, his net approval has decreased by 19 percent (Trump won Indiana in 2016 with 56.6 percent to Clinton’s 37.5 percent). But he filled Hoosier arenas last year and helped elect Sen. Mike Braun.

With the good economy, most presidents’ approval would be at or north of 50 percent, perhaps approaching the 60th percentile. Trump’s problems are that he often steps on his own messaging. The controversial Mexican and Chinese tariffs have injected widespread anxiety across a significant portion of his base that includes farmers and ranchers, manufacturers, union workers who supported President Obama in 2008, as well as moderates and independents.

The Fox News poll shows 45 percent believe tariffs hurt the U.S., while 33 percent believe they help. Some 52 percent opposed Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on Mexico. And 55 percent oppose building the border wall, Trump’s signature issue that stokes his base but doesn’t grow it. The wall isn’t being built (he rejected a $20 billion plus deal with Democrats last December in return for legalizing Dreamers) and it won’t be paid for by Mexico.

Trump promised “great health care” for everyone, adding, it will be a “lot less expensive.” But he and Republicans don’t even have a plan to replace Obamacare, and expenses continue to skyrocket. On tax reforms, the Fox News Poll revealed 31 percent feel everyone has benefited under Trump’s economic policies, but 48 percent think only “people with more money” have.

Another byproduct of the tax reforms is exploding federal debt (now a lofty $22 trillion) and a federal budget deficit that Fox News reports will rise from $779 billion last year to more than $1 trillion this year. If this is what happens in a good economy, what happens when we go into the inevitable recession?

This comes as the Baby Boom retirement is in full swing, and Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will soon run out of money. Remember Gov. Mitch Daniels warning of the ""red menace?"" Well, it's not in Beijing or Moscow. We'll all get to see it from coast-to-coast and no one in Washington is even talking about it.

As with any reelection sequence, anything and everything can change more than a year out. But Trump faces an unprecedented array of hurdles unlike any other president before him, many of his own making.

Can Trump reverse his electoral scenarios?

Of course. If he were to cut a significant trade deal with China that truly solves many of the long-term issues, Trump would certainly benefit. If the economy keeps humming, historically citizens vote their pocketbooks.

Even among his supporters there is Trump fatigue. The president dominates the news cycles, but his M.O. is chaos and he constantly does shoot-from-the-hip things that keep his staff and supporters scrambling for justification (like the Mexican tariffs).

If Trump were to lose, it might be more of a death-by-a-thousand-cuts scenario than any one big thing or any one opponent.

There is no doubt that in 2016, Donald Trump came up with an incredible plan and pulled off a historic upset that virtually no one saw coming. In view of today’s events and circumstances, a 2020 Trump reelection victory might also belong in that “historic upset” category.

The huge question today is: Despite all of Trump’s unprecedented proclivities, could he find history repeating itself? Or will he be consumed by his own chaos? Time and the American people will tell.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - BP PLC has urged the head of the U.S Environmental Protection Agency to keep working with automakers to improve vehicle fuel efficiency as the Trump administration considers freezing the requirements at 2020 levels, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters.

BP, which has made investments in making cleaner fuels, told EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler that it appreciates the need to balance efficiency with vehicle safety and affordability, the June 13 letter said, adding BP wanted to find a path that “effectively balances these issues and continues the impressive trajectory of efficiency improvements” already seen in engines."
Moving USDA research agencies is part of Trump’s war on science and statistics,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Editorial Board'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/moving-usda-research-agencies-is-part-of-trumps-war-on-science-and-statistics/2019/06/17/51c85328-9134-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html,"IN ITS war on science and statistics, the Trump administration has a habit of sidelining inconvenient information. Last week, it was at it again.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced a decision to relocate two of its research agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, from Washington to the Kansas City region. The Economic Research Service, which investigates the economics of food, farming, natural resources and rural America, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which was established as part of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, play a key role in providing the data essential for honest policy-making.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue initially declared an intention to move these sub-agencies 10 months ago but didn’t specify a location then. The USDA now says the move would put the agencies closer to the agricultural heartland while saving money both for taxpayers and for employees, because Washington is an expensive city. While the rationale may seem plausible , in reality the implications are worrying.

In theory, there’s no reason such agencies couldn’t function well in Kansas City or elsewhere. After all, as with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, this would hardly be the first time a government agency operates from beyond Washington. But the way this operation has been managed, with insufficient warning and explanation, suggests an intention by the administration to encourage qualified analysts to leave government and stifle independent and objective research.

If carried out, the move will disrupt ongoing scientific research and displace several hundred federal employees with valuable experience. Since the abrupt announcement last August, many of the agencies’ top economists and scientists have quit.

The investigations carried out by these agencies have long underpinned decisions by Congress and by American farmers, much as research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underpins decisions in others parts of the economy. And much of the information produced by the Economic Research Service has indeed been inconvenient for the administration, as it has illustrated the ills wrought by President Trump’s trade wars and how small farmers were helped only marginally by the 2017 Republican tax overhaul.

Democratic members of the House and Senate have introduced the Agriculture Research Integrity Act, which would bar the move. They are right to do so, but it would be best if the USDA took the hint and retreated from this abrupt and ill-considered relocation. The better way to get sunnier data would be to develop better policies."
The US Treasury is calling for mandatory financial literacy courses for college students,https://www.cnbc.com,['Shawn M. Carter'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-calls-for-mandatory-financial-education-for-students.html,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury released a new report on behalf of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission that recommends mandatory financial literacy courses for college students.

With the cost of college rising faster than incomes and a staggering 44 million Americans owing more than $1.5 trillion in student loans, there has been growing concern that students and their families are taking on debt without truly understanding the long-term impact.

﻿Indeed, there is a lot of research exploring this national problem: Nine out of 10 parents and students failed a 2018 quiz about student loan debt. Meanwhile, MarketWatch reported that half of college students taking an AIG survey on personal finance basics got two or fewer questions correct. And in a recent survey from the Brookings Institution, less than 30% of student respondents could correctly answer three questions on inflation, interest and risk diversification.

""Helping students and their families avoid the pitfalls associated with financing higher education, and empowering them to make optimal financial choices, should be a priority of all institutions of higher education,"" the report reads. ﻿"
Cook County Homeland Security Command Van Moved Amid Complaints,https://patch.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://patch.com/illinois/evanston/cook-county-homeland-security-command-van-moved-amid-complaints,"EVANSTON, IL — A Cook County command van was moved away from a street festival Saturday in Evanston after the presence of the large Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management vehicle at the Custer Street Fair prompted protests from residents.

The logo for the county emergency management agency, DHSEM, bears some similarity to that of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly called ICE. Some residents complained that instead of increasing the sense of safety among fair attendees, the vehicle needlessly intimidated community members.

In social media posts, Evanston's police and fire departments announced they were working with the city's Office of Emergency Management and the Cook County homeland security department to provide security for the Custer Fair, including the command van and proactive barricades.

""This van is no way affiliated with ICE — Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"" police pointed out.

The mobile command center was subsequently replaced by a city-operated dump truck. Residents said it was relocated to a car dealership parking lot following complaints by neighbors.

Mayor Steve Hagerty responded with a message of support for the van.



""Public safety and being a welcoming city are not mutually exclusive. The City's priority is keeping people safe at the Custer Street Fair, not monitoring people for ICE,"" Hagerty responded on social media. ""I appreciate Cook County providing this Command Center.""



In October 2017, the mayor signed an updated ""Welcoming City Ordinance"" that protects people in the country illegally from being held by federal immigration authorities without a warrant signed by a federal judge. Hagerty has also operated an emergency management consulting company for the past 18 years.

""Should anything go wrong (e.g., weather, man made event, etc.), having a command center nearby is helpful for the emergency response. The Center can also be used proactively to monitor the weather at that specific location. The vehicle is not used in any way as part of immigration enforcement,"" Hagerty said, in an emailed response to concerned residents.

The mayor noted the command center had appeared in Evanston at previous occasions and said city officials would look to give the public the opportunity to check it out during a non-event in the future to see how it helps emergency responders.

""Nonetheless, we understand the size, location, and presence of this vehicle at Custer Street alarmed some people, particularly given the national focus on immigration,"" Hagerty said. ""To address these concerns, show more sensitivity towards our immigrant neighbors, and ensure strong economic activity for our vendors and businesses, in the future we will not use this type of vehicle as a barricade but instead, when we have it, place it nearby in a less public and prominent location.""

Over the past 18 months, the Unified Command Post, or UCP, has been used 41 times for events and festivals across 29 different municipalities in the past 18 months, according to information from county officials provided by Fire Chief Brian Scott. He said the post provides assistance monitoring weather and emergency medical services needs, as well as functioning as a unified emergency management center should something go seriously wrong.

""The mobile unified command center is an $830,000 asset with six on-board computer work stations and state of the art mobile communications suite that helps ensure interoperability. It also includes thermal imaging, a weather monitoring and incident management tools to assist fire and police officers,"" Scott said. Out of respect for some of the concerns raised by residents, he said, it was relocated Sunday to a block north of the fair.

""Given our most recent experience at the 2019 [Custer Street Fair], we will make sure to consider and be sensitive to the concerns raised by the immigrant community and their supporters,"" Scott said. ""Future steps could include pre-education opportunities for the entire Evanston community to see and visit the UCP to learn more about the vehicle as well as strategically placing the vehicle at future events in a less prominent location while still being able to utilize the UCP's full capability.""



(Evanston Fire Department)

Several residents commented in response that people left or did not attend the fair due to the presence of the Cook County vehicle, which could have been mistaken for one operated by federal immigration enforcement authorities.



""I am very disappointed the city decided to bring this command truck without thinking of the [trauma] it is putting our immigrant families through,"" one Evanston resident said. ""We have many resources in Evanston. Our city officials need to think of the decisions it makes if they expect our immigrant community to trust them.""

""My family won't be attending the fair because we feel unwelcome,"" said a Chicago resident. ""This is NOT normal and this is NOT ok. Don't try to normalize it with this lame post. This is totally tone deaf and damaging to the relationship the police force has with the community. Do better.""

Though dozens of commentators were critical of the presence of the vehicle, several people suggested those outraged by its presence were overreacting.



""Does anybody remember Nice France,"" 8th Ward Ald. Ann Rainey asked, a reference to a 2016 vehicular attack on a large outdoor Bastille Day celebration. She said the trailer had been misinterpreted. ""It was used at [Northwestern University's Dillo Day] without comment. Evanston is a wonderful caring City, and I know of no one who lives in fear here. I believe 99% of the population would back me up on that statement.""

""Stop being such a bunch of cry babies and get on with your lives and grow up,"" said a retired Evanston police officer. ""The van not going to hurt you, it's there for your protection. If you don't want to attend, then don't.""

President Donald Trump announced Monday night in a social media post that ICE would ""begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in.""

Housing authorities raise concerns about Trump plan to evict undocumented immigrants,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/regulation/other/449065-housing-authorities-raise-concerns-about-plans-to-evict-undocumented,"Landlords and local housing authorities are pushing back on a Trump administration plan to evict undocumented immigrants from subsidized housing, according to The New York Times.

The proposal from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would ban households with one or more undocumented member from living in such housing, but housing administrators and landlords say it would put the onus of immigration enforcement on them.

Under the proposal, released in April, they would have to evict up to 108,000 people receiving benefits, most of whom, they say, are some of their most reliable tenants when it comes to paying rent on time.

“The housing authority would bear the brunt of the expense of having to completely evict and go through the court action of having to evict these families,” Sylvia Blanco, the chief operating officer at the Housing Authority of the City of Austin, Texas, told the Times.

“We would be on the hook for having to pay for that,” she added.

The plan would also require public housing administrators to verify the immigration status of every resident every year, they told the Times, as well as issue eviction notices and potentially go through court battles with individual families, according to the Times.

In Austin, legal fees and staff expenses would cost about $1,000 per eviction, Blanco told the newspaper.

In Los Angeles, where at least 30 percent of public housing occupants are households that could be caught in the crosshairs of the policy, the enforcement cost would be nearly $10 million.

“You can imagine, if you’re forcing the eviction of nearly one-third of these very large public housing sites, the impact that has on households as well as the broader community,” Doug Guthrie, the president and chief executive of the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, told the Times.

Undocumented immigrants currently live with numerous families receiving housing subsidies, but the assistance is generally pro-rated according to how many members of the family are eligible, according to the Times.

“Most of our members are saying that’s a process that works,” Tim Kaiser, the executive director of the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, told the newspaper.
