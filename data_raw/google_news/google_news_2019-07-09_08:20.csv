"Pelosi calls for Acosta to step down over Epstein plea deal, hits Trump",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Edmund Demarche', 'Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-calls-for-acosta-to-step-down-over-epstein-plea-deal-hits-trump,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi late Monday called on Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta to step down for what she called an “unconscionable agreement” with Jeffrey Epstein, who was charged earlier with sex trafficking in New York City federal court.

Acosta, who was a U.S. attorney in Miami back in 2008, helped Epstein secure a plea deal that resulted in an 18-month sentence. He served 13 months. The deal was criticized as lenient because he could have faced a life sentence.

Pelosi said in a tweet late Monday that Acosta’s agreement with Epstein was kept from his “young victims” and prevented them from seeking justice. She said Trump was aware of the background when Acosta was appointed.

Acosta negotiated a deal that resulted in two state solicitation charges—a felony—and resulted in county jail. There were no federal charges. The Washington Post reported that Epstein was allowed to work from his office six days a week. The alleged victims were not told about the deal, the report said.

The Miami Herald called the allegations back then “stomach-turning.” They included allegations that the wealthy financier lured dozens of troubled girls to an estate in Palm Beach and had sex with them. The paper’s editorial called the allegations a “Ponzi scheme,” because he would allegedly use new girls to recruit more.

BILL CLINTON KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT EPSTEIN'S 'TERRIBLE CRIMES,' EX-SPOKESMAN SAYS

The Herald’s editorial said that in 2008, Acosta kept the alleged victims out of the process and failed to ""even inform them of his lenient plea deal with Epstein. In February, U.S. Judge Kenneth Marra ruled that Acosta’s office broke the law by not telling Epstein’s victims of the sweetheart deal. In contrast, [U.S. Attorney Geoffrey] Berman, has issued a public call for women to contact his office to help him build his sex-trafficking case against Epstein.”

Acosta has defended the plea deal as appropriate under the circumstances, though the White House said in February that it was “looking into” his handling of the deal.

Epstein, the 66-year-old hedge fund manager, was charged in a newly unsealed federal indictment with sex trafficking and conspiracy during the early 2000s. He could get up to 45 years in prison if convicted. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, who was arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., told Fox News that Epstein’s initial sentence was “absurd” and said it is not a time ""for people to say, ‘oh, is a Republican or Democrat going to be implicated?’ Every American should stand on the side of those little girls.""

Senate Republicans' 2020 nightmare scenario just got more likely,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/08/politics/kris-kobach-roy-moore-senate-2020/index.html,"(CNN) Of the 22 seats Senate Republicans have to defend in 2020, only two -- Colorado and Maine -- voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Which means that if Republicans win only the seats they hold in the states President Donald Trump carried in the last presidential race, they hold their Senate majority. (Democrats need to net three Senate seats if they win the White House and four if they don't in order to retake control of the chamber following 2020.) That prospect seems entirely doable -- especially when you consider that one of the 12 seats Democrats have to defend next November is in Alabama, where Trump won by 27 points in 2016.

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

Right? Hello?

Meet Kris Kobach and Roy Moore.

Both men are running for the Senate as Republicans -- Kobach in Kansas, a candidacy he made official on Monday , and Moore in Alabama. And both men, if they wind up as the Republican nominees in their respective states, have a very real chance of losing a general election to a Democrats -- despite the heavily Republican nature of both states.

Which would be a stunning blow to Senate Republicans' majority math and would amount to the ultimate cutting-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face move for a party which has proven to be skilled at self-sabotage -- especially in the Senate in recent elections. And while neither Kobach nor Moore starts their races as prohibitive favorites, it's not all that hard to see one or both of them winding up as the nominee.

Start with Kobach. A controversial former state party chair and secretary of state in Kansas, Kobach returned from a short stint as the chair of President Trump's ill-fated election fraud commission to run for governor in 2018. He narrowly edged appointed Gov. Jeff Colyer in the Republican primary and went on to lose the general election to Democrat Laura Kelly -- the first GOPer to lose a statewide race in the Sunflower State in nearly a decade.

Now, Kobach is back -- seeing an opportunity created by the retirement of longtime Sen. Pat Roberts in 2020. Due to his name ID statewide and his past support from Trump -- ""if he loses, I'll bring him into my administration in two seconds,"" the President said of Kobach in October 2018 -- Kobach is a force to be reckoned with in the still-forming GOP primary. Which, many Republicans worry, could put a Senate seat in jeopardy in a state where Democrats haven't won a Senate race since 1932(!)

""L-O-S-E-R,"" David Kensinger, campaign manager for Roberts and former Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, said in a text message to CNN when asked about Kobach's candidacy, a swipe at a spelling error on Kobach's filing forms.

""Kansas Republicans deserve a nominee who can win,"" said the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, in a statement.

The situation is equally nightmarish for Senate Republicans with Moore in Alabama. Moore is a two-time chief justice of the state Supreme Court (he was removed from the office both times) who lost a seemingly can't-lose 2017 special election for the seat of former Sen. Jeff Sessions (R). Moore fell to Democrat Doug Jones in that contest amid allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against Moore, who several women said pursued relationships with them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. (Moore denied all allegations and brought a lawsuit against three of the women; it remains in the legal system.)

That 2017 race is instructive -- and not just because Moore lost. It's actually his victory -- over then-appointed Sen. Luther Strange in the 2017 primary -- that has to really worry Republicans looking to preserve their Senate majority. In that special election primary, everyone from Trump to McConnell endorsed Strange -- warning that nominating the controversial Moore could jeopardize Republican chances of holding the seat in the general election.

Didn't matter. And in fact, there's a case to be made that the establishment lining up behind Strange made Moore's point for him -- that he and his supporters were a David, challenging the big, bad political Goliath.

Which brings us back to the 2020 map. And Moore. And Kobach.

As I said above, neither should be considered the favorite in their respective races. But neither can they be dismissed. Both have active followings among the most conservative elements of the GOP. And in a fractured primary -- which is already developing in Alabama and could happen in Kansas -- their blocs of support might just be enough to win them the nominations. Which is a cataclysmic situation for the likes of McConnell.

Now, none of this may come to pass. Kobach and Moore might well flame out. They might watch the establishment effectively coalesce to keep them from winning. But the very fact they are both now in and running is bad news for Senate Republicans. Very bad news."
"Trump Lied to the Supreme Court, and Four Justices Don’t Care",https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Adam Serwer', 'Staff Writer At']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/trumps-census-case-confession/593488/,"Then Donald Trump himself confirmed that the “conspiracy theory” put forth by groups challenging the legality of the citizenship question was true.

“Number one, you need it for Congress for districting, you need it for appropriations, where are the funds going, how many people are there, are they citizens or not citizens?” Trump told reporters on Friday, explaining why the administration was reversing its original decision to abandon the citizenship question. That statement not only confirms that the majority in the census case was correct, it proves that the dissenters were defending a lie, while accusing their opponents of bad faith. Ironically, this sort of behavior is all too typical of Trump backers like Thomas.

This is a constant risk for Trumpists—that they will commit to vigorous defenses of Trumpian falsehoods, only to be made fools when the president abandons the deception or changes his mind, when it becomes politically convenient. Fortunately for them, the cult of personality surrounding the president is immune to the shame of forcefully defending things its members know not to be true. Unfortunately for the rest of us, that cult of personality now includes members of the Supreme Court, willing to give their implicit blessing to schemes designed to entrench white voting power, in defiance of the Constitution’s guarantees of equal protection regardless of race. Republican elites have concluded that restricting the electorate is a more reliable path to power than appealing to minority voters, and are now committed to the course of rigging elections so that they can maintain dominance even when they fail to win a majority of the votes.

For those keeping score at home, The Washington Post has documented at least 10 instances of the Trump administration contradicting its own statements on the citizenship question. When the Trump administration told Congress and the public that the citizenship question on the census was needed to enforce the Voting Rights Act, that was a lie. When the Trump administration denied that its intent was to use the data to draw congressional districts that would enhance white voting power and therefore grant Republicans an advantage, that was false. When Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Congress the data would not be used for immigration enforcement, that was untrue. Francisco told the Court that the census questionnaire had to be finalized by June; the Department of Justice has now reversed that position.

Ideally, the executive branch lying to the public and the other branches of government would hold certain consequences. But Democrats in Congress are too frightened and weak to properly discharge their oversight duties, and at least four justices on the Supreme Court believe that the law should bend to whatever falsehood Trump decides to embrace. Only Chief Justice John Roberts’s pained conclusion—that under administrative law, the Commerce Department could not justify its census decision based on public falsehoods—prevented the Trump administration’s dishonesty from being rewarded."
Trump seizes on cables scandal to jam UK,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/politics/us-britain-ambassador-memos-diplomacy/index.html,"(CNN) Only a month after basking in the pageantry and lavish hospitality that only Queen Elizabeth II can lay on, President Donald Trump is back to telling Britain who is boss.

With a devastating pair of tweets on Monday that all but declared Ambassador Sir Kim Darroch persona-non-grata, the President did more than simply feed a personal grudge. He turned Britain's extreme discomfort into political leverage over America's best friend.

By making it clear he would prefer an envoy more sympathetic to his worldview, Trump is effectively trying to make it more difficult for another country to get accurate diplomatic reporting and internal intelligence on an administration that has alarmed many foreign allies -- not just Britain.

Trump could have turned the other cheek and sought the high ground amid the rumpus over the UK ambassador's unsparing memos about his character and dysfunctional White House.

That is not the President's way.

Where other US leaders might have chosen a less contentious route, Trump seeks to escalate, indulging his ruthless sense of another party's weakness.

In lashing out at the British government and its envoy, Trump showed familiar traits — he's thin skinned and reacts poorly to public criticism -- even when it c omes from a country and a government he's often rebuked himself . And he rarely lets pass a chance for revenge.

I have been very critical about the way the U.K. and Prime Minister Theresa May handled Brexit. What a mess she and her representatives have created. I told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way. I do not know the Ambassador, but he is not liked or well.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 8, 2019

Trump's tweets sent a mutli-pronged message to London that its ambassador, a career diplomat who was Monday branded an anti-Trump globalist by his foes back home, is no longer welcome in the White House.

Trump's tweet dealt a likely fatal blow to Darroch's strenuous efforts over two years to manage the almost-impossible task of forging stable ties with Trump's tumultuous White House.

In a sign that he is now out in the cold, the ambassador, who had contacts throughout the administration, was dis-invited from a dinner with Trump, the Emir of Qatar and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday night.

Trump also took what may be a final swipe at outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May, accusing her of making a ""mess"" of Britain's exit from the European Union -- a body Trump disdains.

And he made clear that the ""special relationship"" under her successor who will take over in a couple of weeks will be on his terms, a sentiment that could have enormous political and diplomatic implications in London and beyond.

""The good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new Prime Minister,"" Trump tweeted.

'This is a relationship that is bigger than this situation'

The President's intervention makes the next British prime minister -- expected to be former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson -- effectively a supplicant to the US President.

His first order of business will be to repair Britain's most important diplomatic relationship. It's difficult to see how that might be accomplished without effectively appointing a new ambassador to Washington whom Trump finds favorable.

Britain will become increasingly beholden to the United States if it finally leaves the European Union since it will need a new free trade deal with Washington. By establishing fresh leverage over the UK, Trump improved his position ahead of a negotiation in which both sides expect him to drive a hard bargain.

The Trump administration also wants to peel the UK off from its European partners and hopes it will join its effort to punish Iran. Britain still supports the Iran nuclear deal that Trump exited and has come under pressure from top US officials.

Trump's state visit to London last month -- masterminded by Darroch -- was seen as Britain's best chance to deploy its own leverage to win over the President.

But if anyone thought that the warmth of his Buckingham Palace welcome in a successful state visit last month would cause Trump to give Britain a pass when it needed it, they were wrong.

Ironically, Darroch had predicted as much in one of a flurry of dispatches dating back two years that were handed to the ""Mail on Sunday"" by an unknown leaker.

""We might be flavor of the month, but this is still the land of 'America First,'"" wrote Darroch, who in other memos described Trump as ""inept"" and his administration as mired in chaos.

British diplomats spent the weekend trying to contain the damage from the Mail's scoop that rocked US-UK relations.

Given the decades of friendship forged in war between Washington and London, it's likely that the current tensions will eventually be seen as just a wrinkle in a long relationship.

""Nobody is in a great position here,"" former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told CNN's Erin Burnett on Monday, noting that Trump felt insulted and Britain embarrassed by the leak.

He added: ""I would hope that we all recognize that this is a relationship that is bigger than this situation"" and ""any one personality.""

Search for the leaker

Back in London, May's government repeatedly said it stood by Darroch and decried the motives of the unidentified leaker.

Different theories are being floated about the motivation of the leaker. Possibly, he or she was an official sympathetic to anti-European, pro-Trump factions in the Conservative Party who want Darroch gone to insert a new ambassador more ideologically in tune with Trump.

Perhaps someone from the next government wanted to send a sign to Trump that the days of traditional UK diplomats favorably disposed to the EU and the international establishment are numbered. In Tuesday's ""The Sun"" newspaper, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt -- Darroch's boss and Johnson's last remaining rival in the leadership race -- said officials would consider whether a hostile foreign power keen to disrupt relations between the US and Britain was behind the leak.

Trump's friend, Nigel Farage, the anti-Europe Brexit Party leader who Trump has said would be a great ambassador in Washington, sought his own political leverage.

He blasted the current UK ambassador to Washington on his LBC Radio show as a ""globalist,"" adding ""Kim Darroch is anti-Trump.""

The British government was left in a vulnerable position after Trump barred the doors for Darroch.

After all, the ambassador was only doing his job -- providing blunt assessments of a foreign government to his superiors back home. If Trump can force Darroch home, he would send a message to any foreign government keen to exploit Britain's willingness to bend to the will of a host nation.

And by replacing Darroch, the British government would be playing right into the hands of a leaker, who must have left British diplomats abroad uncertain whether their critical memos about foreign leaders will end up in the newspapers.

May's office released a statement expressing May's ""full support"" for Darroch.

""We have made clear to the US how unfortunate this leak is. The selective extracts leaked do not reflect the closeness of, and the esteem in which we hold, the relationship,"" a spokesman said.

""At the same time we have also underlined the importance of Ambassadors being able to provide honest, unvarnished assessments of the politics in their country.""

So in the short term at least, Britain probably cannot afford to withdraw Darroch because of the precedent it would establish at home and to its envoys around the world.

Darroch was expected to leave by early next year anyway. It would not be a surprise if the new British Prime Minister finds a way to quietly finesse his departure before then."
"Bill Clinton 'knows nothing' about financier Jeffrey Epstein's 'terrible crimes,' former president's spokesman says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-clinton-knows-nothing-about-financier-jeffrey-epsteins-terrible-crimes-former-presidents-spokesman-says,"Bill Clinton ""knows nothing"" about the ""terrible crimes"" linked to Jeffrey Epstein, the former president's spokesman said Monday, in Clinton's first statement after new sex-trafficking charges were lobbed against the wealthy financier.

An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old wealthy hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

""In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein’s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,"" the statement said. ""Staff, supporters of the foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein’s New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He’s not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and he has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.”

Separately, claims in court showed that President Trump may have flown on the jet at least once, as well.

CUSHY PLEA BARGAIN WITH EPSTEIN WAS SO BAD IT BROKE THE LAW, JUDGE RULES

Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Barr said he has recused himself from the matter ""because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time.""

On Saturday evening, Christine Pelosi, a Democratic National Committee official and daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, warned conspicuously that it is ""quite likely that some of our faves are implicated"" in the ""horrific"" sex-trafficking case.

""This Epstein case is horrific and the young women deserve justice,"" Pelosi tweeted. ""It is quite likely that some of our faves are implicated but we must follow the facts and let the chips fall where they may - whether on Republicans or Democrats.""

For his part, Trump previously called attention to Clinton's dealings with the financier.

""Nice guy -- uh, got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island, with Jeffrey Epstein,"" Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in 2015, referring to Clinton's connections with Epstein. ""A lot of problems.""

Meanwhile, Trump biographer Tim O'Brien this weekend reposted an excerpt fom a 2002 profile of Epstein in New York Magazine, in which Trump told a reporter, ""I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""

Trump banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago estate “because Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,” according to court documents filed by Bradley Edwards, the lawyer who has represented several Epstein accusers. That claim has not been confirmed by Trump or Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein appeared Monday in a hearing that lasted about 30 minutes wearing a blue prison top with a brown T-shirt underneath, in addition to orange slip-on sneakers. Prosecutors said in the 36 hours since Epstein's arrest, multiple attorneys and several individuals have come forward and said they were victims, none of whom had previously been spoken to.

FORMER FBI OFFICIAL: INDICTMENT OF JEFFREY EPSTEIN IS 'PLACEHOLDER,' EXPECT DOZENS MORE CHARGES IN NEAR FUTURE

Epstein allegedly created and maintained a ""vast network"" and operation from 2002 ""up to and including"" at least 2005 that enabled him to ""sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls"" in addition to paying victims to recruit other underage girls.

""This allowed Epstein to create an ever-expanding web of new victims,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a news conference.

Berman added that nude photographs ""of what appeared to be underage girls"" were discovered at Epstein's Manhattan mansion during a search following his arrest Saturday. The hundreds of photos were discovered in a locked safe, according to officials.

Prosecutors also allege Epstein ""worked and conspired with others, including employees and associates"" who helped facilitate his conduct by contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 66-year-old at his mansion in New York City and Palm, Beach, Fla.

At Epstein's multi-story mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, prosecutors said that victims would be escorted to a room with a massage table where they would perform a massage on him.

""The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, were told by Epstein or other individuals to partially or fully undress before beginning the 'massage,'"" prosecutors wrote. ""During the encounter, Epstein would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's genitals.""

In Monday's court appearance, prosecutors said that the massage room in New York was set up exactly as how the alleged victims described it 15 years ago.

CHRISTINE PELOSI WARNS IT'S 'QUITE LIKELY THAT SOME OF OUR FAVES ARE IMPLICATED' IN 'HORRIFIC' EPSTEIN CASE

Victims would be paid hundreds of dollars in cash by either Epstein or one of his associates or employees, according to prosecutors. The 66-year-old also allegedly ""incentivized his victims"" to become recruiters by paying the victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each girl brought to him.

""In so doing, Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit,"" federal prosecutors said.

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said that Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey at 5 p.m. on Saturday ""without incident."" Epstein is now being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail near the Manhattan courthouse where he appeared Monday afternoon.

Plaintiffs seek to block Justice Department from changing lawyers in census citizenship case,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team"", 'Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department', 'July At Pm']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/plaintiffs-seek-to-block-justice-department-from-changing-lawyers-in-census-citizenship-case/2019/07/08/307182d6-a1e6-11e9-b732-41a79c2551bf_story.html,"Demonstrators gather at the Supreme Court last month. The court ruled the Trump administration had provided a “contrived” reason for wanting a citizenship question on the 2020 Census. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)

The legal battle over the Trump administration’s efforts to put a citizenship question on the 2020 Census further escalated on Monday as the plaintiffs argued that Justice Department attorneys should not be allowed to withdraw from the case because they have not given “satisfactory reasons” for seeking to do so.

The Trump administration has not demonstrated that the withdrawals “will not cause further disruption, particularly in light of the history of this case and the well-documented need for expeditious resolution,” attorneys for those challenging the citizenship question said in a court filing in New York.

The filing comes in response to a request from the Justice Department attorneys on the case to withdraw.

The department had telegraphed the move a day earlier — saying it was replacing the team of career and political employees who had been handling the matter. A person familiar with the matter previously told The Washington Post that at least some of the career attorneys were frustrated with the handling of the case after President Trump ordered the department to explore more options for adding the citizenship question to the 2020 Census after the lawyers, seeing no other possibilities, had conceded defeat.

In asking to withdraw the attorneys from the case, the department argued that it did not expect the move would cause a “disruption.” But those suing said the department should articulate more clear reasons for the attorneys’ attempted withdrawal, arguing that government lawyers had previously made “rapidly shifting representations” to the court.

They also requested the judge “require any attorneys whose representations or conduct is at issue in the pending or forthcoming motions to attend any hearings on these motions or otherwise remain available to the Court and the parties to ensure the full and fair disposition of the pending motions.”

If the judge inquires further, the matter could cause more heartburn for the Justice Department as it is forced to detail in court more of its internal business.

Challengers in the case include Democratic-led states and civil rights and immigrant rights organizations. They have argued that the citizenship question would result in an undercount of millions of people who fear acknowledging that a noncitizen is part of their household.

In a ruling late last month, the Supreme Court blocked the Trump administration’s plan, saying the government had provided a “contrived” reason for wanting the citizenship information.

The Justice and Commerce departments then effectively conceded defeat — but Trump soon ordered the lawyers to do an about-face and come up with ways to keep the fight alive.

On Monday, Attorney General William P. Barr told reporters in South Carolina that he has been in “constant discussions” with Trump ever since the ruling and that the administration is “considering all the options.” He sounded optimistic about the chances that the citizenship question will appear on the 2020 Census, although he declined to provide details of the administration’s next steps.

“I think over the next day or two, you’ll see what approach we’re taking, and I think it does provide a pathway for getting the question on the census,” Barr said.

In an interview with the New York Times, Barr maintained that Trump was “right on the legal grounds” and said he “can understand” if the original Justice Department lawyers are “interested in not participating in this phase.”

Mike Pompeo unveils panel to examine 'unalienable rights',https://www.politico.com,['Caitlin Oprysko'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/08/pompeo-panel-unalienable-rights-1400023,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announces the formation of the Commission on Unalienable Rights during a news conference at the Department of State on Monday. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Foreign Policy Mike Pompeo unveils panel to examine 'unalienable rights'

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday unveiled a new Commission on Unalienable Rights, a panel he said is aimed at providing him with “an informed review of the role of human rights in American foreign policy.”

The panel will be headed up by Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard law professor and former ambassador to the Vatican under George W. Bush. Glendon is also a social conservative who has been a prominent anti-abortion voice, which could lend credence to the concerns among human rights activists that the commission is a ploy to undercut LGBTQ and women’s rights under the guise of religious liberty.

Story Continued Below

In remarks at the State Department on Monday, Pompeo noted that “words like ‘rights’ can be used by good or evil,” decrying how some have “hijacked” human rights rhetoric to be used for “dubious or malignant purposes.”

Glendon, in brief comments, echoed that, telling reporters that ""basic human rights are misunderstood by many, manipulated by many, and ignored by the world’s worst human rights violators.""

“Every once in a while we need to step back, and reflect seriously on where we are, where we’ve been and whether we’re headed in the right direction,” Pompeo said. He hailed former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt’s 1948 Declaration on Universal Human Rights as one of the foundational documents for the commission’s work, but noted that the panel would serve as advisers as opposed to policymakers.

While Pompeo was vague in laying out what exactly the panel will do, emphasizing its focus on “principles” over “policy,” he praised its members as those he hoped would facilitate ""one of the most profound reexaminations of the unalienable rights in the world since the 1948 universal declaration.""

The commission will be made up of 10 members who represent a range of religious backgrounds. Many are religious scholars, with at least one other joining Glendon in having been appointed to represent the Vatican on social issues in the past. One, Hamza Yusuf, is one of the founders of the first Muslim liberal arts college in America. Another, Christopher Tollefsen, specializes in moral philosophy, natural law ethics, practical ethics and bioethics.

Pompeo indicated that the panel could also be used in part to rein in overzealous invocations of human rights, suggesting the group “revisit the most basic of questions: What does it mean to say or claim that something is in fact a human right?”

“How do we know — or how do we determine — whether that claim ... is it true and therefore ought it to be honored? How can there be human rights rights we possess, not as privileges we are granted or even earn, but simply by virtue of our humanity belong to us?” he asked. “Is it in fact true, as our Declaration of Independence asserts, that as human beings we — all of us, every member of our human family — are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights?”

In an op-ed published Monday morning in the Wall Street Journal, the secretary expressed hope that the group would “reorient” institutions like the UN “back to their original missions.”

“Many have embraced and even accelerated the proliferation of rights claims—and all but abandoned serious efforts to protect fundamental freedoms,” he wrote, complaining that “human-rights advocacy has lost its bearings and become more of an industry than a moral compass.”

Reactions to the new panel were split on Monday. In a statement cheering Pompeo‘s formation of the commission, Tony Perkins, head of the conservative Christian group Family Research Council, said that the panel would be useful in light of governments like Cuba, China and Iran who the group said ""have wormed their way onto 'human rights commissions' in their search for international legitimacy.""

""Other special interest groups have sought to expand the definition of a 'human right' to include virtually anything. If everything is a human right then the term begins to have little meaning,"" he said.

In addition, Perkins added, the commission would further promote religious liberty abroad, which he hailed as the ""foundation for all other human rights.""

Amnesty International, meanwhile, accused Pompeo of using the panel to politicize human rights and pointed to the Trump administration’s rollback of rights for LGBTQ citizens.

""If this administration truly wanted to support people's rights, it would use the global framework that's already in place. Instead, it wants to undermine rights for individuals, as well as the responsibilities of governments,"" said Joanne Lin, the group’s national director of advocacy and government affairs. ""This approach only encourages other countries to adopt a disregard for basic human rights standards and risks weakening international, as well as regional frameworks, placing the rights of millions of people around the world in jeopardy.""

And at least one religious group said it was viewing the commission’s formation with skepticism. Rori Kramer, director of government affairs for the American Jewish World Service, criticized Pompeo for employing what she called a “narrow view of religion as a means to undermine the ecumenical belief of respecting the dignity of every person.”

Kramer argued that Pompeo “clearly illustrated” the panel “will be used to question the very notion that basic human rights are inherent in all individuals.”

A pair of congressional Democrats also ripped the commission.

House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel said in a statement Monday that the new panel amounted to an end-run around established structures within the department, and touted an amendment in a House spending bill passed last month that would block funding for ""this bizarre effort.""

He claimed that the group Pompeo had selected would ""give preference to discriminatory ideologies that would narrow protections for women, including on reproductive rights; for members of the LGBTQI community; and for other minority groups,"" and he hit the secretary for providing little information regarding plans for the commission.

And Sen. Bob Menendez, the top ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, called Pompeo's claims that human rights had been manipulated ""absurd"" and asserted the new commission would only weaken human rights.

""President Trump’s personal affection for gross human rights violators has stained America’s moral fabric,"" he said, pointing to the president's praise for leaders such as North Korea's Kim Jong Un and the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte. ""No Trump Administration commission can erase that.""

Obama-era DHS secretary hits 2020 Dem candidates for 'extreme' and 'unworkable' immigration ideas,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-era-dhs-secretary-hits-2020-dem-candidates-for-extreme-and-unworkable-immigration-ideas,"Jeh Johnson, who served as former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security secretary, called out Democratic presidential candidates for embracing ""extreme"" policies on immigration, like rejecting the deportation of those here illegally and decriminalizing illegal border crossings.

""We cannot, as some Democratic candidates for president now propose, publicly embrace a policy not to deport those who enter or remain in this country illegally unless they commit a crime. This is tantamount to a public declaration (repeated and amplified by smugglers in Central America) that our borders are effectively open to all; this will increase the recent levels of monthly apprehensions at our southern border -- about or more than 100,000 -- by multiples,"" Johnson wrote in a Washington Post column.

""For the same reason, we cannot formally decriminalize unauthorized entry into this country, though first-time illegal border crossers are, in fact, rarely prosecuted for that misdemeanor (except for last year's disastrous ""zero-tolerance"" policy).""

TLAIB TO PELOSI: 'FOCUS' ON MCCONNELL INSTEAD OF BASHING PROGRESSIVES

Johnson, who served under Obama from 2013 to 2017, wrote that Americans deserve ""straight talk"" on the issue of illegal immigration, touting the previous administration's handling of the problem. He said the Obama administration ramped up assistance to Central American countries and prioritized the deportation of felons.

Johnson defended House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against far-left critics who claimed she was defeated by Republicans after the House passed a more moderate bill to deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border.

""Give her a break. Those who govern in a democracy know that progress requires compromise, and the speaker made the obvious calculation that it was more important to deliver prompt help to those facing inhumane conditions on the border than it was to delay and hold out for everything House Democrats wanted,"" he wrote, pointing to an overall ""alarming trend"" on both sides of the aisle.

""To win support from a vocal and committed segment of a major party's base -- and simply for the sake of a good applause line -- candidates for office now espouse extreme policy proposals that are unworkable and have no hope of winning the broad support of Congress and the people they represent,"" he argued, adding those who put forth policies that have no chance of becoming law are ""doing a disservice to our democracy.""

""Here is a radical proposal: a presidential candidate who is willing to educate, enlighten and tell voters the hard truths. This trait has all but evaporated in U.S. politics, but it is the single best job qualification for those who aspire to lead. I'm a Democrat, and whoever among the current Democratic field of candidates demonstrates this profile in courage will earn my vote,"" he concluded.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired back Saturday night after Pelosi criticized her and other far-left freshmen congresswomen for voting against a $4.6 billion border bill that President Trump signed into law on Monday.

“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”

Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Democrats who decided to vote along with Republicans on the spending plan to address issues at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I don’t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It’s a huge mistake,” she wrote. “This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People’s lives are getting bargained & for what?”"
The next big question about Jeffrey Epstein,https://www.cnn.com,['Elie Honig'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/08/opinions/epstein-trafficking-molesting-sdny-indictment-honig/index.html,"In this weekly column ""Cross-exam,"" Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, gives his take on the latest legal news and answers questions from readers. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on ""CNN Newsroom"" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays.

(CNN) Jeffrey Epstein dodged justice the first time he faced criminal charges for trafficking and molesting children, exploiting a combination of wealth, influence, vile attack-the-victim tactics and an incompetent prosecutor, then-US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and current US Department of Labor Secretary Alex Acosta . This time , however, Epstein is likely cooked. He faces charges likely to keep him behind bars for the rest of his life. The famously aggressive and independent Southern District of New York (where I worked for eight-plus years) has indicted him on charges of running a sex trafficking ring in which he allegedly sexually abused dozens of girls. Neither SDNY nor a public spotlight will permit a hush-hush sweetheart deal like Epstein got in Florida. The big question is, as the SDNY takes down Epstein, who else will go with him?

When he first faced sex trafficking charges in Florida in 2007, Epstein skated. His powerhouse team of attorneys somehow worked with Acosta to craft an agreement that was staggeringly unjust. Epstein faced decades behind bars but Acosta let him go with a plea to two minor state-level charges (for which he was sentenced to 13 months behind bars but served most of it on work release). The deal also inexplicably immunized Epstein's co-conspirators. In 14-plus years as a prosecutor, I've never even heard of the concept of giving a free pass to a defendant's co-conspirators. Worse, as a federal judge ruled recently , Acosta violated the rights of Epstein's victims by entering into the sweetheart plea deal without notifying them first, as the law requires.

The New York indictment was unsealed Monday and details allegations that between 2002 and 2005, Epstein ran a trafficking outfit in which he paid hundreds of dollars to girls as young as 14 to have sex with him at his homes in New York and Florida and worked with employees and associates who would lure these girls there and paid some of them to recruit others for similar abuse. CNN has reached out to Epstein's lawyer for comment. In a press release, the US Attorney's office said , ""Epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit, often on a daily basis.""

Things now look bleak for Epstein. Simply being charged by the SDNY is, in itself, a defendant's nightmare. According to Justice Department data, the conviction rate on federal charges is typically over 90%, and the conviction rate i n federal human trafficking cases is even a tick higher than that. Much of the case likely will center on testimony from Epstein's victims. While Epstein's attorneys in Florida cowed Acosta in part through a vicious campaign to attack the victims , the SDNY needs to stand firm. I've done sex trafficking cases, including a trial based largely on the testimony of victims. In my experience, victims typically have no reason to lie, and juries can and will believe victims, particularly if their voices are supported by other evidence. Knowing the SDNY, they've likely got other corroborating evidence -- perhaps phone records, financial documents, e-mails or texts or travel records -- to back up the victims.

Epstein has three choices now. First, he can go to trial; the vast majority of defendants who go to trial in federal court get convicted, which almost certainly would send the 66 year-old Epstein to jail for the rest of his life. And a trial will certainly cause what prosecutors call ""collateral damage"": other wrongdoers -- Epstein's co-conspirators and enablers in the alleged sex trafficking ring -- will be named publicly, and the proof of their conduct will come out.

Second, Epstein can plead guilty without cooperation. But it seems unlikely that the SDNY will give Epstein anything remotely approaching the absurdly soft deal he got in Florida. Given the severity of the charges, I'd be surprised if SDNY prosecutors let Epstein plead to anything less than a decade behind bars, without his cooperation.

Third, Epstein can cooperate. This is Epstein's best chance to reduce his sentence significantly. In the SDNY, however, cooperation is all-or-nothing: a cooperator must tell prosecutors everything he knows about his own conduct and the conduct of others, including on the charged crimes and everything else. When I was with SDNY, I had cooperators originally charged with drug offenses who ended up providing information about murders. Cooperators cannot pick and choose and cannot provide information selectively. That's simply how it works in the SDNY. (Just ask Michael Cohen, who received a blistering sentencing letter from the SDNY because he was willing to answer some, but not all, of their questions). So if Epstein does cooperate, he will have to name names. It remains to be seen whether the SDNY even wants to cooperate with Epstein, given his grotesque conduct.

We do not know if Epstein will cooperate, but even if he does not, others will very likely be implicated. It seems clear from the indictment that others helped Epstein run his alleged sex trafficking operation and otherwise participated in it. At least some of those names will come out in court proceedings, public filings, potentially trial and perhaps additional indictments. And it's worth noting that the Epstein case is being handled by the SDNY's Public Corruption Unit -- in my experience, human trafficking cases usually are handled elsewhere in the office -- which strongly suggests that public officials could be under a microscope here. Anybody who helped Epstein in any way needs to get a lawyer and get scared

Now, your questions:

Glen, Minnesota: I've always heard of the checks and balances in our government. What checks are there, if any, on a Supreme Court decision?

There are Constitutional checks on the Supreme Court itself, but not on its decisions.

Systemically, the Constitution gives the Executive Branch (through the President) the power to nominate justices to the Supreme Court, while the Legislative Branch (Congress) can confirm or reject those nominations. The Legislative Branch also holds constitutional power to impeach Supreme Court justices.

But there is essentially no check on the decisions reached by the Supreme Court. There is no higher court and no way parties can appeal to some other court. At times, the Supreme Court leaves the door open to future revision of its own decisions, pending further developments. We saw this recently when the Court ruled against inclusion of a citizenship question on the census, but gave the Trump administration a chance to come back and attempt to show a legitimate legal basis to include it. That involves the Supreme Court leaving its own door open, not some other body of government imposing its will on the Court.

Ultimately, what the Court says, goes -- whether the President or Congress like it or not. An executive order, which Trump has contemplated on the census issue, simply does not override a Supreme Court decision under our Constitutional structure. The only way a Supreme Court decision can be overridden is with a constitutional amendment (the most notable example being the 14th Amendment, which in 1868 overturned the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision by granting citizenship to all those born in the US, regardless of color).

The Supreme Court also can overrule its own prior decisions, as it did in 1954 when Brown v. Board of Education overturned the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case which had upheld racial segregation under the ""separate but equal"" doctrine. Supreme Court reversals of its own precedent are rare, and often take many years, as judicial and social norms evolve.

As former Justice Robert Jackson famously noted of the Supreme Court, ""We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.""

Mamood, Canada: How does the justice system handle situations where a witness given immunity protects a defendant by confessing to a crime?

It sounds like a twist from a Hollywood courtroom thriller, but this happened recently in the controversial military prosecution of former Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher for murder. The prosecution called to the stand a medic who testified under a grant of immunity -- meaning that the medic's own trial testimony cannot be used to prosecute him in the future -- that he saw Gallagher stab the victim. But the medic then testified unexpectedly, and contrary to his own prior statements, that he, not Gallagher, killed the victim by suffocating him during medical treatment. The jury acquitted Gallagher on the murder charge and all others except one relatively minor offense for which he was sentenced to no additional jail time.

The prosecutor now has a few options available. First, if the prosecutor can prove that the medic lied on the stand, then he can charge the medic with perjury (indeed, Gallagher's prosecutors are considering a perjury charge against the medic). Immunity does not cover perjury; it essentially means ""we will not prosecute you based on your own trial testimony, unless you lie."" And if the prosecutor can prove that Gallagher, or any other person, encouraged the witness to lie, then that person can be charged with witness tampering.

The medic also can theoretically be charged with murder, but that charge cannot be based on the medic's own trial testimony, under the grant of immunity. If, however, the prosecutor can find other evidence of the medic's guilt -- for example, if somebody had taken a cellphone video showing the medic actually suffocating the victim -- then the medic can be charged with murder. But the prosecutor cannot use the medic's immunized trial testimony against him to prove that charge.

Dan, New Mexico: How can the Supreme Court justify its decision to permit gerrymandering even if the stated purpose is for one party to gain a more favorable election outcome?

The Supreme Court ruled by a 5-4 vote along ideological lines -- conservatives John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh in the majority and liberals Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissenting -- that the federal courts have no role in reviewing ""gerrymandering"" (the process of drawing political districting maps, often for political advantage). The Court deemed gerrymandering a ""political question"" best left to elected lawmakers and ""beyond the reach of the federal courts.""

In non-legal terms, the Supreme Court ducked. The Court found that the specific districting maps before it (from Maryland and North Carolina) were ""highly partisan, by any measure"" and ""blatant examples of partisanship driving districting decisions."" Yet the Court concluded that gerrymandering is up to elected policymakers, and that there is no reliable way for federal courts to determine precisely how partisan is too partisan.

The dissent takes heated issue with the majority, calling the decision ""tragically wrong"" because extreme partisan gerrymandering poses a threat to fundamental constitutional rights ""to participate equally in the political process."" The dissent also notes that federal courts have monitored partisan gerrymandering for many years and that ""[f]or the first time ever, this Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities.""

As the Supreme Court notes, its decision does not necessarily open the door to unchecked partisan gerrymandering, because state legislatures, Congress and state courts can exercise oversight. But the federal courts -- which are well-positioned to limit extreme gerrymandering because they stand above and apart from local or state politics -- are now out of that business.

Three questions to watch for next week:

1. Who else will be implicated in Epstein's alleged sex trafficking ring?

2. Will Trump issue an executive order purporting to override the Supreme Court on the census issue, and will the Administration take other steps to continue its legal fight to include the citizenship question?

Barr says Trump administration can legally add citizenship question to census,https://thehill.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/452043-barr-says-trump-admin-can-legally-add-citizenship-question-to-census,"Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrCarl Bernstein knocks media coverage of Mueller report: 'I think we've made a big mistake' The Hill's Morning Report - Democrats assail border conditions as Congress returns to work Peter King: Improper behavior by FBI officials 'going to come out' MORE said Monday that he believes the Trump administration can legally add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, though the Supreme Court ruled against its inclusion last month.

“I agree with him that the Supreme Court decision was wrong,” Barr told the AP. The attorney general added that he thinks there is “an opportunity potentially to cure the lack of clarity that was the problem and we might as well take a shot at doing that.”

Barr declined to provide further details to the wire service on how the question will be added to the census.

However, the AP cited a senior official who said President Trump is expected to issue a presidential memorandum to the Commerce Department directing it to include the citizenship question on the 2020 census. Action is expected to be taken in the coming days.

The Hill has reached out to the Justice and Commerce departments for further comment.

The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling last month, found that the administration's stated reason for adding the citizenship question to the census didn’t match up with the evidence in the case.

The justices blocked the question from appearing on the survey for the time being but left an opening for the Commerce Department to provide another reason for the question’s inclusion. The Trump administration had claimed the question was necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act.

Opponents of the question argued that its inclusion on the census would lead to an inaccurate count of the population, as immigrants might be discouraged from participating. The Department of Justice (DOJ) had argued that the data would not be used for purposes beyond compliance with the voting law, but critics said the perception was enough to cause individuals to skip the question or the survey altogether.

The DOJ initially appeared ready to accept defeat in the legal battles, announcing Tuesday that census materials would be printed without the question. The administration had said in court filings that census materials needed to be finalized by June 30 for a July 1 printing deadline.

But Trump one day later tweeted that those efforts would move forward, appearing to catch even DOJ lawyers on the case by surprise.

“The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the president's position on this issue, just like the plaintiffs and Your Honor. I do not have a deeper understanding of what that means at this juncture other than what the president has tweeted,” Joshua Gardner, a DOJ attorney, told a federal judge during a teleconference Wednesday.

“But obviously, as you can imagine, I am doing my absolute best to figure out what's going on,” he added.

The DOJ also announced late Sunday that it was pulling its entire legal team for the citizenship question off the case, and replacing them with other government lawyers.

That move has fueled speculation that career DOJ lawyers refused to provide another rationale behind the citizenship question after repeatedly citing the Voting Rights Act in court or that officials feared they would no longer be viewed as trustworthy by judges presiding over the cases."

The Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank, said Monday that the U.S. government could run out of money in two months if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)

The U.S. government could run out of money to pay all of its bills by early September if Congress doesn’t rush to raise the debt ceiling, a think tank said Monday, a time frame that could force lawmakers to act much sooner than planned.

The Bipartisan Policy Center said that the Treasury Department could breach the borrowing limit in two months because the government has brought in far less tax revenue this year than was projected. The BPC uses economic models to forecast the government’s ability to pay its bills, and its estimates are often studied by the White House and congressional leaders.

In May, it had projected that Treasury would have until October or November before it ran into debt ceiling problems.

[Hiring rebounds in June, easing fears of a U.S. recession]

Congressional negotiations to raise the debt ceiling bogged down in recent weeks, with some leaders hoping to package a debt limit increase with a broader budget package. Those talks have faltered amid disagreements with the White House, and it is unclear when they plan to hold a vote.

But if lawmakers heed the BPC’s warning about the debt ceiling, they could be forced to raise the borrowing limit before a lengthy break in August. Senior GOP senators said Monday that the new projected timeline could increase pressure on Congress to act.

“That could change the dynamic,” said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.). “We cannot default. That would send chaos through the financial markets.""

G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the BPC, said tax revenue, particularly money paid by corporations, has lagged far behind estimates and has provided Treasury much less cash than expected. When the government collects less money in taxes, it has less money to pay its bills. Typically, it would address this by borrowing more money, but its ability to do this is limited because Congress hasn’t raised the debt limit.

Even though there have been numerous political showdowns over the debt ceiling, Congress and the White House have never breached the limit. Financial experts have projected that failing to raise the debt ceiling could lead to a stock market crash and a spike in interest rates. The Treasury is expected to run a deficit of roughly $900 billion this year because spending far outpaces tax collection, and borrowing costs would also shoot higher.

BPC officials said it was difficult to pinpoint when exactly the Treasury would run out of money. While they said there was a “significant” chance the government would run out of funds in the first half of September, they said the more likely scenario is that it would have enough until sometime in October. If Treasury can make it through early September, it is expected to receive billions of dollars in tax payments that are due in late September, giving it a bit more flexibility. They said it’s difficult to pinpoint precisely when the debt ceiling would be breached because hundreds of billions of dollars come in and out of the government each month.

Still, Hoagland said, lawmakers “might want to seriously consider quicker action than waiting until early October.”

“We just want to raise the red flag to be very cautious and careful about what action they may want to take before too long,” he said.

[‘This doesn’t look like the best economy ever’: 40% of Americans say they still struggle to pay bills]

The government makes millions of payments each month, from Social Security benefits to interest payments on its debt. During a debt ceiling standoff with Congress, the Obama administration considered prioritizing payments to minimize the disruption for financial markets. But Democrats and Republicans have stressed that there is no way to contain the fallout from a debt ceiling breach given that U.S. debt is considered to be one of the safest investments.

BPC officials outlined twin risks if the debt ceiling isn’t increased. They said it could lead to a cessation of benefits for millions of Americans, particularly the elderly, but also a stock market crash that could hurt the investments of millions of Americans.

Congress is scheduled to go into recess for much of August and not return until after Labor Day weekend in early September. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has urged Congress to raise the debt ceiling for months, but his overtures have not been met with much enthusiasm by Democrats or Republicans. He has also told lawmakers that the debt ceiling could be breached in September.

The looming debt ceiling threat has caused growing concern on Capitol Hill, especially since it nearly coincides with a Sept. 30 deadline when the federal government will begin to shut down unless new spending legislation is passed. Lawmakers also want to avert onerous spending caps that threaten to slash $126 billion from domestic and military budgets early next year absent a deal.

But there are differences between Republicans and Democrats -- and between GOP lawmakers and the Trump administration -- over the best way to proceed. Trump administration officials recently proposed raising the debt ceiling while extending existing federal spending levels for a year, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called that approach “unacceptable” because the Pentagon wouldn’t get enough money. At the same time, Republicans have chafed at Democrats’ demands for higher domestic spending levels.

All that has left the path forward unclear even as lawmakers express increasing urgency as their annual August recess approaches.

“I think we need to hustle to a (budget) caps deal as soon as we possibly can and include the debt limit in it, no doubt,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said Monday evening after emerging from a Senate GOP leadership meeting where the issues were discussed. “I don’t think it’s in anybody’s best interest to have that fight in September up against the deadline.”

In 2018, Congress suspended the debt ceiling until March 2019. Because that date has passed, Treasury has taken numerous steps to avoid defaulting on obligations by moving money around or delaying certain costs. But Treasury will eventually run out of ways to buy more time.

The U.S. government spends more money than it brings in through revenue, and it covers the difference by borrowing money. It borrows by issuing debt, but it can do so only up to a limit set by Congress."
An Executive Order Can’t Fix Trump’s Census Problem,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Peter M. Shane'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/executive-order-cant-fix-trumps-census-problem/593449/,"The third is that every statute that authorizes the executive branch to do something also puts limits on that power. Lawful executive action must respect those limits, what I call in my administrative-law classes an administrator’s “zone of discretion.” For example, the Census Act requires the secretary of commerce to submit, at least three years before the census date, a report containing the secretary’s “determination of the subjects proposed to be included in the census, and the types of information to be compiled.” The secretary must then submit, at least two years before the census date, a report containing the secretary’s “determination of the questions proposed to be included” in the census. Should the secretary of commerce decide just a year before the census date to ask each person his or her favorite Beatles song, the question would be impermissible because it was not reported to Congress in time.

Finally—and this is the speed bump over which the Commerce Department stumbled—under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, responsible officials must also, at the time a decision is made, offer a nonarbitrary, non-capricious explanation for choosing their strategy for carrying out their statutory authority. This requires at least that the proposed administrative action be a rational way of carrying out the mission Congress has assigned the executive, and that the rationale be clearly explained at the time of an agency decision. In the case of the citizenship question, the Department of Commerce failed to take this step, which is why a 2020 citizenship question is now on hold. Even if such a question could have been asked, in principle, consistent with the secretary’s zone of discretion, the failure of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to offer a non-pretextual rationale for the citizenship question tripped him up in the courts. As euphemistically summarized by Chief Justice John Roberts for a Supreme Court majority, the secretary offered a “contrived … explanation for agency action that is incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decision making process.”

The executive branch now has an obvious logic problem: It must generate a non-pretextual agency explanation to justify an action to which it already committed itself without any such explanation. The Justice Department’s public flailing-about for a new rationale looks like the very definition of “arbitrary and capricious.” But whether or not such a rationale can now be found and belatedly attached to the census question, a presidential order cannot make the job easier.

For one thing, a presidential order cannot expand the secretary’s zone of legal discretion to determine the contents of the census. Just as important, an executive order cannot relieve the commerce secretary of his obligation to proceed based on a nonarbitrary rationale rooted in his statutory mission. “The president wants me to ask this question” would not be an adequate reason. Nothing in the statute empowers presidential whim."
Barr says DOJ would back Mueller if he decides not to testify,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/william-barr-robert-mueller-testify-census-question,"Attorney General William Barr said in an interview Monday that the Justice Department would support Robert Mueller if he decides he ""doesn't want to subject himself"" to questioning from congressional Democrats at a planned July 17 hearing.

Barr's comments raised the dramatic possibility that Mueller would pull out of the questioning at the last minute -- a potential coup for Democrats, as some Republicans and commentators have said Mueller's testimony could end up revealing fundamental problems with his now-closed investigation.

Although Mueller no longer was a DOJ employee, the Trump administration could still limit testimony about decisions made while he was special counsel. Barr indicated the Justice Department would seek to block any attempt by Congress to subpoena members of the former special counsel's team but did not say Mueller's testimony would be restricted in any way.

At the same time, a Mueller pullout would avert an unnecessary ""public spectacle,"" Barr told The Associated Press, given that Mueller has stated publicly that his exhaustive report on 2016 foreign election interference spoke for itself.

Trump attorney Jay Sekulow, however, has countered that Mueller's remarks could be necessary. Sekulow, in a Fox News op-ed last month, pushed for answers as to when exactly Mueller learned there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump team and Russia -- and why Mueller's team hinted in sworn court filings even late into the investigation that such collusion remained a tantalizing possibility.

TRUMP ATTY JAY SEKULOW: HERE'S THE QUESTIONS MUELLER MUST BE ASKED ON JULY 17

""I'm not sure what purpose is served by dragging him up there and trying to grill him,"" Barr asserted. ""I don't think Mueller should be treated that way or subject himself to that, if he doesn't want to.""

Mueller's 448-page report, released with redactions in April, found no proof that the Trump campaign conspired with Russian actors to influence the election, despite multiple outreach efforts by Russians, and did not reach a conclusion on whether President Trump obstructed justice.

Even so, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted Monday that Barr's remarks were ""no surprise.""

""Barr misled the public about Mueller's report, and wants his own deception to stand,"" Schiff wrote, referring to Barr's decision to release an initial summary of Mueller's report shortly before publishing the complete, redacted version. ""The public has a right to hear the truth, from Mueller himself, about Trump's misconduct and ongoing national security risks.""

In a news conference this past May, Mueller defended Barr's decision to release the summary: ""At one point in time, I requested that certain portions of the report be released,"" Mueller said. ""The attorney general preferred to make the entire report public all at once. We appreciate that the attorney general made the report largely public, and I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith in that decision.""

MUELLER SUBPOENA COULD BACKFIRE ON DEMOCRATS, SAY POLITICAL, LEGAL EXPERTS

Barr's additionally said he still saw a legal path forward for requiring 2020 Census respondents to declare whether or not they're citizens. The Justice Department announced Sunday it was putting together a new legal team to spearhead its effort to ask the citizenship question after the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the move.

The justices said the administration's justification for the question ""seems to have been contrived,"" but implied they would consider additional arguments from the White House.

The new legal team, named in court papers, included Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Morrell, a former Trump White House lawyer and law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas; Christopher Bates, who previously worked for Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, and four career Justice Department attorneys: Glenn Girdharry, Colin Kisor, Christopher Reimer and Daniel Schiffer.

James Burnham, a top lawyer in the department's civil division who had been leading the team, had told Barr that a number of people who'd been litigating the case preferred ""not to continue during this new phase,"" the attorney general said.

Barr would not detail the new team's precise plans, though a senior official told The Associated Press that Trump was expected to issue a memorandum to the Commerce Department instructing it to include the question on census forms. Barr said he didn't have details on why the attorneys didn't want to continue, but ""as far as I know, they don't think we are legally wrong.""

Many Democrats have said a citizenship question would deter illegal immigrants from filling out census forms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Monday that Trump wanted to add the demand for citizenship information because he wanted to ""make America white again.""

Census data counts all residents, including illegal immigrants, and is used to determine congressional apportionments and the makeup of the Electoral College. Although illegal immigrants cannot vote, their children become citizens automatically if born in the United States under a practice known as birthright citizenship -- which the Trump administration separately has called into question.

OPINION: WHY ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS CONSTITUTIONAL

The Trump administration has argued it wanted the citizenship question included to aid in enforcing the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters' access to the ballot box. However, Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's four more liberal members in last month's Supreme Court decision, openly skeptical about that justification.

Pelosi, meanwhile, said in a letter to colleagues that the full House would be moving forward with a vote to hold Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress after the administration failed to comply with subpoenas regarding the census question.

Barr spoke to the AP after touring a federal prison in Edgefield, South Carolina, where he met with inmates and staff members to discuss the criminal justice reform law that Congress approved and Trump signed into law last year.

Separately, Barr revealed that he recused himself from the Jeffrey Epstein criminal case ""because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time.""

An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

U.S. State Department approves possible $2.2 billion arms sale to Taiwan,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-taiwan/u-s-state-department-approves-possible-2-2-billion-arms-sale-to-taiwan-idUSKCN1U32HT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to Taiwan of M1A2T Abrams tanks, Stinger missiles and related equipment at an estimated value of $2.2 billion, the Pentagon said on Monday, despite Chinese criticism of the deal.

China’s Foreign Ministry said last month when the possible sale was first reported that it was seriously concerned about U.S. arms sales to self-ruled Taiwan, and it urged the United States to halt the sales to avoid harming bilateral ties.

The sale of the weapons requested by Taiwan, including 108 General Dynamics Corp (GD.N) M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles, would not alter the basic military balance in the region, the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.

DSCA notified Congress on Monday of the possible arms sale, which it said could also include mounted machine guns, ammunition, Hercules armored vehicles for recovering inoperative tanks, heavy equipment transporters and related support.

Reuters reported last month that an informal notification of the proposed sale had been sent to the U.S. Congress.

The United States is the main arms supplier to Taiwan, which China deems a renegade province. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.

Taiwan’s Presidential Office expressed “sincere gratitude” to the U.S. government for the arms sale.

“Taiwan will speed up investment on defense and continue to deepen security ties with the United States and countries with similar ideas,” Chang Tun-han, a spokesman for Taiwan’s president, said in a statement.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in March that Washington was responding positively to Taipei’s requests for new arms sales to bolster its defenses in the face of pressure from China. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide it with the means to defend itself.

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry confirmed it had requested those weapons and that the request was proceeding normally.

The U.S. commitment to providing Taiwan with the weapons to defend itself helps Taipei’s military raise its combat abilities, consolidates the Taiwan-U.S. security partnership and ensures Taiwan’s security, the ministry said last month in a statement."
Democrats should listen to this Obama border official on the overcrowded illegal immigrant detention centers,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Eric Gay Ap'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/democrats-should-listen-to-this-obama-border-official-on-the-overcrowded-illegal-immigrant-detention-centers,"Here’s a quote every Democrat in Congress needs to digest: “[W]hen you sit down and talk to a lot of these folks, being detained in the border patrol facility, it’s not exactly a deterrence compared to what they’ve faced.""

That comes from Obama-era commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Gil Kerlikowske in an Axios report Monday about what’s driving the hundreds of thousands of Central Americans that have overwhelmed the border and are overcrowding detention centers for illegal immigrants.

Democrats and much of the national news media last week attempted to ignite public outrage at the Trump administration for the overcrowded facilities and strained resources that have nearly left Border Patrol agents paralyzed as they try to care for the hundreds of thousands of children pouring in to the country, many of them dirty, disease ridden, and in need of urgent care.

The New York Times on Saturday continued feeding the hysteria with a profile on one of the detention centers in Clint, Texas, the inside of which the paper described as “the stuff of nightmares.” There were outbreaks of scabies, chickenpox, and shingles, the thick stench of soiled clothing and “cramped cells” holding children as young as five months old.

Yes, it sucks. Anyone who has listened to the warnings from the departments of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Defense has known this for the better part of a year.

Our system at the border, such that you could even call it a “system,” was never meant to function as a welfare complex for the world’s poor. Detention facilities were intended to house single male adults caught crossing the border without authorization, until they were processed and then sent back to wherever they came from, usually Mexico. Now things have changed as illegal immigrants game our asylum laws. It’s children, sometimes in groups of hundreds. And American taxpayers are now expected by Democrats to provide each and every one of them with food, clothing, toiletries, and showering facilities, not to mention medicine and legal services. And that’s all before the vast majority of them are inevitably turned loose in to the U.S. anyway.

As the former Obama CBP commissioner said, compared to where they came from — countries that have all but collapsed under violence, corruption, and poverty — the detention centers are a minor discomfort they’re willing to endure.

What, then, is the point of turning them into Comfort Suites? There is none. Democrats largely know that, even as they pretend now that the real problem isn't our own broken immigration system, but the size of the welcome mat for countless poor foreigners wanting in to the country.

Sprucing up detention facilities at the border does nothing to address the issue. It's a band-aid. Only changes to the laws that govern the system can do that."
Why the latest USDA report offers little good news for farmers,https://www.accuweather.com,[],,,,https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/why-the-latest-usda-report-offers-little-good-news-for-farmers/70008768,"July 08, 2019 Why the latest USDA report offers little good news for farmers

By John Roach, AccuWeather staff writer July 08, 2019, 4:42:51 PM EDT



The latest Crop Progress from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offered little comfort to U.S. farmers dealing with a difficult planting season. For the fourth straight week, the condition of corn and soybeans was rated below 60%.

The rain and flooding that has impacted Corn Belt farmers has affected the percentage of corn considered “good” or “excellent” in 18 key corn-producing states. That number this week is 57%; the first rating of the season was 59%, followed by consecutive weeks at 56%. The condition of corn rated “good” or “excellent” last year at this time was 75%.

The condition of soybeans in 18 soybean-producing states considered “good” or “excellent” is 53%, compared to 54% last week. That figure was at 71% this time last year.

The bad news continues for Illinois, which is joined by Iowa as the top corn-producing states, typically accounting for about one-third of the U.S. crop, according to the USDA. The condition of corn in Illinois rated ""good"" or ""excellent"" is just 37%, even lower than last week’s rating of 42%.

Other states with particularly poor corn condition data this week include Missouri (28%), Ohio (34%) and Indiana (38%). Those three states also had low percentages for the condition of soybeans, too: Ohio (28%), Missouri (35%) and Indiana (37%).

Next week’s numbers may not be much better.

“The weather overall for the heart of the Midwest for the next 10 days is slightly negative,” said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Jason Nicholls. “There’s not a whole lot of rain, but the temperatures will be favorable because it will be somewhat warmer than normal. It does look like they’ll get some helpful rains later next week.”

A new AccuWeather analysis predicts there will be 13.03 billion bushels of corn produced this year. That would be the lowest total since 2012 when 10.76 billion bushels of corn were harvested. In 2018, the total was 14.42 billion bushels.

The USDA’s 2019 corn production estimate as of June 28 is higher, at 13.88 billion bushels.

DOJ files to halt Trump suit demanding financial documents,https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-financial-documents-department-of-justice,"The Justice Department on Monday challenged a federal judge's decision to allow a case accusing President Donald Trump of profiting off the presidency to move forward, asking an appeals court to take up the case instead.

Justice lawyers asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overrule a federal judge and instead allow for a mid-case appeal or to dismiss the case outright, calling the case dealing with a Revolutionary War-era clause ""extraordinary.""

The government lawyers also want the court to suspend legal discovery recently approved by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, which would force Trump-related entities such as his New York and D.C. hotels, Trump Tower, the Trump Organization, and Mar-a-Lago Club to turn over business tax returns, receipts and other documents.

Justice lawyers said in the filings that answering their 37 subpoena requests in the interim, by July 29, would cause Trump ""irreparable injury"" and distract him from his official duties.

CUOMO SIGNS BILL ALLOWING CONGRESS TO GET TRUMP TAX RETURNS

This is the second time Justice lawyers have petitioned a higher court to take up a case dealing with the emoluments clause, which bans government officials from accepting foreign gifts and money without Congress' permission. Last December, the federal appeals court agreed to hear a similar case out of a Maryland federal court that had also reached such a point. In the meantime, a stay on proceedings was also allowed.

The lawsuit was brought by nearly 200 congressional Democrats led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, who is also chair of the House Judiciary Committee. It argues that Trump has been accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. Trump, unlike modern presidents before him, has declined to fully divest from his businesses.

""Our goal is simple and straightforward -- stopping President Trump from putting a `For Sale' sign in Russian on the door to the Oval Office,"" Blumenthal said in a statement Monday. ""Unsurprisingly, the Trump Administration is still seeking to delay, delay, delay, but we are confident that the D.C. Circuit will recognize the well-reasoned logic of the District Court, and allow discovery to proceed.""

The Trump Organization did not immediately return requests for comment.

RUSH LIMBAUGH: 'EUROPEAN ELITES' THREATENED BY 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN'

The filing of a writ of mandamus is considered an ""extraordinary remedy,"" according to the Justice Department's website, which ""should only be used in exceptional circumstances of peculiar emergency or public importance.""

Among the judges who sit on the appeals court, includes chief judge is Merrick B. Garland, whose nomination by President Barack Obama to the Supreme Court was not allowed to be heard by Republicans.

The filing seeking for a writ of mandamus comes two weeks after Sullivan ruled against Justice Department lawyers who sought a mid-case appeal to a higher court and a stay on proceedings. For Justice to succeed at the appeals level, they must meet a demanding standard that would partly rest on showing Sullivan's decisions to be clearly wrong and that there's no adequate alternative for relief in the case.

They have argued that the court has ignored ""unique separation-of-powers concerns"" involved in having members of one branch of government conducting discovery against the president in his official capacity. The government also wrote in their filing that the legislature itself must bring such a case, ""not an amalgam of individual legislators or even a single chamber of a bicameral body.""

The case argues that the president has received foreign government favors, such as Chinese government trademarks for his companies, payments for hotel room stays and event-space rentals by representatives of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and proceeds from Chinese or Emirati-linked government purchases of office space in Trump Tower.



SEAN SPICER: 2020 ELECTION IS CHOICE BETWEEN TRUMP'S ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND DEMS' LEFT TURN TOWARD SOCIALISM

Ethics experts say the constitutional emoluments clause was created by the Founding Fathers to ensure that government officials act with the interests of the American public in mind instead of their own pocketbooks.

Unlike prior presidents, Trump chose not to divest from his assets and he remains the owner of the Trump Organization, a sprawling business empire with 550 entities in more than 20 countries that include branded hotels, golf courses, licensing deals and other interests. His Washington, D.C., hotel is near the White House and has become a magnet for foreign governments, previously hosting groups tied to Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.

The District of Columbia case is one of three that argues the president is violating the emoluments clause, but this case is notable because the plaintiffs in this suit -- members of Congress -- are mentioned in the clause itself. The Democrats' attorneys have argued that Congress not only has a right but is required, as part of their jobs, to weigh in on potential emoluments to Trump such as a $6.5 million condo purchase by the Qatari government or a Chinese-government owned company's investment in a project that will include a Trump-branded hotel and golf course in Indonesia.

Justice Department lawyers argued in court papers that the Democrats suing the president are not being injured by him at all but by their colleagues in Congress, who have refused to take up the emoluments issue. And the government has contended that Trump's business activity such as hotel room earnings don't qualify under the constitutional definition of emoluments.

Blumenthal said the subpoenas seeking information in the case are ""targeted"" to get information that ensures the president isn't avoiding his constitutional responsibility to ask Congress to approve any emoluments. The aim of the subpoenas is to trace ownership interests and money flowing to Trump from foreign governments and their representatives.

The subpoenas were seeking the terms governing the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and related information, and aimed to determine trademarks granted to Trump or his companies by foreign governments since Jan. 20, 2017, and all pending applications for foreign trademarks.

The Justice Department asked the court in its filing Monday for a ruling regarding their request for a stay on the subpoenas by July 22 -- one week before the official response deadline -- ""in order to provide time to seek relief from the Supreme Court if necessary,"" an indication that the governments attorneys may be willing to elevate the case to the highest court if there is any indication they won't succeed at the appeals court."
New Human Rights Panel Raises Fears of a Narrowing U.S. Advocacy,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Edward Wong', 'Eileen Sullivan']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/state-human-rights.html,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday that he was installing a human rights advisory panel in the State Department, and named a conservative law professor as its chairwoman, to review and tighten the agency’s definition of human rights and ensure it is grounded in the “nation’s founding principles” and a 1948 United Nations declaration.

The State Department already houses an internal bureau that oversees human rights issues. But the new panel, which Mr. Pompeo said would examine “the role of human rights in American foreign policy,” will not be managed by the bureau and was created without substantial input from its experts and officials.

“International institutions designed and built to protect human rights have drifted from their original mission,” Mr. Pompeo said. “As human rights claims have proliferated, some claims have come into tension with one another, provoking questions and clashes about which rights are entitled to gain respect.”

The announcement, along with a blunt commentary by Mr. Pompeo that was published in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, raised worries among human rights advocates and Democratic lawmakers that Mr. Pompeo is moving to curtail State Department advocacy for some rights, particularly ones related to women’s health and reproduction and gay and transgender issues."
Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule,https://thehill.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/452066-environmental-groups-fight-epas-new-public-records-restrictions,"A coalition of environmental groups pushed back Monday against a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule that could restrict access to public records.

The new EPA rule, the details of which were first reported by The Hill, allows the administrator and other political appointees to review all materials requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process.

“Any politicization of FOIA undermines its core functions of enabling the public to inform itself on what its government is up to, and to hold officials accountable for those actions,” the groups wrote in the letter, saying they were “concerned that this new rule will unduly impair the public’s right and ability to apprise itself of important agency actions.”

The groups that signed the letter, including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Union of Concerned Scientists and many others, have asked Wheeler to withdraw the rule, saying it would be improper to implement it without giving the public a chance to weigh in on its impacts.

EPA’s new rule is similar to the controversial process employed by the Department of the Interior, which also lets political appointees review FOIA requests before they are released to the requester.

Critics of the rule at EPA and Interior have highlighted the potential for abuse.

“Aside from this requirement intuitively granting political staff heightened opportunities to interfere with FOIA requests, it is difficult to see how this change could possibly improve the Agency’s FOIA efficiency or enhance the public’s lawful access to information,” the groups wrote in their Monday letter.

There is already talk in Congress of using legislation to limit the review of public records documents by non-FOIA staff, something the agencies refer to as an “awareness review.”

“Transparency laws like the Freedom of Information Act help provide access to information in the face of an opaque and obstinate government. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court ruling and new regulations at EPA and the Department of Interior are undermining access,” Sen.

“The public’s work ought to be public. So, I’m working on legislation to address these developments and promote access to government records.”

Ed Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeyUN official: US can't ignore that climate change will force 120 million people into poverty Lawmakers talk legislation in response to FOIA changes Study touts planting 1 trillion trees as most effective climate change solution MORE (D-Mass.) is also considering legislation in response to the new rules.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” an EPA spokesman said last month.

In Monday’s letter, the groups contend that holding back documents from a FOIA request is illegal.

“The law is clear that FOIA does not permit agencies to withhold a record or a portion of a record “on the basis of responsiveness,” they wrote.

EPA and Interior have said the FOIA rules are a necessary update to congressional changes to the FOIA law in 2016.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights when the rule was first unveiled in late June. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” the EPA said in a statement when it first announced the rule change."
Department of Education not National School Board,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Yuval Levin', 'Andrew C. Mccarthy', 'Brian T. Allen', 'Madeleine Kearns', 'Alec Dent', 'Jonah Goldberg', 'Jack Fowler', 'Nate Hochman', 'Kyle Smith', 'Ramesh Ponnuru']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-department-of-education-is-not-a-national-school-board/,"(Jonathan Alcorn/Reuters)

Last week, Joe Biden joined the bandwagon of Democrats (started by Elizabeth Warren this year) promising to name a public-school teacher to be Secretary of Education if he wins the presidency. It’s an easy commitment to make in front of a teachers’ union audience, and it wouldn’t be all that odd to do it—several past presidents of both parties have named former public-school teachers to the job.

But the promise is another example of a thoroughly bipartisan misconception about the work of the federal education department. Even if they haven’t been former teachers, nearly every education secretary since the Department of Education was created in the Carter years has been someone with expertise or experience in K-12 education—whether as an educator, administrator, reformer, or policymaker. But the Department of Education actually has a lot more say over higher education than primary or secondary schooling, and its work has suffered from the lack of focus on higher ed over the years. If we must have a Department of Education, it could at least be run by someone who knows something about higher education.

The American system of primary and secondary schools is gloriously decentralized. There are about 130,000 K-12 schools in America, about three-quarters of which are public schools. The latter are governed by about 13,000 different school districts across the 50 states. These districts have enormous power over curriculum and staffing decisions, and the states have most of the remaining power over education policy.

The federal role in K-12 education is strongest in circumstances where racial or other discrimination triggers legally-mandated responses. Otherwise, the federal government uses some levers of conditional funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act—a Great Society law that has been updated every few years since. Recent updates include the No Child Left Behind Act and the Every Student Succeeds Act. These have given the federal government more leverage over time, but its power is still greatest at the margins. Federal dollars are about 8 percent of K-12 education funding, and the Department of Education doesn’t really shape primary and secondary education policy.

We should all be glad about that. And a teacher who wants to influence education policy would be better advised to run for school board or for the state legislature than to go to Washington.

But unfortunately, the federal Department of Education does play a critical role in setting the direction of American higher education. Here too, its power comes mostly from the leverage created by federal dollars, but that leverage is immense, especially because of the student-loan system. And it has meant that the federal government has played a central role in driving the tuition inflation that plagues higher ed and in creating all manner of policy trouble besides.

Price inflation in higher education has been massively exacerbated by the basic structure of federal policy in this area, which might be best described as simultaneously subsidizing demand and restricting supply.

The subsidization of demand is done through student aid, which has been too open-ended and has risen with tuition, thereby creating upward pressure on costs. This leverage over funds has also given the Department of Education lots of informal power to drive policy through nudges and “suggestions” in a variety of areas. The Obama administration’s notorious “Dear Colleague” letters are a prominent example.

The restriction of supply, meanwhile, has been a function of accreditation, which the incumbent players in American higher education have used to restrict new entrants and new uses of technology. Accreditation is technically a private process, run by a group of NGOs, but because it is the means by which schools become eligible for students with federal loans and grants, the Department of Education has enormous power over it, essentially accrediting the accreditors.

All of this gives the Secretary of Education a lot of opportunities to improve (or to worsen) higher-ed policy—both by working with Congress to change the law and by working directly to change the department’s policies. Higher-ed policy is badly in need of reforms, getting those right could make a huge difference, and the Secretary of Education would be a key figure in making that happen. The Trump administration has taken some useful steps in this direction, but there is lots more to be done.

So a president who wanted to do something useful in education policy would be wise to appoint an education secretary who knows something about higher education, rather than just one who will say nice things about primary and secondary schools."
"Mark Esper begins third week on the job, with time running out on his tenure as acting defense secretary",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/mark-esper-begins-third-week-on-the-job-with-time-running-out-on-his-tenure-as-acting-defense-secretary,"ESPER’S UNCERTAIN JULY: Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper begins his third week on the job with a giant question mark hanging over his head. The Pentagon has not said how it plans to handle the conditions of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 , which requires that once nominated, Esper must step aside until confirmed and also that the position cannot be filled by an acting secretary past the end of the month.

While President Trump has announced his intent to nominate Esper as his replacement for Jim Mattis, who resigned in December, the Senate Armed Services Committee has not yet received his nomination paperwork. Once that happens, the provisions of the vacancies law kick in, along with the rules of the Senate, which require a seven-day wait once the nomination is submitted.

THE PROBLEM: Under the 1998 law, a person working as “an acting officer” may serve in the office “no longer than 210 days beginning on the date the vacancy occurs” or from the date that the person’s “nomination is pending in the Senate.” The clock began running on January 1, the date Mattis left office. Once Esper’s nomination is submitted, he must step aside and perform no duties that would presume his confirmation to the post. Patrick Shanahan did not have to do this for two reasons: He was never formally nominated, and under the law he could serve as acting because as deputy defense secretary he served in a “position of first assistant“ to the secretary.

THE FINESSE: Here’s how things could play out this month to get Esper in place while staying within the law: Esper’s nomination is submitted before the end of the month. He steps aside and the Navy secretary, who is next in line, fills in while the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Oklahoma Republican Jim Inhofe, engineers a quick hearing and vote. And by next month, the Pentagon has a confirmed leader for the first time this year. But that’s going to require some legislative gymnastics.

INHOFE’S OTHER BIG WORRY: There are only 20 legislative days left before the Senate is scheduled to take its August recess. And not only does Inhofe have to get the Esper nomination through, he’s among a group of lawmakers increasingly worried about the lack of progress reaching agreement on a bipartisan deal to raise the budget caps.

Inhofe is one of 15 signatories to a letter sent last week to acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, urging them to reach a deal that would avoid a stop-gap continuing resolution that would once again hamstring the Pentagon, just as it is recovering from years of spending limits.

“As the world continues to become more dangerous, the American people rightfully expect their representatives in Washington to put aside political differences and do their jobs. Simply put, our adversaries do not handcuff their militaries with funding gimmicks like continuing resolutions — nor should we,” the letter concludes.

FOUR-STAR SHOCKER: Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. William Moran will retire instead of taking over as the Navy’s top admiral Navy Secretary Richard Spencer announced last night, citing poor judgment regarding a professional relationship.

WHERE THINGS STAND: Daily on Defense was on vacation last week and will take another summer break the first week of August. So as we return from a long Fourth of July weekend, here’s a quick recap of where we stand in the world’s top hot spots.

KOREA: After President Trump’s historic impromptu third summit at the end of June with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un — where Trump became the first U.S. president to step foot on the north side of the DMZ — the work begins to show some tangible progress toward denuclearization.

Secretary of State Pompeo said after the meeting between Trump and Kim that teams from both countries would gather in another week or two in a place to be determined to “start exchanging ideas.”

“The president, by getting together with Chairman Kim,” Pompeo said, “broke through and was able to get us the opportunity to get back to the negotiating table, which I'm excited about.”

IRAN: While the potential for war with Iran was averted when Trump called off a strike on the country in the eleventh hour, tensions continue to simmer, with Iran declaring it will begin enriching uranium above the 3.67% limit agreed to in the 2015 nuclear deal. That level of enrichment is still below bomb grade.

In making the announcement, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran was invoking a provision of the agreement that allows it to take “remedial steps” if any or all of the parties to the deal are not living up to the terms. Trump withdrew from the agreement last year.

“Today, Iran is taking its second round of remedial steps under Para 36 of the JCPOA. We reserve the right to continue to exercise legal remedies within JCPOA to protect our interests in the face of US #EconomicTerrorism,” Zarif said on Twitter . “All such steps are reversible only through E3 compliance.”

Speaking to reporters late yesterday in New Jersey, Trump issued a cryptic warning. “Iran better be careful because you enrich for one reason — and I won't tell you what the reason is, but it's no good. They better be careful,"" he said before boarding Air Force One.

“Iran’s latest expansion of its nuclear program will lead to further isolation and sanctions,” tweeted Pompeo yesterday. “Nations should restore the longstanding standard of no enrichment for Iran’s nuclear program.”

Britain, one of the countries still in the agreement, issued a statement through its foreign office saying that while Iran has broken the terms of the agreement, “the UK remains fully committed to the deal.” It called on Iran to “immediately stop and reverse all activities inconsistent with its obligations.”

AFGHANISTAN: While U.S. diplomats are touting “substantive progress” in peace talks with the Taliban, the group continues to carry out deadly attacks in Afghanistan targeting civilians, including children. For the second time in a week, a suicide bomber inflcited heavy casualties, this time on Ghazni province, where 12 people were killed and more than 170 wounded. Last week, an attack in Kabul killed 6 and wounded more than 100 others, including as many as 50 children.

While condemning both strikes, U.S. special representative Zalmay Khalilzad tweeted the horrific attacks show that “Peace has never been more urgent and is the only path to ending terror and violence.”

On Saturday he had tweeted , “The last 6 days of talks have been the most productive session to date. We made substantive progress on ALL 4 parts of a peace agreement: counter-terrorism assurances, troop withdrawal, participation in intra-Afghan dialogue & negotiations, and permanent & comprehensive ceasefire.”

The Taliban met yesterday for the first time with Afghan officials. The talks are set to resume today in Qatar.

TURKEY: President Trump continues to send mixed messages about Turkey’s refusal to give up its purchase of Russian S-400 air defense missiles, which the Pentagon insists is incompatible with operating and helping to build the U.S. F-35 and could compromise the Joint Strike Figher’s classified stealth technology.

“If Turkey procures the S-400, it will mean they will not receive the F-35. It's that simple,” said acting Defense Secretary Esper at NATO last month.

But at the G20 summit, President Trump lavished praise on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and blamed President Obama for the problem. “The president was not allowed to buy the Patriot missiles,” said Trump at a joint appearance with Erdogan in Osaka, Japan. “So he buys the other missile, and then, all of a sudden, they say, ‘Well, you can now buy our missile.’ You can't do business that way. It's not good. It's not good.”

For the record, both the Obama and Trump administrations tried to sell Patriot missiles to Turkey, but the deals always fell apart over Turkey’s demands for technology transfers.

With Russia set to deliver the S-400 as soon as this week, the United States could impose sanctions against Turkey under a 2017 law that bars cooperation with U.S. adversaries. “We're looking at different solutions. It's a problem, there's no question about it. We're looking at different solutions,” Trump said in Japan.

Trump has long promoted his administration’s energy achievements, praising the comeback of “beautiful, clean coal” in his first State of the Union address and the

advancement

of the U.S. as the top natural gas producer in his second. But this will be his first speech devoted entirely to the environment.

The timing of the event comes as environmental issues, and climate change in particular, are rising in importance among Democratic voters heading into 2020. Polls have shown global warming is now a top voting issue, ranking alongside with health care and the economy.

A new Washington Post-ABC News poll found that Americans disapprove of Trump’s position on many major issues. The lowest-ranking issue in the poll was climate change, with just 29 percent of respondents saying they approved of Trump's position.

During his presidency, Trump has rolled back EPA regulations on methane, pollution from power plants and vehicle fuel standards. He has also proposed lifting a major Obama-era rule protecting water.

Trump has noted that greenhouse gas emissions dropped during his first year in office, according to a 2018 report from the EPA. Some experts have argued that the decrease is largely attributable to the market’s switch to natural gas and away from coal — a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.

A new environmental initiative from the Trump administration involves tackling ocean debris. Wheeler laid out the effort at a June meeting of environment ministers from the world’s 20 largest economies.

Critics have already cast doubt on any message Monday from the president, who has said he intends to pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris climate accords from 2015.

“There was a time not long ago that we were continuing to make progress toward having the cleanest air and water on the planet but we have been slipping backwards since the Trump administration decided to place profits over people through their policy actions,” Mustafa Santiago Ali, a former top environmental justice official at EPA who resigned in 2017, said in a statement Monday."
James Comey’s daughter named to Jeffrey Epstein prosecution team,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Richard Drew'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/comeys-daughter-named-to-epstein-prosecution-team,"The Justice Department team that is leading the prosecution of alleged child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein includes the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey.

Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a press conference Monday that Maurene Comey is part of the public corruption unit handling the case against the well-connected and wealthy businessman.

Maurene Comey, an assistant U.S. attorney, was named alongside Alex Rossmiller and Alison Moe as the prosecutors assisting Berman with the case. James Comey, who was fired as FBI director in 2017 by President Trump, had been a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York before he became deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush.

Last year, James Comey said his wife Patrice “very much wanted Hillary Clinton to be the first woman president” and that he was pretty sure that his four daughters, if not all five of his children, had also wanted Clinton to defeat Trump in 2016.

“There was a lot of passion in this house for Hillary Clinton,” Comey said.

Comey also said his wife and daughters participated in the Women’s March the day after Trump’s inauguration.

Epstein was charged by prosecutors with conspiracy and with sex trafficking of underage girls, and faces up to 45 years behind bars. Prosecutors consider him a flight risk and have asked a judge to keep Epstein behind bars pending his trial.

During the raid on Epstein’s Manhattan mansion, investigators say they seized an “extraordinary volume” of photographs of apparently underage girls."
State Department launches panel focused on human rights and natural law,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department', 'July At Pm']",07-06-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/state-department-to-name-panel-focused-on-human-rights-and-natural-law/2019/07/06/3bfe001e-9f54-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in past remarks about the creation of his Commission on Unalienable Rights, said he felt it was important to evaluate “how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy.” (Jacquelyn Martin/AFP/Getty Images)

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday announced the creation of an advisory commission on human rights that has engendered controversy since it was proposed.

Pompeo said the Commission on Unalienable Rights “will provide the intellectual grist of what I hope will be one of the most profound re-examinations of inalienable rights in the world since the 1948 Universal Declaration.”

The panel will be headed by Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard Law School professor who wrote a book about the United Nations’ 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pompeo was Glendon’s research assistant when he studied law at Harvard. Glendon is also a former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.

Besides her academic research, Glendon is known for her antiabortion views. At the 1995 U.N. World Conference on Women in Beijing, she fought successfully to keep abortion from being listed as a human right.

In thanking Pompeo for the appointment, Glendon said this is a time when “basic human rights are being misunderstood by many, manipulated by many and ignored by the world’s worst human rights violators.”

Some civil rights groups expressed concerns that the new commission could become a vehicle to chip away at same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Jamil Dakwar, head of the ACLU’s Human Rights Program, said it is an attempt to redefine human rights and “to roll back decades of progress in achieving full rights for marginalized communities.”

When the panel was first outlined in an internal State Department memo, the proposed chair was Robert P. George, a Princeton University professor who was a co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposed same-sex marriage, and a prominent antiabortion advocate.

A State Department official said that George will not be on the commission and that the panel will not weigh in on either issue.

“They will not make any pronouncements on gay marriage and abortion,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preview plans for the commission.

Its work is likely to be heavily scrutinized, nevertheless. The commission’s job is to provide “fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” according to a notice published in May in the Federal Register.

The mention of natural law, a philosophy that all human beings are endowed with certain rights, set off alarm among advocates of legal abortion and same-sex marriage. The phrase is used by those who argue that basic human rights — such as free speech and the expectation that governments should not torture people — are made vulnerable when social goods such as education, health care and clean water are elevated to the characterization of human rights.

Daniel Philpott, a University of Notre Dame professor who was initially mentioned as a potential commission member, said that natural law reflects a concern that human rights have gone off the rails, in part because of abortion and claims about marriage rights.

“The idea is these claims of human rights are not based upon natural law or the truth of the human person,” he said. “In a sense, these are false claims to human rights. It brings down the cause of human rights in general. Why should we pursue other human rights if human rights can be anything one faction or party advocates them to be?”

Last month, five Democratic senators sent Pompeo a letter expressing concern about the commission’s focus on natural law, calling it “a term sometimes used in association with discrimination against marginalized populations.”

Proponents of a reassessment say perceptions of what qualifies as a human right have evolved since the days when it took a gross abuse, such as a gulag or apartheid, to raise significant concern. Pompeo appeared to endorse that view, saying the commission will ask the most basic of questions.

“What does it mean to say or claim that something is in fact a human right?” he said. “How do we know or how do we determine whether that claim, that this or that is a human right? Is it true and therefore ought it to be honored?”

The commission is composed of experts, philosophers and human rights activists from every political persuasion. Pompeo said their deliberations will be grounded in the nation’s “founding principles” and those included in the U.N. document on human rights.

“Every once in a while we need to step back and reflect seriously on where we are, where we’ve been and whether we’re headed in the right direction,” he said.

Pompeo bemoaned the continuing human rights violations that persist seven decades after the declaration was drafted and said multinational institutions that are supposed to police human rights have not proved up to the task amid confusion on what constitutes a human right.

“We must therefore be vigilant that human rights discourse not be corrupted or hijacked or used for dubious or malignant purposes,” he said.

The commission will get input from the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL), which already produces annual reports rating countries on their records for human rights and religious liberty. Critics have wondered whether the volunteer panel will undermine the bureau, which for more than four decades has been responsible for holding abusive governments to account.

“We don’t need this commission,” said Michael Posner, the State Department’s assistant secretary for DRL from 2009 to 2013. “What we need is for the U.S. government, the secretary of state and the president to abide by and uphold international human rights standards we already have adopted.”

Modern human rights law is rooted both in religious concepts and experience. Many of the basic principles are embedded in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which in turn formed the basis for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations after World War II and the Holocaust.

William L. Saunders, a human rights scholar at Catholic University who also was mentioned as a potential commission candidate, said that getting input from experts outside of government is sensible.

“I would think the Universal Declaration will guide and shape reflection by the new commission,” he said in an email.

Pompeo has spoken out about human rights abuses in some countries, including China’s detention of Uighur Muslims, Iran’s treatment of religious and ethnic minorities, and the repressive policies of Cuba and Venezuela.

“The distinctive mark of Western civilization is the belief in the inherent worth of human beings, with the attendant respect for God-authored rights and liberties,” Pompeo said in a May speech at the Claremont Institute. “Indeed, the Declaration says that ‘all men are created equal.’ And we ought to help nations protect these first things — and human rights, as well.”

Critics, however, have faulted him for not saying more about abuses committed by governments friendly to the United States. The administration’s response to last year’s killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi remains a particular concern.

“When Mr. Khashoggi gets murdered in Turkey and we know there’s a senior Saudi leader, the crown prince, involved, we ought to be saying something about it,” said Posner, the former DRL head. “When the government of the Philippines is executing thousands of people, we ought to be saying something. When a free press is denied a place in Turkey, we ought to say something.

“That’s what diplomacy is about,” he said. “That’s what DRL has done for 40-some years. The idea that we need fresh thinking or need to somehow revise and rethink what the principles are flies in the face of that history and experience.”"
Trump says US will 'no longer deal' with British ambassador after leaked anti-Trump cables,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-us-will-no-longer-deal-with-british-ambassador-after-leaked-anti-trump-cables,"President Trump announced Monday that the U.S. will ""no longer deal"" with the British ambassador to the United States, after leaked diplomatic cables showed the ambassador secretly slamming Trump in frank and personal terms.

The extraordinary development seemingly rendered Britain's representative to the U.S. a persona non grata for the first time in more than a century. And it came amid reports that the ambassador, Kim Darroch, is actually popular among some White House officials.

""I do not know the Ambassador, but he is not liked or well thought of within the U.S.,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""We will no longer deal with him.""

On Sunday, Trump called Darroch ineffective and implied he wasn't even worth responding to.

""We’ve had our little ins and outs with a couple of countries, and I would say that the U.K. -- their ambassador has not served the U.K. well, I can tell you that,"" Trump told reporters. ""We are not big fans of that man, and he has not served the U.K. well. So, I can understand it and I can say things about him, but I won’t bother.""

Trump also tweeted Monday: ""I have been very critical about the way the U.K. and Prime Minister Theresa May handled Brexit. What a mess she and her representatives have created. I told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way.""

He later added, ""The good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new Prime Minister. While I thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent State Visit last month, it was the Queen who I was most impressed with!""

Responding to Trump's remarks on Monday, a Downing Street spokesperson said the U.K. has ""a special and enduring relationship with the US based on our long history and commitment to shared values and that will continue to be the case.""

""'We have made clear to the US how unfortunate this leak is,"" the spokesperson said. ""The selective extracts leaked do not reflect the closeness of, and the esteem in which we hold, the relationship. At the same time we have also underlined the importance of Ambassadors being able to provide honest, unvarnished assessments of the politics in their country. Sir Kim Darroch continues to have the Prime Minister's full support.""

WATCH: TRUMP SAYS U.S. 'NOT BIG FANS' OF DARROCH

In the leaked documents, Darroch described the Trump administration as ""diplomatically clumsy and inept"" and said he doubted it would become ""substantially more normal.""

The memo was one of several documents published by the Mail on Sunday in which Darroch apparently made highly negative statements about the government of Britain's closest ally.

Josh Dawsey, a reporter at The Washington Post, wrote on Twitter that ""Trump’s own team likes the ambassador and regularly dines and socializes at the embassy with him.""

Added George Conway, the husband of top White House aide Kellyanne Conway and a frequent critic of Trump: ""Indeed they do. They never miss parties at the British Embassy. They love the ambassador, as does everyone else (except for a certain narcissist-in-chief). Frankly, the ambassador was being kind in his assessment of the narcissist-in-chief.""

International incidents involving British diplomats in the U.S. are rare, but not unprecedented. British ambassdor Lionel Sackville-West was summarily sacked in 1888 for writing the so-called Murchison letter, which touched off a firestorm by indicating that Britain preferred Grover Cleveland over Republican Benjamin Harrison. (Republicans publicized the letter, helping Harrison win the White House.)

And in May 1856, President Franklin Pierce expelled John F. Crampton, then the British ambasador to the U.S., and several other British diplomats, following a lengthy spat over British efforts to recruit North Americans to fight in Crimea.

""It's not entirely unprecedented,"" Dan Drezner, Professor of International Politics at The Fletcher School of Tufts University, told Fox News. ""When WikiLeaks released a trove of diplomatic cables, the Bolivarian leader of Ecuador expelled the U.S. Ambassador. Even in that case, however, the Ecuadoran government went through the proper diplomatic channels. A PNG-by-tweet for the leak of cables confirming mainstream media reporting of the Trump administration is definitely new.""

HAPPIER TIMES: RECAPPING TRUMP'S VISIT WITH THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND IN JUNE

Over the weekend, Britain's Foreign Office did not challenge the authenticity of the leaked Darroch documents, which covered the period of 2017 to the present, and came to Darroch's defense. It called the leak ""mischievous behavior"" and said the public has expected diplomats to provide honest assessments of the politics in the countries where they're posted.

The Trump administration has broken from Britain on key issues such as climate change and preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

The Foreign Office said the leaks would not harm the productive relationship between the British government and the Trump White House. A formal investigation of the leak may be set in motion in the coming days.

It is customary for senior British diplomats posted overseas to file straightforward memos to senior ministers and security services analysts back home so political trends and possible threats to British interests could be gauged, but it's unusual for a large number of them to be made public.

Justice Secretary David Gauke called the leak ""disgraceful"" but said Britain ""should expect our ambassadors to tell the truth, as they see it.""

Trump has not hesitated to inject himself into Britain's political fray, repeatedly criticizing Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit negotiating strategy and praising both Brexit party leader Nigel Farage and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a strong contender to become the next prime minister.

Trump's EPA stands up for consumers and freedom by standing up to the ethanol lobby,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/trumps-epa-stands-up-for-consumers-and-freedom-by-standing-up-to-the-ethanol-lobby,"President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency took a step toward draining the swamp by curbing the amount of corn ethanol being forced into our economy by the crony capitalist ethanol mandate.

Big Corn is exploding with shock and dismay, as are corn-friendly lawmakers. But the White House shouldn’t heed the objections of these subsidized corporate moonshiners. Instead, he should lean on Congress to go further and reduce the ethanol mandate to zero.

Ethanol is a fuel alcohol derived from plants, in this country mostly from corn. Without federal support, there would be a very small market for ethanol, which is less powerful than gasoline, typically more expensive, cannot be shipped by pipeline, and tends to corrode engines.

The federal renewable fuel standard, also known as the RFS and the ethanol mandate, is King Corn’s current gravy train. The mandate requires refineries to blend a certain amount of ethanol into their gasoline. The EPA has some leeway on this score, and the agency has used it to protect consumers rather than the ethanol lobby.

The fuel standard requires at least 15 billion gallons of “conventional biofuels,” basically corn ethanol, for 2020. The ethanol lobby wanted the Trump administration to require more ethanol than even the law requires. Trump’s EPA further infuriated the industry by issuing exemptions for small refineries, which often struggle to get their hands on the amounts of ethanol required to meet the mandates.

The corn lobby angrily denounces these exemptions as “small refinery bailouts,” in the words of Geoff Cooper, president of the Renewable Fuels Association. Consider for a moment the perverse sense of entitlement here. An organization representing for-profit businesses, firms engaged in enterprise and supposedly proud of their product, calls it a ""bailout"" when a potential customer is granted limited freedom to not buy their product.

This is how crony capitalism not only distorts the economy and corrupts our politics (watch the Democratic presidential candidates bow before the altar of ethanol in Iowa these days), but how it also corrupts our businesses.

We understand that some of ethanol's biggest champions are powerful. We understand that Trump's political allies include some ethanol hustlers. And we understand the desire to help farmers, especially at a moment when tariffs are unfairly hurting them.

But if Trump cares about the economy, and about draining the swamp, he will not give into King Corn's demands. In fact, he should go in the other direction.

Trump should call on his friends in Congress to kill the ethanol mandate. Pass and sign a law winding the mandate down from its 15 billion gallons down to zero gallons in 2025. At the same time, scrap the mandate for ""advanced"" biofuels. If these fuels are so great, then consumers will buy them without a mandate.

That's how capitalism works, even if the swamp wants it to work differently."
U.S. says its producers harmed by some structural steel imports,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-steel/u-s-producers-harmed-by-some-structural-steel-imports-commerce-department-idUSKCN1U32GV,"FILE PHOTO: A worker walks past rolls of steel wires at a factory in Nantong, Jiangsu province, China July 3, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Monday said domestic producers were being harmed by imports of fabricated structural steel from China and Mexico, and that it would instruct the customs agency to collect cash deposits from importers of such steel.

The U.S. Commerce Department said it had found that imports from Canada were not being unfairly subsidized.

Mexico said in a statement that a U.S. countervailing duty investigation of Mexican fabricated structural steel was an “ordinary” anti-dumping probe with no relation to earlier tariff threats by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Mexico added that its economy ministry would defend the interests of the companies under investigation, and that it had been actively participating in anti-subsidy procedures since early 2019. It did not give further details in the statement.

The preliminary subsidy determination does not endanger ratification of the new North American trade deal, Mexico’s deputy foreign minister for the region, Jesus Seade, said on social network Twitter.That deal was designed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement that governs more than $1.2 trillion of mutual trade.

The U.S. International Trade Commission said in March that imports of fabricated structural steel from Canada, China and Mexico were harming domestic producers.

Fabricated structural steel is used in major building projects, such as bridges, buildings, parking decks and ports. An industry trade group had filed a petition asking for the trade case to be launched.

In 2018, the United States imported $722.5 million worth of fabricated structural steel from Canada, $897.5 million worth from China and $622.4 million worth from Mexico, according to the Commerce Department.

The department is expected to make its final ruling on the imports around Nov. 19."
Reluctant witnesses in FISA abuse probe agree to talk to DOJ inspector general,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Catherine Herridge', 'Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc', 'Based In Washington', 'D.C. She Covers Intelligence', 'The Justice Department', 'The Department Of Homeland Security. Herridge Joined Fnc In As A London-Based Correspondent.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reluctant-witnesses-in-fisa-abuse-probe-agree-to-talk-to-doj-inspector-general,"Key witnesses sought for questioning by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz early in his investigation into alleged government surveillance abuse have come forward at the 11th hour, Fox News has learned.

Sources familiar with the matter said at least one witness outside the Justice Department and FBI started cooperating -- a breakthrough that came after Attorney General William Barr ordered U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead a separate investigation into the origins of the bureau’s 2016 Russia case that laid the foundation for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.

While the investigative phase of the inspector general’s long-running probe is said to be complete, the sources said recent developments required some witnesses to be reinterviewed. And while Barr testified that he expected the report into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuse to be ready in May or last month, multiple sources said the timeline has slipped.

""The wheels of inspector general investigations move very, very slowly,"" former senior DOJ official Tom Dupree told Fox News.

Dupree, who served as deputy assistant attorney general from 2007 to 2009, does not have firsthand knowledge of the current IG case but is familiar with the process. He added, ""Like any investigation, you talk to one person, something that person tells you sends you back … to the first person, so it can be a very extensive, exhaustive process, because you are constantly picking up leads, interviewing former sources and navigating complex questions of classified information.""

Late-breaking information is known to delay such investigations. Horowitz’s office similarly encountered new evidence late in the process of the IG review into law enforcement decisions during the 2016 Hillary Clinton email investigation. In this case, additional FISA information came to light late in the process – including October 2016 contact (first reported by The Hill and confirmed by Fox News) between a senior State Department official and a former British spy Christopher Steele, who authored the infamous and salacious anti-Trump dossier.

The State Department contact with Steele was relayed to a senior FBI official. The timeline matters because about two weeks later, the FBI and DOJ used Steele's unverified research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign, to secure a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. At the very least, it's been argued, Steele's contact with another government agency should have been a red flag for the FBI because it may have violated his confidential human source agreement.

Steele was later fired by the FBI over his media contacts before the 2016 presidential election. The Page surveillance warrant is the central issue of the DOJ IG’s review.

With the timeline for Horowitz’s report not public, one of the wild cards is the final review by the FBI and DOJ, which includes classification issues and could take weeks.

A spokesman for Horowitz would not comment on the report's status. But during largely unrelated testimony in November, Horowitz offered some guidance for the timeline of the FISA abuse probe in response to questions from GOP Rep. Jim Jordan.

""What I can say is given the volume of documents we've had and the number of witnesses it looks like we'll need to interview, we are likely to be in the same sort of general range of documents and witnesses as the last report,"" Horowitz said, referring to his team's review of the Clinton email case. ""It wouldn't surprise me if we are in that million or so plus range of documents and a hundred-ish or so interviews. The last review, as you know, took us about … 16 months or so.""

If that same guidance holds, the window for completion would begin this month, though it remains unclear how much the DOJ/FBI review and the additional interviews could delay the process."
"Pompeo unveils human rights commission, critics suggest it may rollback protections",https://www.cnn.com,['Nicole Gaouette'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/08/politics/pompeo-unalienable-rights-commission/index.html,"Washington (CNN) US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a new commission to examine the role of human rights in US foreign policy and which rights should be ""honored,"" raising fears that the Trump administration may be trying to roll back protections for women, LGBTQ groups and minorities.

""What does it mean to say or claim that something is, in fact, a human right,"" Pompeo said at the State Department Monday, as he unveiled the Commission on Unalienable Rights. ""How do we know or how do we determine whether that claim that this or that is a human right, is it true, and therefore, ought it to be honored?"" the top diplomat asked.

""Words like 'rights' can be used for good or evil,"" he added.

Pompeo said the committee will conduct ""one of the most profound reexaminations of the unalienable rights in the world since the 1948 Universal Declaration,"" of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations , declaring that ""all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights"" and are entitled to a series of rights.

Pompeo argued that the definition of human rights has grown fuzzy, that the concept is now sometimes used to defend ""gross violations"" and that the US has to be ""vigilant that human rights discourse not be corrupted or hijacked or used for dubious or malignant purposes.""

Critics worry commission will 'weaken human rights'

But many see the commission as ""a new body designed to weaken human rights,"" as New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the lead Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, described it on Monday.

Menendez and others question why Pompeo did not include the State Department bureau that focuses on human rights in the creation of the commission or its work, staffing it instead with some high-profile opponents of both LGBTQ rights and abortion, such as his former mentor who he appointed as its head, Harvard law professor Mary Ann Glendon.

They point to the administration's record on human rights, including President Donald Trump's approach to Saudi Arabia's killing of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the President's affinity for authoritarian leaders with appalling human rights records, such as North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

They flag the administration's aggressive push to limit reproductive rights and access to abortion, its silence on LGBTQ abuses abroad and raise the possibility that the secretary is injecting his faith into matters of policy and law. They also question the language being used to describe the re-evaluation of rights.

""This whole thing has been characterized by unusual language,"" said Jeremy Kadden, senior international policy advocate for the Human Rights Campaign.

""This is an attempt to pull back a US human rights vision that we've had for decades and create this new vision that uses these new terms like 'unalienable rights' or 'natural rights' or 'natural law,' "" Kadden said. ""These are all things that have been used by extremist people on the far right, to create a gap between what they consider unalienable rights and alienable rights.""

Blurring the line between church and state?

Like some on Capitol Hill, Serra Sippel, president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity, a US-based nonprofit that promotes sexual and reproductive health and rights in the US and abroad, raised concerns that Pompeo was blurring the line between church and state.

She pointed to an April interview Pompeo did with the Christian Broadcasting Network, in which he said that as a member of Congress, then CIA director and now as secretary of state, ""the task that I have is informed by my understanding of my faith, my belief in Jesus Christ as the Savior ... I think that makes a real difference.""

There is, she said, ""a disturbing pattern of not only undermining human rights of LGBTQ and women and other people who face stigma and discrimination, but also this pattern of inserting Secretary Pompeo's personal faith into the work of the State Department. The undermining of the separation of church and state, and human rights are really hand in hand.""

Serra noted that one right enshrined in the 1948 UN declaration on human rights is the right to request asylum.

""This administration is using rights language for the dubious purpose of denying rights to certain people -- women, LGBTQ and refugees -- look what's happening on the border,"" she said. ""That's a clear violation of the rights of those trying to claim asylum.""

New York Rep. Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the State Department had been very opaque about the creation and purpose of the commission, ""responding vaguely only at the 11th hour. That's why I cosponsored a measure that recently passed the House to prohibit funding for this bizarre effort.""

""The Secretary wants to make an end run around established structures, expertise, and the law to give preference to discriminatory ideologies that would narrow protections for women, including on reproductive rights; for members of the LGBTQI community; and for other minority groups,"" Engel charged.

The State Department did not respond to requests for comment about the criticisms and concerns being raised.

Supporters say Pompeo's move is 'logical'

Others said the concerns were an over-reaction, and that it is a good idea to re-examine what the US considers an important right.

""It's as logical to have a debate about how you rank, order rights as you have a debate about how you rank, order interests,"" said James Carafano, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, who drew a comparison to the way the US defense ""constantly"" debates what constitutes a vital US national security interest.

""The reason why you debate those things is that it defines your level of interest; that defines how much resources you're willing to invest,"" Carafano said. ""A government can't do everything, so differentiating between what's truly vital and what's nice to have is important.""

Glendon, the head of the new commission, was a mentor of Pompeo's at Harvard Law School and is known for her opposition to abortion.

She has stirred controversy in the past. A staunch Catholic, in 2002 she criticized the decision to nominate the Boston Globe for a Pulitzer Prize for its reporting on the sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests, saying that ""if fairness & accuracy have anything to do with it, awarding the Pulitzer to the Boston Globe would be like giving the Nobel Peace Prize to Osama bin Laden.""

She also declined an award from Notre Dame University in 2009, because it had asked President Barack Obama to give the commencement address and she disagreed with his support for abortion rights.

Pompeo said members of the commission include Russell Berman, Peter Berkowitz, Paolo Carozza, Hamza Yusuf Hanson, Jacqueline Rivers, Meir Soloveichik, Katrina Lantos Swett, Christopher Tollefsen, and David Tse-Chien Pan."
It's time to think more seriously about the implications of elderly presidents,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/its-time-to-think-more-seriously-about-the-implications-of-elderly-presidents,"Should he win reelection and complete his full second term, President Trump will surpass Ronald Reagan as the oldest person to ever hold the office. But Trump's age is hardly ever talked about, because leading Democrats Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would be older than Reagan at the start of their presidencies.

As medical science improves and life expectancy increases, more and more candidates may be willing to test the limits of age. And there's nothing in the law that prevents them from running and winning. While one could argue that it should ultimately be up to the voters to decide whether somebody is fit to serve, there are clear issues with this test.

One is that the U.S. Constitution set the minimum age to be president at 35. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most influential voices in her party, is unable to join the two dozen other candidates seeking the party's nomination. Even if Democratic primary voters wanted to support her, they could not. So if she can't run simply because she's too young, is it stripping Americans of any more of a choice by saying they can not vote for somebody who would be in their 80s during a first term?

The second issue is that even if they wanted to, there's a lack of objective information available for voters to determine whether somebody is physically and mentally unfit to serve out a term in office. Candidates are not required to submit medical information, and both Trump (with his ridiculous doctor's note) and Hillary Clinton (with her pneumonia cover-up) were opaque about their health in 2016.

So, one other solution short of age limits would be to require a more specific set of medical information from candidates for office.

There also may need to be a more specific explanation, with measurable health metrics, of the circumstances under which the 25th Amendment can be invoked. Section 4 of the amendment reads, ""Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President."" But that is incredibly open-ended and subject to interpretation.

None of these (age limits, medical disclosure requirements, revisiting the 25th Amendment) might really be a workable solution. But given that it's becoming more common for elderly candidates to run for president, we should be thinking about the problem in a serious matter. Even if a candidate looks vigorous on the campaign trail, a lot can happen within four years in a demanding job, and, in general, somebody in their 80s is going to be at a significantly greater risk of having some sort of adverse physical or mental health decline within that period. This should be a serious part of our political discourse at a time when so many elderly candidates are seeking office."
The Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes,https://thehill.com,[],07-07-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/451617-the-department-of-defense-needs-mark-esper-and-a-few-policy-changes,"Just over halfway through the Trump administration’s first term, the military is getting its third secretary of Defense in Mark Esper. Although the U.S. military is the finest fighting force in the world, even the best need consistent leadership. Fortunately, the Department of Defense (DOD) is receiving a great leader in Esper. He is superbly qualified, by experience and temperament — a family man, combat veteran infantry officer, West Point graduate, defense industry and policy expert, and an intellectual with high-level Pentagon civilian leadership experience.

Esper understands the importance of civilian leadership and how to bring sustainable change in policy, strategy and modernization for the military. However, he does face significant challenges to defend, deter and defeat, if necessary, enemies of the United States — and some of those challenges are at home.

The U.S. focus on counterterrorism not only shifted resources away from modernization of military force planning, structure and technology, it enabled other nation states to challenge, if not close, the competitive edge of the U.S. military. The overemphasis of strategy and resources on Afghanistan and Iraq, President Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq (precipitated by an unnecessary invasion of Iraq), and a botched Libya plan enabled America’s adversaries to recognize the changes in the world order. In addition, America’s adversaries took advantage of the divisive state of U.S. politics. Bottom line, America was being outflanked by its competitors.

Chinese alternatives to American values of democracy, rule of law, human rights and a free-market economy are creating a new economic cold war that will face off the United States and its partners and allies against those of China. Through strategic diplomacy, China has extended its influence into Africa and Latin America, while using the People’s Liberation Army as a capitalist tool to strengthen Chinese influence. China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative presents even deeper regional influence across the Middle East and into Europe.

Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinThe Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes Trump's coarseness, Democrats' shrillness do US foreign policy no favors Biden: There will be 'no NATO' if Trump is reelected MORE, meanwhile, aims to return Russia to its legacy where governments must consider Russian perspectives or actions in any region. Russian influence continues to gain in Eastern Europe, where Putin sees NATO as his biggest threat to regional influence. Putin has inserted Russian diplomacy and military power in the Middle East, through Syria and Iran, in order to have a seat at the table. And, surprisingly, Russia returned to the table with the Taliban to counter U.S. influence in this region as well. Most concerning is that Russia and China increasingly are allying themselves diplomatically.

The Middle East could be spiraling toward regional war. Iran, with Russian support, presents the single greatest threat to any region’s stability because of its revolutionary rhetoric, desire for nuclear weapons, hatred of Israel and the historic Shia-Sunni divide. The violence and destruction caused by ISIS, the United States’s haphazard withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, an unprecedented number of refugees, and belligerent rhetoric and actions, particularly involving the Strait of Hormuz, have created a powder keg.

So, what should the new secretary of Defense do?

First, American society needs robust dialogue on what it expects its all-volunteer force (AVF) to do and how big the military should be to protect the United States. The AVF is more professional and experienced in its purpose, but it is not completely positive. A large AVF is costly to taxpayers. Its personnel costs possibly crowded out necessary long-term defense spending on weapons, infrastructure and technology advances. It struggles to compete in a highly competitive labor market, and has created a warrior caste among Americans.

The United States should not take the position that it’s in a state of perpetual conflict, which has been expressed by military and political leaders. This perspective results in overuse of the military as an instrument of government power and stresses the AVF to points of concern for American society.

Second, the U.S. must get out of Afghanistan now. We should have left after destroying most of al Qaeda following 9/11. No one can predict with any certainty of intelligence that another terrorist attack will emanate from Afghanistan; there are plenty of ungoverned spaces and financiers in the world that can make that happen. We should instead put more resources and effort into developing an alliance with India and reinforcing the Indo-Pacific strategy.

Third, modernization and acquisition changes to policy and process must occur faster, while taking acceptable risk in current readiness. DOD must hedge its bets and focus on threats to the survival of the U.S. Constitution and its values, and not every emerging character of conflict in the world. Right now, the U.S. military is doing too much at one time. The United States must invest in high-end technological capabilities such as cyber offense and defense, advanced aircraft, hypersonic weapons, directed energy and 5G telephony to counter future threats. DOD must shed its propensity to make incremental changes if it is going to transform for the future.

Fourth, the U.S. must reinforce European states and NATO to confront emerging threats. The biggest threat emanates mainly from Russian aggression, evidenced by its actions in Crimea and Ukraine, disinformation operations through digital media, and its increased foreign military activity in places such as the Black Sea. NATO, however, faces other threats such as uncontrolled migration, cyber threats and attacks, and Chinese strategic competition.

Fifth, the Indo-Pacific region must remain a strategic priority in order to maintain U.S. regional balance of power because of China’s assertive posture and overall global trade. American isolationist policies are hampering the development and maintenance of U.S. alliances and partnerships in response to China’s rise. U.S. presence and interaction with India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and other Southeast Asia countries will hedge against China’s economic and military rise and reconstruct the regional order.

As secretary of Defense, Esper clearly will face a difficult set of circumstances for the next few years. He is a great choice — the right leader for the job. His partnership, however, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoKobach to run for Senate in Kansas The Hill's Morning Report - Democrats assail border conditions as Congress returns to work The Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes MORE, his West Point classmate, must remain a priority. If Pompeo keeps the State Department engaged and in the lead, he will give Esper the best chance to transform and rightsize a more technologically proficient, high-intensity fighting force that is utilized more appropriately in protecting the United States.

The department cannot continue to have temporary leadership when it has the blood and treasure of American fathers and mothers deployed in combat zones. A Senate-confirmed secretary must be present to make the critical decisions presented to our armed forces daily. Congress should step up now and immediately confirm Esper.

"Boston Housing Authority chief Bill McGonagle, the city’s landlord, takes his leave",https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-07-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/07/07/boston-housing-authority-chief-bill-mcgonagle-city-landlord-takes-his-leave/kJbKncFMkXsg8yK1uZI8yH/story.html,"He was executive assistant to Boston Housing Authority administrator Doris Bunte, tasked with helping to manage the desegregation effort, when shots were fired into his clearly marked city car parked outside his house on Dorchester Street in Southie. As he recalls, he had been quoted in the Globe that morning saying the BHA would not be deterred by threats of violence. The shots were an unmistakable message that his work to settle families of color into white neighborhoods wasn’t universally appreciated.

Bill McGonagle had agreed to serve on the front lines of the city’s project to integrate public housing in South Boston and Charlestown in the late 1980s, but he didn’t know that assignment would hit so close to home.

“My three kids were at the breakfast table with my wife when that happened,” he said last week. “And my kids were babies then, little tykes.”

Now McGonagle, 67, is stepping down as the head of the BHA, after 40 years with the agency, including the past decade as its head. He departs with a well-deserved reputation as one of the most passionate champions of poor people in city government.

At the time he took on the job as point person in integrating public housing, the city was still reeling from the battles over court-ordered school desegregation. Not only did South Boston and Charlestown have virtually no residents of color, black people didn’t even feel comfortable walking down the streets there.

The idea of moving black and brown families into the most hostile territory in the city — the very neighborhoods that had been powder kegs during the busing crisis of the 1970s — seemed like a recipe for disaster. At the same time, denying them access to the city’s biggest public housing developments — which had been unspoken policy — was blatantly discriminatory.

After a lawsuit by the NAACP, the city agreed to take the first steps toward integrating public housing.

As a lifelong resident of South Boston who had grown up in the Mary Ellen McCormack housing development, McGonagle was an obvious choice to serve as a liaison between the Boston Housing Authority and the residents of the projects that were being integrated. But “obvious’’ should not be confused with “easy.”

Successfully integrating South Boston and Charlestown was a key moment in the city’s racial history, and McGonagle played a huge role. But he gives much of the credit to others.

“The real heroes of that integration effort were the Bessie Paynes, the Liz Clinkscales, and the families of color that moved into those communities back in those days,” McGonagle said, reeling off the names of early integration pioneers in Boston.

In a field where every election results in turnover, careers like McGonagle’s have become rare. He started at the BHA as a custodian; he has to be the last department head who served in the Flynn administration.

But his achievements are about far more than longevity. “When I became mayor, I asked him to stay on because he produced results, and the residents love him,” Mayor Martin J. Walsh said. “He cares about poor people, and he cares about helping people. Every development you go to, the tenants just love him.”

The BHA houses 25,000 tenants in developments across the city and provides subsidies for about 25,000 more. Some 98 percent of its units are occupied, which reflects the high demand for them. The annual income of BHA residents is just $15,000 a year. In effect, the BHA administrator is the landlord for Boston’s poorest residents.

As demand for housing has remained intense, aid from the federal government has sharply declined. That has gotten worse in the Trump years, but federal aid for low-income housing has been insufficient for years.

That reality has transformed McGonagle’s job. Preserving affordability and maintaining some of the nation’s oldest housing developments have forced him to become a developer. The city’s biggest housing projects, including Bunker Hill, Bromley Heath (now known as the Mildred C. Hailey Apartments), and his beloved Mary Ellen McCormack have been or will be completely renovated, through public-private partnerships that will combine public housing with market-rate housing, a project that will take at least a decade to complete.

In effect, affluent people eager to move into desirable properties will subsidize the housing of their low-income neighbors. It’s an ingenious way to renovate old housing that won’t survive another generation without it.

People who are leaving high-profile jobs always say they’re going to spend more time with their families, but McGonagle really means it. His five grandchildren have active lives, and he’s not about to miss that. He also plans to work in the field of substance recovery, which he describes as close to his heart.

He leaves a legacy of tirelessly fighting for tenants in ways large and small and helping to tear down some of Boston’s most stubborn and entrenched barriers. The housing developments in Charlestown and South Boston are probably the most integrated neighborhoods in Boston now. Peacefully so.

It was always the small moments, he said, that showed him change was possible, recalling a scene from the early, tumultuous days of integration at Old Colony in Southie.

It was a hot summer day, and the children in the development — black and white, maybe 5 or 6 years old — were playing together in a kiddie pool in the courtyard.

“It was clear to me that those kids were going to grow up together,” McGonagle said. “And at the end of the day, they would be neighbors, and friends.”

The DOJ’s Office of Inspector General, led by Michael Horowitz, released the summary on Monday. The probe concluded that the DEA group supervisor “violated DEA policy” by “repeatedly meeting with the CS alone,” including at the source’s home. The inquiry also found that the group supervisor “went on two personal trips” with the source and let the source visit the group supervisor’s family and friends.

“None of these individuals were made aware that the group supervisor’s companion was a DEA confidential source who was participating in drug trafficking investigations involving violent criminals,” the DOJ inspector general wrote. “In so doing, the group supervisor deceived these individuals and exposed them and their families to potential danger.”

DOJ’s watchdog also concluded that the DEA assistant special agent in charge signed off on improper payments and failed to properly manage the group supervisor.

The report said “criminal prosecution was declined” by the Justice Department.

Horowitz’s investigation into alleged FISA abuse has reportedly concluded, although last-minute witnesses and a tricky classification process mean it may be a while until the report is released."

“We’re now a global operation, and we became that because of the DOD,” Kirila says.

Kirila Fire Training Inc. represents a sector of the regional economy that has developed a distinct relationship with the defense industry, which translates into millions of dollars worth of business every year.

Manufacturers, contractors and distributors across the region are vital links in a supply chain that keeps the armed forces prepared and equipped with the resources necessary to defend the country.

While weapons systems and aircraft command most of the attention, the government must also rely on those contractors that manufacture and supply bolts, hoses, small components, construction services and everyday items that collectively allow the defense industry to operate effectively.

During fiscal 2018, companies in Mahoning, Trumbull and Columbiana counties secured $44.9 million worth of business with the Department of Defense, according to USASpending.gov. Thus far in fiscal 2019, these counties had $10.7 million worth of defense work on their books, according to the site.

In western Pennsylvania, companies in Lawrence County registered $1.6 million in DOD business during fiscal 2018 and stood at $150,580 through fiscal 2019. Meanwhile, companies in Mercer County saw $3.2 million worth of business with the Defense Department and secured $149,157 through fiscal 2019.

A sizeable chunk of defense contracts awarded to Trumbull County companies has gone to Kirila, which specializes in training military personnel on how to respond to fire emergencies on aircraft and vehicles. The company manufactures and fabricates mock aircraft, towers and vehicles and equips them with a patented ignition system that can spark blazes inside and outside the craft.

A mock aircraft made at Kirila’s fab shop awaits completion. The unit is slated to be transported to an air base where ground crew receive firefighting training.

During a morning in late spring at the company complex in Harford Township, workers were putting the final touches on one mock aircraft, while the skeleton of another was under construction in an adjacent building. These structures, along with the company’s ignition systems, are primarily shipped to U.S. Air Force bases all over the country, where flight and ground crews receive training on how to combat fires.

Kirila mobile units serve as a part office, part living quarters for those employees who travel across the country to install these systems, he says.

“We just did a large project at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida for the fire and research lab there,” Kirila says. He estimates there are just three other companies in the country that have the capabilities Kirila commands. “We’re pretty busy,” he says.

Trumbull County companies secured $20.3 million in business from DOD in fiscal 2018 and have posted $481,720 worth of business thus far in 2019.

“We’ve been awarded more than 85 projects from the federal government since 2009, and more than half of those projects were with the Department of Defense,” says Dawn Ochman, president of Dawn Inc., a design, construction and renovation business in Warren.

“These contracts are the lifeblood of our business, even more so when the economy is not doing well and very few dollars were being spent in commercial construction,” she says. “In the past 10 years, about 95% of our sales were with the government.”

More recently, Dawn Inc. was awarded a $3 million contract to perform renovation work at the Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station, according to USASpending.gov.

Ochman says securing work for DOD is challenging at first, especially for a small business. Once a company proves itself and maintains a solid track record with the government, subsequent business comes more easily.

“Customers including the DOD want to see strong past performance not just in construction, but in government contracting,” Ochman says. “Once you have a few successful projects under your belt, you become a much bigger player in this arena.”

Doing business with the Department of Defense is much different than dealing with the private sector, Ochman elaborates.

“We’ve spent as long as two years planning for a proposal submission to the government,” she says. “If awarded, we then have the opportunity to bid on work for the customer for another 60 months. This is not typical in commercial construction.”

Manufacturers and service providers across Mahoning County also have realized a steady business with DOD. In fiscal 2018, companies in Mahoning County did $11.2 million worth of business with the Department of Defense and have secured $4.5 million in contracts through fiscal 2019.

The scope of these companies is diverse.

Corcon Inc., an industrial-painting company based in Coitsville Township, is in the midst of a multi-year contract valued at $6.8 million, while Valley Food Systems Inc., Youngstown, repeatedly wins new business with the DOD through the company’s A-rations program, which supplies packaged meals to the National Guard.

Other companies, such as Salem-Republic Rubber Inc. in Sebring, manufacture items specifically designed for defense applications.

“We’ve been working with the military over the last seven years, and it’s really kicked off over the last three,” says James Dunchuck, vice president of sales and marketing at Salem-Republic. “We positioned ourselves with some of the things we did in 2015 and 2016 to open up some of these opportunities,” he says.

Salem-Republic manufactures industrial hoses and accessories used as support equipment for commercial and military aviation, Dunchuck says. About three years ago, the company refocused its attention on engineering and sales directed toward winning more business with the government.

The company has attracted the attention of the DOD because of a particular hose known as an air start duct, Dunchuck says. These hoses are used by ground crews to supply fixed-wing aircraft with pressurized air that helps kick-start the turbines of the plane.

“We are one of two manufacturers of that product worldwide,” he says. The duct system also comes with hose couplings and scuffers – spiral coverings that slide over the duct hose to prevent abrasive wear since they are repeatedly used on flight decks and tarmacs.

Contracts with the DOD can range between several thousand dollars to longer-term deals of $1 million and $1.5 million that could stretch over three years, Dunchuck says.

Salem-Republic Rubber Inc. employs about 70.

“The future for us is refining our approach in ground-support equipment,” Dunchuck says.

Meanwhile, the company continues to work on improving its internal operations and strives to become more efficient as it increases market share. “We’re a qualified underdog in this arena,” he observes.

Other local companies provide services to the DOD to save that agency money. For example, the government often chooses to contract with companies that are capable of refurbishing heavy-duty equipment instead of buying new vehicles or other machines.

“We’re working on a couple of different projects,” says Ken Timmings, manager at KTSDI in North Lima. The company is most active in the DOD’s service-life extension program, or SLEP. “They have an aging fleet of vehicles and there are two cost scenarios – that is to purchase new or to rebuild under SLEP,” he says.

That’s where KTSDI comes in. The company can take a vehicle the military uses and take it down to the bare bones, rebuild that vehicle and place it into service in like-new condition.

“There are different SLEPs going on all the time,” Timmings says. ”It’s a common method to look at their fleets.”

Recently, the DOD put out a request for proposal to recondition rough-terrain container handlers, Timmings says.

“We’re involved in the powertrain components and electronic steering for that,” he says, noting the company has worked with other contractors on similar programs. “A lot of work is done on-site; but they also send components to us and we send them back refurbished.”

Companies such as KTSDI are able to recondition parts or vehicles for 60 to 90 cents on the dollar when compared to new purchases, he notes. “It’s a fraction of the cost,” he says.

Most of the work KTSDI does with defense involves new-vehicle technology. “We’ve done work with all the branches of the military and traveled to locations from Alaska to Guam,” Timmings says.

Still, even work with the DOD or other government agencies isn’t always a sure thing, Timmings says. “It’s either feast or famine,” he says. “It comes in very little at a time or it comes in a lot.”

Pompeo launches controversial commission to examine 'unalienable rights',https://thehill.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/451987-pompeo-launches-controversial-commission-to-examine-unalienable-rights,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoKobach to run for Senate in Kansas The Hill's Morning Report - Democrats assail border conditions as Congress returns to work The Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes MORE announced Monday the creation of a commission to review the role of human rights in U.S. foreign policy.

The Commission on Unalienable Rights is meant to provide advice on human rights based on the nation’s founding principles and the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Pompeo said, arguing that there is confusion over what constitutes a human right.

“As human rights claims have proliferated, some claims have come into tension with one another, provoking questions and clashes about which rights are entitled to gain respect,” Pompeo said while delivering remarks to reporters but without taking any questions. “Nation-states and international institutions remain confused about their respective responsibilities concerning human rights.”

The commission drew swift scrutiny from critics who worry the panel will undermine protections for abortion rights and marginalized groups such as LGBT people.

Critics were first concerned in May when a notice for the commission, published in the Federal Register, said the group would provide “fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights.”

The term “natural law” has been used by opponents of same-sex marriage.

“If this administration truly wanted to support people’s rights, it would use the global framework that’s already in place. Instead, it wants to undermine rights for individuals, as well as the responsibilities of governments,” Joanne Lin, national director of advocacy and government affairs at Amnesty International USA, said in a statement Monday. “This politicization of human rights in order to, what appears to be an attempt to further hateful policies aimed at women and LGBTQ people, is shameful.”

The commission will be headed by Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard Law School professor and former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican during the George W. Bush administration.

In brief remarks alongside Pompeo, Glendon said the commission will “do our very best to carry out your marching orders and to do so in a way that will assist you in your difficult task of transmuting principle into policy.”

“I wanted to thank you especially for giving a priority to human rights at this moment when basic human rights are being misunderstood by many, manipulated by many and ignored by the world’s worst human rights violators,” Glendon told Pompeo. “You’ve asked us to work at the level of principle, not policy, and you’ve asked us to take our bearings from the distinctive rights tradition of the United States of America, a tradition that is grounded in the institutions without which rights would not be possible: constitutional government and the rule of law.”"
"The Trade Struggles To Move On From June 30 USDA Report, Analyst says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/analysis/the-trade-struggles-to-move-on-from-june-30-usda-report-analyst-saysf,"The Trump administration has coined the terminology fake news when it comes to some reporting of events and articles regarding the administration.

One has to wonder if the Acreage Report issued on June 30 by the National Agricultural Statistics Service was nothing more than fake news as well.

With extraordinary weather circumstances prohibiting planting progress, the expectation for accurate report data was heightened, and yet the USDA knowingly released the June 30 Acreage Report expecting to resurvey producers in July.

It was not until well after the report was released did they indicate that a resurvey, if necessary, would occur in July.



If necessary?

On June 2, 33% of the corn crop had yet to be planted (latest crop planting ever). Heavy rains continued to pound parts of the Midwest. The survey asked farmers if they intend to plant. Having their back up against the wall in early June, they would likely say yes. Prices were rallying, and they would plant if possible. Common sense should have prevailed.

The USDA could have delayed the survey. Or, at a minimum, issued a disclaimer prior to the release of the report, stating a resurvey would occur due to lack of accurate data. This would have been the responsible and correct approach, providing the marketplace with a more intentional plan to provide full transparency.

Instead, they let the market respond to incredibly negative news, which sent prices limit lower. On March 31, farmers said they intended to plant 92.8 million acres of corn. The June 30 report indicated 91.7 million, or a decline of 1.1 million acres.

It is estimated, potentially, that Illinois alone could have close to 1 million acres of prevent plant. Concerns in Indiana, Ohio, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Missouri suggest a much, much larger number of acres in jeopardy of not being planted, perhaps 5 to 7 million.



The USDA knew they had less than realistic information. They released it, only to then backtrack. The agriculture community deserves a better process of providing timely and accurate information than was exhibited last Friday. What is the point of releasing a “fake” report?



Regardless of their intentions, this is another example of unexpected price moves. Prices move on facts, rumors, and “fake” news. No one knows for sure where prices will go. Prior to any report, we encourage customers to plan for the unexpected. Positioning yourselves for all scenarios is time well spent.

US Treasury yields fall as investors look ahead to Powell testimony,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/08/bond-market-us-treasury-yields-fall-after-strong-jobs-report.html,"U.S. government debt yields fell on Monday as investors looked ahead to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony on Capitol Hill later in the week.

The leader of the U.S. central bank is scheduled to speak before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.02%, while the yield on the short-term 2-year Treasury note rate inched higher to 1.868%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

Wall Street will scrutinize Powell's comments on the state of the American economy as well as those describing the current course of Fed policy. Though the central bank left rates untouched in June, many expect the Fed to cut rates later this month in light of weaker global growth projections.

However, some strong data remains, including last week's jobs report, which showed strong hiring in the month of June. The economy added 224,000 jobs in June. That was way above an expected 165,000 increase.

The solid report tempered expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next policy meeting later this month. The Fed said at its last meeting that it would ""act as appropriate"" to maintain the current U.S. economic expansion, which is the longest in history.

In terms of data, consumer credit figures are due at 3 p.m. ET."
"As Europe orders recall, EPA into Mercedes emissions drags on",https://www.detroitnews.com,"['Anna M. Phillips', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-07-2019,2019,7,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/foreign/2019/07/07/epa-investigation-mercedes-emissions-drags-on/39657613/,"Three years after the Environmental Protection Agency began investigating alleged diesel emission cheating in Mercedes-Benz cars, vehicle owners and environmentalists say the Trump administration appears to be allowing the inquiry to stall.

Daimler, the German parent company for Mercedes, is among several automakers that have come under scrutiny since 2015 after Volkswagen admitted to equipping some of its diesel-powered cars with illegal software designed to hide excess emissions.

In 2016, federal and state regulators launched an investigation into whether Mercedes had used a similar scheme, enabling cars to pass emissions tests that they would have otherwise failed. German regulators also launched an inquiry.

In the intervening years, German regulators have found evidence of cheating by Daimler and hit the company with fines and forced recalls.

However, in the United States there have been no repercussions as the investigation crosses the three-year mark.

“Three years seems unusual,” said John German, a former official at the EPA and a senior fellow at the International Council on Clean Transportation, the environmental advocacy group that commissioned the study that uncovered Volkswagen’s cheating.

From start to finish, the government’s investigation into VW took about a year and a half, German said.

In April, consumer advocacy and environmental groups sent a letter to Congress asking that the investigation be expedited.

“It is past time for greater urgency and action from regulators and Congress on the allegations against Mercedes,” the advocates wrote. “Owners and lessees of Mercedes diesel vehicles have been left without answers or recourse while the illegally polluting vehicles remain on U.S. roads.”

American regulators’ inquiry into Daimler began in 2016 when the Department of Justice asked the company to conduct an internal investigation into its diesel exhaust emissions. Since then, the automaker has stopped selling diesel-powered passenger cars in the U.S.

“To me, that suggests that they had a problem and they’re trying to limit their exposure to that problem,” German said.

EPA officials declined to comment on the investigation, citing its ongoing investigation.

The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.

A spokesman for Daimler said the company continues to cooperate with American regulators but would not discuss the investigation.

Though Daimler has denied wrongdoing, the company has recalled 3 million diesel-fueled vehicles in Europe. In June, German regulators ordered the company to recall 60,000 more and said they were widening their inquiry.

The German luxury brand is currently being sued in the U.S. by people who purchased Mercedes diesel cars. In a class-action lawsuit, lawyers representing Mercedes diesel owners said the cars were marketed as “the world’s cleanest and most advanced diesel.” But engineers hired by the plaintiffs found that they “emit far more pollution on the road than in the emission certification testing environment.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of a U.S. House panel asked an internal watchdog on Friday to investigate whether top officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. border service knew about a Facebook group where agents posted racist and misogynistic comments.

“Such vile and threatening behavior from agents of the United States government is entirely unacceptable” and “should be grounds for immediate dismissal,” Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a letter to the DHS’s acting inspector general.

Noting that the issue was already being probed by the office of professional responsibility of the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) service, Thompson asked the inspector general to open a probe into what DHS and CBP leadership knew about the groups and what action they had taken to address it.

Thompson said it had been reported that recently named CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan “knew about the group as early as 2016, when he was chief of the Border Patrol.”

“If accurate, this report calls into question Mr. Morgan’s fitness to hold any office in the United States government,” Thompson said.

He also asked the acting inspector general to investigate whether Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan knew about the Facebook groups. McAleenan has ordered a probe into the social media posts. He called them “disturbing & inexcusable” in a tweet on Wednesday.

The U.S. border service came under fire over the issue on Monday, when the non-profit news site ProPublica reported that offensive content had been posted on a private Facebook group for current and former CPB officers.

Posts included jokes about the deaths of migrants and sexually explicit comments referring to U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the news outlet said. Reuters did not independently confirm the report.

The report emerged as Ocasio-Cortez and other lawmakers visited a border patrol station in Texas and criticized conditions at the site. Ocasio-Cortez said migrants held at the station had been told to drink water out of toilets and were subjected to psychological abuse."
Trump taxes: Cuomo signs law to allow Congress to get president's New York returns,https://www.democratandchronicle.com,"['Joseph Spector', 'Published A.M.

He discussed the bill May 21, 2019 in the USA TODAY Network's Albany Bureau Joseph Spector, Albany Bureau Chief

ALBANY – President Donald Trump's New York tax returns will now be available to key congressional committees if they ask for them.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday signed a bill into law that lets three congressional committees request copies of Trump’s state tax returns amid an ongoing effort by Democrats to review the president's filings.

New York was in a unique position to pass a state law that would give Congress access to Trump's state returns because he and his businesses have been based in the state.

""Tax secrecy is paramount — the exception being for bona fide investigative and law enforcement purposes,"" Cuomo said in a statement.

""By amending the law enforcement exception in New York State tax code to include Congressional tax-related committees, this bill gives Congress the ability to fulfill its Constitutional responsibilities, strengthen our democratic system and ensure that no one is above the law.""

The bill passed the Democrat-led Legislature in May and amends state tax law so the heads of the House Ways & Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation could request the tax returns of any New York elected officials and top-level appointees and their business entities.

That includes Trump, whose administration is likely to sue to block any requests for his state taxes.

What happens now

It is unclear whether Congress will use the state law to get at Trump's taxes, and Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, D-Massachusetts, suggested in May he was disinclined to turn to New York's law.

There was no immediate comment from Neal's office Monday.

Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee filed a lawsuit to get Trump's federal tax returns in what will be a legal fight between Congress and the executive branch.

The Trump administration has maintained that it is not required to give Congress the tax returns, and the Republican president has said he could not make the taxes public, as had been the practice of presidential candidates and elected officials, because he is under audit.

What New York's law does

CLOSE Assemblyman David Buchwald, D-White Plains, and Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan, have legislation in New York that would make the state tax department release President Donald Trump's taxes. They spoke during a news conference on Monday, April 8, 2019, at the state Capitol. Joseph Spector, Albany Bureau Chief

New York's law seeks to limit the ability for Trump to sue, requiring the state Department of Taxation and Finance to redact any information that would violate state or federal law or would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

Also, a congressional request needs to be accompanied by certification that the tax returns have been requested for a specified and legitimate legislative purpose.

“Our Republic has endured for over 200 years thanks to the system of checks and balances provided in our Constitution,"" said Assemblyman David Buchwald, D-White Plains, who sponsored the bill with Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan.

""Consistent with this tradition, New York state now stands ready to assist Congress as it challenges the Trump Administration’s refusal to provide his tax records.""

Trump criticized Cuomo in a series of tweets July 1, accusing him of using Attorney General Letitia James as a ""bludgeoning tool"" by targeting Trump's businesses and foundation with investigations and lawsuits.

Trump knocks New York

It is very hard and expensive to live in New York. Governor Andrew Cuomo uses his Attorney General as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes. They sue on everything, always in search of a crime. I even got sued on a Foundation which took Zero rent & expenses & gave away... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2019

Trump has often lashed out at the state's high taxes and Democratic leadership on Twitter, his favored social-media platform.

""Now Cuomo’s A.G. is harassing all of my New York businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible,"" Trump tweeted.

""So, on top of ridiculously high taxes, my children and companies are spending a fortune on lawyers. No wonder people and businesses are fleeing New York in record numbers!""

State GOP Chairman Nick Langworthy ripped Cuomo signing the bill Monday, calling the law “nothing more than presidential harassment.”

""Today Andrew Cuomo and Albany Democrats are using it to go after President Trump, but tomorrow it could be any New Yorker,"" Langworthy said in a statement. ""It will never stand up in the courts and they will once again be exposed for wasting precious taxpayer resources on their never-ending partisan witch hunt.”

The state Legislature also passed another bill targeting Trump in May.

It would allow New York to prosecute Trump associates even if they are pardoned by the president, called the “double jeopardy” bill. But Cuomo has yet to sign the measure.
