Meadows' lackluster defense of Cummings speaks volumes,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Michael Warren'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/meadows-defense-cummings-trump-tweets/index.html,"Washington (CNN) When Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib accused Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of racism earlier this year, one of his ""best friends,"" House Oversight Committee chairman and Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings immediately jumped to his defense .

When Cummings was attacked on similar grounds by President Donald Trump over the weekend, it took a bit longer for Meadows to publicly repay the favor. On Saturday and Sunday, Trump went after Cummings on Twitter, calling the veteran Democratic lawmaker a ""racist"" and his district a ""disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.""

Trump's comments hung in the air for days, sparking yet another conversation about the President's race-focused rhetoric. Republicans largely stayed silent, including Meadows, whose warm relationship with Cummings prompted questions about his reticence to defend his friend.

When Meadows finally did issue a reply, it came two days later and second-hand, delivered live on air by CNN contributor and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum. The statement was a perfect distillation of the way Republicans have tip-toed around Trump's inflammatory language about race -- and avoided criticizing the President directly.

""No one works harder for his district than Elijah. He's passionate about the people he represents, and no, Elijah is not a racist,"" Santorum read aloud. The statement also absolved the President of being a racist and included a promise by Meadows to ""go to Baltimore with President Trump to see what they could do to remediate some of the problems they have there.""

To be sure, Meadows finds himself in bind. The North Carolina Republican has cultivated a close and fruitful relationship with Trump, who often focuses his ire toward minority members of Congress. Meadows' friendship with Cummings gave him no choice but to come to the Democrat's defense. That's especially true following the incident with Tlaib this past February, when Meadows publicly called on that friendship to defend himself.

Former Rep. Mia Love, a Utah Republican and CNN contributor, says that she texted with Meadows Monday morning and urged him to ""do the right thing"" and stand publicly alongside Cummings.

""I told him that, look, it's times like this where you know what you're made of,"" Love told CNN.

Even so, Meadows took his time. At a public event at the White House earlier on Monday, he ignored questions from CNN about Trump's tweets, in which Trump disparaged Cummings as a ""brutal bully"" and called his district a ""very dangerous and filthy place."" Trump also said that ""no human being would want to live"" in the district, which is 59% black.

The two congressmen's close relationship , forged during their shared time on the Oversight committee, reflect both men's congenial personalities. Cummings and Meadows have also bonded on policy work together, joining forces on legislation to aide whistleblowers and to reform the Post Office.

""I have a good relationship with Meadows. We don't agree on probably 85% of things, of issues, but he is not disagreeable,"" Cummings told reporters last December. ""So we're able to sit down and work out things we agree on. And he has always maintained a high-level of civility, which I don't see how you can even get anything done unless you at least have that.""

Asked if Meadows has spoken with Cummings since Trump's tweets, a spokesman for Meadows declined to comment. Cummings did not respond to CNN's request for comment.

Love, one of the few black Republicans to serve in Congress in recent years, said she hopes Republicans will speak out about Trump's rhetoric toward Cummings. ""I really do think that the only the way this will be put in check is if people like Mark Meadows say this is not who we are,"" she said.

Very few Republicans have denounced Trump's comments. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who has been critical of the President, called the tweets about Cummings and Baltimore ""outrageous and inappropriate."" Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who has been close to Trump, said the tweets were a ""bad idea.""

Both parties have had to address extreme rhetoric from their own members in recent months. In January, House GOP leaders stripped Rep. Steve King from his committee assignments after the Iowa congressman lamented that the phrase ""white supremacist"" was considered offensive.

Not long after, Democratic leaders in the House spoke out against comments from freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar, who had suggested support for Israel among members of Congress was driven by donations. Several members, including a number of Jewish Democrats, said Omar's comments engaged in anti-Semitic tropes.

Republicans have struggled in particular with racist and racially focused comments from President Trump, including tweets just a few weeks ago in which Trump said four Democratic House members of color, all of whom are American citizens and three of whom were born in the United States, should ""go back"" to their home countries.

Love says she does not believe her former colleagues in the Republican House conference agree with Trump's comments about Cummings and Baltimore. ""But being silent is in some ways condoning it,"" she said."
"Trump pardons, commutes sentences for 7 people",https://www.cnn.com,['Jeremy Diamond'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/trump-pardons-commutes-sentences-7-people/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Monday issued full pardons to five individuals and commuted the sentences of two others convicted of a variety of federal crimes.

The two men whose sentences were commuted will now be released early from federal prison while those who received full pardons had already completed their prison sentences and will now have their rights fully restored.

Top political figures had advocated for the release of the two men who will now be released from prison on Trump's orders: Ted Suhl, an Arkansas man who was convicted of bribery and fraud charges, and Ronen Nahmani, a Floridian who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for distributing synthetic marijuana.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Trump booster whose daughter served as White House press secretary, ""strongly supported"" Suhl's request for clemency, the White House said in a press release, while Nahmani's case was championed by a slew of members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.

The White House noted that Nahmani, who was convicted in 2015, ""is a non-violent, first-time offender with no criminal history"" with five children whose wife is ""suffering from terminal cancer.""

"Trump aide submitted drafts of 2016 'America First' energy speech to UAE for edits, emails show",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-aide-submitted-drafts-2016-america-energy-speech/story?id=64634140,"When candidate Donald Trump prepared to give a major energy speech during the 2016 campaign, one of his closest advisers provided a pre-speech review to senior United Arab Emirates officials, an unorthodox move that caught the attention of federal investigators, according to emails and text messages uncovered by a House Oversight Committee investigation.

“The Trump Administration has virtually obliterated the lines normally separating government policy making from corporate and foreign interests,” according to a report overseen by House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, who commissioned the investigation into back channel business dealings between certain Trump aides and Middle Eastern countries.

Two weeks before Trump was scheduled to deliver the energy policy speech, Thomas Barrack, a California investment tycoon with extensive contacts in the Middle East and who later helped oversee Trump’s inauguration, provided a former business associate inside the United Arab Emirates with an advance copy of the candidate’s planned remarks. The associate then told Barrack he shared them with UAE and Saudi government officials, after which Barrack arranged for language requested by the UAE officials to be added to the speech with the help of Trump’s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort.

“This is the most likely final version of the speech. It has the language you want,” Manafort confirmed in an email to Barrack on the day of the speech, according to the report. Manafort has since gone to prison for financial crimes unrelated to his campaign work.

The White House declined to comment.

House investigators note in their report that none of the documents they gathered indicate “whether Trump was aware that drafts of his speech were circulated to foreign officials in the Middle East or that feedback had been provided through Mr. Barrack and Mr. Manafort.”

Attorneys for Manafort declined to comment when reached Monday.

The back-channel exchange caught the attention not only of House investigators but also of federal prosecutors, according to a report late Sunday in The New York Times, which first reported on the dealings.

ABC News has obtained copies of more detailed emails and texts from House investigators, who gathered more than 60,000 documents showing what they say are the intermingling of private interests and public policy decision by Trump aides both before and after he took office. The resulting investigative report, made public Monday, presents events surrounding the 2016 energy speech as a prime example of how Trump’s close aides were granting their foreign business contacts access to campaign policy decisions.

A source close to Barrack confirmed the basic details to ABC News. A statement from Barrack’s spokesman, first published by The Times, said prosecutors had confirmed to Barrack’s attorney that “they have no further questions for Mr. Barrack.” His aides told The Times he never worked on behalf of foreign states or entities and he was ultimately disappointed that more of the language sought by his contacts in the Middle East did not wind up in Trump’s speech.

Trump traveled to North Dakota in May of 2016, having just clinched the Republican nomination for president. He intended to give a policy speech that would solidify his position on oil, gas and coal – an energy speech that would make clear he would prioritize American energy jobs over grand multi-national environmental pacts like the Paris climate agreement.

Trump called his approach an “America First” energy plan that would “make America wealthy again.”

“Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence,” he told the crowd. “Imagine a world in which our foes, and the oil cartels, can no longer use energy as a weapon.”

Play

In the midst of the muscular, America-first approach that became a hallmark of his campaign, he added a phrase intended to placate an audience far away in the United Arab Emirates, telling the crowd “we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy.”

The language was modest when compared to what was requested by officials in the oil-rich emirates, according to the text messages exchanged between Barrack and Rashid al-Malik, a former business associate in UAE. Al-Malik had secretly worked as an intelligence asset for the UAE government, “tasked to report to his Emirati intelligence handlers on topics of consequence to the UAE,” the House report said, citing an Intercept news report.

William F. Coffield, an attorney for al-Malik, told ABC News his client “was never a conduit to the Trump organization for anyone. He has never been a paid intelligence source for anyone.”

“Mr. al-Malik is from the UAE and has a home in the U.S. He loves the UAE and the USA,” said Coffield. “He was a business associate of Mr Barrack’s, and they shared a personal desire to build bridges between the citizens of both. It’s really that simple.”

Barrack and al-Malik began the text message exchanges two weeks before Trump’s energy speech was set to be delivered, according to the House report. Barrack sent a draft of the candidate’s energy remarks to al-Malik and a message that said, “What do you think of his energy message given to American executives with a pro Middle East point of view -- for you and Saeed to rebiew [sic] for me quickly. I need a few pro Middle East aspects.” The report does not identify “Saeed.”

An hour later, al-Malik responded, “This is what I got from them,” according to the report.

The text does not identify “them,” but House investigators say they believe it is a reference to Saudi and Emirati officials. In that text, al-Malik requests that new language add references to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and UAE Crown Prince Abudhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, as well as a line that states: “We can and should support reform in the Middle East, in the process thereby reducing the appeal of Islamic terrorism, and support our allies who are fighting our enemies.”

The following day, Barrack proposes the additional language to Manafort, suggesting references to the two Arab leaders and language that loosely mirrors the sentiments that had been requested. He adds in his email, “This is probably as close as I can get without crossing a lot of lines,” according to the report.

The language that winds up in Trump’s speech ultimately does not include the direct references to the Gulf leaders but does include a nod to the requested sentiment – expressing his desire to “work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy.”"

A decision issued Monday by Attorney General William Barr will restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum based on their family relations.

In a precedent-setting immigration court opinion, Barr said that simply being part of a nuclear family targeted for persecution doesn’t qualify as a “particular social group” eligible for asylum in the United States.

Story Continued Below

“The fact that a criminal group — such as a drug cartel, gang, or guerrilla force — targets a group of people does not, standing alone, transform those people into a particular social group,” the attorney general wrote.

President Donald Trump has sought to restrict access to asylum, which his administration views as a magnet that draws migrants north from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessionsissued a similar immigration court decision in June 2018 that blocked asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence, a move that drew condemnation from pro-migrant advocates. A federal judge based in Washington, D.C., blocked key parts of a policy related to the decision six months later.

Barr’s ruling will guide future decisions in the immigration courts, which are not part of the federal judiciary and fall under the purview of the Justice Department. Barr highlighted that authority in the ruling Monday, saying “the attorney general has primary responsibility for construing and applying provisions in the immigration laws.”

To receive asylum in the U.S., applicants must prove they faced persecution in their home countries based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Barr’s decision Monday will limit the ability of a familial relationship to qualify as “membership in a particular social group.“ The number of asylum seekers who could be affected each year was not immediately clear.

The attorney general issued the decision in a case that involved a deported Mexican immigrant who claimed drug cartel members had targeted him because they wanted to sell drugs in his father’s Mexico City store.

The Board of Immigration Appeals found that the man’s relationship with his father qualified as a “particular social group,” but ultimately denied the asylum request because the man could not prove he was persecuted over the relationship.

Barr found that being part of a family meets the standard for asylum only when the family is “socially distinct in the eyes of its society.”

Immigration law advocates said the decision defied the precedents of at least two federal appeals courts, which have held that targeting based on family membership can qualify an immigrant for asylum.

“The family provides ‘a prototypical example of a particular social group,’” the Richmond-based 4th Circuitwrote in 2011, quoting an earlier case from the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit.

“It's a significant declaration of power from the A.G. and one that will hopefully take a beating in court,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council said on Twitter.

The DOJ asylum move is only the latest policy change to limit asylum.

Trump announced Friday that his administration had struck a deal with Guatemala that would require asylum seekers passing through that nation to first seek protections there.

The asylum agreement came after a San Francisco-based federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump regulation that barred asylum seekers who passed through other nations en route to the southwest border.

US Defense Department to Develop Blockchain Cybersecurity Shield,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/us-department-of-defense-is-developing-a-blockchain-cybersecurity-shield,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is looking to forge a blockchain cybersecurity shield.

In a report published on July 12 titled Digital Modernization Strategy, the DoD outlined several ways to advance the nation’s digital defenses. This includes the integration of cloud and quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and improved communications through distributed ledgers.

In fact, DARPA, the research wing of the Department is already experimenting with the technology “to create a more efficient, robust, and secure platform,” to secure messaging and process transactions, reports Decrypt.

Specifically, blockchain may be deployed between units and headquarters as well as intelligence officers and the Pentagon. As part of the Digital Identity Management program, the agency may also issue a digital token that authenticates an agent’s identity.

The DoD is also experimenting with the technology to facilitate the creation of an unhackable code to secure its databases.

As part of the second Cryptographic Modernization program, in effect since 2000, the Department is replacing old hardware and cryptographic systems to meet the challenges of the improved computing power of the nation’s adversaries.

Citing the trustless, transparent, and immutable attributes of blockchain the Department writes:

“Blockchain networks not only reduce the probability of compromise, but also impose significantly greater costs on an adversary to achieve it.”

The shift from “low value to high-value work” is also part of the DoDs’ Big Data Platform (BDP), which will handle petabytes of data involved in a number of cross-agency projects. The platform “provides the ability to perform aggregation, correlation, historical trending,” and may perform pattern recognition to “predict attacks.”

State spent $234K on Trump trip to Turnberry,https://thehill.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/455222-state-spent-234k-on-trump-trip-to-turnberry,"The State Department spent nearly $234,000 on President Trump Donald John TrumpSharpton: Trump has 'particular venom' for blacks, people of color Trump signs 9/11 compensation fund bill alongside first responders Trump continues assault on Fed: It 'has made all of the wrong moves' MORE’s trip last July to his property in Scotland, according to a new report from the department’s inspector general.

Inspector General Steve Linick wrote in a July 22 letter to three Democratic lawmakers that the State Department spent $233,732.86 on overtime, hotels, rental cars and temporary duty costs for a trip to Trump Turnberry from July 14 to July 15, 2018, according to documents obtained by The Hill.

That total does not include costs for which State was reimbursed by the Department of Homeland Security, the letter noted, and therefore reflects only a portion of the overall expense of the trip.

“American taxpayers shouldn’t have to foot the bill for the President’s excessive and lavish golfing jaunts abroad,” an aide speaking on behalf of the three lawmakers said in a statement.

“The nearly $234,000 identified by the State Department Inspector General represents only a fraction of the total spending for just one weekend at the President’s Scottish golf course last year,” the aide added.

The lawmakers are still awaiting a similar accounting from the Department of Homeland Security detailing its own costs associated with the Turnberry trip. It's unclear when the report might be issued.

The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General did not respond to a request for comment.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

The bulk of the State Department’s expenses for the Scotland trip came from $111,261.44 spent on hotels, according to the letter from Linick.

But just a small portion of that amount was spent on lodging for State Department employees at Trump Turnberry.

Linick wrote that the department spent $728 for three rooms for two nights to accommodate the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom and his wife and the ambassador’s chief of protocol.

In response to a question from lawmakers about comparing the rate at Trump Turnberry to rates at other area hotels, the State Department found that the president's property was cheaper than other lodging options considered in Glasgow.

“The Trump Turnberry is situated outside Glasgow, and the rates offered here are very favourable to the Government,” the State Department said in reviewing the options. “The Trump Turnberry is therefore determined to offer a fair and reasonable rate to the Government.”

Beyond lodging, the State Department spent $42,406.54 on overtime costs, $28,625.27 on rental cars and $51,439.61 on temporary duty costs, according to the documents.

It’s not clear whether such costs are out of the ordinary for presidential travel.

The State Department's Office of Inspector General declined to comment beyond the report and therefore did not respond to questions about how the Trump Turnberry trip compared to other presidential travel or what the roughly $110,000 in additional hotel costs covered.

The State Department did not answer in its report lawmakers' questions about how much the Turnberry property profited from the stay, but the trip falls into a broader area of concern from Democrats who have accused the president of using his office to boost his brand.

Critics of the president have consistently raised ethics concerns with his tendency to periodically spend weekends away from the White House at his own properties, arguing it depletes resources and boosts the Trump brand.

The president last month stayed at Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Doonbeg in Ireland while abroad on a trip to the United Kingdom and France. The property tweeted — and then later deleted — two videos directly referencing the president’s stay, prompting criticism from ethics watchdogs over the blurred line between business and government interests.

A federal appeals court dismissed a lawsuit earlier this month filed by Maryland and the District of Columbia alleging that Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits elected officials from receiving gifts or benefits from foreign governments without Congress’s approval.

A separate emoluments lawsuit brought by Democratic lawmakers is still proceeding through the court system.

Barr reverses ruling on asylum for those with persecuted family members,https://thehill.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/latino/455163-barr-migrants-with-family-members-facing-persecution-cant-automatically-claim-asylum,"Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrFormer public defender: DOJ plan to resume federal executions a 'recipe for problems' The death penalty is racially biased, fiscally irresponsible and very inaccurate Trump starts another day with Cummings attack: '25 years of all talk, no action!' MORE on Monday reversed a 2018 immigration board ruling that found that a migrant whose immediate family member was persecuted in their home country may be able to claim asylum.

The order is yet another hit to the United States' asylum laws and the most recent action taken by U.S. authorities in recent weeks that would affect asylum rules and procedures.

In this latest decision, Barr effectively tightened a measure in the Immigration and Nationality Act that states a migrant can be granted asylum if they show they have been or will be persecuted because of “race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Barr wrote that the Board of Immigration Appeals has previously found that those in a “particular social group” under asylum laws must share “a common immutable characteristic.”

“The fact that a criminal group — such as a drug cartel, gang, or guerrilla force — targets a group of people does not, standing alone, transform those people into a particular social group,” the decision reads.

The order states that the immigration board had “improperly” decided a 2018 case, in which a migrant had claimed asylum due to persecution, stating that his father, who owned a store, was targeted by a local drug cartel. The migrant said that qualified as “membership in a particular social group,” as laid out in the immigration law.

“Consistent with these prior decisions, I conclude that an alien’s family-based group will not constitute a particular social group unless it has been shown to be socially distinct in the eyes of its society, not just those of its alleged persecutor,” the attorney general’s decision reads.

“Because the record does not support the determination in this case that the immediate family of the respondent’s father constituted a particular social group, I reverse the Board’s conclusion to the contrary.”

Barr earlier this year also issued an order that reversed a 2005 Board of Immigration Appeals ruling that found asylum-seekers could be released on bond if they are able to show they have credible fear of persecution or danger in their home countries.

But that effort has been tied up in the courts after a district court judge blocked the order from going into effect, finding it unconstitutional to indefinitely detain the asylum-seekers. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this month declined to issue a stay on that ruling.

The order also plays out on the backdrop of the Trump administration's larger crackdown on asylum laws, as lawmakers have made little progress on legislation on the topic.

The House departed Washington last week for recess and won't return until September.

The administration issued a rule earlier this month that would block migrants who pass through another country before arriving at the U.S.'s southern border from being able to claim asylum. But that policy has already been temporarily blocked by a federal district judge in San Francisco.

Officials also announced last week that they would expand expedited removal authorities for immigration officers, making it easier to deport immigrants who are unable to immediately prove that they’ve been in the U.S. for two years. Groups have also promised to challenge that new policy in court."
US Defense Dept. to Experiment With Blockchain-Based Security,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Binance Exchange']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-defense-dept-to-experiment-with-blockchain-based-security,"The United States Department of Defense (DoD) is pursuing blockchain solutions for cybersecurity as part of its digital modernization strategy.

The DoD released plans for blockchain tech in its four-year roadmap on July 12, entitled “DoD Digital Modernization Strategy: DoD Information Resource Management Strategic Plan FY19–23.”

According to the report, the DoD’s research branch, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is currently engaged in at least two exploratory blockchain projects focused on cybersecurity.

First, DARPA is experimenting with blockchain in order to construct a new — or improved — communication and transaction platform. Stated intentions for this platform include communications between units and headquarters as well as between intelligence officers and the Pentagon.

Second, DARPA is attempting to create an “unhackable code” with blockchain technology, citing blockchain’s ability to gather intel on bad actors who attempt to hack into databases.

DARPA’s blockchain workshop

As reported by Cointelegraph, DARPA previously announced plans to host a two-day blockchain workshop in February. DARPA was particularly keen on examining permissionless consensus protocols. The organization also noted that there were potentially valuable use cases for blockchain in data storage, saying:

“Technologies for distributed consensus protocols have been revolutionized by their prominent role in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. These technologies have dramatic implications for the security and resilience of critical data storage and computation tasks, including for the Department of Defense.”

In December 2018, DoD officials examined how blockchain technology could help emergencies responses in disaster situations in a presentation hosted by the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support’s Continuous Process Improvement."
"Trump's trip to his Turnberry resort cost the State Department at least $233K, review finds",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/trump-turnberry-resort-cost-state-department-oig/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department spent at least $233,732 on President Donald Trump's July 2018 trip to his Turnberry resort in Scotland, according to a letter from the department's inspector general obtained by CNN.

The July 22 letter from Inspector General Steve Linick to Democratic Sens. Tom Carper of Delaware and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland details only the costs that were paid by the State Department and not reimbursed. Among the costs were more than $42,000 in overtime, more than $111,000 in hotels, more than $28,000 in rental cars and more than $51,000 in temporary duty costs, according to the letter.

The OIG review was not able to determine how much the resort gained in profit from the visit. The State Department spent $728 on three rooms for two nights at the Trump-owned property. According to the letter, the department said they were used by the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, his wife and his chief of protocol. The department said that the Trump Turnberry's rate was ""the lowest of all the hotels being utilized for this VIP visit"" and offered ""a fair and reasonable rate to the Government,"" according to document cited in the letter.

The Hill was the first to report on Linick's letter.

The State Department OIG review was prompted by a call for investigation made by the three Democratic lawmakers shortly after the President's trip. They also requested an inquiry from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General. The department OIG did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Monday.

- A business owner successfully operating a shop for at least three years.

- Operating in a disadvantaged community.

So, Harris’ plan would help, approximately, maybe a dozen, two dozen people? A bold plan, to say the least.

If you think this all sounds a bit ridiculous, you are not alone. Social media users torched the senator’s apparent proposal for hours after her tweet. The announcement was so poorly received, in fact, that a Twitter user even launched the “Oddly Specific Kamala Harris Policy Generator,” which created the following faux Harris proposal after I clicked “randomize”:

Yesterday, I announced that, as president, I'll establish an abstinence only sex education program for Latinos who open a pet store that operates for 7 years in a blue state.

To get an idea of just how poorly the plan was received, consider that the senator’s Twitter account tweeted a series of clarifications later, “thanking” supporters and critics alike for their productive “feedback.”

“I want to thank everyone for your feedback and clarify some confusion. We have an opportunity gap in our country, and one thing we need to do is support Black entrepreneurs. I have a plan to do that on multiple fronts,” Harris account said.

It added, “Student loan relief for Pell Grant recipients is just one component of our plan to reduce the opportunity gap for Black entrepreneurs—along with $12 billion in direct capital. We can ensure Black entrepreneurs have a real shot at starting small businesses.”

The only other thing that her proposal page says about student loan debt forgiveness (apart from the very specific qualifications) is that “Participants can have up to $20,000 of debt forgiven and can defer all of their student loans, interest-free, during a business-formation period that can last for as many as three years.”

Okay, but what about a general student debt forgiveness plan? Or is this it? Is it all tied up in her opportunity gap policy proposal?

There are some real shades here of Harris’ recent approach to reforming healthcare in the United States. In January, after she launched her 2020 campaign, the senator said plainly in a CNN town hall event that she supported doing away with private insurance.

“Let's eliminate all of that,” she said.

It was an exciting and bold declaration for the Democratic base, which responded by giving her its attention and interest. Of course, eliminating all private insurance is a terrible position for the general election, which is why Harris has already played several sides of this issue since announcing her candidacy. Most recently, she has rolled out her own version of so-called “Medicare for All,” which allows some private insurance while forcing most people into a government-run plan.

Like her approach to healthcare, Harris' student debt forgiveness flub from this weekend can be summed up: Excite the base first, worry about the details later."
Justice Department appeals court order blocking asylum restrictions,https://www.cnn.com,['Priscilla Alvarez'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/asylum-rule-appeal/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration appealed a ruling in California blocking its new asylum restrictions to a federal appeals court Monday.

Last week, a federal judge in California late blocked the Trump administration's new asylum rule dramatically limiting the ability of Central American migrants to claim asylum if they enter the US by land through Mexico.

The administration also filed an emergency motion in the Northern District Court of California to allow the asylum restrictions to go into effect while the appeal to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals plays out. The Justice Department asked Judge Jon Tigar to decide whether he would stay his order blocking the rule by Friday.

The move puts yet another of President Donald Trump's immigration policies before the 9th Circuit, which has ruled against some of the President's policies.

The ruling from Tigar, a Barack Obama nominee, came the same day that a federal judge in Washington, DC, an appointee of President Donald Trump, had declined to block the rule. Tigar's decision, which affects the entire country, took precedence.

Border Patrol tried to fire him for lying about gun incident. Now he's Trump’s DHS spokesman,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-tried-to-fire-him-for-making-stuff-up-now-he-is-the-dhs-spokesman,"The top Homeland Security spokesman, brought in to serve last month by acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, is a former Border Patrol agent whom U.S. Customs and Border Protection once attempted to fire for faking a crime against himself, according to three CBP officials with first-hand knowledge of the incident and a fourth who is also aware of it.

DHS acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Media Operations Jose “Lu” Maheda was terminated by Border Patrol a year into his service during the 1990s. Since then, as one official put it, he has “failed up,” getting his job back and eventually becoming a regional Border Patrol spokesman. And now he is the top spokesman for the 240,000-person department because of his connection to McAleenan.

“The guy’s a proven liar and can’t testify in court and yet he’s a spokesman for DHS,” charged one CBP official who worked with Maheda at the time of the incident. “He is 100% a McAleenan sycophant.”

Under the 1972 Giglio v. United States decision, a witness whose integrity has been called into question cannot testify in court.

While working at the Border Patrol station in Nogales, Arizona during his first year on the job in 1996, Maheda left his loaded gun on the front seat of his work vehicle and set out on foot.

“While he was out — and unbeknownst to him — a supervisor came across the car and saw the” firearm, the official said. “He [Maheda] had failed to secure it, and it was just laying there, and that’s when the supervisor saw it and was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve got to get this out of here.’ So the supervisor pulled the gun out. When Lu got back to the vehicle, he saw the shotgun was missing and didn’t realize the supervisor had taken it. So what he did was, he bust the window out, then went back and reported the shotgun stolen.”

A second official who worked with Maheda at the time confirmed the set of events, as did a third.

“He had a longarm go missing from his Border Patrol four-wheel drive so he busted the window out and made a notification that it was stolen, when it was in fact that an agent had just played a joke on him when he left his door unlocked,” said the third person, who also worked in Tucson at the time.

“There was no squirming out of that one. They had him dead to right,” the first official said.

Another source, a union official with secondhand knowledge of the incident, said the supervisor took the gun out of the vehicle to “safeguard” it, not as a joke. Maheda “broke the window and reported it was stolen,” he said.

Maheda was served termination paperwork a day later. He fought the termination with the help of the National Border Patrol Council and kept his job on what the union official described as a “technicality” because he was issued a termination notice on the last day of routine year-long probation period.

The third official with first-hand knowledge of the incident said the move to provide him the termination paperwork the day after may have been intentional because it gave him a way to fight the decision, since the letter should have been served immediately.

“There were all these rumors that his brother, who was a BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit) agent that was very well thought of — that somebody may have been looking out for the family with that clerical mistake,” the official said.

At the time, Border Patrol agents in their first year could be fired for any reason without being able to appeal the decision or respond to the chief patrol agent’s concerns. A union representative at the time “argued that he was technically no longer on probation because his regular shift had ended before they fired him” and therefore the probation period was technically up, and was able to get an arbitrator to agree, according to the first CBP official. Maheda was reinstated and went to work for the union.

At a certain point in his career at DHS, Maheda began to have ""direct interface"" with McAleenan, who would eventually promote him to his current position.

The third official said Maheda was reprimanded during his work for the internal Border Patrol headquarters division during the 2000s for having “abused travel all over the country basically to install flat screen TVs.”

“He got transferred out of that branch during a bottom-up review that was done by the Border Patrol headquarters staff, led by then Operations Chief Kevin Oaks,” said this source said.

The first official described Maheda's promotions as ""one of those things you just keep scratching your head"" over.

Maheda did not respond to requests for comment."
"500K students could lose free meals to USDA food stamp changes, Rep. Bobby Scott says",https://www.cnn.com,"['Kate Sullivan', 'Lauren Fox']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/students-free-meals-usda-food-stamps-bobby-scott/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Rep. Bobby Scott says the US Department of Agriculture concealed data showing that its recent proposed changes to the food stamp program could result in more than 500,000 low-income students losing free meals.

In a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue , Scott, a Virginia Democrat who's the chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, writes that the impact on school meal eligibility was not included in the Trump administration's formal proposal revising who qualifies for the food stamp program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Scott writes that ""the proposed rule will impact not only SNAP eligibility, but will also affect children's eligibility for school meal programs."" The program, Scott noted, ""allows schools to provide free meals to all students in high-poverty communities.""

The congressman writes that his committee's staff learned about the impact on school lunches in a phone briefing with USDA staff and requested that the department revise its proposal to include the estimate and restart the 60-day comment period.

He notes the USDA is required by law to include ""relevant scientific and technical findings"" in proposed rules and says the effect on school meals is an ""important technical finding that must be made public.""

Devin Nunes says 3 groups need to be examined to understand origins of Trump-Russia 'cover-up',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-says-3-groups-need-to-be-examined-to-understand-origins-of-trump-russia-cover-up,"Republican California Rep. Devin Nunes said there are three known groups that need to be examined to understand fully the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.

During an interview Sunday on Fox News, the top Republican said the Justice Department, which is conducting a so-called investigation into the investigators, needs to determine the intersection of the FBI, Hillary Clinton's campaign and Fusion GPS, and a group of people at Cambridge University in London.

“Those are the three entities that we know,"" Nunes told host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures. ""What the DOJ needs to get to the bottom of is, when did these all intersect? You don’t get that until you start to interview people and remember the Mueller team never bothered to interview many of these folks.""

Former special counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation earlier this year and was unable to find sufficient evidence to establish criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. GOP investigators, such as Nunes, want to know when Mueller knew there was no coordination in his 22-month-long investigation. They also are concerned the FBI has not been forthcoming in its assertion that the counterintelligence into President Trump's campaign in July 2016, after Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos told an Australian diplomat Alexander Downer he heard the Russian has damaging information on Clinton.

Papadopoulos was allegedly told about this Clinton ""dirt"" by the mysterious Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, whom Mueller admitted in his report had lied to investigators yet was never charged.

""Mifsud is at the heart of the investigation. Mifsud is the one who supposedly knows about Clinton’s emails — that the Russians have Clinton emails. He supposedly said this to Papadopoulos, something about emails,"" Nunes said.

Nunes said that the Mifsud-Papadopoulos-Downer communications were ""the documented reason why they opened the investigation on July 31, 2016,"" but said that ""it is clear"" that the FBI was ramping up its inquiry earlier.

""What we’re trying to figure out is when did the FBI really start to run the investigation? What sort of processes did they use? What was the predicate?"" Nunes asked. ""It really appears like they were spying on the Trump campaign.""

Nunes said another key issue for Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine in their review of the Russia investigation origins is the role played by the dossier written by British ex-spy Christopher Steele.

The dossier contained a litany of unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia and was used extensively in the FBI's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to justify surveillance of former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with any wrongdoing. Steele compiled the dossier while he was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which itself was being funded by Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

While possible misuse of the Steele dossier in the FISA Court is the subject of an investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, whose report is expected to be released in September, the Barr-Durham review could follow up with prosecutorial action.

Stymieing his own efforts to inspect what the FBI was doing before July 2016, Nunes said the bureau has resisted handing over documents that he stresses he has a right to view under the purview of congressional oversight. Using his nickname for Mueller's team, the ""Mueller dossier team,"" Nunes said the Justice Department ""needs to look at these characters that were on Mueller’s team. I think they obstructed justice. They obstructed a congressional investigation.""

Beyond the FBI, the Clinton campaign, and Fusion GPS, Nunes said ""these intelligence-related folks"" at Cambridge University need to be placed under scrutiny. He name-dropped Steven Schrage, an American citizen who helped organize a symposium in July 2016, which would be before the FBI's counterintelligence operation officially began. During Mueller's testimony last week, the California congressman asked the former special counsel to confirm whether his office did not investigate who was responsible for inviting Trump campaign associates Page and Stephen Miller to this symposium. Mueller declined to answer.

Nunes was by Bartiromo prompted to speak about efforts by possible U.S. informants to ""entrap"" people tied to Trump campaign, including a $10,000 payment to Papadopoulos in 2017 during Mueller's investigation just before he was arrested by the FBI, and contacts between Cambridge University figures and former national security adviser Michael Flynn that date back years before the 2016 election.

Back in 2014, Flynn met Russian-British graduate student Svetlana Lokhova during a trip to the University of Cambridge. Flynn was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the time. Reports came out in 2017 that said spy officials had concerns about Flynn's ties to Russians, including his encounter with Lokhova. Flynn's spokesman said the meeting was ""incidental"" and Lokhova told Fox News last year she is ""not a Russia spy"" and said she believes Flynn ""was targeted and I was used to do it."" The dinner at which they met was set up by a United Kingdom academic group that included Cambridge academic Stefan Halper, an FBI informant who was later sent to make contact with members of Trump's campaign.

Nunes said ""none of this makes any sense"" because Mueller's unredacted report does not touch on any of this, but has an intent focus on the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between members of Trump's inner circle, including his son Donald Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya, an attorney with ties to the Kremlin who had predicated the meetup with the promise of dirt on Clinton.

Nunes said opposition research firm Fusion GPS had very suspicious activity surrounding the June 2016 meeting, including its co-founder Glenn Simpson meeting with Veselnitskaya multiple times. NBC News reported in November 2017 that Veselnitskaya said she received incriminating information on Democrats from Simpson, who had worked with her on a case involving money laundering by a Russian company. A lawyer for Fusion GPS said at the time the firm’s work on the Trump dossier was separate from the money laundering case and that the firm was unaware of the Trump Tower meeting when it happened.

But details on Fusion GPS was left out of Mueller's unredacted 448-page report, obliquely referenced only in a footnote. In fact, Mueller, who at times appeared to be unfamiliar with his own report, said during his testimony he was ""not familiar"" with Fusion GPS.

""This is nothing more, nothing less than a cover-up,"" Nunes said Sunday."
Acting DHS boss McAleenan praises Supreme Court 'victory' sanctioning use of Pentagon funds for border wall,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kevin-mcaleenan-dhs-supreme-court-victory-pentagon-funds-border-wall,"Kevin McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, told Fox News on Sunday it's a “big victory” that the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to tap billions of dollars in Pentagon funds to build sections of a border wall with Mexico.

“There was a big victory at the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Defense to move forward with that $2.5 billion to really accelerate the progress on the wall, and kind of double what we're doing with the congressionally appropriated funding, which is going well, as you noted up to 54 miles since we talked,” he told Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The court’s five conservative justices gave the administration the green light on Friday to begin work on four contracts it has awarded using Defense Department money. Lower courts had frozen funding for the projects while a lawsuit over the money proceeded. The court’s four liberal justices wouldn’t have allowed construction to start.

The Supreme Court’s action reversed the decision of a trial court, which initially froze the funds in May, and an appeals court, which kept that freeze in place earlier this month. The freeze had prevented the government from tapping approximately $2.5 billion in Pentagon money to replace existing sections of barrier in Arizona, California and New Mexico with more robust fencing.

The case in which the Supreme Court ruled began after the 35-day partial government shutdown that started in December of last year. The shutdown ended in February after Congress approved approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding, but the amount was far less than the $5.7 billion Presiden Trump was seeking. The president then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of wall.

KIDNAPPED AUSTRIAN TRIATHLETE SWEET-TALKS CAPTOR INTO LETTING HER GO: REPORT

The money Trump identified included $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department money and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture fund.

The case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds, which the administration said would be used to build more than 100 miles of fencing.

One project would replace 46 miles of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles in Arizona for $646 million. The other two projects in California and Arizona were smaller.

The other funds were not at issue in the case. The Treasury Department funds so far have survived legal challenges, and Customs and Border Protection has earmarked the money for work in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley but has not yet awarded contracts. Transfer of the $3.6 billion in military construction funds was awaiting approval from the defense secretary.

McAleenan told Bartiromo that “building every day down there in the border … that's already providing significant new operational capability, and helping us control some high traffic areas of the border.”

He said that he did believe the situation at the border has been improving by “almost every measure,” but the only way to eradicate the immigration crisis completely would be through congressional action.

Former public defender: DOJ plan to resume federal executions a 'recipe for problems',https://thehill.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/455140-former-public-defender-trumps-plan-to-resume-federal-executions-is-recipe-for-problems,"Former public defender Robert Dunham on Monday said that the Trump administration’s plan to resume federal executions after nearly two decades is a “recipe for problems,” saying that such a move could catch some authorities unprepared if anything goes wrong.

“What we’ve seen is that there’s been 15 years of no executions,” Dunham, now the executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, said in an appearance on Hill.TV.

“Now you’re going to carry out five executions in the span of five weeks, three executions in the span of five days with personnel that have not carried out any executions at all,” he continued. “That particular compressed schedule if it goes forward is a recipe for problems.”

Dunham explained that federal authorities carrying out the executions need to be properly trained.

“These are going to be the first executions, so you know they’re going to be legal challenges — they frequently go on until the last minute and so you’ve got potentially unprepared personnel facing a situation that none of them has faced in a period of 15 years,” he told Hill.TV.

The Justice Department announced last week that it plans to reinstate the federal death penalty, beginning with the executions of death-row inmates later this year. All five of the inmates that Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrFormer public defender: DOJ plan to resume federal executions a 'recipe for problems' The death penalty is racially biased, fiscally irresponsible and very inaccurate Trump starts another day with Cummings attack: '25 years of all talk, no action!' MORE named in his release were convicted for the murders of children.

“The Justice Department upholds the rule of law — and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system,” Barr’s statement read in part.

Dunham, meanwhile, cast doubt over whether the executions, which are scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020, will actually move forward.

“In the statement last week, Attorney General Barr said he was directing the bureau of prisons to adopt a new protocol, which is going to be a single drug — pentobarbital — the same drug that’s used in Texas and Georgia and Missouri,” he said.

“But the difficulty as a legal matter is you can’t say this is our new protocol, you have to go through the rule-making process,” he added.

Dunham said this compressed system doesn’t allow for “meaningful consideration” for ensuring whether the drugs were obtained legally by a drug company with the appropriate health and safety records.

“If you’re going to have a death penalty — the ultimate in the law — I think it’s critical that we follow the law,” he told Hill.TV.

Barr's announcement comes as the number of executions in the U.S. has declined over the last decade.

According to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the number of death-row inmates had fallen for the 17th consecutive year in 2017.

It also comes amid concerns about whether capital punishment disproportionately impacts African Americans. Dunham said there is still a disproportionate number of people of color who are on death rows around the country, saying this discrimination generally happens in two stages.

“The first is who gets capitally prosecuted — what kind of case and there we see a ‘victim preference if you will’ and that’s where you get the argument that black lives don’t matter because you are much more likely to be capitally prosecuted if you’ve committed an offense against a white person and particularly against a white woman.”

The data came in about the same as the trade expected.

Corn

In 2019, the U.S. farmers planted 91.7 million acres of corn, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). That equates to roughly 69 million football fields of corn and 3% above last year's acreage, according to NASS estimates.

The overall condition of the corn crop is rated at 58% good to excellent in the top 18 corn producing states, compared to 57% a week ago.

The USDA pegged 58% of the corn crop was in the silk stage, compared with a 83% five-year average.

Also, 13% of the corn has entered the dough stage vs. a 23% five-year average.



Soybeans

The nation’s crop is rated 54% good/excellent, equal to a week ago.

Also, 57% of the soybean crop is blooming vs. a 79% five-year average.

The USDA pegged the amount of soybeans setting pods at 21%, well below a five-year average of 45%.



Wheat

The U.S. winter wheat harvest is 75% complete vs. a 79% five-year average.

Meanwhile, the U.S. spring wheat crop is rated as 76% good to excellent, equal to last week’s rating."

The $100 million civil suit, which the Department of Justice filed in the Northern District of California, targets BTC-e for offering services to US residents without abiding by US financial regulations, including declining to register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business, failing to establish anti-money laundering procedures as stipulated under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and failing to report suspicious activities.

From the complaint:

“At no point in time did BTC-e have any AML policies or procedures, let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions. To the contrary, BTC-e’s lax policies encouraged persons engaged in criminal activity to use its services, and BTC-e became the virtual currency exchange of choice for criminals looking to launder their illegal proceeds.”

FinCEN had levied $88.6 million in penalties against BTC-e and $12 million in penalties against Vinnik, and the DOJ says that the lawsuit intends to “enforce” those fines.

New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."
"California man behind $1 billion spinal surgery fraud hid millions from government, DOJ says",https://www.mercurynews.com,['Teri Sforza'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/29/mastermind-of-1-billion-spinal-surgery-fraud-hid-millions-from-government-doj-says/,"The imprisoned mastermind of a $1 billion spinal surgery scam faces new federal charges that he violated a court order to forfeit his classic car collection, including an iconic 1965 Aston Martin made famous by fictional British spy James Bond.

Michael Drobot, who operated Pacific Hospital Long Beach, has agreed to plead guilty to charges of wire fraud, engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from unlawful activity and criminal contempt of court.

Drobot, 74, formerly of Corona del Mar, is serving a five-year sentence at Taft Correctional Institution in Kern County. He faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in federal prison on the new charges, and will be arraigned in coming weeks in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, according to the Department of Justice.

Drobot’s attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Drobot, 74, pleaded guilty in 2014 to orchestrating a scheme authorities dubbed Operation Spinal Cap, which paid more than $50 million in bribes to doctors and other health professionals in exchange for steering spinal surgeries and other procedures to his hospital. Former state Sen. Ron Calderon also was convicted of taking bribes from Drobot.

As part of his plea, Drobot was ordered by the court to forfeit $10 million to the United States government. So the Aston Martin on the auction block in August 2018 — along with his 1958 Porsche and his 1971 Mercedes-Benz — was a penance of sorts, helping to fulfill that obligation and provide restitution to victims.

The Aston alone was valued by RM Sotheby’s auctioneers at $1.2 million to $1.4 million, and ultimately sold for $1.5 million.

But rather than forwarding sale proceeds to the government, as promised, Drobot disobeyed the court order and illegally kept the proceeds for himself, the U.S. Department of Justice said in court filings this week. (Drobot No. 1, Drobot No. 2).

Drobot conveyed an interest in the Aston Martin to the classic car auction company in exchange for a $1 million advance on the sale proceeds on June 22, 2018, the DOJ said. That $1 million was wired to Drobot’s bank account and used “for personal expenses and not to satisfy the court’s forfeiture order. Drobot further admitted to laundering the money via transfers to third parties,” the DOJ said.

In February, the DOJ seized Drobot’s interest in his Newport Beach home and Perris business property to help satisfy the order, said spokesman Ciaran McEvoy.

Prosecutors have charged 17 people, and won 10 convictions, as part of Operation Spinal Cap, the $1 billion health care fraud scheme Drobot spearheaded. The accused hail from Manhattan Beach, Newport Beach, Redondo Beach, Palos Verdes Estates, Santa Ana, San Clemente and many other cities.

Patients wait

Thousands of patients received surgeries at Pacific Hospital not knowing that Drobot had bribed their physician to perform their surgery at Pacific Hospital, prosecutors said in court documents.

“The patients believed that they were receiving conflict-free medical advice when, in fact, (Drobot) illegally incentivized their physician to perform the surgery at Pacific Hospital,” they wrote.

Waiting not so patiently in the wings now, as the government’s mammoth probe proceeds, are those patients, who seek redress.

In an avalanche of lawsuits, more than 160 patients contend that cheap, nonsurgical-grade hardware may have been drilled into their bones during operations that might not have been necessary to begin with, leaving them in excruciating pain.

Their suits, in civil court, target doctors and hospitals allegedly involved in the scheme — but those suits are in a deep freeze so as not to interfere with the DOJ’s criminal probe.

Doctors and hospitals targeted by those lawsuits — who have not been charged in the federal criminal probe — deny wrongdoing, including knowingly using inferior product in surgeries. Drobot has said his companies never bought or used any knock-off screws or parts for spinal surgeries.

How much of that $10 million might patients see?

Drobot’s forfeited money goes into a government forfeiture fund, and there’s a process called remission where victims can request their share, said DOJ spokesman McEvoy.

“It would be fair and just — and seems to me the only right answer — for the bulk of whatever’s recovered from Drobot and his co-defendants to go to the actual patients who are suffering,” said attorney Justin Berger, who represents whistleblowers in the case.

Attorneys have asked the court to allow some of the patients’ civil lawsuits to move forward, and that will be considered on Tuesday, July 30.

“We’re hopeful that — given the passage of time, that patients continue to live in pain and that patients continue to die — some or all of these suits will be set for trial soon,” Berger said. “There are doctors still walking around as free men without any indictments — I hope this means there will be continued cooperation and the government will go after all the wrongdoers.”"
Who's afraid of cryptocurrencies? Everyone in Washington,https://www.dallasnews.com,"['Stephen Moore', 'Connect With Stephen Moore']",07-28-2019,2019,7,https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/07/28/afraid-cryptocurrencies-everyone-washington,"What is everyone so afraid of? The one word answer is: competition. Cryptocurrencies challenge the state's strangle-hold monopoly over fiat money. This could diminish the authoritative powers of arrogant and fallible central banks.

Before refuting some of these concerns, for full disclosure I should note that I recently became an investor and economic consultant with Decentral, a California-based crypto that will tie its currency to the dollar.

Cryptos will provide a ""private option"" alternative to government money. They are hedges against inflation. and they can execute global blockchain transactions much more swiftly and at lower costs than using government money.

The claim that these currencies will be used by drug runners, money launderers and tax cheats is certainly legitimate. But this is like saying that automobiles should have been outlawed because they were used as getaway vehicles for criminals like Bonnie and Clyde. Almost any new technology can be used for good or evil. There are many legitimate reasons that hundreds of millions of law-abiding citizens worldwide would want financial privacy from government. They shouldn't be suspected of criminal activity simply because they want that right.

What is laughable is the claim that cryptos risk causing financial panics. Wait a minute. The Fed and other central banks and government financial regulators have done a pretty good job of whirling up crises on their own. Nearly every recession and depression of the last century can be traced to government mistakes, and often by the self-proclaimed oracles at the Fed.

Governments in the U.S. and around the world have amassed tens and even hundreds of trillions of dollars of debts and unfunded liabilities. It's hardly paranoid to think politicians will eventually try to inflate their way out of these debts.

Cryptos are a check and balance against currency debauchery.

This revolution in what we call money is coming one way or the other and the unprepared regulatory regimes will mostly delay and complicate, or may send the activity underground. The more these products are resisted, the more it is likely to drive up demand for private money alternatives. Just look at the big gains in Bitcoin in recent months.

Congress and the regulators should let this new exciting digital technology proliferate. No one knows whether Libra, Decentral, Bitcoin or other private competitors will win out. But as Ralph Benko, formerly with the Chamber of Digital Commerce, has pointed out: ""What would have happened to American technological dominance if regulators had snuffed out Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix?""

These companies would have been stillborn and Google might have emerged in Switzerland, Facebook in Singapore, Amazon in Israel. This would only weaken America's technological superiority and hurt the dollar, not save it. Besides, who is a greater threat to our liberties and American economic prosperity? Mark Zuckerberg or Rep. Maxine Waters?

DOJ approves T-Mobile-Sprint deal with conditions,https://www.axios.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.axios.com/doj-approves-t-mobile-sprint-deal-with-conditions-5025138d-4f25-4103-82ef-8e6ce0dce21a.html,"The Justice Department and five states reached the settlement with Sprint and T-Mobile, which calls on the companies to:

Sell Sprint's prepaid brands (Boost, Virgin and Sprint Prepaid) to Dish Network.

Make available at least 20,000 cell sites to Dish

Divest some spectrum in the 800MHz range to Dish

Provide Dish with ""robust access"" to the T-Mobile network for at least 7 years while Dish builds out its 5G network

engage in ""good faith"" negotiations about leasing some of Dish's existing 600MHz spectrum

Yes, but: Dish already has been sitting on a bunch of spectrum that it has yet to use and many wireless industry experts doubt its ability to emerge as a serious fourth player in the market.

What they're saying:

Assistant Attorney General Makin Delrahim said that the merger ""would be anti-competitive” if not for the remedies the agency includes in its settlement.

Former FCC official Gigi Sohn: ""The state AGs who sued to block the merger shouldn’t be fooled by this weak attempt to maintain competition in the mobile wireless market.... A new mobile wireless entrant that starts with zero postpaid subscribers and that must rely on its much bigger rival, the new T-Mobile, just to operate is not a competitor. It's a mobile Frankenstein.""

T-Mobile CEO John Legere noted in a statement that the Dish deal won't change ""previously announced target synergies, profitability and long-term cash generation"" projections.

Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen said the deal will help fulfill two decades of work and more than $21 billion in spectrum investments. Dish also notes in a press release that the deal requires it to ""use its spectrum to deploy a nationwide 5G broadband network covering at least 70 percent of the U.S. population by June 14, 2023"" or else ""make voluntary contributions to the U.S. Treasury of up to $2.2 billion.”

What's next: A court will have to approve the deal, and 10 other states have separately sued to block it. Those states have asked the court for more time in the event of a DoJ settlement that changed the terms of the deal, as is now the case."
DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"
Daycare Owner’s Son Arrested By Feds In Homeland Security Raid,https://miami.cbslocal.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://miami.cbslocal.com/2019/07/29/homeland-security-raid-miami-daycare-center/,"SOUTHWEST MIAMI-DADE (CBSMiami) – The son of a Southwest Miami-Dade day care center owner is under arrest, however, his name and the charges have not been released.

The Department of Homeland Security served a warrant around 4:30 a.m. at the Little Seeds Academy Child Care and Learning Center at 10470 Bird Road.

Once inside, cyber agents were looking at computers. H-S-I said computers and telephones were being removed from the home early Monday afternoon. A CBS4 crew captured a computer tower being loaded in to a federal vehicle.

HSI says it can neither confirm nor deny reports that they were looking into whether there was child pornography that had been downloaded onto at least one of the computers in the home.

That is what worried parents heard.

“You see these people every day you just don’t expect these things to happen especially here in a facility where children are,” said parent Zaira Perez. “I have three kids here. I have my baby, a 4-year-old and another who used to go to school here so our main concern is that they are all okay and none are involved in this situation. This is the worst nightmare for any parent.”

Perez told CBS4’S Peter D’Oench “My heart aches for what happened. We just don’t know. These are my little babies. Just to know that that person had contact with the kids. It is disgusting.”

Another parent, Ana Hernandez, said, “We just want to know what happened to our kids. We want to know if any of the pictures on the computers are of our kids. My want to clear up the situation.”

Sophia Ramirez, another parent, was near tears when she said, “How do you take this news? There are no answers at all. I don’t have words for this. You put your trust in people here with the kids.”

Another parent, Mirna Gomez, another parent, said, “My daughter is the last one out of the day care every day and she leaves when the man who was arrested is there. She was there when no one else was there and I worry about her being in contact with him.”

Gomez also said he had spoken with the daughter of the owner and said, “She said these allegations are not true, what’s being reported. She said it only has to do with something personal and not something with the day care.”

Gomez said she was told the daycare was going to voluntarily shut down for a week.

“They’d don’t have to,” said Gomez. “They are going to do this on their own.”

D’Oench also caught up with the daughter of the daycare owner, who was identified as Julietta. She was speaking with the concerned parents.

“What are you telling them about the day care?” Julietta was asked.

“I am telling them that I am like them, that I just don’t know what is going on,” he said.

“Are you telling them if they were impacted?” Julietta was asked.

“They haven’t been,” she said. “This was just something to do with computers and something personal and not the day care.”

DCF, the Department of Children and Families, is investigating.

A neighbor named Carmen is also concerned.

“They should be arrested and put in jail for the rest of their life. I have kids and I’m against child pornography all kinds, but when it’s about children I’m 100% against it. ”

Another neighbor, Yulio Lledias, said “I am sorry about this. This is so close to home. This is really bad. I mean I have a 7 year old daughter.”

Homeland Security says the man taken into custody Monday is expected to appear in federal magistrate’s court Tuesday."

Textile Waste Has Surged 811% Since the '60s According to the EPA,https://www.highsnobiety.com,"['Isabelle Hore-Thorburn', 'Weekend Staff Writer']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/textile-waste-increase-epa-report/,"According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), textile waste has increased by 811 percent between 1960 and 2015. The majority of this waste is made up of municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW encompasses discarded clothing, as well as small furniture, carpets, tires, and footwear.

The EPA calculated that in 2015, clothing and footwear produced 11.9 million tons of waste and 4.5 percent of total MSW. Decades of data gathering evidence a dramatic increase in textile waste, which grew from 1.76 million tons in 1960 to more than 16 million tons in 2015.

Jackie King, executive director of Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles (SMART), told Supply Chain Dive that the problem has worsened significantly in the last decade. She explained that “a lot of the ‘fast fashion’ clothing is not very well made and might not last through more than a few washes before ending up in the landfill.”

Trump Labels Elijah Cummings 'Racist',https://www.usnews.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.usnews.com/news/ken-walshs-washington/articles/2019-07-29/trump-labels-elijah-cummings-racist,"President Donald Trump starts the week at the center of another racial firestorm. He is lashing out at Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., an African American and chairman of the House Oversight Committee, which has been conducting various investigations of the Trump administration.

Trump criticized Cummings and his home town of Baltimore throughout the weekend in unusually harsh terms. The president said Cummings should be more concerned with improving horrendous conditions in his Baltimore-based congressional district than trying to improve life for migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico, which Cummings has been trying to do. Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday, ""If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district, and Baltimore itself, perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. His radical 'oversight' is a joke!""

Trump also tweeted Sunday, ""There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know, that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district, and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!""

Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, defended Trump Sunday. Asked if he understood that Trump's comments were offensive to some Americans, Mulvaney told CBS News, ""I understand that everything that Donald Trump says is offensive to some people,"" Asked if he understood why some people would consider Trump's comments as racist, Mulvaney said, ""I understand why, but that doesn't mean that it's racist. The president is pushing back against what he sees as wrong. It's how he's done it in the past, and he'll continue to do it in the future.""

In a series of tweets Saturday and Sunday, Trump wrote that conditions in Cummings' district, which includes part of Baltimore and is majority African American, are ""FAR WORSE and more dangerous"" than those at the border between the United States and Mexico. Trump said Cummings' district is a ""disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.""

""If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place,"" Trump wrote. He said Cummings' ""district is considered the 'Worst in the USA"" and ""no human being would want to live there.""

Trump called Cummings a ""brutal bully"" for criticizing Border Patrol officials about conditions at the southern border. Trump said the congressman ""spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through 'Oversight.'....He does NOTHING for his very poor, very dangerous and very badly run district!"" And Trump said, ""Statistically, Baltimore ranks last in almost every major category. Cummings has done nothing but milk Baltimore dry, but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing!"" Trump gave no details to back up these accusations. On Sunday, Trump again tweeted that Cummings ""has done a very poor job for his district and the City of Baltimore.""

Cummings, who has a long history as a civil rights leader, replied on Twitter, ""Mr. President, I go home to my district daily. Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors. It is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch. But, it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents.""

Trump critics saw racism in his outbursts. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was born and raised in Baltimore and whose father and brother each served as the city's mayor, wrote on Twitter that Cummings ""is a champion in the Congress and the country for civil rights and economic justice, a beloved leader in Baltimore, and deeply valued colleague. We all reject racist attacks against him and support his steadfast leadership.""

Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential front runner, wrote on Twitter that Trump is ""unfit to hold the office"" of president. ""A President is supposed to lift this nation up. Not tear it down.,"" Biden said. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another top Democratic presidential candidate, told CNN, ""It's unbelievable that we have a President of the United States who attacks American cities, who attacks Americans. That is a disgrace.""

Trump critics point out that two weeks ago, he attacked four Democratic congresswomen of color who have criticized him and said they should ""go back"" to the countries where they came from. All are U.S. citizens. Three were born in the United States and the fourth is a naturalized citizen who came to the USA from Somalia as a refugee.

Trump's criticism of the four legislators prompted the Democrat-controlled House to pass a resolution condemning his remarks as racist."
Attorney General William Barr orders first federal executions in nearly two decades,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/william-barr-orders-first-federal-executions-in-nearly-two-decades.html,"The federal government will resume executing death row inmates after nearly two decades without doing so, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.

Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five inmates convicted of murder and other crimes. The executions have been scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020.

The department also announced a new execution protocol, replacing the three-drug cocktail previously used in federal executions with the single drug, pentobarbital.

The last federal execution was carried out in 2003. There are 62 individuals on federal death row, according to a tracker maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Supreme Court outlawed state and federal death penalty laws in the 1972 decision Furman v. Georgia. The ruling invalidated the laws then on the books, but did not outlaw the death penalty under all circumstances, leading states and the federal government to draft new legislation.

The federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, and expanded by Congress in 1994. No federal executions took place, however, until 2001, according to to the Bureau of Prisons website.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Barr said in a statement. ""Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding."""
How can $2 million in U.S. EPA Trash-Free grants curb the Great Lakes plastic problem?,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Laura Johnston', 'Ljohnston Cleveland.Com']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cleveland.com/news/2019/07/how-can-2-million-in-us-epa-trash-free-grants-curb-the-great-lakes-plastic-problem.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio – How can $2 million in U.S. EPA grants clean up the plastic-plagued Great Lakes?

Local environmental groups – including Surfrider, Alliance for the Great Lakes and Drink Local. Drink Tap – are interested in applying for grants, announced this month as part of the annual $300 million Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.

But some experts say the money will do little to solve the problem of 22 million pounds of plastic dumped into the Great Lakes each year.

The only real solution is to stop making more plastic, said Sherri A. Mason, sustainability coordinator at Penn State University’s Behrend campus.

“It’s money and I appreciate money being put toward anything,” Mason said. “If you really want to solve this problem, you don’t focus on removing the trash... That’s a Band-aid on a gaping wound when really what we need are stitches.”

The EPA plans to release details in October. A spokeswoman said the cleanup and preventing of all marine and shoreline trash will be eligible for grants up to $500,000 and that plastics will likely be an important component of many applications.

“This first-of-its-kind trash-focused grant program is yet another example of progress being made under the GLRI,” said EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp. “Thanks to this funding, a number of Great Lakes communities can receive a meaningful assist in removing trash and litter from beaches, shorelines and waterways where cleanup projects are sorely needed.”

Erin Huber, director of Drink Local. Drink Tap, hopes the grants reward efforts to “stop creating the trash in the first place.”

Since 2010, Drink Local volunteers have picked up 6,681 pounds of trash from Cleveland beaches.

“Clean ups, though we do them, are a last resort,” Huber said. “I worry that this grant might be a shiny thing to take our attention away from real issues - unsustainable consumption, unsustainable plastic (aka fossil fuel) use.”

How big is the problem?

Lake Erie has 46,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometer, rivaling the dirtiest part of the world’s oceans, Mason said in the 2018 State of the Great Lakes speech at the City Club of Cleveland.

The earth adds about 300 million tons of plastic every year.

Nearly half of it is packaging.

About 10 percent is recycled -- a number that won’t likely increase since plastic is so cheap to manufacture.

About 10 percent ends up in waterways.

Much of it -- including fast-food straws, cigar tips and plastic bottle caps -- comes flushed from city streets throughout the watershed, down storm drains and into the lake, according to a Rochester Institute of Technology study. The trash washes up on shore, making up about 80 percent of the litter on beaches.

Winds and currents usually push the trash to the east and southern shores of each Great Lake.

In 2018, more than 14,300 volunteers worked with the Alliance for the Great Lakes at 900 beach clean ups, over all five Great Lakes, collecting 35,600 pounds of trash. About 87 percent of that trash was plastic.

“We see a litter issue on a lot of beaches,” Alliance spokeswoman Jennifer Caddick said. “It’s going to have to be a bigger solution than just beach clean ups.”

What are people doing already?

Local governments and businesses have taken their own actions.

In May, Cuyahoga County Council voted 8-3 to enact a plastic bag ban, the first in Ohio, in part to keep plastic out of the lake. County Councilwoman Sunny Simon, who pushed for years for the ban, said county residents use 320 million plastic bags each year. The Republican-dominated state legislature, though, may ban the bag ban.

Many Northeast Ohio restaurants have eliminated plastic straws and have switched Styrofoam take-out containers for biodegradable options.

What else could we do?

Grants could pay for all sorts of projects and programs.

Take the invention of Thomas Zung, a distinguished senior fellow at Stanford University, who won Cleveland Water Alliance’s ErieHack competition in June with a geodesic dome that collects trash from storm sewer outflows. A crane then empties and dumps the trash.

Zung and his team of Cleveland college students, won $40,000 for the idea from Erie Hack. He plans to apply for a Trash-Free grant, too.

Tim Hoellein, an assistant professor of biology at Loyola University Chicago, who studies trash in the Great Lakes, plans to apply for a grant to boost his research, which includes analyzing data from Alliance for the Great Lakes clean ups. The number of cigarette butts, one of the top items found on beaches, has dropped over the last 15 years.

“There’s some room for optimism,” Hoellein said. “A suite of public policies can have a positive outcome over the long term.”

Hoellein appreciates the Trump administration’s spotlight on the trash problem. So far, he said, garbage is not a political issue. Everyone, regardless of party, can see it.

(That said, the Trump campaign is selling packs of plastic straws labeled “Make straws great again.” Plastic straws account for about 1 percent of the plastic in the oceans, according to Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions.)

What’s the problem with trash?

Cleaning it up costs cities money. Its ugliness may detour tourism. There are public health concerns with people exposed to diapers, needles or tampons, plus wildlife problems for fish and birds who eat it or get entangled in it.

Hoellein’s team has analyzed 250 fish, 95 percent of which have plastic in their stomach. The plastic may be as small as a microfiber from a fleece jacket that washed off in the laundry. “But it’s almost universally there,” he said.

Lake lovers hope the federal focus on trash will help reverse the trash flow.

Said the Alliance’s Cleveland office outreach coordinator, Destinee Henton: “I applaud the EPA for their commitment to cleaning up our most precious natural resource.”

Senators who visited border ask DHS to improve migrant care,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Leigh Ann Caldwell']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/26/senators-who-visited-border-ask-dhs-to-improve-migrant-care/23779134/,"WASHINGTON — After visiting migrant detention centers near the southern border, Senate Democrats are requesting that the Department of Homeland Security make immediate changes to its detention centers, citing ""serious concerns"" with conditions.

In a letter signed by 13 Democrats who visited Customs and Border Patrol processing centers near the border last week, the senators list 18 actions the agency should take immediately that they say would ensure humane treatment of migrant children and result in better oversight of the facilities.

CBP processing centers have been scrutinized as migrants, including children, have been held in sub par conditions far longer than the 72-hour limit with reports of abuse and mistreatment.

The senators are asking acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and acting Commissioner of CBP, Mark Morgan, to respond to their request by Thursday and provide a telephone briefing by Aug. 10 with an update on if the requests are being addressed.

Among the senators' requests: improve the water quality at the McAllen Border Patrol Station; provide schedules to Congress indicating that migrants can make phone calls, eat, take showers and brush their teeth; darken rooms so children can sleep.

The letter notes that the senators want to know if the migrants can report claims of abuse and what type of medical and psychological care the migrants have access to, and if DHW will support additional independent monitoring of facilities.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is the highest ranking member of Congress to visit the border. He and 12 other Democratic senators visited the Border Patrol processing facility in McAllen, as well as processing centers Donna and Ursula, also in Texas.

""The searing accounts about the conditions endured by migrant families are true. We saw overcrowding. We heard migrants tell us that they were unable to brush their teeth, shower, call their families, or access feminine hygiene products,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier this week. ""We saw children in soiled clothing, caged and expressionless — heartbreaking, thousand-mile stares on the faces of toddlers…where smiles and laughter should have been.""

The letter notes that a July inspector general report instructed DHS to ""take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults.""

Aaron Hull, head of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, will be reassigned to Detroit on Monday, according to documents obtained by NBC News.

Treasury pick Monica Crowley spread Obama smears: 'Can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?',https://www.cnn.com,"['Andrew Kaczynski', 'Nathan Mcdermott']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/kfile-monica-crowley/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an ""Islamic community organizer"" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns."" During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010 , Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

""Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,"" wrote Crowley. ""He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.""

""It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?"" she added.

Crowley added, ""How could he....support the enemy?""

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" wrote Crowley.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she added. ""He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.""

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing a bout the Obama administration in June 2013 , Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote. ""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy.""

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

""Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,"" she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. ""The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

""Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,"" she added. ""Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'.""

""The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,"" reads the column.

""Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy ""companions"" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."""
U.S. Satellite Operators Urge Commerce Department to Revise Proposed Commercial Remote Sensing Regulations,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-satellite-operators-urge-commerce-090000762.html,"WESTMINSTER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

Proposed regulations would be a step backward for U.S. industry, giving foreign firms a competitive advantage

U.S. satellite operators Maxar Technologies (MAXR) (MAXR.TO), Planet Labs, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global today urged the U.S. Department of Commerce to revise its proposed commercial remote sensing regulations, which as drafted would put U.S. firms at a significant disadvantage in the global marketplace.

Maxar, Planet, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global recently submitted a joint response to the Commerce Department’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking objecting to the newly proposed rules. While U.S. satellite operators appreciate the Department’s recognition of the risk to American leadership in space that comes from overly burdensome regulation, the proposed regulations would undermine U.S. competitiveness, impair U.S. innovation and deter investment in the U.S. commercial space industry. Commenters urged the Commerce Department to significantly revise the proposed regulations to take a more narrowly tailored approach to ensure the pressing need for continued U.S. leadership in commercial space is more appropriately balanced with other regulatory interests.

The U.S. commercial space industry provides critical products and services that support disaster and humanitarian crisis response, national and global security interests and enhance the location-enabled services that billions of people around the world use every day. Addressing the lack of transparency, operational uncertainty and institutionalized delays that impair the ability of the U.S. industry to bring innovative products and services to market should be the primary focus of the Commerce Department’s efforts. For example, license requests to bring new commercial satellite imagery capabilities to market can take years to approve, operators have little visibility into the decision-making process and operating licenses are subject to retroactive modifications after investment has already been made and systems are operating. By failing to address these issues, the proposed regulations put at risk continued U.S. leadership in the global commercial space industry, including the satellite imagery market, which is alone projected to reach $3 billion by 2020.

“The U.S. commercial space industry needs smart regulations that promote innovation, encourage competitiveness and bolster national security, and unfortunately the Commerce Department’s draft regulations fall far short of these goals,” said Dr. Walter Scott, Maxar CTO. “Maxar, Planet, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global urge U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the National Space Council to intervene and ensure that new regulations allow American space firms to continue to lead in this dynamic global industry.”

“The draft regulations represent a three-decade step backward,” said Robbie Schingler, Planet’s Co-founder. “This is cold water thrown onto a thriving ecosystem with rapidly changing space architectures, many new entrants and novel business models. We strongly urge regulators to take a strategic view and create a forward-leaning environment that opens up near-Earth space to efficient, secure and trusted commercial enterprise. Building new industries bolsters American competitiveness and grows the economy, which fuels national security. Should this rule progress without significant modification, it will represent a direct threat to 21st century U.S. national security.”

MORE said in a statement Thursday.

“Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding. The Justice Department upholds the rule of law—and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

Several states currently have a moratorium on the death penalty or have suspended the practice due to recent past wrongful convictions brought to light by groups such as the Innocence Project, which have secured the release of a number of death-row inmates in recent years. The total number of executions has declined over the last decade, in part, due to concerns that capital punishment disproportionately affects African Americans.

The death penalty has been abolished in about 70 percent of countries, including many democratic, industrialized nations similar to the U.S."

Earlier this year, Amazon invested $800 million to launch free one-day delivery for all Prime members.

Alphabet reported a beat on the top and bottom line. Revenue jumped 19% and profits came in at $9.2 billion as the tech giant continues to dominate internet search. Growth expected to persist as Google continues to stack ads into platforms including Maps and YouTube. This happened while Google and other tech giants are coming under scrutiny from foreign regulators and the U.S. Justice Department over antitrust concerns.

Facebook fell below the $200 mark to end the week despite posting strong revenue and earnings growth. The company reported $16.9 billion in revenue, beating estimates of $16.5 billion. Facebook also beat on earnings per share, announcing a profit of $1.99 per share versus estimates of $1.88 per share. This comes after Facebook reached a major settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and was hit with a $5 billion fine Wednesday. The fine is for privacy lapses following an investigation into the Cambridge Analytica Scandal."
US Department of Justice Accuses Crypto Exec of $7 Million Fraud Scheme,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Masao Akimoto']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-department-of-justice-accuses-crypto-exec-of-7-million-fraud-scheme,"Federal authorities in the state of New York have unsealed fraud charges against the principal of a purported cryptocurrency escrow company Volantis in the amount of over $7 million.

According to an announcement by the Department of Justice (DoJ), the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) unsealed a filing with the allegations on July 25. The defendant, Volantis principal Jon Barry Thompson, was also arrested on the same day.

Thompson allegedly made false representations about Volantis’ purported Bitcoin transaction service in order to fraudulently secure over $7 million from two different companies. In the filing, the complainants say that Thompson offered a service for low-risk crypto settlements by acting as a mutual custodian for two transacting parties.

Defendant allegedly used firm as a front for theft

However, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman claims that Thompson used this service as a front to steal the “custodied” money:

“Jon Thompson induced investors to engage in cryptocurrency transactions through his company, Volantis Market Making, by touting a transaction structure that would eliminate any risk of loss during the purchase. As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

The FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge, William F. Sweeney Jr., further specified that he believes Thompson used confusing jargon to exploit companies less familiar with the crypto space:

“Using phrases and terminology that the victim companies didn't understand, he allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency. Our job at the FBI is to investigate fraud and follow the money wherever it leads.”

The filing itself was signed on July 18, and contains the specifics of the fraud charges. According to the filing, the defendant is being charged with two counts of commodities fraud as well as two counts of wire fraud.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the DoJ indicted an individual on July 24 for failing to register himself or his company with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. The defendant, William Green, allegedly ran a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service on “Destination Bitcoin” out of New Jersey without registering as a money transmission business."
DOJ won't prosecute contempt citation against Barr and Ross,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/politics/doj-contempt-wont-prosecute-barr-ross/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Justice won't prosecute the attorney general or Commerce secretary after the House voted earlier this month to hold them in criminal contempt, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said Wednesday.

In a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Rosen described the department's ""long-standing position"" to not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress ""for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege.""

Pelosi tweeted Tuesday that she had signed the contempt citations for Attorney General Bill Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, which were approved mainly along party lines in the House. The citations followed resistance from the Justice and Commerce departments to provide a full range of documents requested by the House Oversight Committee as part of its investigation into the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.

The move to not prosecute the twin contempt citations was widely expected, and followed a similar move by the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, which declined to pursue contempt charges referred by Congress against then-Attorney General Eric Holder.

Both agencies have maintained that they have already provided thousands of documents to the committee about the census question, and that certain documents which had been withheld were done so in line with a federal court ruling that said that many of the same documents were privileged from disclosure in civil litigation.
