"Trump blasts 'con man' Al Sharpton, as feud with Dems over Baltimore heats up",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-con-man-al-sharpton-as-feud-with-dems-over-baltimore-heats-up,"President Trump on Monday blasted Rev. Al Sharpton as a ""con man,"" claiming he ""hates whites & cops,"" after the MSNBC host said he would travel to Baltimore amid the controversy over the president's comments about the city and its Democratic lawmakers.

Sharpton tweeted Sunday evening that he would travel to Baltimore to ""address Trump's remarks & bi-partisan outrage in the black community"" over them. Trump responded by slamming Sharpton, saying they have known each other for decades and used to attend fights together. But the president did not pull any punches when weighing in on Sharpton's character.

TRUMP RAMPS UP WAR OF WORDS WITH ELIJAH CUMMINGS, CALLS CONGRESSMAN 'RACIST'

“I have known Al for 25 years. Went to fights with him & Don King, always got along well. He “loved Trump!’ He would ask me for favors often,” the president tweeted. Trump then continued, “Al is a con man, a troublemaker, always looking for a score. Just doing his thing. Must have intimidated Comcast/NBC. Hates Whites & Cops!"" he tweeted.

Minutes later, the president added: ""Al Sharpton would always ask me to go to his events. He would say, “it’s a personal favor to me.” Seldom, but sometimes, I would go. It was fine. He came to my office in T.T. during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me. Just a conman at work!""

The president's tweets come after Sharpton, on Sunday night, posted details of a press conference he planned to give Monday “to address Trump’s remarks & bi-partisan outrage in the black community.” This was in response to Trump's criticism of Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and the condition of his district, which includes Baltimore.

Minutes after Trump's tweets, Sharpton responded, sharing a vintage photo of Trump with him, Jesse Jackson and James Brown.

""Trump at NAN Convention 2006 telling James Brown and Jesse Jackson why he respects my work. Different tune now,"" Sharpton tweeted.

Sharpton also called into MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" Monday, saying Trump is ""going to attack the most visible black person that comes across his desk and he thinks can set a tone,"" but that he is ""not going to bite the bait."" Sharpton then continued to discuss his history with Trump, and accused the president of ""peddling racism and dividing this country.""

""Trump says I’m a troublemaker & con man. I do make trouble for bigots. If he really thought I was a con man he would want me in his cabinet,"" Sharpton tweeted later Monday morning.

The Baltimore controversy came after Cummings criticized border patrol officials during a House Oversight Committee hearing. Trump, over the weekend, claimed that conditions in Cummings' Baltimore district were ""more dangerous"" than those at the border, described it as ""rodent infested,"" and said that ""no human being would want to live there.""

Democrats immediately rallied to Cummings' side, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and accused Trump of being racist.

REV. AL SHARPTON: BLACK VOTE IS NOT A 'LOCK FOR ANYONE' IN 2020

The president continued his attacks against Cummings on Monday, tweeting that while Cummings has been in office, Baltimore “has the worst Crime Statistics in the Nation,” and described Cummings’ representation as “25 years of all talk, no action!” He then lumped the congressmen in with other Democrats he has feuded with in recent weeks, the ""Squad"" of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib.

""If the Democrats are going to defend the Radical Left ""Squad"" and King Elijah's Baltimore Fail, it will be a long road to 2020,"" Trump said."
"Trump's intelligence chief resigned after the White House repeatedly suppressed his warnings about Russian interference, New York Times reports",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Tom Porter'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/dni-dan-coats-quit-white-house-suppressed-russia-warnings-nyt-2019-7,"Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats repeatedly found his warnings about the threat posed by Russia suppressed by the White House, The New York Times reported Sunday amid his resignation from the post.

According to The Times, Coats has often found himself at odds with President Donald Trump over Russia, a situation that worsened in recent months.

Coats saw Russia as an adversary to the US, The Times wrote, and pushed for closer cooperation with European countries to counter it, but the White House did not agree.

Several times Coats saw his language on the Kremlin's activities watered down by the White House, according to The Times.

A secret report by Coats on Russia's attempt to interfere in the 2018 midterms by spreading disinformation was reportedly altered by the White House. A public statement on Coats' conclusions contained less critical language than the original, The Times said.

A former senior intelligence official told The Washington Post that Coats felt marginalized on national security issues by the president and had come to see his departure as inevitable.

According to reports, Trump had been discussing replacing Coats for months.

Trump has long faced scrutiny for his warm comments on Russia and his changing positions on whether Russia interfered to help him secure his 2016 election victory.

Robert Mueller concluded in the special counsel's Russia investigation that there was insufficient evidence to charge the president or his aides with criminally conspiring with Russia in 2016.

Trump in a tweet Sunday announced that Coats would step down in mid-August and nominated Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas as his replacement.

In his tweet, he thanked Coats for his service but offered him no praise.

""The intelligence community is stronger than ever and increasingly well prepared to meet new challenges and opportunities,"" Coats wrote in his resignation letter, citing the recent appointment of an official charged with countering foreign election interference.

During his time as director of national intelligence, Coats had publicly contradicted Trump on the president's claims regarding Russia and North Korea.

In a statement released after Trump's summit in Helsinki with Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2018, Coats rebutted the president's apparent acceptance of Putin's claim that Russia had not interfered in the 2016 election.

At a national security conference in Colorado last year, Coats reacted with incredulity when told Trump had invited Putin to the White House at the summit.

""That's going to be special,"" he remarked.

And in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January, Coats contradicted Trump's claims that North Korea no longer posed a threat because of his summits with its leader, Kim Jong Un.

Coats told lawmakers that North Korea ""was unlikely to give up"" its nuclear weapons. He also contradicted Trump's claim that Iran was seeking to gear up its nuclear program.

In contrast to Coats, Ratcliffe is a Trump loyalist who has backed Trump's claims that Mueller 's investigation into Russian election interference was a partisan plot to unseat Trump.

In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, he said the special counsel's report and its conclusions ""weren't from Robert Mueller"" but rather ""were written by what a lot of people believe was Hillary Clinton's de facto legal team."""
Trump threatened to classify Antifa as a terrorist group. Germans hit back,https://www.cnn.com,['Rob Picheta'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/europe/germany-antifa-trump-twitter-scli-intl/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's threat to label anti-fascism protest movement Antifa a terrorist organization has prompted a backlash in Germany, where thousands of social media users have pledged solidarity with the group.

Trump tweeted on Saturday that the activist group was made up of ""gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats."" He said a move was being considered to label the movement a ""major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others),"" referring to the international criminal gang the Mara Salvatrucha.

Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA, the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others). Would make it easier for police to do their job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2019

His tweet followed the introduction of a resolution by Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and Bill Cassidy, aiming to have the group identified as ""domestic terrorists.""

But the call prompted a flurry of tweets in the US and in Germany, where #IchBinAntifa -- I am Antifa -- started trending on Twitter.

Several users who used the hashtag referenced Germany's history of fascism and anti-fascist resistance during the Nazi period.

'Morning Joe' guest on Baltimore: Trump's rhetoric could lead to 'horrible civil war',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/morning-joe-baltimore-trump-rhetoric-could-lead-horrible-civil-war,"An MSNBC political analyst said on ""Morning Joe"" Monday that President Trump's rhetoric ""could lead to some sort of a horrible civil war.""

Karine Jean-Pierre, the chief public affairs officer for MoveOn.org, was reacting with Joe Scarborough to Trump's attack on Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., in which the president called Baltimore “far worse and more dangerous” than the southern border.

“Cumming[s'] District is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place,” Trump tweeted, before calling for an investigation into why Baltimore received so much federal funding.

Jean-Pierre said Trump is putting out ""toxic"" racism in his tweets and it must be called out. She argued Cummings ""is everything Trump is not"" and Trump is ""threatened by Cummings.""

CUMMINGS SAYS THERE IS 'NO DOUBT' TRUMP IS RACIST FOLLOWING CONTROVERSY OVER TWEETS

“Donald Trump put his hand on the Bible — technically two Bibles — and took the oath of the presidency to be a president for all of us,” she said.

""And since that day, since that moment, every hour, he seems to just prove that to be wrong. He is not a president for black people. He’s not a president for women. He’s not a president for brown people. He’s not a president for the LGBTQ community. He chooses to just double down and triple down on bigotry and racism.""

EXCLUSIVE TOUR OF CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION FACILITY CONTRADICTS CLAIMS OF INHUMANE CONDITIONS, OVERCROWDING

Jean-Pierre said Trump intends to use racial division until Election Day next year, believing it will help him win and that he's threatening America's ""young democracy."" She and Scarborough both implored Republicans to speak out against Trump and warned of potentially dire consequences.

“I don’t know where Donald Trump wants to take this, but wherever it is, it’s going to be dangerous,"" she said.

""It could lead to some sort of horrible civil war. He is testing us. He’s testing the democracy. He’s shredding the Constitution. And so, Republicans, the leadership in the Republican Party, need to stand up. You have to speak up. Because if you don’t, you are encouraging this. You are picking Donald Trump, loyalty to Donald Trump, instead of to the country.”

Cummings, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, responded Sunday by declaring he has ""no doubt"" that Trump is racist.

Trump's Saturday morning tweet apparently referred to Cummings' questioning of border officials earlier this month. Cummings blasted acting Homeland Security chief Kevin McAleenan for saying the department was doing its “level best” when it comes to the humanitarian crisis at the border.

""What does that mean? What does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces, can't take a shower? Come on man,” he yelled. “What's that about? None of us would have our children in that position. They are human beings."""
John Ratcliffe: AG William Barr will deliver justice to any Obama officials who committed crimes,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/john-ratcliffe-ag-william-barr-will-deliver-justice-to-any-obama-officials-who-committed-crimes,"A top Republican investigator said accountability is coming for any of those individuals who may have committed crimes during the Trump-Russia investigation.

With the Justice Department conducting a review of that operation, Rep. John Ratcliffe said during a Fox News interview Sunday that he trusts Attorney General William Barr and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz to provide answers.

And while Ratcliffe said he does not want to prematurely accuse any specific person of a crime — as Democrats have done with President Trump — he stressed that it is clear crimes were committed by people during the Obama administration, including government officials.

“I think the first thing we need to do is make sure we don’t do what the Democrats have done,"" the Texas Republican told host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures. ""They accused Donald Trump of a crime and then they try and reverse engineer a process to justify that accusation. So I’m not going to accuse any specific person of any specific crime, I just want there to be a fair process to get there. What I do know as a former federal prosecutor is that it does appear that there were crimes committed during the Obama administration.”

Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican on the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees who was critical of special counsel Robert Mueller during his testimony in front of those committees last Wednesday, is Trump's pick to replace outgoing Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. Although many of the GOP lines of questioning last week focused on the origins of the investigation, Mueller largely shut them down, often saying these were issues that were ""outside my purview.""

Ratcliffe explained this is why Barr, who has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the so-called investigation of the investigators, must fill in the gaps.

“Now the things that Bob Mueller said he didn’t know about and his team clearly didn’t look at, those are things that would be fair for Bill Barr and the Department of Justice to look at. Because we know that things happened in the Obama administration that haven’t been answered. There’s been no accountability for that yet,"" Ratcliffe said.

“Well, the special counsel told us ... that they didn't do it. And if they didn't do it, the only place we can get the answers is from the Justice Department right now,"" Ratcliffe said. ""The American people want that. Their faith and trust, Maria, has been shaken in our Justice Department, and the only way to get that back is for there to be real accountability with a very fair process. Again, I have supreme confidence in Bill Barr's ability to deliver that. And at the end of the day, wherever the outcome may be, as long as we know that the process was fair, the evaluation was fair, justice will be done. Look, the truth always defends itself.”

Relevant to the Barr-Durham review is Horowitz's inspector general investigation into alleged government surveillance abuses against at least one adviser for Trump's campaign, Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with wrongdoing. Barr has said he is working closely with Horowitz, who is expected to wrap up his inquiry this fall, and the Justice Department could take prosecutorial action depending on the findings and recommendations.

Ratcliffe recommended three leads for the ""investigation of the investigators.""

The first related to former national security adviser Michael Flynn. “You talked earlier about Michael Flynn. His phone call with the Russian ambassador was a highly classified NSA intercept. Someone in the Obama administration leaked that call to the Washington Post. That’s a felony,"" he said.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed in February 2018 that the Justice Department was investigating that leak, and that he was overseeing the inquiry himself. “I am directing it personally and we’re pursuing it aggressively,” Sessions said at the time.

Ratcliffe suggested investigators also look into conflicting congressional testimony between Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and Justice Department official Bruce Ohr. Fusion GPS was the opposition research firm behind British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier, which was full of unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia and was used extensively by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to justify surveillance of Page. Ohr acted as an unofficial back channel between Steel and the FBI. “Glenn Simpson from Fusion GPS in talking about the Steele dossier, said under oath that he and Bruce Ohr did not meet until after the election. Bruce Ohr said under oath that they met three months before the election. One of them is not telling the truth. We need a process to identify that,"" Ratcliffe said.

The third area of interest, Ratcliffe said, is former FBI Director James Comey's memos on his interactions with Trump before he was fired in May 2017. “Where it all started, Jim Comey. He admitted that he leaked his confidential conversations with the president to a reporter. Did that include classified information? We need a fair processes to find out answers to that,"" Ratcliffe said.

Comey said he leaked one of his memos to a friend to leak to the press in the hope that it “might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” On May 16, 2017, the first Comey memo was reported for the first time. On May 17, 2017, then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as special counsel.

“I trust, because Bill Barr has earned my trust already and the trust of the American people, that there'll be a fair process with John Durham and with Michael Horowitz to get answers to that and provide accountability where it really belongs,"" Ratcliffe said."

Acting DHS boss McAleenan praises Supreme Court 'victory' sanctioning use of Pentagon funds for border wall,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kevin-mcaleenan-dhs-supreme-court-victory-pentagon-funds-border-wall,"Kevin McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, told Fox News on Sunday it's a “big victory” that the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to tap billions of dollars in Pentagon funds to build sections of a border wall with Mexico.

“There was a big victory at the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Defense to move forward with that $2.5 billion to really accelerate the progress on the wall, and kind of double what we're doing with the congressionally appropriated funding, which is going well, as you noted up to 54 miles since we talked,” he told Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The court’s five conservative justices gave the administration the green light on Friday to begin work on four contracts it has awarded using Defense Department money. Lower courts had frozen funding for the projects while a lawsuit over the money proceeded. The court’s four liberal justices wouldn’t have allowed construction to start.

The Supreme Court’s action reversed the decision of a trial court, which initially froze the funds in May, and an appeals court, which kept that freeze in place earlier this month. The freeze had prevented the government from tapping approximately $2.5 billion in Pentagon money to replace existing sections of barrier in Arizona, California and New Mexico with more robust fencing.

The case in which the Supreme Court ruled began after the 35-day partial government shutdown that started in December of last year. The shutdown ended in February after Congress approved approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding, but the amount was far less than the $5.7 billion Presiden Trump was seeking. The president then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of wall.

KIDNAPPED AUSTRIAN TRIATHLETE SWEET-TALKS CAPTOR INTO LETTING HER GO: REPORT

The money Trump identified included $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department money and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture fund.

The case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds, which the administration said would be used to build more than 100 miles of fencing.

One project would replace 46 miles of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles in Arizona for $646 million. The other two projects in California and Arizona were smaller.

The other funds were not at issue in the case. The Treasury Department funds so far have survived legal challenges, and Customs and Border Protection has earmarked the money for work in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley but has not yet awarded contracts. Transfer of the $3.6 billion in military construction funds was awaiting approval from the defense secretary.

McAleenan told Bartiromo that “building every day down there in the border … that's already providing significant new operational capability, and helping us control some high traffic areas of the border.”

He said that he did believe the situation at the border has been improving by “almost every measure,” but the only way to eradicate the immigration crisis completely would be through congressional action.

Papadopoulos wants DOJ to examine $10K given to him by CIA or FBI,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/papadopoulos-wants-doj-to-examine-10k-given-to-him-by-cia-or-fbi/,"Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos on Sunday said he is returning to Greece to get $10,000 given to him as part of a CIA or FBI setup to entrap him – and he now wants the Department of Justice to examine the cash.

Papadopoulos said he was given the money in Israel during the summer of 2017 from a guy he believes was a spy but turned the moolah over to his attorney for safekeeping in Greece.

“A man named Charles Tawil gave me this money under very suspicious circumstances. A simple Google search about this individual will reveal he was a CIA or State Department asset in South Africa during the ’90s and 2000s. I think around the time when Bob Mueller was the director of the FBI,” he told “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News.

Papadopoulos, who served 12 days in federal prison for lying to investigators about contacts with Russian-connected officials during the 2016 campaign, said he has a theory about why he was given the cash.

“The money, I gave it to my attorney in Greece because I felt it was given to me under very suspicious circumstances. And upon coming back to the United States I had about seven or eight FBI agents rummaging through my luggage looking for money,” he told Mario Bartiromo.

He believes it was part of a setup by the FBI or the special counsel Robert Mueller’s office to “bring a [Foreign Agent Registration Act] violation against me.”

He wants Attorney General William Barr and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to take a close look at the paper trail.

“Because I still have the bills and I think they are marked,” Papadopoulos said. “These bills that are still in Athens right now must be examined by the investigators because I think they are marked and they’re going to go all the way back to DOJ, under the previous FBI under Comey, and even the Mueller team.”

“If the Mueller team is going around entrapping campaign associates and Trump associates, the way they did to me — I am sure it wasn’t just me they did it to — it’s going to open up a massive can of worms,” he added.

Papadopoulos met with Joseph Misfud, a Maltese professor in London in early 2016 in London.

Misfud told him months before the Wikileaks published Hillary Clinton and Democratic National Committee emails that the Russians had dirt on the Democratic candidates.

Papadopoulos told Australian diplomat John Downer about Misfud’s assertions, and Downer forwarded the information to the FBI."

Vinnik, who remains in custody in Greece as governments worldwide jockey to extradite him, stands accused of laundering billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency stolen from other exchanges, most notably Mt. Gox.

Trump DOJ Sues BTC-e, Alexander Vinnik for $100 Million for Illicit Bitcoin Dealings

Alexander Vinnik bitcoin launderer BTC-e More

The $100 million civil suit, which the Department of Justice filed in the Northern District of California, targets BTC-e for offering services to US residents without abiding by US financial regulations, including declining to register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business, failing to establish anti-money laundering procedures as stipulated under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and failing to report suspicious activities.

From the complaint:

“At no point in time did BTC-e have any AML policies or procedures, let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions. To the contrary, BTC-e’s lax policies encouraged persons engaged in criminal activity to use its services, and BTC-e became the virtual currency exchange of choice for criminals looking to launder their illegal proceeds.”

FinCEN had levied $88.6 million in penalties against BTC-e and $12 million in penalties against Vinnik, and the DOJ says that the lawsuit intends to “enforce” those fines.

DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"
"At Vermont VA hospital, swirling accusations of harassment, retaliation, negligence",https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/07/28/hospital-swirling-accusations-harassment-retaliation-and-negligence/El7CDjsgvIW3BGZVKqSxdP/story.html,"But if that strong appraisal represented a pinnacle of Keller’s eight years at the VA, the last 13 months have represented a professional nadir, one involving a tangle of conflicting allegations of assault, medical negligence, and whistle-blower retaliation that has reverberated to the upper levels of the federal agency.

She received an overall rating of “outstanding,” earning highest marks for her clinical competence, supervisory ability, and personal qualities. The review was signed in November 2017 by Dr. Fima Lenkovsky, chief of the hospital’s anesthesiology department.

“This has shaken me to my soul,” said Keller, 51, a clinical assistant professor at Dartmouth College’s medical school who was fired from the VA hospital in October. “I am naive, and this has been an ugly process.”

Hospital officials said Keller, interviewed by the Globe at her lawyer’s office, was fired for endangering patient safety. But Keller and other female employees say her termination was reprisal for speaking out against Lenkovsky for allegedly bullying and harassing female employees, including a reported assault against a nurse during an operation in June 2018.

Keller’s dismissal outraged Dr. Stewart Levenson, a former VA official who served as medical services director for the New England system during 18 years at the agency.

“This is perhaps the most shocking case of misuse of the disciplinary process that I can recall from my VA experience, one that fails on any level to pass the ‘sniff’ test,” he wrote to VA attorneys. “The removal of Dr. Keller is not only extreme but unprecedented.”

Keller is one of four female employees at White River Junction who filed whistle-blower complaints against Lenkovsky with the VA’s Office of Special Counsel. The office has since referred the complaints to the VA medical inspector after determining they contained a “substantial likelihood of wrongdoing.”

In a whistle-blower complaint filed two days before her dismissal, Keller said that the hospital’s actions against her were punishment “for criticizing her supervisor, whose serious abuse and mismanagement was reported by no less than five different female employees of the VA.”

Two weeks after the alleged assault in the operating room, Keller and three nurses — including the nurse who brought the allegation — met with the hospital’s acting director, Dr. Brett Rusch. At that meeting, Keller told Rusch she did not believe Lenkovsky treated male doctors, nurses, and staff in the “abusive and hostile way he treated the female staff,” according to her whistle-blower complaint.

Later that month, Keller told VA police she was “not surprised” when she heard of the assault allegation, which she described in a witness statement as “consistent with Dr. Lenkovsky’s behavior in the past.”

Christine Murphy, the hospital’s chief nurse anesthetist and the person who leveled the allegation, told Rusch that Lenkovsky intentionally struck her arm during a difficult operation, a blow she said was hard enough to bruise her forearm.

“I had a bruise the size of a quarter on my right arm after the event, which my colleagues observed,” she wrote in a subsequent statement to VA police. At least eight witnesses were present, Murphy has said.

Following the meeting with Rusch, Lenkovsky was suspended pending a five-week internal investigation and returned to work with full clinical privileges Aug. 20. He retired in December and could not be reached by the Globe for comment.

The alleged assault occurred amid mounting frustration in the operating room after Lenkovsky and a surgeon made repeated, unsuccessful attempts to insert a breathing tube into a patient’s trachea, Murphy told VA police.

In a recent statement to the Globe, VA officials dismissed the allegation as “blatantly dishonest” and “disrespectful to actual assault victims, which Murphy is clearly not.”

They said that the contact was accidental and that Lenkovsky reflexively pushed away an oxygen bag that Murphy had allowed to obstruct his vision. VA officials described Murphy’s action as a “direct violation of protocol” by her at a pivotal and potentially life-threatening moment.

“In doing so, Lenkovsky inadvertently made contact with Ms. Murphy’s hand rather than the bag,” they said.

“This has shaken me to my soul,’’ Jennifer Keller, an anesthetist, said of her firing. (The Boston Globe)

Phillipa Lilienthal, an attorney who represents Murphy and Keller, said that the veteran nurse vehemently denies she breached protocol and that the hospital’s assertion to the Globe — nearly a full year after the incident — was the first time Murphy had heard that the VA faulted her actions during the surgery.

Murphy did not face any discipline for her alleged mistake and even was rewarded recently with a $400 performance bonus, Lilienthal said.

In addition, the attorney said, the VA’s “claim that she was not an assault victim is appalling and further victimizes her.”

Murphy told the Globe that she was initially afraid to report the assault “because I didn’t know what he [Lenkovsky] would do to me professionally,” but that Keller’s support helped her bring the complaint forward.

At the meeting with Rusch, Murphy said in her whistle-blower complaint, he asked “if there were any patterns to Lenkovsky’s behavior. The group was afraid to respond, so Keller responded.”

Keller told him that Lenkovsky had bullied and yelled at her, nurses, and anesthesia technicians, she said. In her whistle-blower complaint, Keller also said that Lenkovsky once showed her an image of former US senator Al Franken that had been photoshopped to make him appear to be groping a topless, pre-adolescent girl.

At the meeting, Keller said, Rusch assured the group that they would be protected from retaliation.

But on the day Lenkovsky returned to the hospital last August, Rusch suspended Keller’s clinical privileges, citing unspecified concerns that she potentially posed an “imminent threat to patient welfare.”

“I thought, this can’t be happening,” Keller recalled. “I got the letter, and I was trying to figure out what was wrong.”

Keller said she was not told at that time why she was considered a threat. Despite repeated requests, Keller said, she did not learn the specifics until Sept. 20, when the hospital’s acting chief of staff, Dr. Daniel O’Rourke, proposed she be fired, her attorney said.

By that time, two review committees already had met and recommended that Keller be dismissed, Lilienthal said. Keller had no knowledge of those meetings, her lawyer said.

Keller was fired after an internal review concluded she had walked out of a working operating room for brief periods during two surgical procedures on July 30, leaving an unlicensed, fourth-year medical student alone to provide anesthesiology care.

Keller has denied she was absent during the second procedure, but acknowledged that she stepped away during the first operation as a training exercise for the medical student.

“Dr. Keller’s intentional absences in the operating room have unnecessarily placed patients at risk, as well as placed students in a position to care for patients for which they do not have appropriate training, qualifications, or licenses,” O’Rourke wrote in his proposal that she be fired.

In a statement to the Globe, hospital officials said “the consensus opinion was this was a life-or-death situation that demanded an immediate correction.”

By leaving the operating room, the officials said, Keller had committed “an egregious breach of protocol during a surgery that could have led to the death of a patient.”

Hospital officials said their investigation also found that Keller had previously “left other anesthetized patients unattended” — a claim that Keller disputed — and that her dismissal was unrelated to Murphy’s assault allegation.

“The bottom line is that at VA, patient safety comes first in all that we do,” a hospital spokeswoman said. “It’s unfortunate that Murphy and Keller are either unaware of or don’t care about this crucial fact.”

The standards of the American Society of Anesthesiologists state that anesthetists “shall be present in the room throughout the conduct of all general anesthetics, regional anesthetics, and monitored anesthetic care.”

Keller described her absences during the first procedure — four times, for no more than a minute each time, a few yards from the patient — as a training exercise to observe the anesthesiology student from a distance. Once was from the entrance to a supply closet; the others were from behind doors in the surgical suite, she said.

Lilienthal said no problems were reported in the immediate aftermath of the two operations. Keller continued to be assigned to serious procedures, including an aortic bypass graft that is the most complex case the hospital handles, the attorney said.

“If you look at what happened and when, a lot of things don’t add up,” Lilienthal said, adding that Keller had compiled a spotless professional record during 17 years of clinical practice. Keller also is being represented by Andrea Amodeo-Vickery, an attorney who has represented whistle-blowers from the VA hospital in Manchester, N.H.

Levenson, the former VA medical services director for New England, said Keller was fired because she dared to confront more powerful men. On April 28, Rusch was appointed executive director of the hospital, which serves veterans in Vermont and four counties in New Hampshire.

“The saddest part of this whole process is that in an era when women can finally be taken seriously with regard to harassment complaints, the VA is still in the dark ages,” he said. “Instead of ‘#MeToo,’ the VA is ‘Old School.’ ”

Keller continues to teach at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College, but her future as a physician could be in jeopardy. Lilienthal said the VA has reported her dismissal to the National Practitioner Data Bank, a database run by the US Department of Health and Human Services that collects negative information about physicians.

Keller, however, said she is determined to resume her career.

“I look forward to working as an anesthesiologist again,” said Keller, a single mother with two teenage children. “I will have a strong practice again.”

How can $2 million in U.S. EPA Trash-Free grants curb the Great Lakes plastic problem?,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Laura Johnston', 'Ljohnston Cleveland.Com']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cleveland.com/news/2019/07/how-can-2-million-in-us-epa-trash-free-grants-curb-the-great-lakes-plastic-problem.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio – How can $2 million in U.S. EPA grants clean up the plastic-plagued Great Lakes?

Local environmental groups – including Surfrider, Alliance for the Great Lakes and Drink Local. Drink Tap – are interested in applying for grants, announced this month as part of the annual $300 million Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.

But some experts say the money will do little to solve the problem of 22 million pounds of plastic dumped into the Great Lakes each year.

The only real solution is to stop making more plastic, said Sherri A. Mason, sustainability coordinator at Penn State University’s Behrend campus.

“It’s money and I appreciate money being put toward anything,” Mason said. “If you really want to solve this problem, you don’t focus on removing the trash... That’s a Band-aid on a gaping wound when really what we need are stitches.”

The EPA plans to release details in October. A spokeswoman said the cleanup and preventing of all marine and shoreline trash will be eligible for grants up to $500,000 and that plastics will likely be an important component of many applications.

“This first-of-its-kind trash-focused grant program is yet another example of progress being made under the GLRI,” said EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp. “Thanks to this funding, a number of Great Lakes communities can receive a meaningful assist in removing trash and litter from beaches, shorelines and waterways where cleanup projects are sorely needed.”

Erin Huber, director of Drink Local. Drink Tap, hopes the grants reward efforts to “stop creating the trash in the first place.”

Since 2010, Drink Local volunteers have picked up 6,681 pounds of trash from Cleveland beaches.

“Clean ups, though we do them, are a last resort,” Huber said. “I worry that this grant might be a shiny thing to take our attention away from real issues - unsustainable consumption, unsustainable plastic (aka fossil fuel) use.”

How big is the problem?

Lake Erie has 46,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometer, rivaling the dirtiest part of the world’s oceans, Mason said in the 2018 State of the Great Lakes speech at the City Club of Cleveland.

The earth adds about 300 million tons of plastic every year.

Nearly half of it is packaging.

About 10 percent is recycled -- a number that won’t likely increase since plastic is so cheap to manufacture.

About 10 percent ends up in waterways.

Much of it -- including fast-food straws, cigar tips and plastic bottle caps -- comes flushed from city streets throughout the watershed, down storm drains and into the lake, according to a Rochester Institute of Technology study. The trash washes up on shore, making up about 80 percent of the litter on beaches.

Winds and currents usually push the trash to the east and southern shores of each Great Lake.

In 2018, more than 14,300 volunteers worked with the Alliance for the Great Lakes at 900 beach clean ups, over all five Great Lakes, collecting 35,600 pounds of trash. About 87 percent of that trash was plastic.

“We see a litter issue on a lot of beaches,” Alliance spokeswoman Jennifer Caddick said. “It’s going to have to be a bigger solution than just beach clean ups.”

What are people doing already?

Local governments and businesses have taken their own actions.

In May, Cuyahoga County Council voted 8-3 to enact a plastic bag ban, the first in Ohio, in part to keep plastic out of the lake. County Councilwoman Sunny Simon, who pushed for years for the ban, said county residents use 320 million plastic bags each year. The Republican-dominated state legislature, though, may ban the bag ban.

Many Northeast Ohio restaurants have eliminated plastic straws and have switched Styrofoam take-out containers for biodegradable options.

What else could we do?

Grants could pay for all sorts of projects and programs.

Take the invention of Thomas Zung, a distinguished senior fellow at Stanford University, who won Cleveland Water Alliance’s ErieHack competition in June with a geodesic dome that collects trash from storm sewer outflows. A crane then empties and dumps the trash.

Zung and his team of Cleveland college students, won $40,000 for the idea from Erie Hack. He plans to apply for a Trash-Free grant, too.

Tim Hoellein, an assistant professor of biology at Loyola University Chicago, who studies trash in the Great Lakes, plans to apply for a grant to boost his research, which includes analyzing data from Alliance for the Great Lakes clean ups. The number of cigarette butts, one of the top items found on beaches, has dropped over the last 15 years.

“There’s some room for optimism,” Hoellein said. “A suite of public policies can have a positive outcome over the long term.”

Hoellein appreciates the Trump administration’s spotlight on the trash problem. So far, he said, garbage is not a political issue. Everyone, regardless of party, can see it.

(That said, the Trump campaign is selling packs of plastic straws labeled “Make straws great again.” Plastic straws account for about 1 percent of the plastic in the oceans, according to Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions.)

What’s the problem with trash?

Cleaning it up costs cities money. Its ugliness may detour tourism. There are public health concerns with people exposed to diapers, needles or tampons, plus wildlife problems for fish and birds who eat it or get entangled in it.

Hoellein’s team has analyzed 250 fish, 95 percent of which have plastic in their stomach. The plastic may be as small as a microfiber from a fleece jacket that washed off in the laundry. “But it’s almost universally there,” he said.

Lake lovers hope the federal focus on trash will help reverse the trash flow.

Said the Alliance’s Cleveland office outreach coordinator, Destinee Henton: “I applaud the EPA for their commitment to cleaning up our most precious natural resource.”

New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."

DOJ approves T-Mobile-Sprint deal with conditions,https://www.axios.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.axios.com/doj-approves-t-mobile-sprint-deal-with-conditions-5025138d-4f25-4103-82ef-8e6ce0dce21a.html,"The Justice Department and five states reached the settlement with Sprint and T-Mobile, which calls on the companies to:

Sell Sprint's prepaid brands (Boost, Virgin and Sprint Prepaid) to Dish Network.

Make available at least 20,000 cell sites to Dish

Divest some spectrum in the 800MHz range to Dish

Provide Dish with ""robust access"" to the T-Mobile network for at least 7 years while Dish builds out its 5G network

engage in ""good faith"" negotiations about leasing some of Dish's existing 600MHz spectrum

Yes, but: Dish already has been sitting on a bunch of spectrum that it has yet to use and many wireless industry experts doubt its ability to emerge as a serious fourth player in the market.

What they're saying:

Assistant Attorney General Makin Delrahim said that the merger ""would be anti-competitive” if not for the remedies the agency includes in its settlement.

Former FCC official Gigi Sohn: ""The state AGs who sued to block the merger shouldn’t be fooled by this weak attempt to maintain competition in the mobile wireless market.... A new mobile wireless entrant that starts with zero postpaid subscribers and that must rely on its much bigger rival, the new T-Mobile, just to operate is not a competitor. It's a mobile Frankenstein.""

T-Mobile CEO John Legere noted in a statement that the Dish deal won't change ""previously announced target synergies, profitability and long-term cash generation"" projections.

Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen said the deal will help fulfill two decades of work and more than $21 billion in spectrum investments. Dish also notes in a press release that the deal requires it to ""use its spectrum to deploy a nationwide 5G broadband network covering at least 70 percent of the U.S. population by June 14, 2023"" or else ""make voluntary contributions to the U.S. Treasury of up to $2.2 billion.”

What's next: A court will have to approve the deal, and 10 other states have separately sued to block it. Those states have asked the court for more time in the event of a DoJ settlement that changed the terms of the deal, as is now the case."
Textile Waste Has Surged 811% Since the '60s According to the EPA,https://www.highsnobiety.com,"['Isabelle Hore-Thorburn', 'Weekend Staff Writer']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/textile-waste-increase-epa-report/,"According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), textile waste has increased by 811 percent between 1960 and 2015. The majority of this waste is made up of municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW encompasses discarded clothing, as well as small furniture, carpets, tires, and footwear.

The EPA calculated that in 2015, clothing and footwear produced 11.9 million tons of waste and 4.5 percent of total MSW. Decades of data gathering evidence a dramatic increase in textile waste, which grew from 1.76 million tons in 1960 to more than 16 million tons in 2015.

Jackie King, executive director of Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles (SMART), told Supply Chain Dive that the problem has worsened significantly in the last decade. She explained that “a lot of the ‘fast fashion’ clothing is not very well made and might not last through more than a few washes before ending up in the landfill.”

Attorney General William Barr orders first federal executions in nearly two decades,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/william-barr-orders-first-federal-executions-in-nearly-two-decades.html,"The federal government will resume executing death row inmates after nearly two decades without doing so, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.

Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five inmates convicted of murder and other crimes. The executions have been scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020.

The department also announced a new execution protocol, replacing the three-drug cocktail previously used in federal executions with the single drug, pentobarbital.

The last federal execution was carried out in 2003. There are 62 individuals on federal death row, according to a tracker maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Supreme Court outlawed state and federal death penalty laws in the 1972 decision Furman v. Georgia. The ruling invalidated the laws then on the books, but did not outlaw the death penalty under all circumstances, leading states and the federal government to draft new legislation.

The federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, and expanded by Congress in 1994. No federal executions took place, however, until 2001, according to to the Bureau of Prisons website.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Barr said in a statement. ""Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding."""
Treasury pick Monica Crowley spread Obama smears: 'Can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?',https://www.cnn.com,"['Andrew Kaczynski', 'Nathan Mcdermott']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/kfile-monica-crowley/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an ""Islamic community organizer"" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns."" During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010 , Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

""Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,"" wrote Crowley. ""He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.""

""It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?"" she added.

Crowley added, ""How could he....support the enemy?""

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" wrote Crowley.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she added. ""He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.""

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing a bout the Obama administration in June 2013 , Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote. ""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy.""

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

""Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,"" she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. ""The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

""Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,"" she added. ""Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'.""

""The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,"" reads the column.

""Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy ""companions"" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."""
Senators who visited border ask DHS to improve migrant care,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Leigh Ann Caldwell']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/26/senators-who-visited-border-ask-dhs-to-improve-migrant-care/23779134/,"WASHINGTON — After visiting migrant detention centers near the southern border, Senate Democrats are requesting that the Department of Homeland Security make immediate changes to its detention centers, citing ""serious concerns"" with conditions.

In a letter signed by 13 Democrats who visited Customs and Border Patrol processing centers near the border last week, the senators list 18 actions the agency should take immediately that they say would ensure humane treatment of migrant children and result in better oversight of the facilities.

CBP processing centers have been scrutinized as migrants, including children, have been held in sub par conditions far longer than the 72-hour limit with reports of abuse and mistreatment.

The senators are asking acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and acting Commissioner of CBP, Mark Morgan, to respond to their request by Thursday and provide a telephone briefing by Aug. 10 with an update on if the requests are being addressed.

Among the senators' requests: improve the water quality at the McAllen Border Patrol Station; provide schedules to Congress indicating that migrants can make phone calls, eat, take showers and brush their teeth; darken rooms so children can sleep.

The letter notes that the senators want to know if the migrants can report claims of abuse and what type of medical and psychological care the migrants have access to, and if DHW will support additional independent monitoring of facilities.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is the highest ranking member of Congress to visit the border. He and 12 other Democratic senators visited the Border Patrol processing facility in McAllen, as well as processing centers Donna and Ursula, also in Texas.

""The searing accounts about the conditions endured by migrant families are true. We saw overcrowding. We heard migrants tell us that they were unable to brush their teeth, shower, call their families, or access feminine hygiene products,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier this week. ""We saw children in soiled clothing, caged and expressionless — heartbreaking, thousand-mile stares on the faces of toddlers…where smiles and laughter should have been.""

The letter notes that a July inspector general report instructed DHS to ""take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults.""

Aaron Hull, head of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, will be reassigned to Detroit on Monday, according to documents obtained by NBC News.

DOJ’s tech probe needs to be mindful of corporate harassment,https://nypost.com,"['Jonathon Trugman', 'July']",07-28-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/dojs-tech-probe-needs-to-be-mindful-of-corporate-harassment/,"The Department of Justice last week launched a wide-ranging antitrust review to determine if the largest technology companies are, or have been, stifling competition.

The four that are reported to be most focused on — Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google — account for almost a million high-paying jobs with good benefits, and are massive contributors to this year’s strong projected 2.5 percent-plus GDP growth rate.

Facebook, Google, Amazon and Snap all reported earnings last week. Aside from Amazon’s — affected by a big investment in faster delivery — they were pretty impressive. (Apple reports this week.) So people clearly are using these platforms to conduct commerce and communication.

There are always unintended consequences of big government trying to wrestle with an industry. The DOJ needs to be mindful of that, and not return to the Obama days of excess corporate harassment.

While the privacy issues are real and absolutely need to continue to be addressed, the anticompetitive aspect seems to me rather nonsensical.

Silicon Valley’s growth machine is one of the bright lights of the economy, not only in the US, but globally.

So I like the way the FTC handled the Facebook settlement announced on Wednesday. Facebook agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty due to the privacy issues and the use of people’s data, as happened in the Cambridge Analytica fiasco.

Those who say that’s not enough money don’t get it. It’s not about the money, it’s about the behavior. The FTC, by requiring Zuckerberg’s certification that its newly-agreed-to privacy rules are adhered to, found a great way to truly address any issues going forward without inhibiting growth and innovation.

These companies don’t stifle competition; they finance and foster it!

Let’s not give China or any other advanced economies a technological advantage by hampering our own geniuses and shooting ourselves in the foot."
Haaland pushes EPA for a national recycling strategy,https://www.abqjournal.com,"['Scott Turner', 'Journal Staff Writer']",,,,https://www.abqjournal.com/1346154/haaland-pushes-epa-for-a-national-recycling-strategy.html,".......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........

U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland is among several lawmakers on Capitol Hill requesting the Environmental Protection Agency develop a national recycling strategy in response to a change in policy in China that has sharply reduced the import of foreign scrap materials, which they said has created a crisis for local recycling programs.

The New Mexico Democrat and other members of Congress sent EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler a letter earlier this month asking if the agency is developing a strategy to address the needs of municipalities where recycled items have been piling up that were once shipped overseas.

ADVERTISEMENTSkip

................................................................

“This change in policy, and after three decades of reliance on China to accept American domestic recyclables, has created a crisis for states and municipalities across the country,” the letter said.

The lawmakers told Wheeler the U.S. lacked the infrastructure to meet current needs.

“Our reliance on China and the lack of local investment has resulted in the rapid decline of recycling programs across the country, with recyclable waste piling up in U.S. landfills, or worse yet, being incinerated and releasing harmful chemicals into the environment,” they said.

China’s decision to reduce the amount of recycled items it took in has caused the cost of running recycling programs in Albuquerque and Santa Fe to rise, according to a Journal story earlier this year. Both cities saw a rise in programs costing a few hundred thousands of dollars a year to $1 million or more in the past couple of years.

“Albuquerque is taking the lead and implementing recycling programs and finding effective workarounds for this challenge, but recycling programs across the country are struggling,” Haaland told the Journal. “If we’re going to get serious about empowering our communities to reduce waste – we need to invest in local recycling infrastructure.”

The lawmakers’ letter to Wheeler said the change in China’s policy presented the U.S. with an opportunity to be a leader in the recycling industry “and stop the wasteful practice of throwing valuable materials away.”

The letter said the EPA reported in 2015 over $9 billion worth of recyclable materials were thrown away each year, and that was before China changed its policy.

It suggested that the EPA was best equipped to assist in developing a national strategy.

“We need a comprehensive solution that focuses on targeted investments in local recycling programs to enhance recycling infrastructures and promotes new technologies for sorting, reusing and converting waste into valuable goods,” the lawmakers said."
DOJ won't prosecute contempt citation against Barr and Ross,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/politics/doj-contempt-wont-prosecute-barr-ross/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Justice won't prosecute the attorney general or Commerce secretary after the House voted earlier this month to hold them in criminal contempt, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said Wednesday.

In a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Rosen described the department's ""long-standing position"" to not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress ""for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege.""

Pelosi tweeted Tuesday that she had signed the contempt citations for Attorney General Bill Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, which were approved mainly along party lines in the House. The citations followed resistance from the Justice and Commerce departments to provide a full range of documents requested by the House Oversight Committee as part of its investigation into the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.

The move to not prosecute the twin contempt citations was widely expected, and followed a similar move by the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, which declined to pursue contempt charges referred by Congress against then-Attorney General Eric Holder.

Both agencies have maintained that they have already provided thousands of documents to the committee about the census question, and that certain documents which had been withheld were done so in line with a federal court ruling that said that many of the same documents were privileged from disclosure in civil litigation.

“Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding.

Several states currently have a moratorium on the death penalty or have suspended the practice due to recent past wrongful convictions brought to light by groups such as the Innocence Project, which have secured the release of a number of death-row inmates in recent years. The total number of executions has declined over the last decade, in part, due to concerns that capital punishment disproportionately affects African Americans.

US Department of Justice Accuses Crypto Exec of $7 Million Fraud Scheme,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Masao Akimoto']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-department-of-justice-accuses-crypto-exec-of-7-million-fraud-scheme,"Federal authorities in the state of New York have unsealed fraud charges against the principal of a purported cryptocurrency escrow company Volantis in the amount of over $7 million.

According to an announcement by the Department of Justice (DoJ), the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) unsealed a filing with the allegations on July 25. The defendant, Volantis principal Jon Barry Thompson, was also arrested on the same day.

Thompson allegedly made false representations about Volantis’ purported Bitcoin transaction service in order to fraudulently secure over $7 million from two different companies. In the filing, the complainants say that Thompson offered a service for low-risk crypto settlements by acting as a mutual custodian for two transacting parties.

Defendant allegedly used firm as a front for theft

However, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman claims that Thompson used this service as a front to steal the “custodied” money:

“Jon Thompson induced investors to engage in cryptocurrency transactions through his company, Volantis Market Making, by touting a transaction structure that would eliminate any risk of loss during the purchase. As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

The FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge, William F. Sweeney Jr., further specified that he believes Thompson used confusing jargon to exploit companies less familiar with the crypto space:

“Using phrases and terminology that the victim companies didn't understand, he allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency. Our job at the FBI is to investigate fraud and follow the money wherever it leads.”

The filing itself was signed on July 18, and contains the specifics of the fraud charges. According to the filing, the defendant is being charged with two counts of commodities fraud as well as two counts of wire fraud.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the DoJ indicted an individual on July 24 for failing to register himself or his company with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. The defendant, William Green, allegedly ran a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service on “Destination Bitcoin” out of New Jersey without registering as a money transmission business."

Et July']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/environment/2019/07/29/epa-targets-bergen-passaic-counties-massive-passaic-river-cleanup-dioxin-occidental-ypf/1836670001/,"CLOSE EPA officials Michael Sivak, left, and Pete Lopez, right, discuss cleanup plans for the upper nine miles of the contaminated Passaic River. North Jersey Record

Pockets of highly contaminated Passaic River sediment in Bergen and Passaic counties would be partially excavated and capped with a barrier under plans being considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, officials said.

Cleaning up 9 miles of the Passaic — from North Arlington to the Dundee Dam in Clifton and Garfield — would not be as massive as the still-pending $1.4 billion plan to partially dredge the river's lower 8 miles from bank to bank in Newark and Hudson County.

Instead, contractors are targeting hot spots contaminated with cancer-causing dioxin, PCBs and other industrial pollution that have made the Passaic one of the most polluted waterways in the U.S.

But the EPA's proposal to leave a portion of the pollution under a barrier — a strategy that it has often been used at other contaminated sites — has drawn criticism for both portions of the Passaic cleanup.

""These hot spots need to be totally dredged,"" said David Yennior, a longtime member of a community group that advises the EPA on the Passaic cleanup. ""EPA seems to have an unwritten policy to cap everything and not do a total cleanup.""

Pollution is so bad in the Passaic River that officials say no one should eat fish caught from the waterway. But that does not deter some anglers. To the right is the Dundee Dam, a barrier that prevented harmful dioxin from moving upriver. (Photo: Staff photo/ Kevin R. Wexler.)

Other members of the community group, along with EPA officials and some elected officials, have praised the plan. It is one of the largest, most expensive cleanups in the 40-year history of the federal Superfund program.

The pollution dates to the 1960s, when workers at the former Diamond Alkali plant in Newark routinely dumped dioxin — a byproduct of Agent Orange, the infamous Vietnam-era herbicide — into the adjacent Passaic River.

After decades marked by studies, pushback by polluters and smaller cleanups, the EPA announced a $1.4 billion plan in 2016 to remove 3.5 million cubic yards of polluted sediment from the Passaic's lower 8 miles.

The portion above it will see a cleanup plan targeting hot spots of dioxin along nine miles from North Arlington to the Dundee Dam spanning Clifton and Garfield. (Photo: EPA)

Legal agreements with the polluters are still needed. But EPA Region 2 Administrator Pete Lopez and his staff are targeting 2021 as the start of cleanup work in the lower 8 miles, a project that would last seven years.

In the meantime, Lopez wants to start planning cleanup options for the next 9 miles of the river in Bergen and Passaic counties. The idea is to have work done concurrently with the lower 8-mile project to minimize disruptions such as the opening of bridges, barge traffic and use of heavy machinery like excavators.

“Capping is going to make our children and grandchildren pay for another cleanup.” David Yennior, community advocate

""Our goal is to have the upper section catch up to the lower section so you're doing the work simultaneously,"" Lopez said.

The investigation of the Bergen and Passaic portion of the river was completed in late June, and a report outlining the cleanup options is expected to be made public in October.

Towns along the upper portion include Garfield, Wallington, East Rutherford, Rutherford, Lyndhurst and North Arlington on the Bergen County side of the river, Clifton and the city of Passaic in Passaic County, and Nutley and Belleville in Essex County.

EPA officials are already leaning toward an option to clean up only targeted spots for several reasons. Among them:

The dioxin contamination isn't as extensive as it is in the lower 8 miles, where the Diamond Alkali plant sits.

The river sediment in the upper portion is more coarse and grain-like, so dioxin doesn't cling as stubbornly as it does to the lower portion's fine silt.

But unlike the lower portion of the Passaic, the next nine 9 miles is used extensively for recreation. That means more people have a greater chance to come into direct contact with dioxin, including high school and college crew teams using that part of the river for training and competition.

The EPA already oversaw a smaller dredge-and-cap project in 2013 in the upper 9-mile portion in exposed mudflats near where rowers race. That project saw the first 2 feet of dioxin-laden mud next to Riverside County Park in Lyndhurst excavated, and then the riverbed was lined with layers of rocks, sand and a synthetic covering.

Michael Sivak, chief of the EPA's Passaic River team, said the dioxin levels found elsewhere in the upper 9 miles are not as high as those in the Lyndhurst mudflats. But he said the proposed work would be similar.

Dredging and capping ""is something that is a very common way to deal with this kind of contamination,"" Sivak said.

Many environmentalists, however, have sarcastically dubbed the practice ""pave and wave"" as a means for polluters to get a cheaper cleanup that leaves the public more at risk.

The EPA has approved such controversial plans across North Jersey in recent years, leaving at least a portion of pollution in place at Superfund sites from densely populated Edgewater to the forests of Ringwood.

ENVIRONMENT: NJ budget: Meadowlands Conservation Trust gets $1.5 million

At the meeting in Clifton, Yennior stood and told the 40 people gathered in a building near City Hall that all of the polluted sediment should be dredged from the Passaic because a cap will eventually erode in a tidal river, where water constantly sloshes back and forth.

""Capping is going to make our children and grandchildren pay for another cleanup,"" said Yennior, a Belleville resident who lives a quarter-mile from the river.

Work on the 9 miles of the river in Bergen and Passaic counties would not begin until the second half of 2024, although EPA timelines are often delayed.

Meanwhile, the river's No. 1 threat to human health remains eating fish caught south of the Dundee Dam. Assemblywoman Britnee Timberlake, D-East Orange, said at the meeting that the EPA should consider bolstering its efforts to spread the word to anglers, many of whom are recent arrivals to the U.S. and may not know the dangers.

""We have to get the word out to people,"" Timberlake said. ""I know there are still people who fish this river.""

John Ratcliffe: Mueller could not testify about Obama-Russia question because DOJ is investigating,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/john-ratcliffe-mueller-could-not-testify-about-obama-russia-question-because-doj-is-investigating,"A leading Republican investigator surmised that Robert Mueller was restrained from speaking about whether the Obama administration was influenced by the Russians because of an ongoing Justice Department investigation.

After the former special counsel testified about his Russia investigation Wednesday, Rep. John Ratcliffe told Fox News' Bret Baier that British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier was off-limits because U.S. Attorney John Durham and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz are looking into how it was used by federal agents.

""What we don’t know, what he didn’t answer today was whether or not that’s sweeping and systematic effort influenced the Obama administration,"" the Texas congressman said. ""Did they use a false dossier to surveil an American citizen and thereby influence the election? That was something that Bob Mueller wasn’t willing to address today and I think John Durham and the folks at the Justice Department will be looking into that.""

Baier asked Ratcliffe what his expectation for a timeline regarding Horowitz's investigation on alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and FBI and Durham's inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation. The congressman, who is on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees and has spoken to Horowitz, said progress is being made.

""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day. I think John Durham just got started, but I think there’s a lot to look at there. I think there’s a lot that you saw the special counsel wouldn’t answer today because it was in the purview and under the investigation of John Durham as the new special counsel,"" he said.

Labor Day is Sept. 2 this year.

Durham was tasked by Attorney General William Barr, who said he is working closely with Horowitz, to lead a review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Trump also gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information” in the Justice Department inquiry.

In his opening statements to the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on Wednesday, Mueller said he would not speak about the Steele dossier in his testimony, nor about the FBI's opening of the Russia investigation that preceded his appointment, citing his consultation with the Justice Department about restrictions. At one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz grilled Mueller about Steele's dossier, which contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He also asked about Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele, but the former FBI director dodged by repeatedly asserting it was beyond his purview.

The FBI says the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began July 2016 after Australian diplomat Alexander Downer told the U.S. that Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos claimed the Russians had some sort of incriminating evidence against Hillary Clinton, Trump's 2016 presidential rival. This effort was later wrapped into Mueller's investigation.

In spite of this, Trump and congressional Republicans have cited the dossier as evidence that the genesis of the FBI's original investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election was possibly based on the compromising material from Steele. They have also raised concerned about how the FBI relied on the dossier to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to gather information on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page between October 2016 and June 2017. The dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign was not revealed to the FISA Court.

Mueller, who was appointed to take over the investigation after the president fired ex-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, testified that he was not involved in the approval chain for the final FISA renewal."

Derek Mize and Jonathan Gregg, who married in New York in 2015, had their daughter Simone Mize-Gregg via surrogacy in England in 2018, their lawyer said in a statement. Both fathers are listed on the birth certificate.

When they applied for Simone's US citizenship, the US consulate in London rejected their application, the release said. ""The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that children of married U.S. citizens born abroad are U.S. citizens from birth so long as one of their parents has lived in the U.S. at some point, but the State Department routinely denies that right to same-sex couples and their children,"" the statement says.

Michael Drobot, who operated Pacific Hospital Long Beach, has agreed to plead guilty to charges of wire fraud, engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from unlawful activity and criminal contempt of court.

Drobot, 74, formerly of Corona del Mar, is serving a five-year sentence at Taft Correctional Institution in Kern County. He faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in federal prison on the new charges, and will be arraigned in coming weeks in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, according to the Department of Justice.

Drobot’s attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Drobot, 74, pleaded guilty in 2014 to orchestrating a scheme authorities dubbed Operation Spinal Cap, which paid more than $50 million in bribes to doctors and other health professionals in exchange for steering spinal surgeries and other procedures to his hospital. Former state Sen. Ron Calderon also was convicted of taking bribes from Drobot.

As part of his plea, Drobot was ordered by the court to forfeit $10 million to the United States government. So the Aston Martin on the auction block in August 2018 — along with his 1958 Porsche and his 1971 Mercedes-Benz — was a penance of sorts, helping to fulfill that obligation and provide restitution to victims.

The Aston alone was valued by RM Sotheby’s auctioneers at $1.2 million to $1.4 million, and ultimately sold for $1.5 million.

But rather than forwarding sale proceeds to the government, as promised, Drobot disobeyed the court order and illegally kept the proceeds for himself, the U.S. Department of Justice said in court filings this week. (Drobot No. 1, Drobot No. 2).

Drobot conveyed an interest in the Aston Martin to the classic car auction company in exchange for a $1 million advance on the sale proceeds on June 22, 2018, the DOJ said. That $1 million was wired to Drobot’s bank account and used “for personal expenses and not to satisfy the court’s forfeiture order. Drobot further admitted to laundering the money via transfers to third parties,” the DOJ said.

In February, the DOJ seized Drobot’s interest in his Newport Beach home and Perris business property to help satisfy the order, said spokesman Ciaran McEvoy.

Prosecutors have charged 17 people, and won 10 convictions, as part of Operation Spinal Cap, the $1 billion health care fraud scheme Drobot spearheaded. The accused hail from Manhattan Beach, Newport Beach, Redondo Beach, Palos Verdes Estates, Santa Ana, San Clemente and many other cities.

Patients wait

Thousands of patients received surgeries at Pacific Hospital not knowing that Drobot had bribed their physician to perform their surgery at Pacific Hospital, prosecutors said in court documents.

“The patients believed that they were receiving conflict-free medical advice when, in fact, (Drobot) illegally incentivized their physician to perform the surgery at Pacific Hospital,” they wrote.

Waiting not so patiently in the wings now, as the government’s mammoth probe proceeds, are those patients, who seek redress.

In an avalanche of lawsuits, more than 160 patients contend that cheap, nonsurgical-grade hardware may have been drilled into their bones during operations that might not have been necessary to begin with, leaving them in excruciating pain.

Their suits, in civil court, target doctors and hospitals allegedly involved in the scheme — but those suits are in a deep freeze so as not to interfere with the DOJ’s criminal probe.

Doctors and hospitals targeted by those lawsuits — who have not been charged in the federal criminal probe — deny wrongdoing, including knowingly using inferior product in surgeries. Drobot has said his companies never bought or used any knock-off screws or parts for spinal surgeries.

How much of that $10 million might patients see?

Drobot’s forfeited money goes into a government forfeiture fund, and there’s a process called remission where victims can request their share, said DOJ spokesman McEvoy.

“It would be fair and just — and seems to me the only right answer — for the bulk of whatever’s recovered from Drobot and his co-defendants to go to the actual patients who are suffering,” said attorney Justin Berger, who represents whistleblowers in the case.

Attorneys have asked the court to allow some of the patients’ civil lawsuits to move forward, and that will be considered on Tuesday, July 30.

“We’re hopeful that — given the passage of time, that patients continue to live in pain and that patients continue to die — some or all of these suits will be set for trial soon,” Berger said. “There are doctors still walking around as free men without any indictments — I hope this means there will be continued cooperation and the government will go after all the wrongdoers.”"

Interior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump,https://thehill.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/454805-interior-whistleblowers-say-agency-has-sidelined-scientists-under,"Former Interior Department employees who say they experienced retaliation at the agency for their work on scientific endeavors appeared before lawmakers Thursday, sparking political wrangling over the role of scientists in the Trump administration.

Republicans used the appearances to accuse Democrats of political theater, while Democrats in turn stepped up calls for scientists to be protected.

Among those testifying were Joel Clement, a whistleblower who said he was removed from his work on climate change and reassigned to an accounting role.

Also testifying was Maria Caffrey, who said she had to fight with the Interior Department to keep references to the human contributions to climate change in a report on how sea level rise would impact national parks.

Clement said under the Trump administration, the Interior Department “has sidelined scientists and experts, flattened the morale of the career staff, and by all accounts, is bent on hollowing out the Agency.”

Clement, now a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University, said he was removed from his work with 30 Alaska Native communities that were “one big storm away from being wiped right off the map” and needed to be immediately relocated.

Caffrey, whose research was funded by the Interior Department, said she found herself repeatedly demoted at the agency after pushing to keep references to the human impacts of climate change in her report.

“It removes the meaning from my study. I prepared four different climate scenarios for those three different time periods, so those scenarios hang on how much greenhouse gases we produce in the future,” she said, including how much humans contribute to the atmosphere.

“I had become at outcast for standing up,” she added, noting the department told her they didn’t want her help even on a volunteer basis. She is now looking for work in the Denver area.

The hearing was to discuss the Scientific Integrity Act, a bill sponsored by Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Democrats seek help in appealing to conservatives on climate | Whistleblowers say Interior sidelined scientists | Automakers strike fuel efficiency deal with California in rebuff to Trump Interior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump Automakers rebuff Trump, strike fuel efficiency deal with California MORE (D-N.Y.) that would add protections for government scientists, including allowing them to publish research outside of government channels and establish a Scientific Integrity Officer.

Several Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee complained the hearing was political theater centered around a bill that would have to pass out of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.

They said there were more complaints about misuse of science under the Obama administration.

“In listening to some of our panelists today you would think that the Trump administration was the only one where there have been issues regarding scientific integrity, and that certainly is not the case,” said Rep. Jody Hice Jody Brownlow HiceInterior whistleblowers say agency has sidelined scientists under Trump Conservatives call on Pelosi to cancel August recess The 27 Republicans who voted with Democrats to block Trump from taking military action against Iran MORE (R-Ga.).

Tonko said such instances should only strengthen their interest in joining their bill.

“If you believe in science and scientific integrity we should have learned from that past and not look for a reason not to do this,” he said.

Meanwhile, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, said that ""it’s no secret that the Trump administration is not a fan of science.”

“There are the stories that career scientists at Interior are too afraid to share. And with good reason. They have seen their colleagues, like our witnesses, get threatened, harassed, reassigned, and retaliated against,” he added.

Scientists have been vocal about what they view as mistreatment under the Trump administration.

They have cited examples, ranging from limiting government-funded scientists from sitting on an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) board to a proposal to limit what kind of studies can be considered by the EPA, to recent plans to relocate U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers and Bureau of Land Management policymakers.

“To purge the language of climate change from the agency entirely is a direct assault on the science we know is very prominent and very clear on the risk to the mission of the agency that we act now to protect real people in harm’s way,” Clement said.

Interior was invited to attend the hearing but did not send a representative.

""The Department of the Interior diligently works to accommodate Congressional invitations to testify,"" spokeswoman Molly Block said in a statement to The Hill, saying it had participated in 59 of 62 Congressional legislative and oversight hearings that the Department has been invited to, or 95 percent, and provided over 65 witnesses for Committees."""

The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the indictment in a press release on July 24.

According to the DoJ, the indictment filings and court statements indicate that Green operated a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service through the website Destination Bitcoin. As such, Green reportedly would receive money from his customers in order to convert their cash to BTC. The findings further indicated that Green had not registered with the Secretary of the United States Treasury in any capacity.

As noted in the announcement, a person is required by federal law to register any money transmitting businesses with the Secretary of the Treasury.

Potential sentencing

Regarding monetary quantities and compensation, the report says that Green converted over $2 million in fiat money to BTC. Moreover, the maximum penalty for Green’s alleged crime is 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

According to the DoJ, Green was charged over the same issue in a criminal complaint filed on February 28.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the State of New Jersey filed a complaint last week about purportedly unregistered securities sales within its borders. The State accused blockchain-based online marketplace Pocketinns of selling over $400,000 in securities to investors, without registering with the state’s associated bureau."

Zebley will be there to advise Mueller, but the special counsel will be the only one answering the committee questions, the source said. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee only plan to swear in Mueller as a witness. However, Zebley will be sworn in to testify in front of the House Intelligence Committee, a committee aide told CNN.

Mueller made the last-minute request to have his deputy sworn in for Wednesday's blockbuster hearings before the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on the Mueller report, in case he needed to help with any questions the special counsel could not fully answer himself, according to a source familiar with the matter.

""Aaron Zebley was the Deputy Special Counsel and had day-to-day oversight of the investigations conducted by the Office. He will accompany Special Counsel Mueller to the Wednesday hearings, as was discussed with the committees more than a week ago,"" said Mueller spokesman Jim Popkin.

Republicans on the House Judiciary committee immediately raised concerns that Democrats were making a major, last-minute change to the hearing to have Zebley to testify alongside the special counsel, less 24 hours before the hearings are scheduled to begin.

Trump’s DOJ Brings Back Capital Punishment,http://nymag.com,['Adam K. Raymond'],07-25-2019,2019,7,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/trumps-doj-brings-back-capital-punishment.html,"The execution chamber in the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images

After nearly two decades without an execution, the federal government will put five people to death in December and January, the Justice Department announced on Thursday.

The DOJ also announced a change to the execution process. The traditional three-drug cocktail used for lethal injections with be replaced with the single drug pentobarbital. A handful of states have made a similar move after sodium thiopental, one of the three drugs used in the cocktail, became difficult to obtain after foreign manufacturers refused to sell it for use in executions.

In a statement, Attorney General William Barr said, “We owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

The DOJ announcement marks an end to an unofficial moratorium on federal executions. The death penalty is legal in 29 states, which execute around two dozen people each year. But the federal government hasn’t executed anyone since 2003 and has only put three people to death since 1976. The five inmates whose executions have been scheduled for December and January have “exhausted their appellate and post-conviction remedies,” according to the Justice Department. All have been “convicted of murdering, and in some cases torturing and raping, the most vulnerable in our society — children and the elderly.”

While it’s been nearly two decades since a federal inmate was executed, people were still sentenced to death during that time. In the past decade, death sentences were handed down to high-profile inmates such as Dylann Roof and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

But the number of federal death-penalty cases has increased under President Trump, a vocal fan of capital punishment. In 1989, he placed an ad in four New York City newspapers calling for the execution of the Central Park Five, who were later exonerated.

In 1989, Trump bought this ad to inflame public sentiment against teens known as the Central Park Five, who were later exonerated by DNA evidence.

DOJ vows to step up fight against Hezbollah amid Iran tensions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-vows-to-step-up-fight-against-hezbollah-amid-iran-tensions,"A top Justice Department official made it clear Thursday that combating Hezbollah is a top priority for the department, a move that puts pressure on the terrorist organization's sponsor, Iran.

Principal Deputy Attorney General John Cronan, who leads the department's team that investigates Hezbollah financing and narcoterrorism, laid out the government’s efforts and plans for dismantling and neutralizing the Iranian-backed terrorist group during a conference commemorating the victims of the Hezbollah bombing of a Jewish cultural center in Argentina 25 years ago.

The deadly bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina Jewish cultural center on July 18, 1994 killed 85 people and injured hundreds more, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentina’s history. Argentina designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist group to coincide with last week's anniversary, something that the State Department did back in 1997.

""Destroying Hezbollah’s support networks and neutralizing the Hezbollah threat is a top priority for this Department of Justice and will continue to be,” Cronan said, though full details of the operations can't be shared.

“Investigations may be covert, charges may be sealed, defendants may be cooperating, and Hezbollah supporters may be facing non-terrorism crimes as we work to build terrorism charges,” he said.

The department is both combating Hezbollah’s terrorist acts and drying up its funding.

Hezbollah is Iran’s top paramilitary force and is among the crown jewels of its foreign influence efforts, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from the Iranian regime. Hezbollah, though based in Lebanon, operates across the Middle East and has made inroads around the world as well on behalf of its Iranian benefactors.

Cronan's comments from the come amid rising tensions with Iran and as the United States increases pressure on the ayatollahs. Iran seized and blew up allied ships and tankers in the Straits of Hormuz off the coast of Iran and shot down a U.S. drone over international waters in recent weeks.

The U.S., which pulled out of the controversial Iran nuclear deal in 2018, has been ratcheting up pressure on Iran ever since through increased sanctions and through designating Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group earlier this year, and it brought down Iranian drones in recent days too.

And as the U.S. has tried to limit Iran’s global operations and has called for Iran to cease its funding of terrorist groups, the department made it clear that it will be playing a major role in neutralizing Iran’s Hezbollah proxies.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions created Cronan's team in early 2018 as a coordinated and aggressive response to the “ongoing, sophisticated, and global threat posed by Hezbollah to the United States.” Department prosecutors and investigators will pursuing both non-terrorism and terrorism charges whenever possible, working with a host of federal agencies, and seeking help from foreign allies as well, as they pursue people who provide help to Hezbollah, whether through financial support or the provision of manpower or weaponry, for example.

Samer El Debek and Ali Khourani, for example, were arrested in June 2017 on charges of providing material support to Hezbollah, for which Khourani was found guilty earlier this year. The two were trained by the terrorist organization and then released into the U.S. as sleeper operatives waiting for assignments. Kourani, a years-long Hezbollah operative, trained for possible attacks and conducted surveillance of locations in New York City, such as an FBI federal office building and an Army National Guard facility.

Cronan said that cutting off Hezbollah’s financial support is key, because “money is the lifeblood of any terrorist organization.” He pointed to the recent conviction of multi-billion commodities tycoon Kassim Tajideen, who was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for financing Hezbollah and who pleaded guilty in December to a money laundering scheme in evasion of U.S. sanctions on Iran, agreeing to forfeit $50 million to the U.S. government.

Treasury Department, he said, has wide efforts to dismantle Hezbollah's financial networks, including sanctioning more than 50 Hezbollah-related people and entities since 2017. Among those dozens of now-sanctioned Hezbollah financiers were top Hezbollah figures with deep ties to Iran.

Cronan said the U.S. is working with its international allies to root out Hezbollah operatives and funders elsewhere in the world, an effort he put to the conference audience.

“How can we work even better with our partners across the globe? How can we strengthen the capabilities of those partners? How can we most powerfully combat the Hezbollah threat that we all face?”"
Ethics Probes Launched at Department of the Interior and EPA,https://undark.org,"['Jane Roberts', 'Frankie Schembri', 'Maiden Minnesota', 'Colin Macgillivray']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://undark.org/2019/07/26/ethics-probe-interior-department-epa-july-2019/,"Acting Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt visits oil rig manufacturer Watson Hopper Inc. in Hobbs, New Mexico. Visual: Tami A. Heilemann/U.S. Department of the Interior

Two new ethics probes were opened this week — one at the U.S. Department of the Interior and one at the Environmental Protection Agency — following contentions that the two agencies most influential in setting the country’s environmental agenda may be working to limit public access to policy documents, and that a member of EPA leadership may have acted in the interest of private sector lobbyists.

The Interior Department probe, carried out by the agency’s internal audit unit, seeks to determine if a new policy mandating that staff reviewing requests for documents via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) notify politically appointed officials if they are mentioned in documents slated for release is indeed in violation of the public’s legal right to request government records and merits a formal investigation. A separate bill, aimed at challenging similar FOIA policies at the EPA, was announced in the Senate on the same day with bipartisan support.

The FOIA policy changes come on the heels of the ousting of both agency heads — EPA chief Scott Pruitt in July of last year and the Interior’s Ryan Zinke this January — after records released to the public revealed misconduct on the part of both leaders. Watchdog groups contend that the new FOIA policies are an attempt to shield officials from such scrutiny by allowing them to delay or deny the release of internal documents.

Communicating with New York Times reporters, representatives for both agencies denied this motivation for the policy changes. In an email to The Times, EPA Press Secretary Michael Abboud wrote: “Allegations made that the rule is changing the political appointees role in FOIA are false and irresponsible.”

In the EPA probe, announced on Monday, the agency’s inspector general is looking into the actions of former air quality chief William L. Wehrum, a key legal architect of the Trump administration’s policies easing federal limits on air, water, and coal ash pollution. It’s the third investigation to examine whether Wehrum violated federal rules during his time in office through interactions with his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, and one of the firm’s clients, the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a now-defunct coal plant lobbying coalition.

In a report sent Sunday to the EPA inspector general and obtained by The Washington Post, Democratic Senators Tom Carper and Sheldon Whitehouse documented allegedly undisclosed meetings between Wehrum and private sector clients. The pair urged EPA officials not to “abandon or decline to pursue work on this matter in the wake of Mr. Wehrum’s departure from the agency.”

• An unprecedented and lethal heatwave swept across Europe this week, breaking records in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom. As of Friday morning, French authorities reported at least five deaths linked to the rising temperatures. There, temperatures topped 108 degrees Fahrenheit; in Germany, 106.7 degrees; Belgium 105 degrees; and in the Netherlands, 104 degrees. The temperature spike is the second major heatwave to hit the continent this summer and scientists warn that this particular weather system will be moving north, where it is expected to further break records in countries from Norway to Finland on its way into the Arctic region. Scientists have also noted that Arctic sea ice is already at record lows for this time of year and that the super-charged temperatures are likely to accelerate that loss. And climate scientists have noted that with this heat wave, July is on track to be hottest month on record around the world. (The New York Times)

• The Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft successfully launched from the edge of the Bay of Bengal on Monday, marking the start of the Indian Space Research Organization’s ambitious second mission to the moon. Chandrayaan-2 is composed of a lander, a rover, and a lunar orbiter, and will be the country’s first attempt to make a “soft” landing on the surface of the Moon (a controlled descent in which the craft lands without sustaining damages). If all goes to plan, the lunar lander — named Vikram — will touch down in early September, and India will join Russia, the U.S., and China as countries to have complete a soft landing on the moon’s surface. The majority of Chandrayaan-2’s scientific instruments were designed in India, and include: X-ray, infrared, and mass spectrometers; stereoscopic and high-resolution cameras; and radar. NASA designed one instrument for the lander: an array of mirrors to reflect laser beams from Earth, used to help to calculate the distance to the Moon. Vikram’s planned landing site is the Moon’s south pole, a previously uncharted region, where it will study soil samples, rocks, and minerals. (Nature)

• Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. announced a new, longer-lasting drug for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention at the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City this week. Currently, the main preventative strategy for uninfected individuals with a high risk of contracting the virus is to consume a daily pill — a strategy known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, adherence to an oral HIV PrEP regimen can be challenging for some and the pill’s effectiveness is diminished with intermittent use. At the conference, Merck unveiled a slow-release implant of an experimental antiretroviral (ARV) drug, that the company’s tests suggest could safely provide protection against HIV far longer than any ARV currently on the market. The implant is placed under the skin and slowly delivers the drug in a mechanism similar to some implantable contraceptive devices. Merck’s study included only 12 participants, but the researchers reported that there were no safety issues, and the results showed that individuals receiving a high enough dose could be protected against HIV infection for 12 to 16 months.

• The fungus Candida auris, already a deadly and resilient pathogen, may be growing better suited to infecting human bodies, according to a study published this week in the journal mBio. When researchers examined close relatives of C. auris, they found most similar fungi are incapable of tolerating the human body’s typical internal temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This led them to suspect that C. auris had somehow adapted to thriving in hotter environments, perhaps thanks to temperatures climbing worldwide as a result of a changing climate, though they could not definitively rule out other factors contributing to C. auris’ unusual resilience. While cases of infection are still rare, C. auris is a worrisome threat as it is difficult to detect, crops up among already ill patients in hospitals, and strains of the fungus have proven resistant to one or more classes of the most common antifungal medications.

• As synthetic opioid overdoses continue to rise in the U.S., West Africa is facing its own crisis due to the abuse of tramadol — a widely available painkiller known at high doses to produce a euphoric effect similar to that of heroin. Reportedly taken by refugees in Nigeria to help cope with post-traumatic stress, along with wage workers, and even schoolchildren looking to gain an edge, many tramadol pills are illicitly manufactured in India and China, making it impossible for users to know what they really contain. According to the United Nations (U.N.), seizures of the drug have increased in recent years. Last year, Nigeria alone seized 6.4 billion pills. In nearby Togo, in contrast, smaller raids have led vendors to become even more secretive. Despite its risks, the U.N. in March declined to make tramadol an internationally controlled substance, saying it could make it more difficult to obtain for those who truly need it. (Mosaic)

• And finally: On Tuesday, a diminutive satellite — or CubeSat — operated by the Planetary Society, a nonprofit, unfurled four large mylar sails in an attempt to demonstrate solar sailing as a viable means of space travel. Over the next month, the toaster-sized satellite, named LightSail 2, will harness the momentum of light from the Sun to propel itself into increasingly higher orbits before eventually falling back to Earth’s atmosphere. LightSail 2 isn’t the first spacecraft to attempt to set sail on the solar wind. In 2010, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency launched IKAROS, a solar sail that made it past Venus, but that lacked a steering mechanism and was last heard from in 2015. Four years ago, the Planetary Society launched LightSail 2’s predecessor, LightSail 1, but that craft’s orbit was too low to demonstrate solar sailing.

"Justice Department won't bring charges against Attorney General William Barr, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after contempt vote",https://www.cnbc.com,['Sunny Kim'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/doj-wont-bring-charges-against-barr-ross-after-contempt-vote.html,"Attorney General William Barr discussing the counting of citizens in the country and the legal issues surrounding that effort, behind him stands Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, in the Rose Garden at the White House.

The Justice Department will not bring charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the House voted last week to hold them in criminal contempt.

The DOJ had not been expected to pursue charges against Barr, who oversees the department, or Ross.

""The Department of Justice's long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had authorized subpoenas to the Justice and Commerce departments in April demanding information about the administration's attempt to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

Barr and Ross had refused to comply with the subpoenas, after Trump asserted executive privilege over the documents. The refusal to comply prompted the Oversight Committee to vote along party lines to hold the officials in contempt. That vote was sent to the entire Democrat-led House, which voted last month to hold the men in contempt.

After a defeat at the Supreme Court, Trump abandoned his fight to add the citizenship question to the census, opting instead to sign an executive order to collect citizenship information from government agencies.

Rosen contended in the letter that the Justice Department has ""consistently adhered to the position that 'the contempt of Congress statute was not intended to apply and could not constitutionally be applied to an Executive Branch official who asserts the President's claim of executive privilege.'""

He cited multiple examples of the department taking the same stance during the Bush and Obama administrations.

""The Department has determined that the responses by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to the subpoenas issued by the Committee on Oversight and Reform did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen wrote.

A spokeswoman for the Oversight Committee did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."
