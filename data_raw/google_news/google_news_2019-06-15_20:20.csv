President Donald Trump said he'd been briefed on Navy pilots reporting increased sightings of unidentified flying objects, adding that he doesn't particularly believe in UFOs.

Speaking with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in an interview segment released Saturday, Trump raised his eyebrows and grinned incredulously when asked what he made of the reports.

""I want them to think whatever they think,"" Trump said of the Navy pilots. ""I did have one very brief meeting on it. But people are saying they’re seeing UFOs. Do I believe it? Not particularly.""

The Navy recently drafted new guidelines for how to report encounters with ""unidentified aircraft"" in response to reports of sophisticated vessels intruding on Navy strike groups, POLITICO reported in April. Pilots reported seeing objects flying at 30,000 feet with no exhaust plumes and at supersonic speeds, according to The New York Times.

The Pentagon quietly set up a program to research UFOs more than 10 years ago at the direction of Congress. The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program was largely pushed by former Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and operated with extremely limited public exposure, though it was not a classified program.

Trump did not seem as eager to act on the reports, telling Stephanopoulos that ""we’re going to see.""

When asked if Trump would know of any extraterrestrial life, he demurred and said: ""I think our great pilots would know. And some of them see things a little bit different from the past. ... We’re watching, and you’ll be the first to know.""

U.S. Escalates Online Attacks on Russia’s Power Grid,https://www.nytimes.com,"['David E. Sanger', 'Nicole Perlroth']",06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/trump-cyber-russia-grid.html,"After Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Russian hackers kept escalating attacks.

Mr. Trump’s initial cyberteam decided to be far more public in calling out Russian activity. In early 2018, it named Russia as the country responsible for “the most destructive cyberattack in human history,” which paralyzed much of Ukraine and affected American companies including Merck and FedEx.

When General Nakasone took over both Cyber Command and the N.S.A. a year ago, his staff was assessing Russian hackings on targets that included the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear power plant near Burlington, Kan., as well as previously unreported attempts to infiltrate Nebraska Public Power District’s Cooper Nuclear Station, near Brownville. The hackers got into communications networks, but never took over control systems.

In August, General Nakasone used the new authority granted to Cyber Command by the secret presidential directive to overwhelm the computer systems at Russia’s Internet Research Agency — the group at the heart of the hacking during the 2016 election in the United States. It was one of four operations his so-called Russia Small Group organized around the midterm elections. Officials have talked publicly about those, though they have provided few details.

But the recent actions by the United States against the Russian power grids, whether as signals or potential offensive weapons, appear to have been conducted under the new congressional authorities.

As it games out the 2020 elections, Cyber Command has looked at the possibility that Russia might try selective power blackouts in key states, some officials said. For that, they said, they need a deterrent.

In the past few months, Cyber Command’s resolve has been tested. For the past year, energy companies in the United States and oil and gas operators across North America discovered their networks had been examined by the same Russian hackers who successfully dismantled the safety systems in 2017 at Petro Rabigh, a Saudi petrochemical plant and oil refinery.

The question now is whether placing the equivalent of land mines in a foreign power network is the right way to deter Russia. While it parallels Cold War nuclear strategy, it also enshrines power grids as a legitimate target.

“We might have to risk taking some broken bones of our own from a counterresponse, just to show the world we’re not lying down and taking it,” said Robert P. Silvers, a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings and former Obama administration official. “Sometimes you have to take a bloody nose to not take a bullet in the head down the road.”"
Trump campaign zeroes in on a new threat: Elizabeth Warren,https://www.politico.com,"['Alex Isenstadt', 'Christopher Cadelago', 'David Siders']",06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/15/donald-trump-elizabeth-warren-2020-election-1365816,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is enjoying a renaissance after a painful campaign rollout, engineering her turnaround with litany of policy plans, a nonstop campaign schedule, and a populist message. | Paul Sancya/AP Photo 2020 elections Trump campaign zeroes in on a new threat: Elizabeth Warren The president's team is about to go after a candidate he had left for dead.

President Donald Trump’s reelection machine is setting its sights on a new target, one it had left for dead just a few months ago: Elizabeth Warren.

With the Massachusetts senator rising in polls and driving a populist message that threatens to cut into the president’s blue-collar base, the Trump campaign is training its firepower on Warren with an eye toward blunting her momentum.

Story Continued Below

Trump aides and their allies at the Republican National Committee, who initially believed their money and manpower were better focused elsewhere, are digging up opposition research, deploying camera-wielding trackers, and preparing to brand Warren as a liberal extremist. The reassessment of Warren, confirmed in conversations with more than a half-dozen Trump advisers, reflects the volatility of the massive Democratic primary and how the reelection campaign is reacting to it.

The Trump team — including the president himself — had been focused almost exclusively on Joe Biden to this point. But Warren’s rise now has them thinking she could pose a serious threat in a general election. Warren’s disciplined style, populist-infused speeches, and perceived ability to win over suburban female voters, Trump advisers concede, has raised concerns.

Campaign pollster John McLaughlin has sounded the alarm internally, stressing that Warren’s attacks on Trump threaten to undercut his support from the working-class voters who propelled him to the presidency.

“Although our own early published polls and internal polls discounted Elizabeth Warren, her recent momentum in May and June in national and early caucus and primary states into a strong second place to a flat Joe Biden is a cause for our campaign’s attention,” McLaughlin wrote in a text message to POLITICO.

“Sen. Warren’s attacks on President Trump’s policies need to be rebutted,” McLaughlin added. “We can’t just allow her to continue to attack the President in key states like Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and elsewhere.”

Biden will still receive a significant share of the campaign's attention. But Trump aides say they're less certain that he'll be their eventual opponent.

The reelection campaign first began taking note of Warren’s momentum several weeks ago, when polling showed her gaining substantially on Biden and Sanders. They were startled earlier this month when Tucker Carlson, a host on Trump-friendly Fox News, used the opening monologue of his show to heap praise on the liberal senator.

Warren’s populist economic agenda, Carlson said, “sounds like Donald Trump at his best.”

Other pro-Trump Republican groups are paying closer attention to Warren, too. The GOP oppo research shop America Rising has placed Warren in its top tier of Democratic candidates and will prioritize putting trackers on her campaign events. The RNC, meanwhile, recently sent out a news release drawing attention to a radio interview in which Warren was pressed on her past claims of Native American ancestry.

But Trump aides are planning a barrage that extends well beyond the heritage issue, which has been the focus of Trump's mockery and broadsides. They’re preparing to dig into her past as a professor and try to pick apart her laundry list of policy proposals.

“There’s no question that Elizabeth Warren is on the move, has momentum and could well end up as our opponent,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump 2020 spokesman. “We have to make sure voters know about her proposals for government takeover of health care, free health care for illegal immigrants, radical environmental restrictions, and increased taxes — all proposals that will devastate this country.”

A Warren spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Warren is enjoying a renaissance after a painful campaign rollout. Trump attacked her mercilessly after she released a DNA test that attempted to put the controversy over her blood lines to rest only to reveal she’s between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American.

During an appearance at his Mar-a-Lago resort in March, the president lamented to donors that he knocked Warren out of the race too early and that he should have saved his jabs for later. During a late April rally in Wisconsin, the president said Warren was “finished.”

In the weeks that followed, though, the anti-Wall Street crusader engineered a turnaround with a litany of policy plans, a nonstop campaign schedule and a hard-charging populist message.

In the most recent national poll, from Quinnipiac University, Warren was at 15 percent, only slightly behind Sanders for second place. And in polls released this week of California and Nevada — two key states that vote in late February and early March, respectively — Warren leapfrogged Sanders, running behind only Biden.

The latest view inside the Trump campaign is that Warren has a more coherent message and a more passionate liberal following than Biden, whose support they see as soft. “Her politics are where the Democratic party has moved,” said Trump campaign adviser Raj Shah. “She’s primed to pick up more support as Bernie fades and Biden erodes.”

Biden and his supporters, however, are confident the Democratic electorate is more centrist than prognosticators think.

Not everyone agrees that going after Warren is the right move. Some Trump aides contend that her liberal positions would make her an easier general election opponent and that they should hold off on attacking her. Others, however, argue that guessing a particular candidate's level of electability is impossible and that the Democratic nominee — no matter who it is — needs to be defined well before next year’s convention.

Trump himself appears to recognize Warren’s newfound strength.

“Now I see that Pocahontas is doing better,” the president said during a Friday morning appearance on Fox News, using his favorite nickname for the Massachusetts senator. “I would love to run against her frankly.”

State Department says senior UN official’s visit to China 'highly inappropriate',https://www.foxnews.com,['Ben Evansky'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/state-department-says-senior-un-officials-visit-to-china-highly-inappropriate,"The State Department criticized an upcoming visit of the UN’s counter-terrorism Czar to China as, “highly inappropriate,” after it was revealed the official was going to a province that has witnessed persecution of ethnic Muslims for their religious beliefs by the Chinese government.

The U.N. has faced ongoing criticism of cozying up to China – adding fuel to the fire the U.N. has allowed Vladimir Voronkov, the United Nations Under-Secretary for the UN’s counter-terrorism office to visit Xinjiang, which is home to some one million persecuted Uighur and ethnic Muslims.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said that Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan called UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Friday, “to convey deep concerns,” regarding Vornonkov’s planned visit to Xinjiang, China.

“The Deputy Secretary expressed that such a visit is highly inappropriate in view of the unprecedented repression campaign underway in Xinjiang against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims.”

US SPEAKS UP FOR MINORITY MUSLIM UIGHURS IN CHINA - WHILE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES STAY MOSTLY SILENT

Ortagus continued, “The Deputy Secretary noted that Beijing continues to paint its repressive campaign against Uighurs and other Muslims as legitimate counterterrorism efforts when it is not, and stressed that the UN’s topmost counterterrorism official is putting at risk the UN’s reputation and credibility on counterterrorism and human rights by lending credence to these false claims.”

Proposing a solution, “The Deputy Secretary advocated for unmonitored and unhindered access to all camps and detainees in Xinjiang by UN human rights officials.”

China has faced growing scrutiny over its internment camps that hold approximately 1 million Muslims in the Xinjiang region of Western China.

A recent State Department country report on human rights practices in China noted: “Members of the minority Uighur ethnic group reported systematic torture and other degrading treatment…survivors stated that authorities subjected individuals in custody to electrocution, waterboarding, stress positions, injection of unknown substances and cold cells.”

In April, Antonio Guterres the UN Secretary-General faced criticism for not raising the issue of the Uighurs directly with President Xi Jinping on a visit there. Instead, his spokesman told reporters that he had discussed the situation in Xinjiang with, “Chinese authorities.”

KEANU REEVES' PICTURE AMONG TOOLS IN CHINA'S CRACKDOWN ON UIGHUR MINORITY

China’s new ambassador to the UN in Geneva confirmed to reporters this week that China had invited Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit the camps in the region. Her spokesperson told the Associated Press that her office is in negotiations for “full access,” for the trip to take place.

Last month during a session of the UN Human Rights Council in Switzerland, the Executive Director of UN Watch, Hillel Neuer, took to the floor against the continuous objections of China and described the conditions ethnic Muslims were living under.

“Surveillance and repression in Xinjiang has increased dramatically,” he said. “Biometric data is collected from residents, passports confiscated, religious activity restricted. China bans long beards, public prayers and Muslim veils.”

Despite its human rights violations, China is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council.

The Trump administration withdrew from the UN Human Rights Council in June of last year. Nikki Haley, the then United States ambassador to the UN said the council was, “a protector of human rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias.”

DOJ audit reveals FBI lost track of dozens of foreign nationals,https://www.cnn.com,"['Josh Campbell', 'Cnn Law Enforcement Analyst']",06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/15/politics/fbi-lost-track-of-foreign-nationals-ig-report/index.html,"(CNN) The FBI lost track of dozens of foreign nationals it sponsored for entry into the United States to assist with investigations, the Justice Department's internal watchdog found.

The revelation stems from an audit by the DOJ Office of Inspector General into the department's use of immigration tools that allow law enforcement to sponsor non-US citizens to enter the country without requiring a traditional visa or residency.

This special category of immigration status is often used by the department to permit the entry of cooperating witnesses and confidential informants, who may be required to take part in investigative operations or trial testimony. Many of these individuals would ordinarily be unable to obtain traditional lawful immigration status due to their connections to criminal enterprises.

An agreement with the Department of Homeland Security -- the federal agency charged with conferring immigration status -- requires sponsoring law enforcement agencies assume full responsibility for tracking and monitoring the location and activities of foreign nationals they sponsor for entry.

In its review of the use of these special provisions by Justice Department component agencies, the inspector general found that the FBI was unable to account for at least 61 foreign nationals it sponsored. Furthermore, rather than proactively reporting the total number of those who disappeared, the bureau only notified DHS of 32 individuals no longer under the agency's control.

Hans von Spakovsky: Congress has no right to Trump tax returns – Justice Department makes right decision,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Hans Von Spakovsky', 'Hans A. Von Spakovsky Is A Senior Legal Fellow At The Heritage Foundation.', 'He Is The Coauthor Of']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/hans-von-spakovsky-congress-has-no-right-to-trump-tax-returns-justice-department-makes-right-decision,"President Trump won a victory Friday when the Justice Department said Congress does not have the right to see his tax returns. More importantly, all American taxpayers won a victory, because the Justice Department memo regarding Trump’s returns has the effect of upholding the privacy and confidentially of all our tax returns as well.

If Congress is allowed to examine the president’s tax returns, the next step will be demands by lawmakers to examine the tax returns of others – political activists and opponents, members of unpopular groups, religious minorities, and who knows who else.

And if you think this isn’t possible, just think back to the FBI under Director J. Edgar Hoover and the files he kept on many Americans he considered to be dangerous subversives – including civil rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King.

DOJ DEFENDS MNUCHIN’S REFUSAL TO HAND OVER TRUMP’S TAX RETURNS

Even if you can’t stand President Trump and think he should be impeached, remember that giving government the power to act against someone you oppose also gives government the power to act against someone you support – or perhaps even against you personally.

Importantly, the provision of the tax code that Democrats are seeking to use to get Trump’s tax returns could also be used to get the tax returns of other Americans as well, should Trump lose his fight to keep his tax returns confidential.

The 33-page opinion protecting the confidentially of tax returns was written by Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel, who heads the Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department. It is based on an appropriate reading of the law.

The Office of Legal Counsel is the office within Justice that provides legal advice to the president and all executive agencies, including on the proper interpretation of laws and the Constitution.

To no one’s surprise, Democrats are attacking the Justice Department memo as a political document designed to protect President Trump. Yet in fact, the reason Democrats want to see the Trump tax returns is blatantly political. They want to use the information in the returns in possible impeachment proceedings against the president and to campaign against Trump’s re-election.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., who has led the fight by House Democrats to get six years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns, has indicated Democrats will file a lawsuit seeking access to the tax returns.

The Justice Department opinion concludes that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was legally justified in refusing to turn over the Trump tax returns that Neal’s committee asked for.

As I have explained previously, the Justice Department opinion should come as no surprise, given the privacy protections contained in federal law ensuring the confidentiality of tax returns and the invalid reasons given by Neal for demanding the returns.

The opinion reviews the relevant federal statute, 26 U.S.C. § 6103, which prohibits federal officials from disclosing tax returns.

There is an exception in the law that says the Treasury Department secretary shall provide tax return information upon “written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means.” No reason has to be given for the request.

Importantly, the provision of the tax code that Democrats are seeking to use to get Trump’s tax returns could also be used to get the tax returns of other Americans as well, should Trump lose his fight to keep his tax returns confidential.

However, the Justice Department opinion released Friday points out, Congress cannot “constitutionally confer upon the Committee the right to compel the Executive Branch to disclose confidential information without a legitimate legislative purpose.” The opinion cites numerous court decisions, including by the Supreme Court, that have made this clear.

The opinion goes into great detail examining the background behind the demand for the president’s tax returns. After reviewing that history, the Office of Legal Counsel says that Secretary Mnuchin “reasonably and correctly concluded that the Committee’s asserted interest in reviewing the Internal Revenue Service’s audits of presidential returns was pretextual and that its true aim was to make the President’s tax returns public, which is not a legitimate legislative purpose.”

Rep. Neal claimed that the reason for the demand to see the Trump tax returns was to examine the “extent to which the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a President.”

But if that was the case, asked the Office of Legal Counsel, why did Neal ask for Trump’s tax returns “for many years before his presidency.”

Furthermore, the Office of Legal Counsel noted that Neal did not ask for “any information concerning the IRS’s actual policies or practices governing presidential audits or the audit histories for any President other than President Trump.”

Based on these “discrepancies in the public record,” it was obvious that Neal had “not articulated the real reason for his request,” the Justice Department opinion found.

The opinion concluded that this is especially true given that Neal’s demand represented “the culmination of a sustained effort over more than two years to seek the public release of President Trump’s tax returns” by Neal and numerous other Democrats in the House of Representatives, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

The opinion summed up the “sustained effort” by pointing out that Neal and other members of Congress made “clear their intent to acquire and release the President’s tax returns” throughout 2017 and 2018.

Referring to Democrats, the opinion states: “They offered many different justifications for such an action, suggesting that releasing the returns would ‘honor tradition,’ show ‘what the Russians have on Donald Trump,’ reveal a potential ‘Chinese connection,’ inform tax reform legislation, provide the ‘clearest picture of his financial health,’ and expose any alleged emoluments received by the president from foreign governments.

But alleged “oversight” of the IRS audit process of the tax returns of presidents “had never been the focus of their demands” until Neal’s letter to the Treasury Department in April, according to the memo from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel.

Clearly, the effort by Democrats to get President Trump’s tax returns is not over. We can now expect a long and expensive legal battle – financed by your tax dollars – as Democrats continue their singular focus on investigation of the president instead of legislation to improve the lives of the American people and strengthen our nation."

In response to the special counsel’s report, Democrats are piecing together a package of legislation focused largely on shielding elections from foreign influence, including proposals to bar candidates from accepting foreign help of any kind, while making it mandatory that campaigns alert the FBI when such offers are extended.

But some lawmakers want to press further, eying legislation to nullify the Department of Justice's (DOJ) long-standing determination that presidents cannot be charged with federal crimes while they remain in office.

Gerry Connolly Gerald (Gerry) Edward ConnollySwing-state Democrats see trouble in proposed pay hike Swing-state Democrats see trouble in proposed pay hike Seven key allies for Pelosi on impeachment MORE (D-Va.), a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. “I'm in favor of expanding enforcement tools and accountability tools, and that's definitely one of them.”

While he has not been involved in talks about specific proposals, Jeffries said, “It strikes me as a reasonable thing to consider.”

“It's fair to say that one of the options we should consider is revisiting that Department of Justice rule so you don't have a rogue and lawless president immunized from criminal prosecution,” he said.

It's unclear how or when the proposal might surface. Connolly said it could appear as part of a larger spending package or as an authorization bill out of the House Judiciary Committee. “But I guarantee you it will be a topic of discussion,” he said.

At issue is a Justice Department policy stretching back 46 years, when former President Nixon was coming under increasing fire surrounding a Watergate scandal that would eventually lead to his impeachment and resignation. In that 1973 memorandum, the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) resolved that a sitting president cannot be subject to prosecution for federal crimes.

The rationale hinged on bandwidth. The president's unique responsibilities, the authors determined, “have become so onerous that a President may not be able fully to discharge the powers and duties of his office if he had to defend a criminal prosecution.” With that in mind, the OLC concluded, the only way to remove a sitting president is through impeachment.

The DOJ revisited the question in 2000, following the impeachment of former President Clinton, finding that “the conclusion reached by the Department in 1973 still represents the best interpretation of the Constitution.”

Mueller leaned heavily on that policy last month in outlining his findings during a brief appearance at the DOJ, where he made clear the agency’s guidelines precluded his team from recommending charges against Trump related to the obstruction allegations it had investigated.

“The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice, and, by regulation, it was bound by that department policy,” he said. “Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.”

Democrats were quick to punch back, arguing that no one — not even the president — is immune to the nation’s laws.

They had just ousted a king who flaunted that.”

Quigley said legislation to invalidate the DOJ policy is “a great idea.”

Such a bill has little chance of being considered in the Senate, which is controlled by Trump's Republican allies. But some Democrats see it as a viable messaging tool heading into the 2020 elections.

“If I were a Republican member of the Senate, I wouldn't want to have to explain why the president is not subject to the laws of the United States,” said Rep.

Warren's idea is catching on with Democrats in the Capitol, who have grown increasingly frustrated with the administration's stonewalling of their investigations.

“That's why you have impeachment,” she said. “Because when the president is unfit — and it doesn't have to be criminal — when the Congress decides that he's not fit to be president, then that's what impeachment is for. That's what we're supposed to do.”

“There's an old saying that bad facts make bad law,” he said. “And I'd be careful of making sweeping legal decisions based on Trump's conduct.”

Still, there appear to be no divisions among the Democrats when it comes to the idea that the Constitution provides no license for presidents to flout the law with impunity.

Trump has challenged enough conventions, many Democrats say, that Congress will be forced to enshrine new laws that were previously thought unnecessary — including the voiding of the OLC guideline — even if it’s after he's gone.

Vladimir Voronkov, a veteran Russian diplomat who heads the U.N. Counterterrorism Office, is in China at the invitation of Beijing and is due to visit Xinjiang’s capital Urumqi, according to an email sent by his office to countries that raised concerns.

Diplomats said that along with the United States several other countries, including Britain, also complained.

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan spoke with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday “to convey deep concerns” about Voronkov’s trip because “Beijing continues to paint its repressive campaign against Uighurs and other Muslims as legitimate counterterrorism efforts when it is not.”

“The Deputy Secretary expressed that such a visit is highly inappropriate in view of the unprecedented repression campaign underway in Xinjiang against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement.

“The U.N.’s topmost counterterrorism official is putting at risk the U.N.’s reputation and credibility on counterterrorism and human rights by lending credence to these false claims,” the statement said.

China has been condemned internationally for setting up the detention complexes, which it describes as “education training centers” helping to stamp out extremism and give people new skills. Western states are worried Voronkov’s visit will validate China’s justification for the centers, diplomats said.

“China will, and is, actively saying that what they’re doing in Xinjiang is good terrorism prevention,” said a U.N. Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“The visit by Voronkov validates their narrative that this is a counterterrorism issue, when we would see it more as a human rights issue,” said the diplomat, adding that if Voronkov did not speak out after visiting Xinjiang then “silence could be seen as implicit acceptance, at worst U.N. complicity.”

The email from Voronkov’s office, seen by Reuters, said China planned the itinerary for Voronkov, whose office helps states implement a global counterterrorism strategy adopted by the U.N. General Assembly. The email said his office does “not expect any public statements” on his visit to Xinjiang.

He will be visiting Xinjiang before U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, who has repeatedly pushed China to grant the United Nations access to investigate reports of disappearances and arbitrary detentions, particularly of Muslims in Xinjiang.

“This mission is not connected in any manner to upcoming visits by other senior U.N. officials, including the High Commissioner of Human Rights. We would like to assure you that (Voronkov’s) visit is not intended to undermine or overshadow the visit of Ms. Bachelet,” the email said.

China’s envoy in Geneva said on Thursday that he hoped Bachelet would visit China, including Xinjiang, and “we hope to define a time which is convenient to both sides.” The last visit by a U.N. human rights chief to China was in 2005.

The email from Voronkov’s office said he had already visited Russia, Britain, the United States and France which, along with China, make up the five permanent veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council.

Human Rights Watch U.N. director Louis Charbonneau said that instead of sending Voronkov to Xinjiang, Guterres should “be calling for the immediate closure of ‘political education’ camps” and pushing for unfettered access for Bachelet and other rights experts.

Guterres raised the plight of Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region with the Chinese government’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, during a visit to Beijing in April."
Sean Hannity: Sources say DOJ inspector general resolved 'hang up' on first Carter Page FISA application,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-sources-say-doj-inspector-general-resolved-hang-up-on-first-carter-page-fisa-application,"Fox News host Sean Hannity said the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses may have hit a snag examining the first Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

During his evening show on Thursday, Hannity explained how Inspector General Michael Horowitz worked around the issue, which was related to British ex-spy Christopher Steele and his dossier, and may have already submitted his report to the attorney general.

""From my understanding, my sources, is inspector general Horowitz is probably likely done,"" Hannity said, adding, ""I’ve had some people saying, suggesting strongly they believe that the attorney general already has the inspector general's report.""

He was interviewing the Hill's John Solomon and credited memos obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation and first reported by Solomon with aiding the watchdog investigation reach a breakthrough.

The memos showed Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11, 2016 and admitted he was encouraged by his client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

""Now there was apparently, originally a hang up on only one of the FISA applications. Surprisingly that being the first,"" Hannity said. ""But according to my sources, your reporting about Kathleen Kavalec's confirmation and warning and admonition to the FBI prior to the first FISA application put that to bed in light of also the closed-door testimony of Bruce Ohr that everybody was warned,"" he added, referring to Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, who acted as an unofficial back channel between the Steele and the FBI.

Steele's dossier, which was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had just left the Trump campaign and had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

Hannity's reporting follows Joe diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, saying last month that Horowitz's team determined the three FISA warrant extensions against Page were illegally obtained.

Although Attorney General William Barr said he anticipated Horowitz’s investigation to be complete by early June, Solomon said his own sources and Rep. Mark Meadows, have made it clear that the FISA investigation will take longer than expected to wrap up, particularly after Steele offered himself up for an interview with the inspector general.

""Not a long time, a short while,"" Solomon said, adding that he thinks the American people will see the report sometime in the summer."
"A President With a Taste for Planes Has a Plan for Air Force One: Paint It Red, White and Blue",https://www.nytimes.com,['Katie Rogers'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/us/politics/trump-air-force-one-paint-job.html,"WASHINGTON — As someone who fancies himself an aviation expert — he did once have his own airline, after all — President Trump indulged his interest this week in a number of ways.

He ordered an F-35, a (very loud) $80 million fighter jet, to fly over the White House during the visit of the president of Poland. He stood on the South Lawn watching the landing of a pricey new VH-92 helicopter, which is referred to as Marine One when he is aboard. And in maybe his most satisfying moments of the week, he detailed his plans to give Air Force One — perhaps the most famous plane in the world — a new paint job.

“I like the concept of red, white and blue,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Friday, describing the makeover he envisions for the plane, a specially fitted Boeing 747 with iconic cyan and white coloring. “The baby blue doesn’t fit with us.”

For other presidents, all of this would have amounted to a few too many aeronautical activities to stuff into a week packed with mounting aggression toward Iran, tariff threats and a head-of-state visit. Not for this one. In fact, it’s hard not to think that this sort of sky-toy-packed schedule is closer to what Mr. Trump, with his peculiar fixation with all things aviation, originally envisioned for his presidency."
DOJ edges closer to T-Mobile-Sprint approval,https://www.cnet.com,['Marguerite Reardon'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnet.com/news/doj-edges-closer-to-t-mobile-sprint-approval/,"Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The US Justice Department is getting close to approving T-Mobile's $26 billion merger with Sprint if the companies agree to sell multiple assets to help create a new wireless carrier, according to The New York Times. The paper reports that three unnamed sources close to the DOJ have said the agency could approve the deal as soon as next week, so long as a new nationwide phone carrier can be created to ensure sufficient competition in the wireless market.

T-Mobile and Sprint have already struck a deal with the Federal Communications Commission to sell off Sprint's prepaid brand Boost Mobile in exchange for the agency's blessing. The FCC and the DOJ must each sign off on the deal. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has already said he'd support the merger if the companies agreed to sell Boost and if they make other commitments, such as meeting build-out requirements for 5G wireless service. In addition to the Boost sale, the DOJ is also asking T-Mobile and Sprint to divest wireless spectrum, according to the Times.

Reports that the DOJ wanted the companies to sell off assets to create a new carrier first circulated last month. But the Times report suggests a deal is imminent.

Such an agreement could weaken the case for the states suing to stop the merger. A group of 10 state attorneys general, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, filed their suit earlier this week, saying that the merged company would ""deprive consumers of the benefits of competition and drive up prices for cellphone services.""

The lawsuit to block the merger is set for a pretrial hearing next week in federal court in New York City, according to Reuters.

T-Mobile declined to comment on the report. Sprint, the DOJ and the New York Attorney General's office weren't immediately available for comment."
DOJ establishes transnational elder fraud strike force,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-establishes-transnational-elder-fraud-strike-force/story?id=63714167,"The Justice Department has formed a transnational elder fraud strike force to combat the growing international problem of elder fraud.

Elder fraud is when fraudsters prey on older victims who can be more susceptible to when approached to give money to sympathetic causes and in some cases threatened and harassed by criminals.

Recently, three Peruvian men pleaded guilty to extorting older Americans through a Spanish-speaking call center.

""For example, one such script directed the callers to falsely and fraudulently claim to be government attorneys and to state that the victims faced lawsuits and fines for not paying for or receiving packages. Other scripts included similar stories where the callers falsely claimed to be attorneys with courts or credit bureaus in the United States,"" the indictment in the case reads.

The effort, announced Thursday, combines six U.S. Attorney's offices from California to Georgia, FBI Special Agents and the Postal Inspection Agency -- all in an effort to combat elder fraud in the United States.

“Fraud against the elderly is on the rise,"" Attorney General William Barr said in a release. “One of the most significant and pernicious causes for this increase is foreign-based fraud schemes. The new Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force will bring together the expertise and resources of our prosecutors, federal and international law enforcement partners, and other government agencies to better target, investigate, and prosecute criminals abroad who prey on our elderly at home. The Department of Justice is committed to ending the victimization of elders across the country.”

Earlier this year, the attorney general announced the largest ever crackdown on elder fraud in country by highlighting the case of William Webster, the former FBI director who was targeted for months by scammers abroad.

“It doesn’t matter where these criminals live. We’re committed to keeping our elderly citizens safe, whether they’re being targeted door-to-door, over the phone, or online, from thousands of miles away,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said.

Barr has said that he had been a victim of one of the scams in 2017. While he was not attorney general at the time, fraudsters asked for money using his old official portrait.

He highlighted his story at a roundtable event in March.

""People took my official Justice Department portrait from 1992, so I was looking pretty good in 1992 and they put it up on Facebook and other online sites and I was telling people as the former attorney general I had access to special federal grant money and if they just sent some money I could tell them how to get some major grants,"" he explained.

Barr said he had the pages taken down, but from time to time even leading up to when he was nominated to be attorney general he would get calls from people around the country which he called ""heartbreaking."""
Federal watchdog opens inquiry into EPA handling of Minnesota PolyMet pollution permit,http://www.startribune.com,"['Jennifer Bjorhus', 'Jennifer.Bjorhus Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/federal-watchdog-opens-inquiry-into-how-the-epa-handled-minnesota-pollution-permit/511333592/,"The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General has opened an investigation into the agency’s handling of a crucial pollution permit for Minnesota’s first copper mine after a retired agency attorney raised questions about the episode.

The investigation was announced June 12, the same day the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released documents related to the water quality permit requested by several parties, including the Minnesota-based advocacy group WaterLegacy and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn.

Release of the documents shows that written comments by EPA regulators, challenging key parts of the permit, were never formally submitted for the public record and were never sent to officials at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). Instead, the comments were read to MPCA staff over the telephone last spring, a practice that the retired EPA attorney described as “bizarre.”

The Star Tribune has also requested the documents, but the EPA hasn’t yet provided them.

The documents relate to a crucial state water quality permit issued to PolyMet Mining, a Toronto-based minerals firm that wants to build a $1 billion copper-nickel mine in northeast Minnesota. After years of review, PolyMet cleared most of Minnesota’s regulatory hurdles in late 2018. The newly released documents include seven pages of detailed criticism by EPA Region 5 staff in Chicago, which oversees Minnesota’s enforcement of federal pollution laws, outlining deficiencies in the permit that the MPCA issued to PolyMet last December. It is the first time the EPA’s official comments on the permit, which will regulate dangerous pollutants in effluent from the mine, have been made public.

The written comments note that the permit would “authorize discharges that would exceed Minnesota’s federally-approved human health and/or aquatic life water quality standards for mercury, copper, arsenic, cadmium, and zinc.” In one core passage, they said the permit lacked specific effluent limits, known as WQBELs, which are numeric limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the effluent pumped out a discharge pipe.

A retired EPA attorney from Boston, Jeffry Fowley, learned of the phoned-in comments from confidential sources in January and filed a complaint with the EPA’s Office of Inspector General.

The sources told him EPA leadership in Region 5 were suppressing staff comments. Fowley has called it “serious improper conduct” and “unethical.”

“In all my years of experience, I have never heard of a situation where EPA personnel have read written comments on a permit to state personnel over the phone,” Fowley said in a sworn declaration filed with the Minnesota Court of Appeals.

MPCA officials told the Star Tribune there was nothing unusual about their exchange with the EPA, and that they did incorporate many of the agency’s concerns into the final permit for PolyMet.

In an interview Friday, Fowley said he and Minnesota’s Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, which also filed a complaint, were pleased with the Inspector General’s decision.

“I think the fact that they’re taking up this one indicates they think there is something seriously wrong,” Fowley said.

McCollum, who waged a monthslong public battle to obtain the EPA documents, had only brief comments. In a statement to the Star Tribune she said her role was to “ensure transparency.”

“Now the courts and the public have the information needed to determine whether the final permit adequately addresses the many concerns raised by the EPA,” said McCollum, who leads a House subcommittee that oversees the EPA.

Differing documents

In a letter to McCollum with the documents, EPA Acting Associate Administrator Joseph Brazauskas said it’s common practice for complex permitting decisions to be handled verbally rather than in writing.

“EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp has specifically encouraged EPA staff to work more collaboratively and speak ‘face-to-face’ with state officials,” Brazauskas wrote.

Brazauskas also said the EPA hadn’t planned to release the written comments because it considers them private under the “deliberative process privilege” exemption to the federal Freedom of Information Act.

However, he said, the agency had given the comments voluntarily to the Fond du Lac tribe, so it could no longer withhold them.

The EPA’s written comments were also sent to WaterLegacy, an advocacy group in St. Paul, and the Fond du Lac Band, whose land is downstream from PolyMet’s proposed mine near Babbitt.

The parties together have challenged the water permit over its lack of stringent, federally enforceable limits on nearly two dozen pollutants regulated by the Clean Water Act.

The documents received by WaterLegacy, however, differ slightly from those sent to McCollum; they include a separate letter from Kevin Pierard, a senior official in the EPA’s Chicago office, to Jeff Udd, the MPCA’s director of metallic mining, which underscores the fact that the EPA’s concerns were conveyed by phone, not in writing.

Many sections in this copy of the written comments were underlined and numbered; across the top Pierard wrote by hand that the underlined sections were “conveyed verbally” to the MPCA on April 5, 2018, and lists the MPCA staff on the phone call.

The phone conversation occurred several weeks after the public comment period on PolyMet’s draft permit closed in March 2018, meaning that the EPA-written criticisms were never entered in the public record.

The EPA’s criticisms should have been public from the start, said WaterLegacy lawyer Paula Maccabee.

“They are some of the strongest comments I’ve ever seen,” she said. “It’s like one of the most important documents in this entire case, and it’s not in the administrative record.”

‘Rigorous’ review

MPCA officials and former MPCA Commissioner John Linc Stine said nothing improper occurred in the episode and that the final PolyMet permit did reflect some of the EPA comments.

In an interview, Stine said nothing requires the EPA to submit written comments during the public comment period. He also said that the concerns the EPA read over the telephone were similar to comments other stakeholders had filed previously.

“It didn’t strike me that there was anything that was plowing new ground,” he said.

In a statement, MPCA spokesman Darin Broton described the PolyMet permit process as “rigorous” and said the agency discussed technical issues with the EPA frequently.

“Based on those conversations, as well as other comments received … during the official comment period, the MPCA made substantive changes to the draft permit, including additional limits for arsenic, cobalt, lead, nickel and mercury; and new language was added that clearly states that the discharge must not violate water quality standards,” Broton said. “That’s why the EPA did not object to the MPCA’s final permit.”

Several MPCA staff members have filed sworn statements as part of an appeal filed by WaterLegacy, making similar arguments.

Former MPCA staff attorney Michael Schmidt said in his declaration that no one tried to conceal anything. They noted how quickly the EPA staff read the comments on the phone that day, making note-taking difficult.

In an interview Friday, Fowley, the former EPA attorney, accused both the EPA and the MPCA of a “coverup.” He said confidential sources told him that the EPA’s Region 5 staff were so frustrated about their unheeded concerns that they filed a memo Dec. 18 — just before the permit was issued — documenting the issues that had not been resolved. Fowley said the memo contained sufficient information to justify an EPA objection to the permit.

Fowley characterized PolyMet’s permit as weak, and “an end run around the … requirements of the Clean Water Act.”

“It’s kind of like if instead of speed limits they told people not to drive too fast,” Fowley said. “I’ve never seen this situation before.”"

DOJ lost track of foreign nationals with criminal histories after bringing them to US: audit,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-lost-track-of-foreign-nationals-with-criminal-histories-brought-into-us-for-court-cases-audit,"The Justice Department has lost track of numerous foreign nationals who were brought into the United States to help with law enforcement cases and may have criminal histories of their own – something that could be putting the public ""at risk,"" the DOJ’s inspector general warned in a newly released audit.

The report released by the Office of the Inspector General identified 62 foreign nationals brought into the U.S. who have since ""absconded"" from Justice Department oversight. The audit called this “especially problematic” because “these individuals often have criminal histories or are involved with criminal organizations.”

“Therefore, there are risks associated with these individuals remaining in the United States unsupervised and the public can be at risk,” the report said.

HOUSE DEMS VOTE TO HOLD BARR, ROSS IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER CENSUS

The report warned that others could be missing too: As of August 2018, the Department of Homeland Security was still seeking current information for 665 people identified as DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals as part of its own tracking.

A Justice Department spokesman, Alexei Woltornist, told Fox News: “The Department of Justice is aware of the findings of the IG report and is working on remedying the problem.”

​

In total, the department has sponsored thousands of foreign nationals under this program -- 5,496 between 2015 and 2017, spanning the Obama and Trump administrations, the audit said. Agencies involved include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Attorney’s Offices and the United States Marshals Service.

According to the audit, these foreign nationals – who may otherwise be considered inadmissible to the United States because of their criminal history – are brought to the U.S. to help support investigations and prosecutions.

“Significant risks accompany the sponsoring of foreign nationals to support law enforcement investigations because these individuals may be associated with criminal activity and motivated only by the ability to reside in the United States,” the report said.

But the report said the inspector general’s office does not “have assurance” that the DOJ and its law enforcement agencies have “adequately executed their monitoring responsibilities to mitigate the risks involved with sponsoring foreign nationals and to fulfill their obligation to protect the public.”

While the Justice Department and the other agencies have performed monitoring activities, problems have been identified in the process.

The report said some of the sponsored foreign nationals are not actually subject to “any routine monitoring requirements” because of “weaknesses in the monitoring policies at some DOJ components.”

And the report noted 18 instances where the Justice Department did not renew the sponsorship or termination of a foreign national in a timely matter, leading to those individuals falling into “an illegal status while residing in the United States.”

“We are concerned that the monitoring policies and practices currently executed by the DOJ components that sponsor foreign nationals do not adequately mitigate the risks associated with bringing individuals into the United States who may have criminal backgrounds or involvement in disreputable activities, or who may be associated with such individuals,” the report said.

In a response included in the audit, the Justice Department defended the use of the so-called S visa program, which allows long-term stays for foreign nationals in the United States when their presence could assist in combatting criminal and terrorism activities.

“The S visa program has played a crucial role in the successful prosecution or investigation of significant criminal or terrorist organization enterprises, and has enabled federal investigators and prosecutors to bring to justice dangerous criminals,” Jennifer A.H. Hodge, the acting deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in an April letter.

There have been risk concerns involving other federal government programs designed to expedite the admittance of foreign nationals into the United States. Then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in 2017 revamped a program that puts foreign-born recruits on a fast-track to U.S. citizenship in exchange for military service as doctors, nurses and language experts after Defense Department investigators discovered “potential security risks” with the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program."

The chemicals are often referred to as “forever chemicals” because of the time it takes them to break down.

The EPA has said it will decide by the end of the year whether it will set drinking water standards for PFAS.

The amendment, filed as part of the annual defense policy bill, would put pressure on the agency to speed up that timeline, adopting a drinking water standard within two years for two specific types of PFAS.

The EPA said it would not comment on pending legislation.

The compromise measure from a bipartisan group of senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee provides an early glimpse at how Congress plans to address the issue this year.

The EPA currently recommends no more than 70 parts per trillion of PFAS in drinking water. But many states, tired of waiting for standards from the federal government, have passed their own drinking water standards that are tougher than what the EPA currently recommends.

Attempting to force the EPA to set a standard would likely meet resistance from some Republicans.

At a recent House hearing on PFAS, several GOP lawmakers said they were wary of getting ahead of agency scientists and recommending a specific response.

But other Republicans argue the agency has been delaying action while the problem spreads.

Thursday’s Senate amendment would also force the EPA to consider barring new uses of PFAS and require PFAS manufacturers to share data on their production.

The amendment does not, however, make Superfund cleanup money available for places where PFAS has contaminated drinking water.

Carper has been pushing to designate PFAS a hazardous substance under the Superfund law as a way to force responsible parties to clean up the chemical.

In some cases, that party would be the military itself, which has identified more than 400 military sites with suspected PFAS contamination."
Justice Dept. Seeks to Question C.I.A. in Its Own Russia Investigation,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Julian E. Barnes', 'Katie Benner', 'Adam Goldman', 'Michael S.

Putin of Russia intervened to benefit Donald J. Trump.

The interview plans are the latest sign the Justice Department will take a critical look at the C.I.A.’s work on Russia’s election interference. Investigators want to talk with at least one senior counterintelligence official and a senior C.I.A. analyst, the people said. Both officials were involved in the agency’s work on understanding the Russian campaign to sabotage the election in 2016.

While the Justice Department review is not a criminal inquiry, it has provoked anxiety in the ranks of the C.I.A., according to former officials. Senior agency officials have questioned why the C.I.A.’s analytical work should be subjected to a federal prosecutor’s scrutiny. Attorney General William P. Barr, who is overseeing the review, assigned the United States attorney in Connecticut, John H. Durham, to conduct it.

[The attorney general is reviewing the Russia inquiry. Here’s what we know about its origins.]

Congressman is ready to go to court after Justice Department said Trump can keep his tax returns hidden,https://www.nj.com,"['Jonathan D. Salant', 'Jsalant Njadvancemedia.Com', 'Nj Advance Media For Nj.Com']",06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.nj.com/monmouth/2019/06/this-jersey-congressman-is-ready-to-go-to-court-after-trumps-justice-department-said-the-president-can-keep-his-tax-returns-hidden.html,"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump’s Justice Department says the president can keep his tax returns secret, and Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. is calling on the federal courts to reject “33 pages of pablum.”

Pascrell, D-9th Dist., said the next step should be a lawsuit against Attorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee.

“The law is on the side of the people, not Trump,” Pascrell said. “Thirty-three pages of pablum later from political hack lawyers in Barr’s world won’t change that. In short order, I hope and expect we can move forward to file suit and enforce the law and subpoena seeking this critical information.”

Democrats say Trump had to release his tax returns under law that’s been around since 1924. Trump just refused. Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin said the president will not comply with the House Democratic request.

Pascrell, who has served in the House of Representatives since 1997, has led the fight on Capitol Hill to obtain Trump’s returns, and first called for a lawsuit when Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin refused to release the documents last month.

Hose Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., had requested the returns under a 1924 law giving him the right to do so. But Trump’s Justice Department said the president didn’t have to comply because the request served no “legitimate legislative purpose,” even while acknowledging the law contained no such provisions.

“While the Executive Branch should accord due deference and respect to congressional requests, the executive need not treat the committee’s assertion of the legitimacy of its purpose as unquestionable,” the department said. “The president stands at the head of a coequal branch of government, and he is separately accountable to the people for the faithful performance of his responsibilities.""

The Justice Department issued its decision late Friday, a traditional time for government officials to make announcements they don’t want to attract attention to.

Pascrell said the timing of the decision “says all there is about what they think of its merits.”

Trump is the first president in more than four decades to refuse to make his tax returns public.

In a March Quinnipiac University Poll, almost two-thirds of U.S. voters, 64 percent, said Trump should release his tax returns, while just 29 percent said he shouldn’t. By 57 percent to 38 percent, they said Congress should investigate if Trump did not comply.

Trump administration to move USDA researchers to Kansas City area,https://www.politico.com,"['Liz Crampton', 'Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Burgess Everett', 'Nancy Cook', 'John Bresnahan']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/13/usda-kansas-city-area-1529072,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue argued in a statement that the Kansas City region will better position the department to attract people “with training and interest in agriculture” because the area is a proven “hub for all things agriculture."" | Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images Agriculture Trump administration to move USDA researchers to Kansas City area

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has chosen to relocate two of USDA's research agencies to the Kansas City area, the final step in a process to reshape the department's research wing that has drawn objections from several congressional Democrats.

Perdue said in announcing the new home of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture on Thursday that the move would bring the research agencies closer to major farming regions, improve customer service and save taxpayer dollars — about $20 million per year over 15 years.

But many employees at ERS, who conduct research into areas such as climate change, nutrition and the farm economy, and at NIFA, who arrange federal grants for agricultural research institutions, have told POLITICO they believe the move is rooted in politics.

Several current and former staffers at the agencies have warned that relocation could disrupt operations and drive out experienced researchers. The proposal has already sparked a brain-drain of veteran economists from ERS, and some lawmakers and ERS staff allege relocation is a back-door attempt to shrink the agency and clamp down on research that doesn't align with the Trump administration's priorities.

Democrats have questioned the relocation plan and blamed USDA for not providing detailed justification since the concept was first unveiled in August 2018. The House USDA-FDA appropriations bill for fiscal 2020 would prohibit USDA from moving forward with the relocation, but the measure is unlikely to become law before the move is carried out.

Perdue argued in a statement that the Kansas City region will better position the department to attract people “with training and interest in agriculture” because the area is a proven “hub for all things agriculture” and already boasts a “significant presence” of USDA and federal government employees, in addition to the Kansas City Federal Reserve.

“The Kansas City Region will allow ERS and NIFA to increase efficiencies and effectiveness and bring important resources and manpower closer to all of our customers,” he said.

“This agriculture talent pool, in addition to multiple land-grant and research universities within driving distance, provides access to a stable labor force for the future,” he added.

The department has not settled on a location in the Kansas City area. The General Services Administration will release a proposal early next month, allowing interested parties to submit bids, Perdue said Thursday afternoon. In the meantime, employees will be relocated as soon as mid-July and will be placed in temporary office space that fits up to 200 workers.

USDA has argued since the relocation proposal was first announced that the high cost of living in the Washington, D.C., area hinders recruitment and retention at the agencies.

The anticipated savings of $20 million per year will allow more funding to be directed to research initiatives to address “critical needs like rural prosperity and agricultural competitiveness,” Perdue said, adding that the savings will also enable the agencies to maintain service and staffing “even in the face of tightening budgets.”

State and local governments sweetened the deal by offering a package of $26 million in incentives, the secretary said. Perdue refused to reveal what the Kansas City region offered to attract USDA.

""These are proprietary discussions from our perspective,"" he told reporters. ""If the local community chooses to disclose those, they can do so at their will.""

The total savings of the projected move — about $300 million over 15 years — is based on a cost-benefit analysis of relocation to the Kansas City area that the department released on Thursday. Several congressional Democrats have called on the department for months to release such a study.

In announcing the pick, USDA backed down on another element of its plan that had drawn pushback from lawmakers — moving ERS within the department's organizational structure so that it would fall under the Office of the Chief Economist. The agency will remain under the department's Research, Education, and Economics mission area.

""While we believe there is considerable synergies and benefits to a realignment, after hearing feedback from stakeholders and members of Congress, USDA will not move forward with the realignment plans,"" the release said.

Critics of that part of the plan, including several current and former ERS employees interviewed by POLITICO, argued the realignment could subject the agency's research to political influence by positioning it closer to the Office of the Secretary. The House fiscal 2020 spending bill for USDA had sought to block the realignment.

The Kansas City region was selected from a pool of more than 130 locations that had expressed interest in hosting the agencies. Now, the move is on a fast-track timeline.

Agency employees are expected to receive relocation letters on Thursday. Employees anticipate being given 30 days to decide whether to move, according to union leaders.

Employees of both agencies have voted to unionize in the face of the relocation, and leaders at the American Federation of Government Employees, which is representing the workers, have vowed to press for a delay.

Union representatives said employees were not given advance notice of the announcement — something Perdue said on Wednesday he would do. They learned of the site selection through media reports, according to union leaders.

During a town hall briefing following the announcement, nearly 20 employees silently protested Perdue by turning their backs to him while he addressed staff.

""Secretary Perdue continually speaks of transparency and communicating to employees but has failed on both fronts,"" said Kevin Hunt, acting vice president of the ERS union. ""The announcement today highlights his disregard for the rights and wellbeing of employees.""

In a letter to employees shared with POLITICO, Perdue said he knows ""that this time, especially for the employees directly affected, has been personally and professionally challenging. I am grateful for your patience and your continued hard work.""

The secretary said he wrote the letter because he wanted employees to hear the news from him first. But a notice containing the letter was not distributed among staff until 10:37 a.m. Thursday — well after media reports were published and Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) had hailed the decision in a press release.

The four U.S. senators from Missouri and Kansas — all Republicans — issued a joint statement praising Perdue for selecting the Kansas City area. One of them, Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), said that ""agricultural research is a critical function of USDA, and I am committed to ensuring we continue to support and strengthen the research mission that our U.S. producers rely on.""

But some Democrats from other parts of the country were critical of the decision.

Reps. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) and Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-V.I.), who lead House Agriculture subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the USDA research agencies, criticized Thursday's announcement and said the entire process has lacked transparency.

Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), a House Appropriations Committee member who co-sponsored a bill to stop the move, said she was ""appalled"" with USDA's decision to force ""staffers to uproot their lives to Kansas City in order to keep their livelihoods.""

She also noted that a USDA Inspector General investigation ""examining the viability of this relocation is not complete.""

USDA paid the consulting firm Ernst & Young $340,000 to run the site selection process.

Gillibrand says she wouldn't stand in way if her DOJ wanted to investigate Trump,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Paul Steinhauser', 'Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gillibrand-wont-stand-in-way-if-her-justice-department-wanted-to-investigate-trump,"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand says if elected to the White House, she wouldn’t stand in the way if her Department of Justice wanted to investigate Donald Trump for obstruction of justice.

And the senator from New York told Fox News on Friday that she believes the Republican president’s alleged obstruction of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation “amounts to a crime.”

“As president of the United States, I will restore what’s been lost and that is an independent Department of Justice. They would be able to make that decision independent of me as president,” she said, while campaigning in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire.

She becomes the latest 2020 Democratic candidate to at least open the door to a Trump prosecution once he's out of office.

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris said this week she believes the only reason Mueller didn’t recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. In an interview with NPR, Harris said that once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges – and she suggested the Justice Department in a Harris presidency would pursue them.

HARRIS SAYS IF ELECTED, HER DOJ WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PROSECUTE TRUMP

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said.

Another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, said this week that if elected president, he could also support a Justice Department criminal investigation into Trump.

“To the extent that there’s an obstruction case, then yes, DOJ’s got to deal with it,” Buttigieg said in an interview with The Atlantic published Thursday.

But Buttigieg added that he would only take such a step if there was a “credible allegation.”

Mueller spent two years investigating any possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia to sway the election toward the GOP nominee at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

In his recent report, Mueller detailed extensive contact between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But he did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy. And he didn’t take a clear position on whether the president obstructed justice. Trump himself, in an interview with ABC News, disputed a central allegation from his former White House counsel that he tried to have Mueller removed.

Asked by Fox News whether she believed Trump deserved to be investigated, Gillibrand answered: “Do I believe what he’s done already amounts to a crime? I do.”

And she emphasized that “the American people, no matter what, are entitled to facts, transparency, and accountability.”

Another Democratic presidential candidate, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, disagrees with his rivals.

“If you look around the world, one pattern that America should seek to avoid is prosecuting past leaders and presidents and imprisoning them,"" Yang told Fox News on Thursday. ""That’s something that America has never fallen into and that’s the way I would hope that we proceed with me in the White House.”

Trump, meanwhile, has fired back at Democrats accusing him of a crime -- especially after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week she wants to see him in prison. Speaking Friday to ""Fox & Friends,"" he called her accusation of a ""criminal coverup"" a ""fascist"" and ""disgraceful"" statement."
"Quicken, Feds reach $32.5M deal in false claims lawsuit",https://www.detroitnews.com,"['Breana Noble', 'Robert Snell', 'Daniel Howes', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2019/06/14/judge-tosses-quicken-loans-justice-department-suit/1454923001/,"Dan Gilbert. (Photo: Clarence Tabb, Jr., The Detroit News)

Quicken Loans Inc. agreed to pay $32.5 million to the U.S. government in a yearslong case accusing the Detroit home mortgage lender of ignoring red flags in home loans that didn't meet federal standards ahead of the global financial crisis.

U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith dismissed Friday the lawsuit following a resolution reached in mediation sessions that included Quicken Chairman Dan Gilbert before he had a stroke on May 25. The deal resolves the matter without findings against Quicken Loans, the largest Federal Housing Administration lender in the United States.

""Dan Gilbert has been involved in this all the way, in the entire seven-year process,"" Quicken Vice Chairman Bill Emerson told The Detroit News, adding: ""He was 100 percent fully involved"" in mediation sessions on May 8 and May 9 that culminated in an agreement on May 9 — more than two weeks before his stroke.

Quicken's agreement differs from settlements made between major FHA lenders and the Justice Department following the bursting of the housing bubble and the financial meltdown that followed. Typically, those have totaled billions of dollars and often required the lenders to acknowledge they failed to comply with quality and reporting requirements.

""The small dollar amount and the fact that the government did not insist on an admission of wrongdoing gives the impression that the investigators did not feel they had a strong case of systematic wrongdoing of the sort they found at Wells Fargo,"" Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross Business School, said in an email.

Gilbert and his lawyers previously said the company would fight the accusations and not settle. Emerson denied the agreement resolving the suit is a settlement, instead calling it a ""resolution.""

Quicken, now the country's No. 1 mortgage lender, made loans in error totaling $25.5 million, he said, which is 0.02% of the company's $108 billion in FHA loans it has originated since 2007. To encourage homeownership, when a debtor defaults on an FHA loan, the government pays, not the lender. Quicken previously had said it would correct any wrongs.

""We didn't settle; we did exactly what we said we would do,"" Emerson said. ""We looked at some of the loans, and there were a few we made a mistake on. We made them whole. That's all we did.

""We did exactly what we said we would do, that we would fight this case. There was no case. There is no case. There are no findings of wrongdoing of us at all. There were a handful of loans that we made a mistake on. That’s exactly what happened.""

Emerson did not detail what or how many mistakes had been made. When the Justice Department filed the lawsuit, Quicken CEO Jay Farner said in 2015 that the online lender had found issues with only ""eight or nine"" loans.

Progress on the case, for the most part, had been behind closed doors and in documents under seal. The agreement comes two months after Goldsmith ordered that the parties undergo mediation with Gerald Rosen, the retired chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

Rosen proposed the ""fair path"" agreement following several meetings and two full days of mediation that the parties ultimately accepted, he said in a statement. The parties differed as to how the settlement amount should be attributed and calculated.

Ultimately, the proposed $25.5 million would go to making the government whole for any losses it may have incurred, together with $7 million in interest on that amount.

""The parties worked diligently, and in good faith, to mediate for a solution to resolve their differences and to put the dispute behind them,"" Rosen wrote. ""This resolution is in the interests not only of the parties, but of the home-buying public. All parties fully understand the important role the FHA program plays in helping middle-class Americans access home financing, and this resolution allows the parties to move ahead together with that mission and to ensure their future relationship.""

The deal also sends a message to all lenders that they will be held to the same regulatory requirements as traditional banks, said Lysa Davis. She has worked on settlement agreements for financial institutions in the past and is the founder of Community-Up, an anti-poverty nonprofit in Detroit.

""The fact that Quicken settled for millions and not billions is not that unusual,"" Davis said in an email. ""This is their first settlement agreement of this type. Quicken, like any other company, has learned from its mistakes over the years; I think it's a great organization — they make solid investments in urban cities across the country creating economic development opportunities and strengthening neighborhoods.""

The case was dismissed with prejudice — meaning it cannot be reinstated, according to an order filed Friday. The resolution comes under the leadership of the Housing and Urban Development Department, which oversees the FHA, within the administration of President Donald Trump. The government originally filed the lawsuit in 2015, the seventh year of the Obama administration.

The agreement will allow for the continuation of ""safe and sustainable mortgage financing to qualified, creditworthy borrowers,"" Amy Thompson, the Housing and Urban Development Department's secretary for public affairs, said in a statement.

“FHA relies on its partnerships with lenders, such as Quicken Loans, to advance home buying opportunities for Americans, and we look forward to continuing our relationship with Quicken Loans,"" she wrote.

The government alleged that Quicken had a culture of bending the rules and gave “speed bonuses” to underwriters. Federal lawyers contended the mortgage company failed to disclose the problems with the FHA-insured loans that cost the federal government millions of dollars when they went bad.

Quicken said it has represented the FHA’s “gold standard” for underwriters. Court documents filed by Quicken attorneys say the company could prove it had proper underwriting practices, complied with program and contractual requirements, and did not make false claims. It denied the existence of speed bonuses.

The lawsuit has not soured Quicken Loans from offering FHA loans or led it to make any significant operations changes, Emerson said.

""We have continued exactly to do the same thing as always,"" he said. ""It's always been our job to do the right thing to underwrite loans correctly. That's what we've done and continue to do.""

The Justice Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General began investigating Quicken under the False Claims Act. The investigation originally encompassed about 246,000 FHA loans Quicken had originated from mid-2007 through Dec. 31, 2011. The number of loans in question, however, had been reduced to 109 as of April.

The federal government’s lawsuit alleged Quicken employees regularly spoke of “fudging” a borrower’s income to get approval for FHA insurance. It included emails from company officials discussing the “bastard income” of borrowers. One email described how a customer was approved for a loan after he stopped paying other bills and his credit score dropped 100 points.

Rosen has presided at previous mediation sessions with the parties. He was the court's chief justice from 2009 to 2015, after President George H. W. Bush nominated him to the federal court bench in 1989. Rosen oversaw a number of high-profile cases during his tenure, and he led the mediation team that helped Detroit exit its record-setting municipal bankruptcy in just 18 months. After retiring from the bench, he opened a Detroit branch of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services.

Since the financial crisis, the Justice Department has reached settlements totaling billions of dollars with several major lenders, including the Bank of America Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., over poorly underwritten FHA loans. Pontiac-based United Shore Financial Services LLC in 2016 paid $48 million to resolve allegations of knowingly originating and underwriting loans that did not meet FHA requirements.

Quicken also had sued the government preemptively in 2015 after Justice Department officials requested ""nine-figure"" settlements, Gilbert has said. The company claimed the Justice Department unfairly targeted major lenders after the 2008 mortgage crisis. Goldsmith dismissed the suit. The Justice Department originally filed its case in Washington, D.C., but Quicken won its motion to move it to Detroit.

Columnist

The Trump administration presents a series of unanswerable moral riddles. What’s worse — President Trump’s outrageous acts? His gaslighting? His followers’ eagerness to join him in coverups and lies? All three were on display this week, as they have been pretty much every week since Jan 20, 2017.

First, the misconduct: Having claimed that he did not collude with Russia in 2016, Trump now proudly advertises his willingness to collude with any foreign government in the future. If a regime offered him useful information, he told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, “Oh, I think I’d want to hear it.”

“I would not have thought that I needed to say this,” responded Ellen L. Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission: “It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.”

Next came the gaslighting. Trump indignantly tweeted: “I meet and talk to ‘foreign governments’ every day. I just met with the Queen of England (U.K.), the Prince of Wales, the P.M. of the United Kingdom, the P.M. of Ireland, the President of France and the President of Poland. We talked about ‘Everything!’ Should I immediately call the FBI about these calls and meetings? How ridiculous! I would never be trusted again. With that being said, my full answer is rarely played by the Fake News Media. They purposely leave out the part that matters.”

Actually, the media didn’t leave out any part of his answer. It was the president who, in his ham-handed attempt at cleanup, left out the truth. Stephanopoulos wasn’t asking him whether, as president, it was proper for him to have diplomatic exchanges with foreign heads of state. He was asking whether Trump, as a candidate, would accept help from a foreign government. So Trump is, as usual, throwing out absurdities and falsehoods to distract from what he said and to give his followers — some cynical, others credulous — an excuse to claim that it was all fake news.

Trump’s trucklers did not disappoint. On Laura Ingraham’s Fox News show, Victor Davis Hanson of the Hoover Institution said the lesson was that “you shouldn’t ever talk to George Stephanopoulos,” and Ingraham was perturbed that someone (perhaps a 400-pound coach potato?) put Trump “in that situation — I don’t get it.” On “Fox & Friends,” co-host Ainsley Earhardt said it was ridiculous for Trump to report foreign assistance to the FBI: “What’s the FBI going to do?” Uh, stop the election interference?

A common trope among the Trumpkins was that criticism of their idol for making use of foreign election assistance was hypocritical because, as Sean Hannity argued: “Hillary Clinton literally empowered a foreign agent who produced a dossier for the Russian lies.” This whataboutism was echoed by the likes of Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who should be smart enough to know better.

In reality (remember that quaint concept?), there is nothing illegal or unethical about the Clinton campaign paying a U.S. research firm, Fusion GPS, which employed a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, who talked to actual Russians to probe Trump’s suspicious Russia links. Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee admitted as much: This is standard opposition research. It is not remotely equivalent to the Russian government helping Trump win. It’s actually similar to the Trump campaign hiring Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm. Moreover, Steele did go to the FBI — something that Trump boasts about never having done.

Few Republicans were willing to defend Trump’s egregious comments outright. Instead, they deflected and minimized. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made it sound as if the real problem was Democrats “trying to keep the 2016 election alive.” Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that this was not one of Trump’s “best statements” (please cite Trump’s best statement, Senator), but he praised Trump for his “refreshing habit of saying what he thinks.” I can think of many ways to describe the president bragging about breaking the law, but “refreshing” isn’t one of them. I suppose that’s one reason I’m not a Republican member of Congress.

The final indignity came when Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) led Republicans’ successful effort to block a bill sponsored by Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) to require campaigns to disclose any foreign offers of assistance to the FBI. This is of a piece with McConnell blocking a raft of other bills designed to defend U.S. elections from foreign interference. The most benign explanation is that Republicans are afraid of embarrassing Trump and incurring his wrath. The more sinister explanation is that they are secretly rooting for Russian help again in 2020. The two explanations are not, of course, incompatible. Either way, Republicans are putting partisan self-interest above the nation’s interest.

Beyond the issue of foreign election interference, this sordid episode shows how an utterly amoral president in league with power-hungry Republicans and the ratings-driven conservative media-industrial complex has hijacked U.S. politics. Considerations of truth, justice and the national interest are utterly alien to our new overlords. All that matters is “owning” the “libtards” — and enjoying the spoils of power.

DOD unveils plans for contractor cybersecurity standards,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Jackson Barnett'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.fedscoop.com/dod-cmmc-new-supply-chain-and-cybersecurity-rules/,"Written by Jackson Barnett

A Department of Defense official unveiled plans Thursday for contractor cybersecurity standards that are scheduled to be implemented by January 2020.

Katie Arrington, special assistant to the assistant secretary of Defense acquisition for cyber, made the announcement along with a plea for the private sector to work with the government to secure its supply chain at a Professional Services Council conference Thursday. The new standards will have a five-level system, and they will combine guidance currently in place from the National Institute of Standards and Technology with new input from the private sector and academia.

The standards, known as Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, will be researched and developed in partnership with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab and Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. Once in place, third-party private sector companies will audit contractors to ensure compliance. The program also will include an education and training center for cybersecurity.

The level of cybersecurity required by the standards will be indicated on all contract solicitations once implemented.

Defense officials have spoken of the need to develop new contractor cybersecurity standards for more than a year now. Earlier this year, DOD CIO Dana Deasy described how tier-one prime contractors aren’t the big concern.“It’s down when you get to the tier-three and the tier-four” subcontractors.”

“Where the issue breaks down is that as you go down to those various subcontractors, do they understand, [are they] equipped, have the knowledge and the capabilities to defend themselves, and what is it we should be doing more to help them learn how to defend themselves at those tiers?” Deasy said.

Arrington’s announcement was the first look into what to expect when the new standards are implemented. Similarly, in 2017, DOD introduced a regulation that requires all vendors who do business with the department to more safely guard “covered defense information” that is transmitted to or stored in their systems or networks for contracted work.

In addition to speaking about the new rules, Arrington stressed the need for collaboration between public and private sectors to ensure information security.

“It is not a ‘me’ thing, it is a ‘we’ thing,” Arrington said.

The “vast majority” of DOD contractors have ad hoc and inconsistent cybersecurity practices, Arrington said. Cybersecurity breaches and intellectual property theft of DOD data has led to the theft of high-grade weapon systems, such as the F-35.

“We should be infuriated about what has happened to our data,” she said.

Arrington will be embarking on a listening tour across the country to seek input from contractors for the cybersecurity rules. Arrington is a former South Carolina lawmaker and small business owner who contracted with the government — experiences she said will inform her work to help secure military data.

The greatest counterintelligence risk to the U.S. is not theft of government data, but private sector IP, said Joyce Corell, assistant director for supply chain and cyber at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s National Counterintelligence and Security Center. Governments, like China’s, and their efforts to steal U.S. IP have taken up the majority of the U.S. counterintelligence apparatus’s work, Corell said in a talk following Arrington’s.

New steps to secure the supply chain are critical to plugging the leaks of data. To do so, Corell pushed for cybersecurity to be baked-in across all parts of the supply chain for government contractors. In the past, Corell has pushed small businesses to increase their cybersecurity to work with the government.

Corell and Arrington both drove the message that cybersecurity is needed at all levels of the supply chain, at all levels of contracting and from the military to civilian agencies.

Supply chain security is “a team sport,” Corell said."

Feds gone wild: DOJ's stunning inability to prosecute its own bad actors,https://thehill.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/448383-feds-gone-wild-dojs-stunning-inability-to-prosecute-its-own-bad,"One was caught red-handed engaged in nepotism. Another, a lawyer no less, admitted to shoplifting at a Marine barracks store. A third leaked sealed court information to the news media. And a fourth engaged in fraud by turning a government garage into a personal repair shop.

Four cases, all solved in the past month, with suspects who cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars and significant breaches of public trust.

But these weren’t your everyday perps.

ADVERTISEMENT

All were U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) employees who are supposed to catch other criminals while working for the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. attorneys’ offices. Instead, they broke the law or violated the rules. And all managed to escape prosecution, despite their proven transgressions.

Recent Justice Department disciplinary files tell an undeniable story.

Under the leadership of Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s internal watchdog is doing an outstanding job of policing bad conduct inside America’s premier law enforcement agency.

And DOJ is doing a poor job of punishing its own.

In cases closed in the past month, more than a half-dozen FBI, DEA, U.S. attorney and U.S. marshal officials were allowed to retire, do volunteer work, or keep their jobs as they escaped criminal charges that everyday Americans probably would not.

In most instances, the decisions were made by federal prosecutors who work with the very figures impacted by or committing the bad conduct. In local law enforcement, that go-easy phenomenon is known as the “thin blue line.”

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and FBI did not respond to a request for comment.

The troubling pattern of weak punishment emerges as DOJ heads into one of its most ambitious internal affairs probes in recent history. Attorney General William Barr, Horowitz and special U.S. Attorney John Durham are investigating whether the FBI and other intelligence agencies violated the law with the Trump-Russia investigation.

Even before the recent spate of closed inspector general investigations, questions surfaced about DOJ’s willingness to punish its own. That’s because fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Andrew George McCabeMcCabe says it's 'absolutely' time to launch impeachment inquiry into Trump McCabe says it's 'absolutely' time to launch impeachment inquiry into Trump Feds gone wild: DOJ's stunning inability to prosecute its own bad actors MORE was recommended for prosecution more than 15 months ago for lying about news leaks, and so far has faced no criminal charges.

To put that into perspective, it took special counsel Robert Mueller just a few months to bring charges against multiple figures associated with President Trump’s campaign accused of lying or other process crimes.

It’s still possible that McCabe could face prosecution. But the recent spate of fresh wrongdoing inside DOJ doesn’t portray a compelling pattern of enforcement or punishment.

Take, for example, the DEA executive who just this week was found to have engaged in nepotism by routing hundreds of thousands of dollars to contractor jobs for his son and retired colleagues or friends.

Horowitz spared few words for the egregious scheme. “The senior DEA official wasted and misused hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer funds and engaged in misconduct when he took actions to get his son and former colleagues contractor positions and that his actions constituted misconduct in violation of federal ethics regulations, the DEA Standards of Conduct, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation,” he reported this week.

The official also engaged in a “lack of candor,” the investigative file showed.

Despite the established wrongdoing, criminal prosecution “was declined” and “the senior DEA official retired from his position.” In short, he kept his retirement benefits.

Likewise, the inspector general had harsh words for the FBI special agent in charge (SAC) who used the bureau’s official garage to perform repairs on his and other employees’ personal vehicles, calling it, among other things, a “dereliction of supervisory responsibility,” and a misuse of tax dollars for “private gain.”

“The SAC took advantage of the SAC’s official position for personal benefit by arranging to have the SAC’s personal vehicle repaired by an FBI employee in exchange for compensation, in violation of federal regulations regarding standards of conduct for federal employees and FBI policy,” the investigative file concluded. “The OIG also found that the SAC was derelict in the SAC’s supervisory responsibilities by allowing use of the FBI repair facility to conduct repairs and maintenance on personal vehicles belonging to FBI employees.”

And then there was the FBI lawyer who got caught in an embarrassing criminal act at the Marine Corps barracks (MCB) commissary in Quantico, Va.

“The FBI attorney admitted to placing numerous cosmetic items, valued at $257.99 and belonging to the MCB Quantico Exchange, into her purse without the intention to pay for them and did not pay for them before leaving the store. The FBI attorney further admitted that between February 2016 and her arrest in February 2018 she had shoplifted at the MCB Quantico Exchange one to two additional times, and at other private retailers in the area on two to three occasions,” the inspector general reported on May 14.

The investigation concluded her conduct violated federal criminal law and FBI policy regarding unprofessional conduct. But here was the outcome: “Criminal prosecution was deferred pending the FBI attorney’s completion of 125 hours of community service, after which all charges were dismissed.”

A few weeks of community service, and she was still in her job at the time the IG issued its report.

Two weeks ago, another DOJ official, an assistant U.S. attorney, escaped charges even after it was documented that he violated federal laws by possessing, transporting and consuming marijuana-laced edibles that he claimed he needed to treat back pain. He also was caught lying about his wrongdoing and 'fessed up only when his estranged wife threatened him during their divorce proceedings. Nonetheless, “criminal prosecution by federal and state authorities was declined,” the IG reported May 30.

One of the internal affairs cases that stunned members of Congress this month directly grew out of the interwoven Hillary Clinton email and Russia collusion investigations in 2016, during then-FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyUnder Trump, our democracy is for sale Sarah Sanders to leave White House Sarah Sanders to leave White House MORE’s tenure.

The IG concluded that an FBI deputy assistant director engaged in multiple improper news media leaks while those investigations were ongoing, including one that violated a sealed court order, and accepted an improper gratuity from the news media. But prosecution was declined, yet again. FBI officials say they are considering discipline against the supervisor.

Records I reviewed indicate that more misconduct eerily similar to that already uncovered is being investigated. For example, the IG fraud unit opened a case in March and began interviewing whistleblowers about a new contract fraud matter inside the DEA, emails show.

It used to be that those who were entrusted to enforce the law were held to the highest standards.

Today, however, there is a troubling pattern of officers being held to a lower standard inside a department where critics fear there is a dual system of justice.

"DHS chief reveals startling stat on asylum seekers who skip hearings, disappear",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-secretary-reveals-startling-stat-on-asylum-seekers-who-skip-hearings-disappear,"The acting Homeland Security secretary gave lawmakers a glimpse Tuesday into just how many asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the United States -- telling a Senate panel that a recent program found 90 percent miss their court dates.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan how many asylum seekers coming across the southern border show up for their hearings.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

“It depends on demographic, the court, but we see too many cases where people are not showing up,” he said, telling Graham that DHS recently conducted a pilot program with family units.

“Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent,” he said.

“90 percent did not show up?” Graham asked.

“Correct, that is a recent sample from families crossing the border,” McAleenan clarified.

McAleenan’s testimony also painted a grim portrait of a border crisis that shows no signs of easing, with Border Patrol overwhelmed and underfunded. The secretary described authorities as hamstrung by laws that limit how long they can keep migrants in custody.

“Currently due to a single district court order, we cannot obtain effective immigration enforcement results for the families arriving at our border -- they cannot be held for longer than 21 days and do not receive rulings from immigration courts for years,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it encountered 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a level not seen in decades, describing the situation as a “full-blown emergency.” McAleenan said that 60,000 children have entered into DHS custody in just the last 40 days.

McAleenan told lawmakers they also suffer due to “misaligned” asylum standards, meaning many of those who demonstrate “credible fear” of returning home -- the initial bar for claiming asylum -- are later judged not to have a valid asylum claim.

PELOSI HITS TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO, ACCUSES HIM OF 'THREATS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS'

He also said the restrictions on how long family units can be held mean that a child is now seen as a passport to the U.S. -- a perception he said is based in reality. He testified that only 30 percent of those coming to the border are actually trying to avoid being captured.

“Unless you’re a single adult, it is very unlikely you’ll be repatriated,” he said.

McAleenan urged Congress to act to end those loopholes and to grant requested DHS funding, and suggested that moves to make asylum seekers claim asylum in their home countries or designated third-countries could help solve the crisis.

Graham’s “Secure and Protect Act of 2019,” being discussed at the hearing, would include a provision to establish refugee processing centers in Mexico and Central America, and the senator asked the DHS chief if such an approach would work.

“First of all, it would break the back of the smuggling organizations, they’re profiting from this cycle.” McAleenan said. ""It would provide access to asylum in country in a much safer manner than taking this dangerous journey and it would stop this flow immediately.”

“I believe the vast majority [of the migrant flow] would stop,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that the administration bears some of the blame for the situation at the border, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointing to McAleenan's recent appointment as an example of dysfunction at the department.

“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department, we have before us an acting secretary who has been on the job for more than two months,"" he said. ""We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.”

McAleenan’s testimony comes amid continued negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico on immigration. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

An administration source told Fox News Tuesday that a new deal for Mexico becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers was completed, but not yet announced.

"House Panel Votes For Contempt For Barr, Ross As Justice Dept. Holds Back Documents",https://www.npr.org,['Philip Ewing'],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/12/732051545/justice-dept-cites-executive-privilege-in-keeping-census-documents-from-democrat,"House Panel Votes For Contempt For Barr, Ross As Justice Dept. Holds Back Documents

Updated at 5:53 p.m. ET

The separation-of-powers standoff between Congress and the executive branch deepened on Wednesday over a dispute about access to materials involving the controversial citizenship question planned for the 2020 census.

The Justice Department notified the House oversight committee that it's withholding documents sought by the panel's chairman because it says they're shielded by executive privilege — the doctrine that permits an administration to conceal some of its internal workings.

The letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd arrived electronically at the Capitol at the same time Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., had convened a hearing at which the committee debated whether to find Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress.

After a day's worth of discussion and amendments, it did, voting 24 to 15 by the late afternoon on contempt for the Cabinet officials.

Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., who has lately stepped up his criticism of Trump, broke with Republicans to support the measure.

The dispute over documents

Boyd's letter blamed Cummings for the administration's invocation of privilege.

The Justice Department has already provided tens of thousands of documents and access to witnesses but nothing is ever enough, officials say — and Democrats' threats of contempt meant these talks can't continue.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said after the Oversight Committee contempt vote made no sense.

""The committee's attempt to define the Department of Justice's good-faith cooperation as 'contempt' defies logic,"" she said. ""Today's action by Chairman Cummings and his committee undermines Congress's credibility with the American people.""

The Justice Department has provided Congress with tens of thousands of documents and access to witnesses on the census matter, Kupec said, over months of prior negotiations.

Cummings and the Democrats blame Barr, Ross and the administration for what they've called an effort to ""stonewall"" their investigation.

Critics argue that Trump's administration wants to use a question about citizenship on the 2020 census to suppress some responses, including those of Latinos, and Democrats say they want unredacted communications to see how the question was discussed inside the government.

""The census is critical to our democracy and our constituents,"" Cummings said. ""We must protect the integrity of the Census, and we must stand up for Congress' authority under the Constitution to conduct meaningful oversight.

The action in the committee on Wednesday followed a vote by the full House on Tuesday authorizing chairmen such as Cummings to file civil contempt lawsuits in order to try to obtain testimony or evidence.

That's what may happen now following the oversight committee session on Wednesday: Cummings, with the assent of the House leadership, could file suit and ask a judge to order Barr and Ross to provide the census materials he wants.

Republicans have criticized Democrats' litigation strategy as a waste of taxpayer dollars given the court costs involved and also as a dangerous road for the House. If members of Congress file suit but lose, Republicans warn, they could harm the oversight powers of the House over the long term."
USDA Corn Yield Estimate Still Too High,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/usda-corn-yield-estimate-still-too-high/,"It’s been a long, arduous planting season for farmers across the U.S. Many farmers are wondering what this will mean for yields, ending stocks and, consequentially, corn prices.

“I think the drop-dead week will be this week for planting,” Michael Cordonnier of Soybean and Corn Advisor, Inc., told AgriTalk Host Chip Flory. “If you plant your corn at this time in June you’ve probably got at least a 20% yield drag. If you go at the end of this week that could go up to 30% or 40%. This is very serious, and we won’t know the yields until later in summer.”

So far, the market isn’t reflecting the tough season.

“USDA’s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimate (WASDE) showed us down 3 million corn acres with a harvest estimate of 91.7%,” Cordonnier says. “I think a 90% harvest for grain is optimistic—it might be in the 88% to 89% and then lower yield. When you combine all these things, you’re going to get a much lower production number.”

Cordonnier estimates farmers will finish with 86 million corn acres planted, with 90% harvested for grain and a 165 bu./acre yield—putting total production at 12.8 million bu. His yield estimate is just slightly lower than USDA’s 166 bu./acre estimate.

With lower production and unchanged demand, the market could provide positive pricing opportunities.

“The burdensome corn carryout could be gone by the end of the summer,” Cordonnier says. “We’re going to need price rationing to ration the demand.”

South American farmers will be closely watching U.S. corn production, he notes.

“This is a corn story, primarily, in the U.S.,” says Cordonnier. “So, I do think corn acres will go up in South America, especially Argentina. They’re going to take out some soybeans to put in more corn.”"
More mercury in the fish we eat? Don’t let the EPA weaken water-quality rules,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Nate Tyler', 'Amy Grondin', 'Chris Wilke', 'Special To The Times']",06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/more-mercury-in-the-fish-we-eat-dont-let-the-epa-weaken-water-quality-rules/,"Puget Sound, the Columbia River, Lake Washington, the San Juan Islands, the Spokane River, Lake Chelan: Washington state is known for some of the most beautiful and iconic waterways in the country. Significant steps have been taken to recover these waters, each of which has a fish consumption advisory due to toxic pollution. So why would the Environmental Protection Agency move to dramatically weaken limits on three of the most dangerous and persistent chemicals — mercury, arsenic and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) — thus preventing us from moving forward with stronger controls that are essential protections for human health?

It’s a question to take to the EPA. In an agency decision dated May 10, the Trump administration revealed its next target in a nationwide assault on environmental regulation: Washington state waters. The agency signaled its intentions to revise or withdraw Washington water-quality standards. If this happens, current hard-won standards designed to protect local seafood consumers will be lost, and the amounts of toxics allowed in Washington’s waters could increase dramatically.

Gov. Jay Inslee, who has acted against Trump’s other environmental rollbacks, was quick to release a statement with Attorney General Bob Ferguson opposing the EPA decision. Ferguson then filed suit June 6 in an attempt to block the Trump administration’s misguided proposal.

While this proposed reversal raises environmental alarms, it will also make seafood we eat and the water we drink less safe. In dismantling an environmental standard known as “Fish Consumption Rule,” the agency would allow for up to 25 times more toxic chemicals like mercury, lead and cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. In the case of arsenic, it would perversely allow increased discharges of this dangerous toxic heavy metal in our waters because it is also “naturally occurring.” This move doesn’t merely raise questions about the administration’s concern for public health. It signals a blatant disregard for it.

Who is most vulnerable? Anyone who consumes locally caught fish. This applies especially to tribal communities, for whom fishing is critical not only for subsistence, but for ceremonial, religious and commercial purposes. Sharing and eating fish is an integral part of tribal culture and social fabric here in the Northwest, and it is well documented that tribal communities consume fish at a higher-than-average rate. Current water-quality standards restrict pollutants that are harmful to fish, and also take into account chemical bioaccumulation to protect the people who eat these foods. Previously, the EPA noted that tribes and Washington residents have a right not only to fish, but also to avoid exposure to unacceptable health risks when consuming local fish and seafood.

Before the current administration’s attempt at rolling back protective water-quality standards, the EPA stated its intent to protect people from cancer and other harmful effects that can arise from consuming polluted fish, shellfish and drinking water. However, most of our local waterways already have fish consumption advisories due to toxic pollution, warning people to limit their intake of certain species.

Toxic pollutants in Puget Sound waters severely impact the survival of our endangered southern resident orca population, as well as their primary prey — chinook salmon. Our southern resident orcas are considered to be among the most PCB-contaminated mammals in the world. Gov. Inslee has been very vocal about protecting orcas and calling for increased protections to reduce toxic contamination. Vigorously opposing EPA’s proposed rollbacks to the fish-consumption rule is an important way he can act to protect these beloved marine mammals that are a keystone species for our entire ecosystem.

This issue is critical to people and communities across the state. The Trump administration is poised to turn its back on Washington citizens and human health in order to line the pockets of corporate interests pushing for the action. We oppose the EPA push to repeal effective water-quality safeguards. We thank Gov. Inslee and state ecology director Maia Bellon for standing up and staying strong defending what is right: clean water for all."

"Kamala Harris: If elected, my DOJ would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-if-president-doj-would-have-no-choice-but-to-charge-trump,"2020 candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has issued a stunning warning to President Trump that seems to echo controversial recent comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying her Justice Department would likely charge him with obstruction of justice if she wins the White House.

Harris, in a newly released interview, said she believes the only reason former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. Once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges -- and Harris was emphatic in saying the DOJ should pursue them.

DEMS' LONG GAME? PELOSI RAISES PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING TRUMP ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said on this week’s NPR Politics Podcast.

The former California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney cited the importance of holding everyone accountable for their actions.

“I mean look, people might, you know, question why I became a prosecutor,” Harris said. “Well, I’ll tell you one of the reasons – I believe there should be accountability. Everyone should be held accountable, and the president is not above the law.”

Harris is not the first high-profile Democrat to suggest that not only should Congress pursue impeachment against Trump -- but he should face criminal charges once out of office.

Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly told colleagues last week: “I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.”

REP. WARREN DAVIDSON: PELOSI MENTIONED TRUMP IMPRISONMENT TO ‘KEEP IMPEACHMENT ZEALOTS IN LINE’

Trump reacted to this by calling Pelosi ""a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., however, had no problem with Pelosi's remarks.

""I don’t have any difficulty with those words,"" Cicilline told ""Fox News Sunday,"" comparing them to when then-candidate Trump inspired ""lock her up"" chants when he ran against Hillary Clinton. A 2018 New York Times report also said that Trump looked into prosecuting Clinton, as well as former FBI Director James Comey.

Joining the chorus of Democrats hinting that prosecuting Trump might be appropriate was another 2020 candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The progressive Democrat said recently that Trump would be ""carried out in handcuffs"" if he were anyone else, though she did not openly advocate charges against him.

Asked Wednesday if he would advocate Trump's prosecution, fellow candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said “no one is above the law” while leaving the question open.

“To be very blunt, if my attorney general at the Department of Justice finds that there is probable cause that a law has been broken by anyone, I expect him to hold the alleged offender accountable no matter who they are or what title they’ve held in the past,” he said. “I’m not going to be a president that undermines the independence of the DOJ or the judiciary in a way that I’ve seen this administration do.”

"T-Mobile, Sprint vow to fight state AGs if they get DOJ approval",https://www.foxbusiness.com,"['Lydia Moynihan', 'Charles Gasparino']",,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/t-mobile-sprint-vow-to-fight-state-ags-if-they-get-doj-approval,"T-Mobile US. Inc., and Sprint Corp., are prepared to fight the 10 state attorneys general suing to block their $26 billion merger if the U.S. Department of Justice approves the deal, FOX Business Network has learned.

Continue Reading Below

The coalition of state AGs led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California’s Xavier Beccera filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday to stop the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing the merger would reduce the number of major wireless carriers to three from four, and possibly lead to higher prices for consumers. The move briefly upended the negotiations between the companies and the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, which had been making progress toward a possible solution.

But on Wednesday, officials from T-Mobile and Sprint both resumed their consultation with the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, and importantly, developed a legal strategy to fight the state AG lawsuit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

That strategy is to proceed with attempting to convince the DOJ to approve the deal, and if that happens, fight what the companies believe is a long-shot attempt to block the merger by the states, these people said. The companies believe that even if a court issues an injunction to block the deal, the state case is weakened by the fact it was filed before the DOJ finished its discussions with the companies about their agreement to make further concessions to address antitrust concerns, they added.

Press officials from T-Mobile and Sprint had no comment. A DOJ spokesman also declined comment. A spokesman for the New York Attorney General had no immediate comment.

Even with the latest twist to hit the merger, officials at T-Mobile and Sprint believe a final decision from the DOJ’s Antitrust Division could come by next week.

In their negotiations with the DOJ, T-Mobile and Sprint have discussed concessions including selling wireless spectrum and additional businesses outside the Sprint’s Boost Mobile prepaid service. The companies agreed to sell Boost, build out their rural network, and not raise wireless prices for three years in order to receive approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the merger to proceed.

The state attorneys general ""saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued."" Peter Adderton, founder of Boost

The Trump administration has made the development of fifth-generation wireless networks, also known as 5G, both a national security and an economic objective. The development of such super-fast wireless networks are expected to be an economic boom, adding potentially hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product. The companies have also argued that a combined T-Mobile and Sprint will be better able to compete on price with wireless heavyweights AT&T and Verizon and gain ground in the area of 5G.

But DOJ staffers are eager to nix the merger on the grounds that fewer major carriers will lead to higher prices—the same argument made by the state AGs. They can be overruled by antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, who is said to be officially undecided but may be warming to the companies’ argument that the merger would not lead to high prices, particularly, after additional concessions are agreed upon.

Progress toward forming a set of concessions may be behind the state lawsuit, according to Boost founder Peter Adderton. The state AGs “saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued,” Adderton said Tuesday in an interview with FOX Business.

Another theory for the lawsuit is that the “states just got frustrated with the slowness of the process at DOJ,” said Craig Moffett of MoffetNathanson Research. “There’s a fair amount of pressure on DOJ to end this process,” he added.

An antitrust lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the state AGs' announcement may signal the DOJ is looking to approve the deal. “The state AGs want to get ahead of the DOJ decision… and undermine whatever action [the Department of] Justice is going to take."" However, a ruling with concessions could “take the wind out of the state AG’s sails,” this person told FOX Business.

Another possibility is the DOJ is looking to file its own suit and the state AGs want to deny the Trump administration a pro-consumer victory by launching their lawsuit first.

In filing their lawsuit, the attorneys general blindsided Delharim and his staff, which wasn’t notified of the filing, this person added. Officials at the DOJ’s Antitrust Division were recently in negotiations to appease the state attorneys general and prevent state legal action from taking place.

FOX Business has also learned that the AGs are attempting to recruit other states to create the strongest possible case that might find a sympathetic judge to block the deal, or delay it indefinitely through an injunction. “If the states win their injunction, it’s not a slam dunk but it could make the merger messy,” Moffett notes, adding that an injunction could prevent the deal from closing, forcing one or both of the parties to walk away.

Still, legal experts say the states face an uphill battle in looking to kill the merger if the DOJ approves it.

Not only do states have fewer resources than the feds, they also have a higher bar to meet to prove their case: They must show the merger would cause “irreparable harm” whereas the FCC’s “general interest” paradigm and the DOJ’s mandate to keep markets competitive are much broader and less restricting, experts say.

As the telecom deal continues to face opposition, some on Wall Street are looking at what may happen if the companies call it quits. In an unusual provision, T-Mobile is not required to pay Sprint the agreed upon $600 million break-up fee if Sprint’s debt doesn’t meet minimum credit ratings from the three major bond-rating services.

Sprint’s debt must have at least a “B-2” bond rating from Moody’s Investors Service, a “B” rating from S&P Global and “B-plus” from Fitch Ratings.

Sprint is the smallest of the major wireless carriers, and its finances are considered the most suspect contributing to a stock price that is just above penny-stock levels. Ironically, its shaky finances could help the deal gain approval; Delrahim told FOX Business in an April interview that he was considering the so-called “failing firm defense,” meaning he was weighing the argument made by company officials that if Sprint wasn’t purchased by T-Mobile it might fall into bankruptcy and the number of wireless carriers would be reduced."
VA’s new mission: expand services,https://www.wane.com,[],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.wane.com/news/local-news/vas-new-mission-expand-services/,"President Donald Trump signed the MISSION Act into law a year ago. Now, the Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA) is using that law to expand healthcare options for veterans.

The VA says the new law allows VA care providers to recommend veterans go to local hospitals to get the care they need sooner. If a VA care provider determines a veteran cannot be seen in less than 20 days for primary care or less than 28 days for specialty care, that provider can recommend veterans go to a local hospital.

“What the VA MISSION Act does is it allows veterans to have the care they need when they need it and where they need it,” said Heather Tarr, a supervisory health systems specialist for the VA. “It gives veterans greater access to care and greater options in where they go to receive that care.”

Some veterans are excited about their future healthcare with this law.

“I really like it because I’ve literally gotten in a skydiving accident before and instead of going somewhere local, I had to drive an hour and 40 minutes here to Fort Wayne for them to look at me and determine ‘yeah, it’s broken. We need to do this with it,'” said Justin Baker, a veteran who comes to Fort Wayne for healthcare but lives in South Bend. “So, I think it’s awesome.”

Local hospital groups in Fort Wayne told WANE 15 News they are excited about the expanding opportunities to give health care to veterans.

IU Health said in a statement to WANE 15 News, “We want to improve access to care for our veterans, so when we heard about the MISSION ACT, we wanted to be part of the initiative.”

Parkview Hospital has not responded to our request for comment.

Lutheran Health network said in a statement they “look forward to learning more about how the MISSION Act may provide even more access to those who have served our country so bravely.”

The VA is hosting a benefits fair on June 20th at the Parkview Mirro Center. The event runs from 10 in the morning to 7 at night. You can find more information about the benefits you’d be eligible for there and here."

Known as PFAS, the chemicals are linked with cancer and other health impacts and have contaminated water in at least 43 states. There's been mounting pressure on government officials to address the problem. The persistence in the environment and the human body has earned it the nickname of “forever chemicals.”

The EPA has said it will decide by the end of the year whether it will set drinking water standards for PFAS.

The amendment puts pressure on the agency to speed up that timeline, adopting a drinking water standard within two years for two specific types of PFAS.

The amendment provides an early glimpse at how Congress may address the chemicals this year.

The EPA currently recommends water have no more than 70 parts per trillion of PFAS. But many states, tired of waiting for standards from the federal government, have passed their own more stringent drinking water standards beyond what the EPA currently recommends.

Forcing the EPA to set a standard could prove controversial.

At a recent House hearing on PFAS, several Republicans said they were wary of getting ahead of agency scientists and recommending a specific response to the substance.

But Democrats argue the agency has been delaying action while the problem spreads.

TRUMP AND CLIMATE DENIERS: A Trump administration official consulted with advisers to a think tank skeptical of climate change to help challenge widely accepted scientific findings about global warming, according to emails obtained by The Associated Press.

William Happer, a member of the National Security Council, made the request to policy advisers with the Heartland Institute this March.

Happer and Heartland Institute adviser Hal Doiron discussed Happer’s scientific arguments in a paper attempting to knock down climate change as well as ideas to make the work “more useful to a wider readership” in a March 3 email exchange.

Happer also said he had discussed the work with another Heartland Institute adviser, Thomas Wysmuller, according to the emails obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request by the Environmental Defense Fund.

The National Security Council declined to comment on the emails.

Pushback: Jim Lakely, interim president of Heartland Institute, told The Hill that the government’s stances on climate change are not above question.

“As for Wysmuller and Doiron, they are unpaid policy advisors and friends of The Heartland Institute and have known Dr. Happer for many years,” he said.

“It would be hard to find a group of men with more qualifications or experience to criticize NASA’s alarmist public statements on the climate than Happer, Doiron, and Wysmuller.”

The Trump administration is reportedly considering creating a new panel headed by Happer to the question the broad scientific consensus that climate change is driven by human activity and is potentially dangerous.

DEMS DON’T LIKE PUERTO RICO DEAL: Democrats are pushing the Puerto Rican government to reject a debt resettlement deal with the island’s power company, arguing that it will increase Puerto Ricans’ electric bills and stymie development of renewable energy.

A May deal would address the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority’s (PREPA) $8 billion in debt, pushing the utility to charge customers more to pay off its creditors.

A letter signed by 36 Democrats late Thursday encourages Puerto Rico’s legislative leaders to oppose the deal, which would reduce the utility’s debt by about one-third but raise prices for its customers.

Puerto Ricans already pay almost double the national average for electricity — 22 cents per kilowatt hour compared to 12 cents nationally — and the new deal is expected to raise electric prices by about 20 percent.

“Higher electricity rates are detrimental to the local economy, causing businesses to operate with reduced profit margins, leaving them less able to expand and hire new employees. The new [deal] will accelerate the outmigration of businesses and residents, depleting what is left of Puerto Rico’s economic foundation,” the letter said.

Background: PREPA filed for bankruptcy in July of 2017, but the arrival of Hurricane Maria just months later compounded problems for the struggling utility. More than 1 million Puerto Ricans lost power during and after the storm, many remaining without electricity for months.

Beyond damage to the economy, lawmakers argue the deal backtracks on a pledge to generate more of Puerto Rico’s electricity through renewable sources.

"Trump ally ready to revoke president's emergency power on arms sales to Saudis, UAE",https://www.inforum.com,['Washington Post'],,,,https://www.inforum.com/news/world/article2603954.ece,"WASHINGTON - One of President Donald Trump's closest congressional allies is ready to strip him of certain emergency powers in response to the administration sidestepping lawmakers to secure 22 arms sales benefiting Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

""Do away with the emergency exception,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Wednesday. Doing so, he added, would prevent the executive branch from repeating such a move in the future. ""I would not have agreed to that before, but after this maneuver by the administration, count me in.""

Graham is one of several leading lawmakers conferring over how to change the rules governing congressional oversight of arms sales to prevent end-runs around Congress, after Democrats and Republicans objected to the administration citing an unspecific threat from Iran to expedite more than $8 billion worth of weapons sales.

""We're talking about a more permanent fix, so we can't have it this way again,"" Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said.

Next week, Menendez, Graham, and others are expected to ask for a vote on 22 disapproval resolutions aimed at blocking the sales, and a bipartisan majority of senators is expected to support that effort. House Democrats also are expected to pursue a package of disapproval resolutions intended to stymie the deals.

listen live watch live

But with Republican Senate leaders committed to oppose the resolutions, it will be difficult to overcome a presidential veto.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James Risch, R-Idaho, who has not supported efforts to block the resolutions, said this week that it would be best if the House, Senate, State Department and the White House could agree on legislation to address the arms sales.

But lawmakers and State Department officials remain at odds over the deals' legitimacy, and there were no signs of common ground Wednesday as the House Foreign Affairs Committee grilled one of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's top deputies about the emergency declaration.

Panel chairman Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., began the hearing with R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, by accusing the administration of creating a ""phony"" emergency to justify the sales.

""Here's the reality: there is no emergency,"" Engel said. ""It's made up. And it's an abuse of the law.""

Cooper argued that the declaration had been prompted by a ""significant increase"" in threats from Iran, coupled with ""the clear, provocative, damaging actions taken by Iran's government.""

But Democrats were not having it - and Republicans were clearly uncomfortable with having been circumvented as well.

""The recent use of this emergency authority, in my judgment, was unfortunate,"" said the panel's ranking member, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, adding: ""Consulting with Congress is always the better route.""

Democrats and Republicans are frustrated by Trump's continued embrace of Saudi leaders in the face of congressional efforts to distance the United States from Yemen's civil war and impose sanctions in response to its leaders' role in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributing columnist who was slain in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October.

House Democrats grilled Cooper Wednesday about whether the president or his son-in-law, Jared Kushner - who has a close relationship with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman - had played a role in the emergency declaration, or hashing out the terms of the arms deals ahead of time. Cooper denied that Kushner had.

They also questioned why Pompeo had not briefed lawmakers on his plans, pointing out that the secretary had briefed all senators and House members about Iran just three days before the emergency declaration.

""Which came first, the arms sales, or the threat?"" Engel asked Cooper, noting that acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan told lawmakers during the May 21 briefings that the threat from Iran had spiked, but was in decline.

Cooper refused to detail in a public setting any of the individual deals, leaving Democrats to question whether the administration was expediting the sale of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia to arm it for a regional war or an escalation of its military campaign in Yemen.

They challenged Cooper's assertion that giving Saudi Arabia more precision-guided weapons would help them avoid civilian casualties in Yemen, pointing out that such weapons seemingly had been used to target schools and hospitals.

McCaul, the panel's top Republican, joined Democrats in questioning how critical the emergency could be if it would take months or years to complete certain weapons deals.

"Keep Landsat data free, panel urges Department of the Interior",https://www.sciencemag.org,['Paul Voosen'],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/keep-landsat-data-free-panel-urges-interior-department,"Keep Landsat data free, panel urges Department of the Interior

A federal advisory panel today called on the Department of the Interior (DOI) to keep access to the imagery from its long-running Landsat satellite program free and open. Any effort to collect fees for such data would generate little money and would actively damage the U.S. remote sensing industry, the panel said in a report.

The Landsat program, which began in 1972 and is managed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has produced the world’s longest-running series of satellite images, documenting the vast global changes caused by humanity over the past 47 years. Two Landsat satellites are now in orbit, taking 1200 images a day at a 30-meter resolution. In 2008, USGS stopped charging for use of Landsat images, creating a surge of academic research, along with users in government and industry. The move created about $2 billion in annual economic benefits, according to estimates from earlier this decade. The Landsat annual budget, meanwhile, is about $80 million.

In 2017, DOI asked its National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC) to evaluate the possibility of once again imposing charges for using Landsat data, among other approaches to raising revenue. The move, when reported last year, was met with an outcry from scientists in the United States and abroad, along with federal and state agencies and nonprofits running a diverse range from the Wyoming state engineer to the Global Forest Observations Initiative. “The community was very vocal regarding the value of a free and open data policy,” said Frank Avila, a remote-sensing scientist at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in Springfield, Virginia, who leads the NGAC subcommittee that authored the report approved today.

The NGAC report echoes those sentiments, according to a presentation by Kevin Pomfret, a lawyer at Williams Mullen in Tysons, Virginia, who led the NGAC study and specializes in remote sensing. An effort to charge for Landsat data would largely drive users to free alternatives offered by the Europeans, while still costing the government a significant sum to run. The net result would be a drain on the U.S. economy, the study said. “Charging a fee for Landsat data will result in negative economic impacts,” Pomfret said at the meeting, and “would not be worth the economic, legal, societal, or political costs.”

The report also explores whether USGS, which runs Landsat, might instead keep the core Landsat data free, while charging for “value-added” imagery or specialized tasks carried out by the satellites. Such a move might raise revenue, the report says, but it could also require substantial regulatory or legal changes. Similarly, money could potentially be saved by hiring a contractor who could more efficiently manage digital access to the Landsat data, but USGS must study this idea more closely.

If DOI is concerned about the cost of the Landsat program, the report concludes, it would be better served by looking at how to reduce the cost of the satellites themselves, rather than attempting to reap revenue from their data. Although the next Landsat satellite, the ninth in the series, is set for a launch in December 2020, USGS and its partners, including NASA, are mulling what the future of the program should look like, especially given the rise of competitors such as the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellites and commercial constellations like Planet. A study on the program’s future architecture is due later this year.

Although the NGAC report was approved unanimously by the panel’s members and will be available online this week, it is ultimately up to DOI to decide whether it will go through with any fees, says Timothy Newman, program coordinator for national land imaging at USGS. But given the report and the nearly universal negative reaction to charging fees, he says, “The reality is that I just don’t see it happening.”"
DOJ antitrust chief warns Big Tech that low prices or free products won't protect them,https://www.foxnews.com,['Christopher Carbone'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/doj-antitrust-big-tech-low-prices-free-products-wont-protect,"The Justice Department's assistant attorney general highlighted the antitrust case against Silicon Valley's major players during a Tuesday speech.

Makan Delrahim described a range of possible arguments against tech companies as his office takes the lead in probing Google and, possibly, Apple. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission is overseeing inquiries into possible antitrust practices of Facebook and Amazon.

After discussing the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911, the 1982 dissolution of AT&T into the ""Baby Bells"" and the government's successful monopoly case against Microsoft in 2001 – which arguably helped lay the foundation for the success of Google and Yahoo – Delrahim explained several arguments that could be made against the world's most powerful tech companies on antitrust grounds.

Offering Low Prices or Free Services

Critics have pointed out Amazon's undeniable power in the area of American e-commerce and its foray into the world of bricks-and-mortar retail, but the company's defenders note the consistently low prices it offers on a gigantic array of consumer goods. In addition, Facebook and Google offer a multitude of services for free.

WHY IS NANCY PELOSI IGNORING FACEBOOK CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG?

But Delrahim said the Justice Department takes a much broader view.

""The Antitrust Division does not take a myopic view of competition. Many recent calls for antitrust reform, or more radical change, are premised on the incorrect notion that antitrust policy is only concerned with keeping prices low,"" he said in his speech at the Antitrust New Frontiers Conference. ""It is well-settled, however, that competition has price and non-price dimensions.""

Besides price, ""diminished quality"" is a factor the Justice Department would consider.

""As an example, privacy can be an important dimension of quality. By protecting competition, we can have an impact on privacy and data protection. Moreover, two companies can compete to expand privacy protections for products or services, or for greater openness and free speech on platforms,"" Delrahim said.

Exclusive Agreements

Delrahim said the Antitrust Division has a history of investigating ""exclusive conduct"" under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.

""[Exclusivity agreements] also can be anticompetitive, however, where a dominant firm uses exclusive dealing to prevent entry or diminish the ability of rivals to achieve necessary scale, thereby substantially foreclosing competition,"" he said. ""This is true in digital markets as well.""

SOCIAL MEDIA CONTRIBUTES TO RADICALIZATION, TOP TWITTER EXEC SAYS

The Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft focused in part on that company's inclusion of its own browser in its Windows operating system, which the federal agency found discouraged users from seeking alternatives.

“This theory is broadly applicable to other technology markets,” Delrahim added.

CREEPY DEEPFAKE AI LETS YOU PUT WORDS INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S MOUTH

Swallowing Up Competitors

Facebook and Google have gobbled up hundreds of other companies – some of them former competitors – over the last two decades. Delrahim indicated that this type of behavior could be considered anticompetitive.

“It is not possible to describe here each way that a transaction may harm competition in a digital market, but I will note the potential for mischief if the purpose and effect of an acquisition is to block potential competitors, protect a monopoly, or otherwise harm competition by reducing consumer choice, increasing prices, diminishing or slowing innovation, or reducing quality,"" he said. ""Such circumstances may raise the Antitrust Division’s suspicions.”

According to The New York Times, Google has acquired at least 270 companies over nearly two decades, including YouTube, which was a competitor to Google Video; Waze, which competed with Google Maps; and DoubleClick, which had been the tech giant's chief advertising competitor.

Facebook has acquired 92 companies since 2007, including Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The Menlo Park, Calif. based company also bought and shut down other social networks, including Gowalla, Beluga and Nextstop, the Times reports.

AMAZON'S SECOND NEW YORK GO STORE SERVES COFFEE, ACCEPTS CASH

Still, Delrahim said that acquisitions can be positive if they ""combine complementary technologies or bring products and services to market that would not have been made available to consumers otherwise.""

Although these investigations may take years to complete, Delrahim made it clear that the Justice Department is taking a serious look at Silicon Valley's main players.

""While antitrust is not a panacea for every policy challenge presented by the digital market, the Antitrust Division will not shrink from the critical work of investigating and challenging anticompetitive conduct and transactions where justified,"" he said. ""That is because where competition is harmed, consumers and markets lose with higher prices, lower quality, lower rate of innovation, less free speech and even lower privacy protections.""

"DOJ slams latest committee contempt vote, warns of retaliation",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/11/doj-slams-latest-committee-contempt-vote/,"The Justice Department warned Tuesday that it could retaliate against the House Oversight Committee should the panel vote this week to pursue contempt of Congress proceedings against Attorney General William P. Barr, saying it would sour what cooperation there has been.

Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd said the department has turned over thousands of pages of documents to the Oversight Committee but Chairman Elijah Cummings‘ quick trigger finger on the contempt vote is ruining that.

“Should the committee take the unnecessary and counterproductive step of proceeding with a contempt vote, the department will be forced to reevaluate its current production efforts in ongoing matters,” Mr. Boyd wrote.

He also warned that Mr. Cummings‘ vote won’t end up getting the congressman what he wants.

If the committee does pursue contempt, President Trump will assert a protective executive privilege over the documents Mr. Cummings is trying to get. That would effectively shield them all, while government lawyers look them over, Mr. Boyd suggested.

Mr. Cummings, in a reply letter Tuesday, said Republicans were making demands and issuing threats without offering any accommodations or promises that they will turn over documents if the committee delays its action.

“The committee cannot accept these terms,” he said. “The committee has a responsibility under the Constitution to conduct rigorous oversight of the census, and we will not continue to delay our efforts due to your ongoing obstruction.”

Mr. Cummings suspects shenanigans behind the move to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census — a contention several federal judges have backed up with their findings in several court cases.

The legality of the citizenship question is now pending before the Supreme Court.

Republicans argue Mr. Cummings is trying to sway the justices by orchestrating the contempt vote.

Mr. Boyd said that when Congress demands documents from the administration there is supposed to be an accommodation, where both sides work through privileges and other issues that arise.

He said that didn’t happen in this case.

In particular, he said, Mr. Cummings refused to allow a Justice Department lawyer to attend a deposition of a top department official — leading Mr. Barr to order the official not to testify.

The department released a legal opinion last month justifying Mr. Barr’s stance, saying the Obama administration held the same position.

When Mnuchin rejected Neal's request, he said he did so upon the advice of DOJ, and that the Justice Department would publish a legal opinion with its advice.

What's next? Both Mnuchin and Neal have said they expect the tax-return issue to end up in the courts.

The Hill's Naomi Jagoda breaks down the DOJ's reasoning here.

LEADING THE DAY

Centrist Democrats raise concerns over $15 minimum wage push: House Democrats are moving forward with legislation that would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, despite concerns from centrist lawmakers about the impact on lower-cost areas.

Democratic leaders say they're close to clinching the 218 votes needed to pass the bill, which they expect to bring to the floor in July.

Raising the minimum wage has been a staple of Democratic policy for years. But Congress has only voted twice in the past two decades to increase the minimum wage, and it has been stagnant at its current rate since 2009.

That might change soon.

All but 29 of the 235 House Democrats have cosponsored the measure, arguing it is key to helping workers and reducing poverty, while also lowering dependence on government welfare programs.

Other Democrats aren't sold. Many of the holdouts are moderates who are concerned that a significant wage boost in a short period of time could have an unintended effect in more rural settings. They argue that in a country as economically diverse as the United States, an across-the-board base wage doesn't make sense.

Reactions:

Trump bashes Powell, says he's 'waited long enough' for rate cut: President Trump escalated his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in an interview that aired Friday, saying he's ""waited long enough"" for the Fed to cut interest rates.

In an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos George Robert StephanopoulosOn The Money: DOJ offers legal opinion backing refusal to release Trump tax returns | Centrist Democrats raise concerns over minimum wage | Trump bashes Powell ahead of crucial Fed meeting | Design leaks for Harriet Tubman bill On The Money: DOJ offers legal opinion backing refusal to release Trump tax returns | Centrist Democrats raise concerns over minimum wage | Trump bashes Powell ahead of crucial Fed meeting | Design leaks for Harriet Tubman bill Trump's March internal polling showed him far behind Biden in battleground states: ABC MORE, filmed Tuesday, the president again accused Powell of holding back the economy from its full potential through interest rate hikes and bond sales meant to stave off inflation.

""He's my pick,"" Trump said. ""And I disagree with him entirely.""

Trump argued that the U.S. economy and stock market would have grown faster ""if we had a different person in the Federal Reserve that wouldn't have raised interest rates so much.""

""It's OK to raise interest rates a little bit,"" Trump said. ""But so much ... it would have been even better.""

Crucial moment: Powell has brushed off Trump's criticism, insisting that politics play no role in the Fed's decisionmaking. But the president's latest attack intensifies the spotlight on the Fed as it weighs whether to cut interest rates.

Fed officials have expressed concern over the persistence of inflation below the central bank's 2 percent target and the rising costs of Trump's trade battles with China, the European Union, Mexico, Canada and Japan.

Powell said last week that the Fed ""will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion"" as inflation remains low and the economy faces headwinds abroad. Analysts and investors saw Powell's comments as a nod to an impending rate cut following months of the chairman stressing the bank's ""patient"" approach to moving rates.

What comes next: The Fed's policymaking arm, the Federal Open Markets Committee, will meet Tuesday and Wednesday for its monthly huddle. While the Fed is not expected to cut rates next week, Powell's press conference and the committee's statement may shed light on the central bank's next moves.

Design leaks for Harriet Tubman $20 bill after Mnuchin announces delay: The preliminary design for an updated $20 bill featuring Harriet Tubman was revealed by The New York Times on Friday, after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced last month that a redesign will be delayed until 2028.

The design was reportedly completed in late 2016. The Obama administration had set a 2020 deadline for finishing the design before Mnuchin pushed that deadline back.

A spokeswoman for the bureau, Lydia Washington, confirmed to the Times that preliminary designs of the new note were created as part of research that was done on orders from former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew.
