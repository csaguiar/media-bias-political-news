'I am Antifa' professor who posted desire to hit Trump with bat resigns from post,https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/iowa-professor-antifa-resigns-bash-trump-baseball-bat,"A college professor in Iowa who declared his support for the far-left Antifa movement and came under fire for a social media post in which he expressed a desire to hit President Trump with a bat is no longer in his post.

Jeff Klinzman, an adjunct English professor at Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids, resigned on Tuesday. The school said in a statement it accepted his resignation and has an instructor who will teach Klinzman's one course this semester. The decision to name a new instructor for Klinzman's course was based on securing a safe learning environment for students and staff, not on the professor's politics or his right to express his views, the statement said.

IOWA PROF SAYS 'I AM ANTIFA'; ONCE POSTED DESIRE TO BASH TRUMP WITH BASEBALL BAT

A local TV station, which found numerous posts believed to have been written by the professor both on his personal page and on an “Iowa Antifa” page, asked Klinzman last week about his social media activity.

“I affirm that I am Antifa,” Klinzman told local ABC affiliate KCRG-TV. He stood behind his comments. Some comments were inflammatory to Evangelical Christians and he said he was willing to apologize to any Christians offended by them.

The outlet reported that in one post, Klinzman shared a poem containing the words, “Kill them all and bury them deep in the ground,” to which he added the comment, “It’s not pretty, and I’m not proud, but seeing what evangelical Christians are doing to this country and its people fills me with rage, and a desire to exact revenge.”

The professor was also an active participant in a local Antifa group on Facebook, according to KCRG, where he reportedly made the comment about attacking Trump.

In a July 27 tweet, President Trump wrote: “Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA, the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others). Would make it easier for police to do their job!”

“Yeah, I know who I’d clock with a bat…” Klinzman wrote on the local Antifa Facebook page in reference to the president’s message.

Antifa, which is short for anti-fascist, has been facing scrutiny and calls to be labeled as a domestic terrorist organization, particularly after a series of violent incidents in Portland, Ore. Masked Antifa demonstrators allegedly beat up conservative blogger Andy Ngo at a June 29 rally that drew national attention to this small, liberal city.

More than two dozen local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI and the Federal Protective Service, were active in Portland earlier this month to help police monitor dueling protests between right-wing demonstrators and Antifa.

President Trump is so eager to complete hundreds of miles of border fence ahead of the 2020 presidential election that he has directed aides to fast-track billions of dollars’ worth of construction contracts, aggressively seize private land and disregard environmental rules, according to current and former officials involved with the project.

He also has told worried subordinates that he will pardon them of any potential wrongdoing should they have to break laws to get the barriers built quickly, those officials said.

Trump has repeatedly promised to complete 500 miles of fencing by the time voters go to the polls in November 2020, stirring chants of “Finish the Wall!” at his political rallies as he pushes for tighter border controls. But the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed just about 60 miles of “replacement” barrier during the first 2½ years of Trump’s presidency, all of it in areas that previously had border infrastructure.

The president has told senior aides that a failure to deliver on the signature promise of his 2016 campaign would be a letdown to his supporters and an embarrassing defeat. With the election 14 months away and hundreds of miles of fencing plans still in blueprint form, Trump has held regular White House meetings for progress updates and to hasten the pace, according to several people involved in the discussions.

When aides have suggested that some orders are illegal or unworkable, Trump has suggested he would pardon the officials if they would just go ahead, aides said. He has waved off worries about contracting procedures and the use of eminent domain, saying “take the land,” according to officials who attended the meetings.

“Don’t worry, I’ll pardon you,” he has told officials in meetings about the wall.

“He said people expected him to build a wall, and it had to be done by the election,” one former official said.

Asked for comment, a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Trump is joking when he makes such statements about pardons.

Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said Tuesday that the president is protecting the country with the addition of new border barriers.

“Donald Trump promised to secure our border with sane, rational immigration policies to make American communities safer, and that’s happening everywhere the wall is being built,” Gidley said. He called internal criticisms of the president “just more fabrications by people who hate the fact the status quo, that has crippled this country for decades, is finally changing as President Trump is moving quicker than anyone in history to build the wall, secure the border and enact the very immigration policies the American people voted for.”

“President Trump is fighting aggressively for the American people where other leaders in the past have rolled over, sold out, and done absolutely nothing,” he said.

Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper is expected to approve a White House request to divert $3.6 billion in Pentagon funds to the barrier project in coming weeks, money that Trump sought after lawmakers refused to allocate $5 billion. The funds will be pulled from Defense Department projects in 26 states, according to administration officials who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the matter.

Trump’s determination to build the barriers as quickly as possible has not diminished his interest in the aesthetic aspects of the project, particularly the requirement that the looming steel barriers be painted black and topped with sharpened tips.

In a meeting at the White House on May 23, Trump ordered the Army Corps and the Department of Homeland Security to paint the structure black, according to internal communications reviewed by The Washington Post.

Administration officials have stopped trying to talk him out of the demands, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is preparing to instruct contractors to apply black paint or coating to all new barrier fencing, the communications show.

Trump conceded last year in an immigration meeting with lawmakers that a wall or barrier is not the most effective mechanism to curb illegal immigration, recognizing it would accomplish less than a major expansion of U.S. enforcement powers and deportation authority. But he told lawmakers that his supporters want a wall and that he has to deliver it.

Trump talked about the loud cheers the wall brought at rallies, according to one person with direct knowledge of the meeting.

Former White House chief of staff John F. Kelly would often tell administration officials to disregard the president’s demands if Kelly did not think they were feasible or legally sound, according to current and former aides.

During a conference call last week, officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Army Corps engineers that the hundreds of miles of fencing must be completed before the next presidential election, according to administration officials with knowledge of the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal communications.

“Border Patrol insists on compressed acquisition timelines, and we consent. Their goal is to get contracts awarded, not for us to get a quality contract with a thoroughly vetted contractor,” said one senior official who is concerned the agency has been hurried to hand out contracts as quickly as possible.

Military officials expect more contract protests because the arrangements have been rushed, the official added. The Army Corps already has had to take corrective actions for two procurement contracts, after companies protested.

The companies building the fencing and access roads have been taking heavy earth-moving equipment into environmentally sensitive border areas adjacent to U.S. national parks and wildlife preserves, but the administration has waived procedural safeguards and impact studies, citing national security concerns.

“They don’t care how much money is spent, whether landowners’ rights are violated, whether the environment is damaged, the law, the regs or even prudent business practices,” the senior official said.

CBP has suggested no longer writing risk-assessment memos “related to the fact that we don’t have real estate rights and how this will impact construction,” the official said.

While Trump has insisted that the barriers be painted, the cost of painting them will reduce the length of the fence the government will be able to build. According to the internal analysis, painting or coating 175 miles of barriers “will add between $70 million and $133 million in cost,” trimming the amount of fencing the Army Corps will be able to install by four to seven miles.

In June, teams of U.S. soldiers painted a one-mile section of fence in Calexico, Calif., at a cost of $1 million. The coating, known as “matte black” or “flat black,” absorbs heat, making the fence hot to the touch, more slippery and therefore tougher to climb, according to border agents.

At Trump’s behest, the Army Corps also is preparing to instruct contractors to remove from the upper part of the fence the smooth metal plates that are used to thwart climbers. The president considered that design feature unsightly, according to officials familiar with his directives.

Instead, contractors have been asked to cut the tips of the steel bollards to a sharpened point. Trump had told aides this spring he thought the barrier should be spiked to instill a fear of injury.

The change in the bollard design is likely to reduce the overall length of the barrier by two to three miles, according to the administration’s cost assessments.

CBP has used a pointed design in the past, according to agency officials, either by installing a pyramid-shaped cap or making what the agency refers to as a “miter cut” in the metal.

Trump remains keen to tout incremental progress toward his wall-building commitments, and in recent weeks, top Homeland Security officials have taken to Twitter to promote the advances.

In recent days, DHS leaders including acting CBP chief Mark Morgan and the top official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, have tweeted photos of border fence construction, echoing promises that 450 miles of new barrier will be completed by next year. Another senior administration official credited both men with injecting urgency, saying that “things are starting to crank away,” even though Cuccinelli’s agency is not involved in the project.

Dan Scavino Jr., the White House social media director, has asked for video footage and photos of equipment digging up the desert and planting the barriers so that administration officials can tweet about it, aides said.

Administration officials involved in the project also defended the president’s use of eminent domain laws to speed the process.

“There is no more constitutionally permissible public purpose for eminent domain than national defense,” said a current administration official who was not authorized to speak on the record about the contracting process.

“Our intention is to negotiate with every property owner, and every property owner will receive fair market value for the land,” the official said. “But the land that is needed is not replaceable land. This is not like building a hospital or even a school. There is no alternative land to the border.”

CBP and Pentagon officials insist they remain on track to complete about 450 miles of fencing by the election. Of that, about 110 miles will be added to areas where there is currently no barrier. The height of the structure will vary between 18 and 30 feet, high enough to inflict severe injury or death from a fall.

The Border Patrol’s strategic planning and analysis office has not made a final decision on the black paint or other White House design requests .

“Ultimately, we’ll do our assessment and determine what is the best for us operationally,” said Brian Martin, the office’s chief, adding that the agency is waiting to get border agents’ feedback on whether the coating would be beneficial.

Martin also said CBP would continue to install anti-climb panels on portions of the barrier already under contract, calling the design “very vital to overall effectiveness.” But he and other CBP officials said that some new portions of barriers will have the panels and that others will not, a determination that he said will be guided by necessity, not aesthetics.

Trump has recently urged the Army Corps to award a contract to a company he favors, North Dakota-based Fisher Industries, though the firm has not been selected. Fisher has been aggressively pushed by Trump ally Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who briefly held up the confirmation of a Trump budget office nominee last month in an attempt to put pressure on the Army Corps.

Cramer demanded to see the contracts awarded to Fisher’s competitors, lashing out at the “arrogance” of the Army Corps in emails to military officials after he was told the bidding process involved proprietary information that could not be shared. The CEO of Fisher Industries is a major backer of Cramer and has donated to his campaigns.

[These photos show private border barriers being built on private land]

Cramer visited the El Paso area Tuesday to tour border facilities and view a span of privately funded border fencing Fisher built as a showcase for what it claims are superior construction techniques. Cramer posted videos of his tour to social media. He undertook the tour “to see the crisis at our border firsthand.”

The senator had asked Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the commander of the Army Corps, to meet him at the site, but Semonite is traveling in Brazil, where the Trump administration has offered to help fight wildfires in the Amazon.

In an email to The Post, Cramer said he met with CEO Tommy Fisher on Tuesday at a span of fencing the company built on private land; he said Army Corps officials joined them at the site.

“The agents on the ground said the walls have been very helpful in slowing illegal crossings,” Cramer wrote. “I’m not a wall-building expert, but at the pace of the last few years, it’s hard to see how 450 miles gets built with the same process. . . . I wish DHS would engage a whole bunch of builders and innovators rather than rely on the same decades old bureaucracy.”

Cramer said he shared the president’s “frustration” with the pace of progress.

Several administration officials who confirmed the White House’s urgency said they expect to be able to deliver on Trump’s demands because the actual construction of the barriers is typically the last step in the process.

“There is a long lead time to acquiring land, getting permits and identifying funding,” the official said. “I think you will see a dramatic increase in wall construction next year because all of the work over the past two years has primed the pump.”"
"Trump mocks NYT's Bret Stephens: My resort doesn't have 'bedbugs,' but he's 'loaded up with them!'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-nyt-bret-stephens,"President Trump slammed New York Times columnist Bret Stephens on Tuesday night, suggesting he's ""loaded up"" with bedbugs — not his properties.

After the president floated the idea of hosting next year's G-7 summit at his Doral resort outside of Miami, Fla., a report resurfaced that this resort had settled a lawsuit in 2017 after a New Jersey man named Eric Linder alleged he woke up one morning at Trump's property with bites all over his body.

Trump denied of having any bedbugs at his resort Tuesday morning, blaming ""Radical Left Democrats"" for spreading ""nasty rumors.""

However, the president took the opportunity on Tuesday night to repeat his denial about the alleged bedbug problem and hit one of his outspoken critics from the Times.

NEW YORK TIMES NEWSROOM HIT WITH BED BUG INFESTATION: REPORT

""A made up Radical Left Story about Doral bedbugs, but Bret Stephens is loaded up with them!"" Trump tweeted. ""Been calling me wrong for years, along with the few remaining Never Trumpers - All Losers!""

The op-ed columnist had been widely mocked after he responded to a Twitter user who jokingly referred to him as a bed bug in reaction to reports of a pest infestation at the Times newsroom.

""The bedbugs are a metaphor. The bedbugs are Bret Stephens,"" George Washington University associate professor Dave Karpf quipped.

This tweet apparently angered Stephens enough for him to email both Karpf and the GWU provost, which Karpf shared on Twitter Monday night.

""Someone just pointed out a tweet you wrote about me, calling me a 'bedbug,'"" Stephens began the email. ""I'm often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people – people they've never met – on Twitter. I think you've set a new standard.""

The Times columnist went on to invite Karpf to his home, meet his wife and children, and then ""call me 'bedbug' to my face.""

""That would take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your part,"" Stephens told the college professor. ""I promise to be courteous no matter what you have to say. Maybe it will make you feel better about yourself.""

Stephens has since deactivated his Twitter account."

"Yes, you can still visit Bob Dole's 1996 campaign website. Here is its story.",https://mashable.com,['Matt Binder'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://mashable.com/article/bob-dole-1996-website/,"Welcome to Dial Up, Mashable’s most excellent look at technology in the '90s, from the early days of the World Wide Web to the clunky gadgets that won our hearts.

It’s Oct. 6, 1996. The night of the first presidential debate between President Bill Clinton and the Republican nominee, Bob Dole. Clinton is the young, popular incumbent who played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show. Dole is a stiff conservative, who at 73 years old looks like he yells at kids to get off his lawn.

But as the debate ends, right after he warns young people against doing drugs, Dole pulls off a first for a presidential candidate in the new internet era: he drops the URL of his campaign website, www.dolekemp96.org, on national TV.

A screenshot of the dolekemp96.org homepage. Image: Screenshot: mashable / 4president.org

Now, 23 years later, you can still experience the website at the original URL in all its 1996 glory.

To find more, I reached out to designer Rob Kubasko, the man hired to create Dole’s website, and Mike Dec, the man who set out to preserve it.

The beginning

In the mid-'90s, Kubasko was working as a graphic designer at Arizona State University when he hooked up with the Dole campaign through a mutual connection.

“I had been interested in politics for some time and one of my mentors at ASU knew a person who consulted with the Dole campaign,” Kubasko told me.

“At that time, there weren’t a lot of experienced web developers out there, so this was still in the infancy of the internet,” said Kubasko, explaining how he partnered with a programmer friend, Vince Salvato, to work on the site under his digital design agency Iguana, Inc.

And that’s how the development of one of the first presidential campaign websites began.

Who was first?

There are reports of various political campaigns utilizing the internet way back in 1992. Bill Clinton, who Dole ended up losing to in ‘96, used email, message boards, and listservs during his '92 campaign. Sen. Dianne Feinstein has been credited with launching the first political campaign website in 1994.

But the first presidential campaign site is a matter of dispute. Some outlets give the credit to Bob Dole, an effort by an older candidate to show he wasn't out of touch with technology. However, it appears that Bill Clinton beat Dole to the punch in the general election. An archived press release dates Clinton’s website launch on July 10, 1996. A press release on the archived Dole website dates the website’s official relaunch for the general election as Aug. 2, 1996. (Once Jack Kemp was picked to be Dole’s running mate, the campaign switched the website over to dolekemp96.org.)

“Keep in mind there were TWO Dole sites: one for the primary and one for the general election,” Kubasko told me. “I do believe Clinton had his re-election site up though before the Dole general one, since he had obviously had no challenger in the primary.”

Interestingly, it was actually a third-party that beat both candidates to the punch — and I don’t mean a party of the political kind. Technically, the first presidential campaign website was a parody site created by a couple of pranksters in their 20s.

“Back then, there was no GoDaddy, you’d register almost any name for free and set it up with your name server and you were gold,” says Kubasko.

SEE ALSO: How the battle over domain prices could drastically change the web

Two young techies, Brooks Talley and Mark Pace, had already been creating spoof websites for a number of the Republican primary contenders, Bob Dole included. According to an archived New York Times piece from that year, Talley registered dole96.org on July, 11, 1995. The Dole campaign didn’t register its domain for the primary, dole96.com, until Aug. 12.

The spoof site’s slogan? Bob Dole: “the ripe man for the job.”

“They made it look like a Dole pineapple campaign,” Kubasko recalls. “Not as funny then as it is now.”

Running a website in 1996

Today, running a website is easy. Anyone with a few bucks a month to spare can do it. Obviously, websites receiving lots of traffic, like a major political campaign, need to spend more, but it’s still a rather easy process. Often times, the website manager never even comes into contact with the physical server. Everything is managed for them by a web hosting service.

This was not the case in 1996.

“In the mid-1990s just hosting a site wasn’t as ubiquitous as it is today,” says Kubasko. “We bought a used Sun Sparc2 workstation to host the site and got a T1 line installed in Vince's bedroom at his parent’s house.”

“One of the technical hurdles was that the T1 line stunk, it would go down all the time and we’d have to reboot the system,” he continued. “Literally, no joke, this was about as meager as you could imagine because there weren't a lot of choices back then that weren’t way out of the budget for even a presidential campaign at the time.”

“It was insane by today’s standards,” he said.

""It was insane by today's standards.""

Managing the content on the website wasn’t any easier. Digital tools like Slack or Trello didn't exist then. Email was still young and social media wasn’t a thing yet. So they had to get physical.

“We got all our edits from the campaign by them faxing us hand-drawn edits to printed pages of the site,” explained Kubasko. “I had one of those thermal roll fax machines — the cheapest you could get — and I can remember coming home from my day job at ASU and finding my bedroom overrun by dozens of faxed pages every night. It was ridiculous.”

The plug heard across the nation

Rob’s fax-filled bedroom seemed worth it as the Dole team pushed the website as an important part of the campaign.

“Even though I think the campaign saw the site as 'something we have to do to look like we get technology,' they really embraced it,” he said. “They really saw this as a way to get people to think of Senator Dole as more than just the 'old guy' in the race.”

And, for 1996, the website’s features were fairly revolutionary. It had up-to-date content and animated GIFs. There’s a section on the site, Dole Interactive, where visitors could create their own buttons and posters, take quizzes, play crossword puzzles, and even send customized electronic postcards via email.

“The last one of which was incredibly innovative and had we known about patent law, would have patented the hell out of most of these technologies,” explained Kubasko.

""Years later I was asked to defend a top five internet site in a patent dispute based on the postcards alone. When they did their research they found we had basically invented this and I helped them succeed in their defense.""

The website's most historic moment, however, came at that presidential debate.

“This election is important. I ask for your support. I ask for your help. If you really want to get involved, just tap into my homepage: www.dolekemp96 org” said Dole in the final moments of the debate, forgetting the final “dot” before “org.” (You can watch the moment at around 1 hour and 30 minutes in the video above.) Bill Clinton even lets out a chuckle after Dole plugs the site.

Much like the rush to register matching domain names after Joe Biden’s text message number flub at the most recent Democratic primary debate, there were “imposter” sites in 1996 ready to take advantage of those mistyping the web address.

Regardless, Kubasko believes the namedrop made their choice for the general campaign domain name “famous.”

“To this day, it might still be the greatest internet namedrop ever by a politician,” he told me.

Thanks to that plug, Dole’s campaign touted “a record-breaking day” of about 2 million total hits on the campaign’s homepage. Luckily, Dole’s digital team had upgraded its previously mentioned server situation by then and were able to handle the traffic.

Archiving internet history

Today, in the year 2019, anyone with an internet connection can go to dolekemp96.org and see the site as it was nearly 23 years ago.

Dole’s original general election website is archived thanks to Mike Dec, who runs 4President.org . Dec’s website contains archived presidential campaign speeches, bumper sticker images, brochure scans, and even screenshots of political campaign websites as far back as the primary candidates who ran against Dole in 1996.

But, the working archived Dole website is the main attraction.

“I wanted to preserve the history of the first websites,” Dec said when I asked him why he maintains an archive of the site. “I contacted Bob Dole’s office in Washington, D.C., and the Dole Library in Kansas and told them what I was doing, but I don’t think they really understood.”

Unfortunately, Dole’s office told Dec that they didn’t have anything pertaining to the website archived. But luckily, Mike did.

“I had part of it archived,” he told me. “I had saved some of it on my own back in 1996, so I had the files and I kind of rebuilt it from the graphics.”

Looking at the site, you’ll see that there are a number a broken internal links, so some of it has been lost to time. But, the website looks as it did in 1996 and many pages do indeed work.

Today, people can also visit an archive of the Clinton/Gore campaign’s 1996 website, maintained by the American Museum of Moving Image. However, Mike has something that the museum does not, something that sets the Dole website archive apart from the rest: the campaign’s original domain name.

“I saw that the dolekemp96.org was available one day and snapped it up,” Dec said. “The original cg96.org used by the Clinton/Gore campaign is owned by someone else and I’ve tried to purchase it, but they want too much money, so it remains in their hands.”

“And now the price will probably go up when you publish your article.”"

Dana Milbank: Is Trump a president or a timeshare salesman?,https://www.sltrib.com,"['Dana Milbank', 'The Washington Post']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/08/27/dana-milbank-is-trump/,"Washington • The Amazon is burning, a trade war is escalating, and the world economy is deteriorating.

Enter President Trump, taking the stage on Monday at the Group of Seven gathering of world leaders in Biarritz, France, to assure an anxious world that … his golf resort in Miami is just tremendous!

“With Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings — we call them bungalows — they each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views,” Trump said at the closing news conference of the international gathering.

Trump, who had been asked to clarify his earlier (inappropriate) remarks promoting his Miami-area property at the international gathering, instead expanded on them: ""We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants. And we have many hundreds of acres so that in terms of parking, in terms of all of the things that you need, the ballrooms are among the biggest in Florida, and the best.""

""We."" With that pronoun, Trump spoke not as president of the United States but as de facto head of the Trump Organization. And he now endeavors to abuse his status as host of next year's G-7 summit to force foreign countries and U.S. taxpayers to pump millions more dollars into one of his properties.

Trump essentially requiring foreign governments to pay him is the very definition of unconstitutional emoluments. Is this a president or a timeshare salesman?

Trump is often criticized for representing only those who voted for him, but even that description seemed generous Monday. On French soil, Trump seemed to be representing only himself.

This isn't the first time Trump has been unable (or unwilling) to distinguish the national interest from his own. And his l'etat-c'est-moiroutine isn't just for the French. After meeting recently with mass-shooting victims, he rhapsodized about their ""love for me — and me, maybe, as a representative of the country — but for me.""

He has badgered the Federal Reserve chairman to reduce interest rates, which would benefit him as a huge borrower. The president has made untold millions from his tax cuts and from foreign governments booking rooms and meals at his properties.

Trump makes geopolitical decisions based on how he's treated personally. It's no mere coincidence that Japan, which nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize and gave him a fancy state visit, has escaped the worst of his trade wrath. By contrast, he canceled a visit to Denmark and claimed the prime minister had insulted the United States by labeling ""absurd"" his (absurd) plan to buy Greenland: ""You don't talk to the United States that way!""

Accordingly, Trump's peers at the G-7 were careful to stroke his ego with talk of his powerful traits, his lovely wife, his new grandchild. Even so, no one praised Trump as much as Trump.

Article continues below

On the environment: ""I think I know more about the environment than most people.""

On oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: ""I was able to get ANWR approved. Ronald Reagan wasn't able to do it.""

On trade: ""We never had a president that understood this."" Until now!

Asked about Russia rejoining the G-7, Trump found himself boasting: ""I ran one election and I won. Happened to be for president.""

Above all, he celebrated the greatness of Trump Organization holdings.

""I own great property in the U.K."" he said when asked about new Prime Minister Boris Johnson, adding, ""I own Turnberry and I own in Aberdeen and I own in Ireland, as you know, Doonbeg and great stuff.""

Great stuff! His travels to his properties in Ireland, Scotland, Virginia, New Jersey, Florida and elsewhere (on 255 days of his presidency, The Washington Post calculated in June) have funneled them a fortune in taxpayer dollars.

Now, it's Doral's turn. Seated earlier Monday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump gave a hard sell for the resort: ""Great place."" ""Tremendous acreage."" ""Next to the airport."" Nothing ""close to competing with it."" Later, he explained that ""my people"" looked at potential G-7 locations and — surprise! — ""they came back and said, 'This is where we'd like to be.'""

It would be a nice boost for the underperforming resort, yet Trump believes he is the one making a sacrifice. The presidency has cost him more than $3 billion, he lamented on Monday, from lost income from giving motivational speeches, for example.

""I don't care about making money,"" Trump claimed Monday. What's more, ""I'm not going to make any money"" from hosting the G-7 at Doral.

Of course not. And if you don't believe him, you can check his tax returns.

"As Puerto Rico Braces For Storm, DHS, FEMA To Move $271 Million To Border Operations",https://www.npr.org,['Claudia Grisales'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/27/754838143/as-puerto-rico-braces-for-storm-dhs-fema-to-move-271-million-to-border-operation,"As Puerto Rico Braces For Storm, DHS, FEMA To Move $271 Million To Border Operations

As a major storm heads for Puerto Rico, the Department of Homeland Security and its Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday they will move $271 million in funds to support President Trump's border enforcement efforts.

The Department of Homeland Security said it will transfer the emergency funds — including $155 million from FEMA's disaster relief fund — to support new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds as well as facilities for related court cases, according to documents obtained by NPR.

In a July notification to Congress about the transfer, DHS said the $155 million comes from recoveries of prior year funds and that ""absent significant new catastrophic events"" the department believes the fund will still have enough money to operate.

Congressional Democrats slammed the move on Tuesday, which comes at the peak of hurricane season and as Tropical Storm Dorian was poised to reach hurricane levels.

""The Trump administration's plan to divert money away from FEMA at the start of hurricane season to continue its efforts to separate and jail migrant families is backwards and cruel,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""Taking these critical funds from disaster preparedness and recovery efforts threatens lives and weakens the government's ability to help Americans in the wake of natural disasters. Congress appropriated these funds to meet the American peoples' priorities and I strongly oppose this effort to undermine our constitutional authority.""

DHS alerted Congress to the move in a 15-page notification dated July 26, which NBC first reported earlier Tuesday. The agency is required to give Congress a 30-day notice to the plans.

Democrats, opposed to the move, waited to respond until the end of that notification period in hopes of delaying the costly action, a congressional source familiar with the plans said.

""I have significant concerns about the intended use of funds, and consequently, about the tradeoffs between that use and activities that would otherwise be funded from the source accounts,"" California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, chair of a House Appropriations subcommittee, told DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan in an Aug. 23 letter.

Roybal-Allard said the the reprogramming was unnecessary and the Trump administration was overstepping its authority. She noted that DHS components such as the U.S. Coast Guard could be hampered by the move.

She added she was concerned about implementation of the agency's immigration enforcement operations, which often ignores its budget directives from Congress and lack transparency. She urged McAleenan to work with the House Appropriations Committee to restore their partnership.

""I am greatly concerned that during the course of this administration, there has been a growing disconnect between the will of Congress, as represented by ICE funding levels in enacted appropriations bills signed by the President, and the Department's Immigration enforcement operations, which often lack justification,"" Roybal-Allard said.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., also slammed the move Tuesday.

""Once again, this administration is endangering America by moving funds away from emergency management for their extremist border agenda,"" he said. ""President Trump and his administration are not just endangering the lives of the children and families they seek to harm in the name of deterrence. By shortchanging preparedness, they're endangering the lives of millions of Americans who live in hurricane zones as well.""

The DHS notification to Congress expired on Sunday, the agency said in a statement Tuesday. The Department also defended the move, saying it is necessary to deal with the influx of migrants.

""Given the rise of single adults crossing the border, ICE has already had to increase the number of detention beds above what Congress funded,"" DHS said in its statement. ""Without additional funding for single adult detention beds and transportation from the U.S. Border Patrol to ICE detention facilities, ICE will not be able to support the influx of migrants from U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehensions.""

In its notification, DHS cited ""a security and humanitarian crisis on the southern border"" and the ""high volume of aliens presenting themselves at ports of entry or entering illegally ... and being released into the interior of the United States while they wait sometimes years for a final resolution of their case."" The shift in the funds would help DHS address the ""crisis,"" the department says, under authority provided in the fiscal year 2019 DHS appropriations act.

As a result, DHS said it will transfer funds from its FEMA disaster relief fund and other accounts to the new border effort.

Of the overall $271 million total, the agency said it will move $155 million to establish and operate temporary Migrant Protection Protocol, or MPP, Immigration Hearing Facilities along the Southwest border. Another $116 million will be used to pay for new detention beds, the agency said.

""MPP court docket backlogs will continue to grow and ICE will not be able to effectively and efficiently move single adult migrants between detention centers and courtrooms without the funding,"" the agency said. ""This realignment of resources allows DHS to address ongoing border emergency crisis by alleviating the surge along the Nation's Southwest Border while minimizing the risk to overall DHS mission performance.""

Supporters of the administration's immigration policies say Democrats have left the administration little choice but to take this action.

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, who is in regular discussions with the administration, said the transfer of the funds is necessary because ICE is so over budget due to the border crisis. They have to find the money from somewhere because Congress hasn't given them what it needs, she said.

""ICE's priority caseload is growing, but the Democratic majority in the House does not support the level of enforcement that they consider to be the bare minimum for public safety and maintaining the most basic integrity of the law,"" she said.

""The border influx has strained ICE capacity,"" she said. ""Under the law, their detention capacity is set by Congress. They have to balance the criminal cases, border cases and other priorities like worksite operations and fugitives. And on top of that some people are mandatory to detained, such aggravated felons and prior deportees.""

"As Trump policies deepen farmers' pain, Democrats see an opening in rural America",https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Tim Reid', 'Joseph Ax']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/08/27/trump-policies-farmers-pain-democrats-rural-america/23801970/,"(Reuters) - Seizing on mounting Farm Belt frustration with President Donald Trump's economic agenda, Democratic rivals are stepping up their push to take back part of rural America, whose overwhelming support for Trump helped propel his upset 2016 election victory.

The sparsely populated U.S. heartland has remained loyal to the Republican president even as farmers from Iowa to Wisconsin to Pennsylvania bear the brunt of his tariff war with China. His advisers insist Trump's projection of toughness against China will only delight, not alienate, his base.

Democrats seeking to face Trump in the November 2020 election challenge that presumption, pointing to farmers reeling from plunging prices and unsold crops during what is now more than a year-long trade war with China. Farmers and ethanol producers are also upset with the administration's latest decision to allow more oil refiners to skirt biofuel laws and use less corn-based ethanol.

From front-runner Joe Biden to U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, many of the more than 20 Democratic presidential candidates have highlighted the economic damage caused by Trump's trade war and biofuel waivers as the central plank of their pitches to rural America.

At various campaign stops in Iowa since June, Biden has said the trade war was ""crushing"" American farmers. “How many farmers across this state, across this nation, have to face the prospect of losing everything, losing their farm because of these tariffs?” Biden said in Warren County, Iowa, last week.

Biden's aides say he will make campaigning in rural areas a top priority.

""Vice President Biden will work to expand the market for ethanol and the next generation of biofuels, and will re-engage allies to negotiate trade that benefits American farmers and other workers,"" TJ Ducklo, a Biden spokesman, told Reuters.

In recent weeks, several other candidates, including Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, have rushed to roll out plans for rural America, touching on everything from farm subsidies to rural healthcare and broadband.

They have already been campaigning heavily in rural Iowa, the state that kicks off the party’s nominating contest in February and is the largest producer of corn and ethanol.

In the past, Democratic candidates often just paid lip service to rural voters, said former U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who founded the One Country Project to help Democrats broaden their rural appeal after she lost her re-election bid last year.

This year is different, she said in an interview.

“There’s an appreciation that we can’t continue to fail at the rate we’re failing in rural America and be successful in presidential races and Senate races,"" Heitkamp said.

She added: “We’re getting helped a lot by the president in this regard.""

Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union, said in a statement last Friday: ""Between burning bridges with all of our biggest trading partners and undermining our domestic biofuels industry, President Trump is making things worse, not better.""

UPHILL BATTLE

Many rural voters helped former Democratic President Barack Obama win the White House in 2008 and 2012. But they supported Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 by more than 30 percentage points.

Next year is again expected to be an uphill battle for Democrats. Officials worry the party's increasingly liberal direction on immigration and other Trump-driven hot-button issues is socially and culturally at odds with rural voters.

According to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted this month, five in 10 U.S. adults in rural areas approved of Trump's performance in office, higher than his 41% approval nationwide.

Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director, said farmers know the trade war is a ""fight worth winning.""

“Farmers are patriots ... and they know the long-term benefits are going to be worth it for themselves and this nation,"" Murtaugh said.

The White House also unveiled a $16 billion aid package in July to help farmers hurt by the trade war and bad weather.

But Democrats point to last year's congressional elections, where the party increased its share of the vote from 2016 in at least 54 districts with large rural populations, as a sign that Trump's grip on rural America may be loosening.

Even a small erosion in Trump’s support among rural voters could make a difference in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where Trump won by razor-thin margins in 2016, Democratic strategists say.

Trump won by a combined total of just 77,000 votes in the three states.

Priorities USA, the largest Democratic Super PAC, is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a week to run digital ads in those states as well as in Florida, aimed at tying Trump’s policies to economic difficulties that many working-class people face.

'FOLDED TO BIG OIL'

A round of more bad news for farmers last week, including extra tariffs Beijing announced on soybeans and other key U.S. agricultural exports, gave Democrats a fresh opening to attack Trump.

After Reuters reported this month that Trump gave regulators the green light to grant exemptions to more than 30 small refineries so they can use less ethanol, Democratic candidates pounced on it as evidence Trump favors the oil industry.

Klobuchar, the Minnesota lawmaker who has centered her campaign narrative on her ability to win over rural Midwestern voters, said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved.

“He folded to Big Oil,” she told reporters on Thursday.

Murtaugh, the Trump campaign spokesman, rejected the accusation, saying the president was concerned about some “small” refineries not being able to cope with costly standards.

“As president, he must look out for the economic interests of everyone involved,” he said.

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, a swing state won twice by Obama but that Trump carried in 2016.

“Democrats have crisscrossed Iowa. They are speaking to ethanol producers who have idled plants and talking to workers who are losing their jobs,"" said Patty Judge, a former Democratic lieutenant governor in Iowa and current chair of the Focus on Rural America, which advocates progressive economic policies in rural areas.

""This is an opportunity for Democrats to win back the heartland and the White House."" (Reporting by Tim Reid in Los Angeles and Joseph Ax in New York; Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Kahn in New York; Editing by Soyoung Kim and Peter Cooney)

Joe Walsh Says Trump Is ‘Unfit’ to Be President. Some Say the Same About Him.,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Matt Stevens', 'Annie Karni']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/us/politics/joe-walsh-president-racist-tweets.html,"Mr. Walsh has not deleted his offending tweets, choosing instead to apologize for some of them. But his long, searchable trail means Mr. Walsh has spent the opening days of his campaign addressing his own record rather than mounting a coherent attack on Mr. Trump.

“I wouldn’t call myself a racist, but I would say, John, I’ve said racist things on Twitter,” Mr. Walsh said in an interview with the MSNBC host John Heilemann on Monday.

The difference between him and the president, Mr. Walsh said in an interview with ABC, is that Mr. Trump has “never apologized for anything he’s done or said.”

But asked by The Washington Post about a tweet in which he deployed an expletive used by Mr. Trump to describe Haiti, Mr. Walsh said that while his word choice was perhaps “a little too provocative,” he stood by his description.

Amid his media blitz, Mr. Walsh received bad news about his own radio broadcast. In a statement Monday, Salem Radio Network announced that it would exercise its right to cancel national distribution of Mr. Walsh’s radio program, effective in 30 days.

A company official said any broadcaster who becomes a bona fide candidate for office must leave the air or risk exposing stations to the Federal Communications Commission’s equal time provision, under which any other declared candidate could demand airtime equal to that afforded to Mr. Walsh.

Mr. Walsh has tried to portray himself as someone who experienced an awakening — a firebrand populist who contributed to a divisive climate that helped elect Mr. Trump, but who was now putting his own career on the line to atone for his role in the Trump ascendancy."
Comey friend expects criminal charges against McCabe 'any day' now,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/comey-friend-expects-criminal-charges-against-mccabe-any-day-now,"A ""good friend"" of former FBI Director James Comey says he expects criminal charges against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe any day now.

Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of Lawfare, wrote in a blog post that he was shocked by a New York Times report Monday that revealed McCabe's lawyers met with top Justice Department officials in recent weeks.

""Such meetings generally take place when indictment is imminent; they happen when the government plans to bring charges,"" Wittes said on Tuesday. ""You should thus expect charges against McCabe to be forthcoming any day. And if such charges don’t happen, that doesn’t mean they weren’t planned but, rather, that some extrinsic event has intervened.""

McCabe’s lawyers met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who will help make the call on whether to prosecute, and U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu in two separate meetings last week. This indicates federal prosecutors are close to making a final decision on whether to indict McCabe, who is accused of lying to federal agents.

Wittes, an author and senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said the report was ""shocking."" He argued that ""as best as I can tell, the facts available on the public record simply don’t support such charges."" Wittes also suggested the White House may be a factor because of a ""sustained campaign by President Trump demanding McCabe’s scalp."" Trump has repeatedly criticized McCabe, who authorized the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018, less than two days before he was set to retire, prompted by a DOJ inspector general report that found he misled Comey and investigators about leaks to the media regarding the Hillary Clinton emails investigation and an inquiry into the Clinton Foundation which had not yet been made public.

Comey, whom Trump fired in May 2017, says he did not give McCabe permission to leak that information to the media. Comey has yet to comment on the latest developments in the McCabe investigation.

McCabe's lawyers have called the inspector general's report ""deeply flawed,"" and McCabe, who was hired by CNN last week, sued the Justice Department in August, accusing Trump of forcing his subordinates to participate in an “unconstitutional plan and scheme” to have him fired. He is demanding back pay, his full pension, and for his record to be expunged.

Wittes said if prosecutors bring criminal charges against McCabe, which he views as excessive, they will have to overcome ""substantially mitigating factors,"" such as McCabe correcting the record after he misled investigators and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page telling a grand jury that McCabe was authorized in his position as deputy director to give information to the media and had no motive to lie.

Wittes admitted there could be ""evidence that is not public yet"" against McCabe. He also predicted that McCabe's defense will be that he was confused and under a lot of pressure, given the circumstances at the time.

Although Wittes said he will not rush to judgment, he expressed concern about assistant U.S. attorneys dropping off the case. He also said, ""I would be lying if I said that, as I look at it now, it all seems on the level to me. I worry that what’s happening here is simple corruption of the Department of Justice in precisely the fashion I have been worrying about since before Donald Trump was even elected."""

The Exponent Telegram reported an attorney for the daughter of a Clarksburg VA patient who died last year filed a notice of a pending lawsuit. It said an autopsy showed her father died after an insulin injection.

Charleston attorney Tony O'Dell said the VA told his client there was evidence as many as 10 other patients died in similar fashion.

Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia says he wants answers about what happened.

""When someone basically was willing to sacrifice their life, and then we find out that their life was taken in such a horrific fashion, it's hard for us to imagine that, especially as a family member,” Manchin said. “So we're going to make sure we get closure and we get answers to this.""

Trump willing to pardon wrongdoing if it relates to building the wall faster,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-willing-to-pardon-wrongdoing-if-it-relates-to-building-the-wall-faster,"President Trump is reportedly willing to pardon subordinates if they break laws in an attempt to build the wall along the U.S. southern border faster.

Officials told the Washington Post that Trump wants hundreds of miles of the border barrier erected before the 2020 election and is willing to pardon wrongdoing if laws are broken in the process.

""Don’t worry, I’ll pardon you,"" Trump told officials during a meeting about the wall.

White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley did not deny the report but called internal criticisms of Trump ""fabrications.""

""Donald Trump promised to secure our border with sane, rational immigration policies to make American communities safer, and that’s happening everywhere the wall is being built,"" Gidley said, adding that internal criticisms ""are just more fabrications by people who hate the fact the status quo, that has crippled this country for decades, is finally changing as President Trump is moving quicker than anyone in history to build the wall, secure the border and enact the very immigration policies the American people voted for.""

Trump's urgency to build the wall comes as no new miles of wall have been created during his presidency. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed last month that all built fencing was done to replace ""dilapidated designs.""

The president is hoping to speed up the process to fulfill his promise to ""build the wall"" before the 2020 election.

""He said people expected him to build a wall, and it had to be done by the election,"" a former official said."
Oregon woman with California birth certificate sues State Department for denying her a U.S. passport,https://www.oregonlive.com,"['Maxine Bernstein', 'Mbernstein Oregonian.Com', 'The Oregonian Oregonlive']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2019/08/oregon-woman-with-california-birth-certificate-sues-state-department-for-denying-her-a-us-passport.html,"An Oregon woman is suing the U.S. State Department for twice declining to issue her a U.S. passport even though her lawyer says she presented federal government officials with a certified birth certificate from a Los Angeles County hospital.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon filed the suit Tuesday in federal court in Medford on behalf of Maria Qarrillo Soto, 48, who has lived in Oregon for 30 years. The lawsuit follows a similar complaint the ACLU filed in federal court in Colorado earlier this month on behalf of a Texas-born resident who also was denied a U.S. passport.

Soto, a married mother of two grown daughters who lives in White City, was denied a U.S. passport in 2018 despite providing government officials with the original birth certificate and copies of her Social Security card, driver’s license and marriage certificate and medical records from her pregnancy, according to her attorney, Leland Baxter-Neal of the ACLU.

The government denied the passport, writing to her that the material she presented was “not sufficient to establish your identity,’’ according to a letter from the U.S. Department of State.

Someone applying for a U.S. passport must establish their identity through submission of a previous passport, or other state, local or federal government-issued photo identification, the letter said.

Soto had been denied a U.S. passport in 1994 after she applied for one the prior year.

“There’s no reasonable explanation for denying her passport,’’ Baxter-Neal said Tuesday.

The State Department said it doesn’t comment on pending lawsuits.

Soto was born in Los Angeles County Hospital in April 1971 to her migrant parents from Mexico, father Felix Carrillo Arrellano and mother Guadalupe Barjaas Macias, according to the suit. At the time of her birth, her last name was misspelled on her birth certificate as “Qarrillo,’’ not Carillo.

She used “Qarrillo” until she married and took her husband’s name, using “Qarrillo’’ on her Social Security card, driver’s license and other identification, her lawyer said.

“The misspelling of her name is like a quirk in the case but everything she submitted proves her identity,’’ Baxter-Neal said.

Her parents, who are now deceased, worked in agriculture in Los Angeles and returned their daughter to Mexico to be raised by her maternal grandparents when she was between 1 month and 3 months old. During her childhood, Soto returned to the United States about once a year between ages 8 and 17, crossing the border by presenting her birth certificate, according to the suit.

Soto returned to live in the United States in 1989 at age 18, settling in Klamath Falls, Oregon. That year, she married Jose Alfredo Soto Toriz. In 1990, she petitioned for an immigrant visa for her husband as the spouse of a U.S. citizen, presenting proof to the government of her citizenship. The petition was approved and her husband was granted residency in 1995, according to her attorney.

When Soto applied for a U.S. passport in 1993, she submitted a photocopy of a certified copy of her birth certificate from Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. The State Department sent her a letter on June 3, 1994, requesting additional documentation about her birth, her family and upbringing and her application was denied when Soto didn’t provide additional records to the government, the suit says.

At that time, Soto didn’t send her original birth certificate in, fearful she wouldn’t get it back, her lawyer said.

She applied a second time for a U.S. passport in February 2018, submitting a certified copy of her birth certificate, a copy of her Social Security card and her driver’s license. Because of the State Department’s earlier denial, it informed her that she needed to fill out an additional form – a “Supplemental Questionnaire to Determine Identity’’ – for the passport.

So she sent the completed form and additional documentation – her original birth certificate, her marriage certificate, a letter confirming her education in Mexico, medical records related to her pregnancy and a letter from her church, where she provides Bible study classes, according to Baxter-Neal.

But the government found that still wasn’t enough and denied her request on July 2, 2018, according to the suit.

Soto had hoped to travel to Peru with her husband.

“We’re suing to make sure she’s able to travel in the future like every other U.S. citizen,’’ Baxter-Neal said.

The ACLU argues that President Donald Trump’s administration is blocking U.S. passports more frequently for Latin Americans. The group pointed to a report by The Washington Post last summer about a surge in passport denials for Latin Americans born along the United States’ southern border.

“The idea that all people should be treated fairly and equally is fundamental to our democracy, and we must fight against the Trump administration’s attempts to divide us based on skin color or accents,’’ Baxter-Neal said in a statement.

VA secretary rejects Obama religious expression rules: 'They did not know the makeup of the force',https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Christopher Vondracek']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/27/robert-wilkie-va-secretary-rejects-obama-religious/,"Robert Wilkie, the soft-spoken and managerial-minded secretary of Veterans Affairs, went public in a big way this summer when he said he refused to be “bullied” by a federal lawsuit claiming a Bible on display at a New Hampshire VA hospital violated the separation of church and state.

In an interview with The Washington Times in his office at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Wilkie said displaying a Bible in a VA hospital is a matter of liberty and that the Obama administration erred in trying to eliminate religious symbols from the veterans health care system.

“The last administration … had a very ahistoric approach [to veterans],” Mr. Wilkie said. “They did not know the makeup of the force. They did not know the history of this country when it came to religious foundations, the religious support for those in uniform.”

He said he grew up in a military family in North Carolina and believes the vast majority of veterans “identify themselves religiously.”

Meanwhile, a federal judge in New Hampshire will soon decide whether a Bible in a bolted-down display case in the lobby of a Manchester hospital funded by taxpayer dollars represents constitutionally protected speech.

A group of veterans, with support from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, filed a lawsuit in May to remove the Bible.

“The placement of the Christian Bible, here, is in violation of that fundamental proscription, that the government may not establish any religion,” the lawsuit states.

Mr. Wilkie, noting the department’s murky directives on religious memorabilia, said he empathized with VA administrators who initially removed the Bible decorating the POW/MIA memorial table before replacing the book. The Bible was donated by a World War II veteran who had survived a German prisoner of war camp.

“I think the leadership of the VA hospital was still not sure how to act given the directives of the last administration,” Mr. Wilkie said.

The VA secretary accused the Obama administration of banning the Army Chaplain Corps — which currently numbers 800, including student chaplains — from distributing religious materials, including Bibles, Torahs and Korans, to veterans, even those who request them.

The previous administration, he said, even forbade revelers from singing Christmas carols in VA hospitals.

“The underlying notion here is that there is a group of people who want to eliminate all indicia of religion and spirituality from the public square,” Mr. Wilkie said. “And they’ve used the military as their hobby horse, and that, to me, is a great disservice to the vast majority of those who served.”

Michael L. Weinstein, a lawyer and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said his organization is looking forward to its day in court.

“I find it very ironic that VA Secretary Wilkie believes that upholding the separation of church and state regarding religious displays in VA facilities represents the interest of only a narrow number of people,” Mr. Weinstein said via email. “The Veterans Administration is what is called a ‘state actor’ and therefore must completely comply with the No Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights of our U.S. Constitution.”

The VA has a number of policies on religious expression. A 2016 inspector general’s report found no evidence that those policies contributed to religious insensitivity, and Secretary David J. Shulkin at the time wrote that policies “generally aligned” with applicable federal laws.

However, the inspector general’s report noted that the VA had not adequately updated a variety of policies related to religious expression, including directive 0022 on religious symbols. In one instance, the inspector general found that a VA guidance on maintenance at national cemeteries hadn’t been updated in 22 years.

According to multiple press reports at the time, the Obama administration adopted rules meant to curtail reported instances of proselytizing at military bases and hospitals. Mr. Wilkie’s staff said those strictures will stay in place.

“I also want to make clear that a lot of people will try to say that [the VA’s memo on Bibles and public display] constitutes proselytization,” said John Mashburn, a senior adviser to Mr. Wilkie. “[But] the VA kept in places its prohibition against proselytization.”

Mr. Wilkie had served as a legal aide to various Republican members of Congress, including Jesse Helms and Trent Lott, before his March 2018 promotion from an undersecretary post in the Department of Defense to head of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He was named acting VA secretary before the nomination of presidential physician Ronny Jackson was scuttled by reports that Dr. Jackson created an abusive work environment and drank on the job.

The secretary said the spirituality of veterans is inseparable from the task of healing, especially during a crisis of depression, addiction and suicide.

“What I consider to be the bizarre argument that men and women who’ve been sent to the most dangerous corners of the Earth, the most miserable places on the planet, would walk by a Bible on a table dedicated to missing men and go to pieces by the sight of that Bible when so many of them have been under fire in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Liberia, [just] goes counter to all logic,” Mr. Wilkie said.

The VA secretary noted that the Army Chaplain Regimental Corps crest reads “Pro Deo et Patria.” He said any decision to remove the Bible in New Hampshire would diminish that motto.

“For veterans, we’re not going to deprive them of that [spiritual] comfort during what is often a very, very trying time,” he said.

Trump's secretive intelligence advisory board takes shape with security pros and GOP donors,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-secretive-intelligence-advisory-board-takes-shape-security/story?id=65222244,"Three years ago, Dallas businessman Ray Washburne was vice chairman of the Trump Victory Committee, helping then-candidate Donald Trump and the Republican party raise millions of dollars ahead of the 2016 election – in addition to the more than $100,000 of his own donations to the candidate's and the party's committees.

Now Washburne has formally joined an intelligence panel chosen by the president that has access to some of America's most closely held secrets and a line to the Oval Office.

Washburne is one of a handful of appointees on the secretive President's Intelligence Advisory Board, or PIAB, who appears to be light on national security experience but has given generously to Republican causes – though Washburne disputes any correlation.

Past presidents have often named political supporters to the board, which one political scientist compared to the controversial yet common practice of presidents doling out plum ambassadorships to partisan patrons, and Trump's board does include other members with deep national security experience.

But former PIAB chairman and ex-Republican senator Chuck Hagel said that considering the sensitive nature of the organization -- and its broad access to secrets -- the practice of pulling from political supporters to fill out the ranks is a particularly concerning tradition.

""From that standpoint it does bother me,"" said Hagel, who presided over then-President Barack Obama's PIAB from 2009 until he was named defense secretary in late 2013. ""But it's been done for many years, I mean both administrations. No one is really very pure in that.""

For his part, Washburne acknowledges he does not have a national security background like some others on Trump's board, some of whom served decades in the CIA, for instance. But he said that he did not believe his appointment had anything to do with his past political or financial support to the president or the Republican party.

Instead, he said it was the 20-odd months he recently served the head of the government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation – another Trump appointment in June 2017 – that gave him enough experience with ""economic intelligence"" to make him a valuable member of board.

""I was in a [secure facility] every day reading intelligence briefings on countries and leaders and businesspeople throughout the world, because we do business in every far, dark corner of the world,"" Washburne told ABC News in late May, shortly after the White House announced Trump's intention to nominate him, but before he passed the additional security checks to formally join the board. ""So what expertise I bring to the board is something that none of the others there have and wouldn't have because they're not dealing with economic issues. … When we talk about intelligence gathering, it's not just military capabilities, it's economics as well.""

The PIAB is an unpaid, part-time panel made up of private citizens that was created in 1956 by then-President Dwight Eisenhower to provide an independent perspective on the way the U.S. intelligence community goes about its normally cloistered business. At least twice a year it's supposed to provide assessments about the ""quality, quantity, and adequacy of intelligence activities,"" along with the ""effectiveness"" of the intelligence community's structure and performance, according to the White House.

The board's specific work is kept secret – though a recent government report revealed Trump's board has met with the intelligence community inspectors general at least twice to discuss ways to protect classified information.

And while those who have studied or served on the board say it's only as useful as the president allows it to be, the White House website says the board ""has had immense and long-lasting impacts on the structure, management, and operations of U.S. intelligence.""

Several members of the board did not respond to requests for comment for this report or referred ABC News to the White House National Security Council. The council declined to comment on the board's activities or the criteria for its membership under Trump.

From a CIA legend to big-money investors

From its founding early in the Cold War, the makeup of the PIAB has been a ""balance between real intelligence experts and people with other experience not directly related to intelligence but who offer a useful broad-level view,"" according to Michael Desch, a political science professor at Notre Dame who co-authored the book ""Privileged and Confidential: The Secret History of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board.""

Desch's book surveyed all the boards from the Eisenhower administration to the first half of the Obama administration, including how politics can creep into what was originally supposed to be a non-partisan panel.

Trump's board got a late start in his administration but has grown over the past year and a half in a series of spare press releases and notices posted on the White House website to 14 members as of mid-August. Their respective national security experiences vary significantly.

On one end, the board includes some former CIA officers who spent their careers in the intelligence world, including Agency legend Charles Allen and current Fox News contributor Daniel Hoffman. Newer PIAB member Gen. Michael Hagee (ret.) served in the U.S. Marine Corps for more than 30 years and served as commandant before retiring.

Others had government experience during prior administrations that involved national security, like ex-Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Saxby Chambliss and the board's No. 2, Samantha Ravich, who was deputy national security advisor to ex-Vice President Dick Cheney.

Then there are four members of the board, including Washburne, whose public biographies show long careers in business but relatively scant professional experience in government or national security positions.

And while half of the PIAB members supported Republican candidates or organizations with financial donations ahead of the 2016 election, some with relatively small donations of a few thousand dollars, those four members donated by far the most among the board members -- more than $100,000 each, according to Federal Election Commission data.

The New York financier in charge

The board's chairman, New York investor Stephen Feinberg, donated nearly $1 million to a pro-Trump super PAC just days before the 2016 election, only the latest installment of large gifts in support of Republican candidates or organizations in the 2016 cycle. He had previously donated some $200,000 to a pro-Jeb Bush super PAC.

Feinberg, whose investment firm's portfolio includes the defense contractor DynCorp, was named by Trump to lead the intelligence board in May 2018, a year after reports surfaced that Trump was considering naming him to some other special position in the administration to review the intelligence community in the shadow of the president's claim of an anti-Trump ""deep state.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, brought up the prospect in a congressional hearing in February 2017, saying that, ""As far as I can tell, this individual does not have national security experience, nor does he appear to have experience in intelligence.""

The point of the hearing was to consider former Sen. Dan Coats for the job of the Director of National Intelligence – a job he recently left. At the time Coats said that while he disagreed with the idea of Feinberg being placed in a new, special position, he said he knew Feinberg ""personally"" and considered him a ""patriot [who] wants to serve his country and […] brings many talents to that.""

This February, months before Coats' departure, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told ABC News in a statement, ""Director Coats supports Stephen Feinberg's leadership of the PIAB and the ODNI is working with the PIAB to improve the effectiveness of our nation's intelligence capabilities.""

A spokesperson for Feinberg's investment firm, Cerberus Capital Management, declined to make Feinberg available for comment for this report.

A 'student' of national security

After Feinberg and Washburne, the two other major political donors with lighter national security experience on the PIAB are Goldman Sachs management executive James Donovan and California investor John Hurley, each of whom in 2015 and 2016 gave over $100,000 to Republican organizations and approximately $100,000 to a pro-Jeb Bush organization. Neither appears to have made major donations to organizations that were directly pro-Trump.

Donovan, who was previously nominated for a top position at the Treasury Department but withdrew, did not respond to requests for comment for this report. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

An online biography for Hurley at Stanford Graduate School for Business where he lectures in finance says he's associated with a handful of national-security and foreign policy-related think tanks, and he served five years in the U.S. Army, including in the Gulf War in the early 1990s. A spokesperson at Hurley's investment firm directed ABC News' questions to the White House National Security Council.

But Hurley has the backing of another national security heavy-hitter, former Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force Gen. Norton Schwartz (ret.). Schwartz is the president of an organization called Business Executives for National Security, where Hurley is on the Board of Directors.

""I think he's a high-quality fella and who I think cares about national security and is a student of it,"" Schwartz told ABC News in February after the White House announced its intention to appoint Hurley. ""He is smart, and, in my experience, he has demonstrated exceptional judgment ... [and] in the end I think all of us make our way based on the quality of our judgment.

""I think he'll fit fine,"" said Schwartz.

Another member of the board, the newest addition, is J. Tucker Bailey, a cybersecurity specialist and partner at the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company. His online biography says he is a former Navy officer and was a special agent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS). He does not appear to have made significant political contributions in the 2016 election cycle.

Outside the 'echo chamber'

Desch said that historically speaking, Trump's board is ""not the best"" he's studied – an honor he bestows only on Eisenhower's original board -- because of what he said appeared to be the small number of political appointments, but he ""would not put it in the Looney Tunes land of boards that have been appointed"" by other presidents either.

Going back decades, one of the worst, Desch said, was convened by President Richard Nixon. While not short on experts, the board was aggressively partisan in its work, he said.

Former President Barack Obama at times placed some political supporters with thin intelligence backgrounds on his advisory board, Desch said.

He said that Obama's PIAB ""started out strong"" under the bipartisan leadership of Hagel, a former Republican senator, and co-chairman David Boren, a former Democratic senator. Hagel told ABC News that they cautioned the president about appointing unqualified members to the board.

""If he was interested in a show kind of place, a big repository for big donors, we said, 'Don't send them our way, we really won't accept them,'"" Hagel said.

But Desch said that following a reportedly dramatic shake-up in Obama's board in 2014, most of the board was dismissed and newcomers included a few people with ""far less seemingly relevant experience."" For example, one of the new members, Chicago investor Jim Crown, had been a major political donor and worked on Obama's 2008 campaign, according to federal data and contemporaneous news reports. Crown did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

ABC News also previously reported how a prolific Democratic donor was appointed to a similar body, the International Security Advisory Board, which advised the State Department, at the time led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Hagel said that appointing people with relatively little background in national security is not necessarily a problem -- after all the PIAB is designed to offer a view from private individuals who don't have ingrained ideas about how the nation's many spy agencies should work.

""You wouldn't want to restrict the membership just to the echo chamber,"" Hagel said. ""We get a hell of a lot of that already in Washington. … I think there is some benefit, no question, of having outside people come in.""

It's only an issue, according to Desch, when people are appointed who aren't serious about the work, who ""you know, just want the White House pass.""

When ABC News asked Sen. Mark Warner, the Democratic vice-chairman of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, if he had any concerns about the makeup of the current board and, by extension, the kind of advice the president might be getting, Warner said only that the board ""can be an effective entity to provide independent advice to the President on the functioning of the Intelligence Community.""

""It should be filled with members who bring unique perspective to national security and how intelligence can operate most effectively,"" he said in a statement in July.

Potential conflicts of interest, so far a 'theoretical concern'

The Washington Post reported that critics of Feinberg's appointment were concerned at the time about potential conflict of interest, citing in part his firm's ownership of Dyncorp, which does a significant amount of government business. In its report, the Post cited a source that said Feinberg divested his interest in Cerberus' holdings that involved defense or intelligence issues.

Desch said concerns over potential conflict of interest when it comes to private businesspeople handling classified intelligence are as old as the board itself, since the members may have investments or other interests that could be affected by what they learn or what the board recommends to the president.

But Desch said he's unaware of any members abusing their access and said that the setup of the board, including the use of staff members on loan from various government agencies, would make such abuse unlikely.

Desch said that as far as he knows, it remains a ""theoretical concern.""

Perhaps more valuable to the members, he said, are the connections that come from being on the board itself.

Top intelligence officials are going to return phone calls from a member of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, Desch said, ""That's for sure."""
Opinion | My Final Break With the Trump State Department,https://www.nytimes.com,['Bethany Milton'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/opinion/trump-state-department.html,"When President Trump allowed a crowd to chant “Send her back!” about a sitting member of Congress — espousing an ideology in which naturalized American citizens, at least those who don’t fit a certain profile, are held to different and dangerous standards — he wasn’t thinking about me. He’s rarely thinking about me, the white American-born daughter of two American-born citizens.

But he is often thinking and talking about at least some of the tens of thousands of people I’ve helped immigrate to the United States — legally and permissibly — over my 11 years as a consular officer in the Foreign Service. From 2014 to 2016, I oversaw immigrant visa processing at the U.S. Consulate General in Mumbai, India. Every day, my team and I saw dozens of families destined to move to the United States as green card holders: older parents going to spend their final years surrounded by grandchildren, spouses matched up through online matrimonial sites, parents with kids in tow who had been waiting patiently since the early 1990s for their chance to join a sibling.

I also oversaw immigrant visa operations in Kigali, Rwanda, from 2018 to 2019, helping Rwandans and Congolese reunite with family members in the United States. Their stories often had a darker tone: marriages brokered in refugee camps, siblings separated by war, children born of rape. But the one thing that united almost every visa applicant I ever saw was the belief that life was going to be better in America. What a rude surprise, then, for them to face elected national leadership that targets them in such gruesome ways.

When a diplomat joins the State Department, she sits through two presentations toward the end of her weekslong orientation class. One is an afternoon session about the State Department’s storied dissent channel, which lets employees speak out internally about foreign policy decisions free from the fear of retaliation. How to use it, when to use it, what it means. The other is a much shorter presentation, one that lasts all of 15 seconds: “The day you can no longer publicly support your administration’s policies is the day you need to resign.”"
"Iran president backpedals, wants Trump to lift sanctions before any possible talks",https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-president-trump-sanctions-back-pedal,"Iran's president backpedaled Tuesday on possible talks with President Trump, saying the U.S. commander in chief must first lift sanctions imposed on Tehran, otherwise a meeting between the two would be a mere photo-op.

Hassan Rouhani's change of heart came a day after Trump said Monday that there's a ""really good chance"" the two could meet on their nuclear impasse after a surprise intervention by French President Emmanuel Macron during the G-7 summit to try to bring Washington and Tehran together after decades of conflict.

""Without the U.S.' withdrawal from sanctions, we will not witness any positive development,"" Rouhani said in a televised speech on Tuesday, adding that Washington ""holds the key"" as to what happens next.

""If someone intends to make it as just a photo-op with Rouhani, that is not possible,"" he said.

ARI FLEISCHER: TRUMP CONSIDERING IRAN MEETING IS 'UNSETTLING' AND PREMATURE

Earlier on Monday, Rouhani expressed readiness to negotiate a way out of the crisis following America's pullout from the nuclear deal.

""If I knew that going to a meeting and visiting a person would help my country's development and resolve the problems of the people, I would not miss it,"" he had said. ""Even if the odds of success are not 90 percent but are 20 percent or 10 percent, we must move ahead with it. We should not miss opportunities.""

Rouhani also shielded his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, against criticism from hard-liners over his surprise visit Sunday to France's Biarritz, where leaders of the Group of Seven rich democracies were meeting.

Iran's English-language Press TV issued a vague, anonymous statement later on Monday, rejecting Macron's initiative.

GEN. KEANE: IT WAS 'SMALL' FOR MACRON TO INVITE IRAN'S FOREIGN MINISTER TO G-7 SUMMIT

Macron said he hoped Trump and Rouhani could meet within weeks in hopes of saving the 2015 nuclear deal that Tehran struck with world powers, but which the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from last year. Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

Since the U.S. pullout from the nuclear deal, Iran has lost billions of dollars in business deals allowed by the accord as the U.S. re-imposed and escalated sanctions largely blocking Tehran from selling crude abroad, a crucial source of hard currency for the Islamic Republic.

Rouhani's U-turn can be seen as a result of pressure from hard-liners in the Iranian establishment who oppose taking a softer tone toward the West.

The hard-line Javan daily, which is close to Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, warned Rouhani in large font on its Tuesday front page: ""Mr. Rouhani, photo diplomacy will not develop the country."""

John Kasich said Tuesday that he doesn't currently see a path that would lead him to defeat President Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination.

I think John's point is right. Abdication is a word I have used. Essentially the United States has gone from being the principal architect and general contractor of world order to now becoming the principal disruptor. The problem for the Europeans and the Japanese and others is they lack the capacity to subjects duty substitute for us. They do what they can. $20 million for Amazon fires which is a literal drop in the bucket. Without the United States in the driver's seat, we don't make a lot of progress. The gap between the challenges and the international responses is growing. That's the historical judgment about the G-7, which looks like a tired gathering.



I think the two immediate things I would highlight are the president walked back two big issues. The trade war, for the moment, with China and the threat of actual war with Iran. On both of those, I think there was a change from where he showed up in France and where he ended."

George Conway slams 'silly' Washington Post report on Barr booking holiday party at Trump Hotel,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/george-conway-slams-silly-washington-post-report-on-barr-booking-holiday-party-at-trump-hotel,"George Conway, husband to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, is not impressed with the Washington Post's latest scoop about Attorney General William Barr.

Conway, a conservative lawyer who routinely criticizes President Trump, argued with people on Twitter about Barr holding a family holiday party for 200 people at Trump International Hotel in December. He reasoned that it is an inconsequential story in comparison to the attorney general's role in the rollout of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia investigation.

""Frankly, this is a silly story. Barr is paying for the party out of his own pocket. The hotel is next door to DOJ. The notion that the small profit from this would improve his standing with Trump, especially given how Barr misled the public about the Mueller report, is absurd,"" Conway tweeted Tuesday.

A Justice Department official told the Post that Barr, who hosts a holiday party each year, is picking up the tab himself and only reserved space in the hotel after other prominent hotels in the city were booked. The official also said Barr was not trying to score points with his boss with his reservation, which could bring in more than $30,000 of business, but that did not stop critics from arguing the attorney general was making an ethically questionable decision.

""I respectfully disagree, George. It is a conflict,"" Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said in response to Conway. ""Barr giving a middle finger to any notion of independence. Imagine if Obama’s AG had given a $30,000 donation to the Clinton Foundation while there were qs about Hillary. Not even $ in their pockets. Defcon 1, appropriately so.""

""This party is trivial nonsense. Barr gave the middle finger to independence when he acted as a PR shill for the White House when he received the Mueller Report. That’s what we should be talking about,"" Conway shot back.

Before Mueller's report was released with redactions to the public in April, Barr put out a summary of the report's principal conclusions that said Mueller did not establish criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. Barr also concluded Mueller’s investigation did not find “sufficient” evidence to determine whether Trump obstructed justice. Critics have argued that Barr sought to mislead the public about Mueller's findings by establishing a narrative of Trump being cleared.

Still, Mueller's report laid out 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice. Although Mueller declined to say whether he committed obstruction, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted, Democrats in Congress argue the special counsel gave them a road map to impeachment.

In a flurry of follow-up tweets, Conway explained why he does not think the Post story deserves ""outrage.""

The “‘clear[ing]’ [by Barr of Trump] of obstruction despite never having tried a single case and overwhelming evidence”—that’s the outrage, by a factor of orders of magnitude. This party adds nothing to that. — George Conway (@gtconway3d) August 27, 2019

Maybe I’d be slightly concerned if there were nothing else going on here. But this is at most the flicking of a cigarette lighter while a series of five-alarm fires are burning down the neighborhood. Let’s have some perspective here. — George Conway (@gtconway3d) August 27, 2019

He also quipped that Trump saying he wants to host the 2020 G-7 meeting of international leaders at Trump Doral, a Florida resort the president owns, is outrageous.

Department of Energy awards Fermilab $3.5 million for quantum science,https://news.fnal.gov,[],,,,https://news.fnal.gov/2019/08/department-of-energy-awards-fermilab-3-5-million-for-quantum-science/,"The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded researchers at its Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory more than $3.5 million to boost research in the fast-emerging field of Quantum Information Science.

“Few pursuits have the revolutionary potential that quantum science presents,” said Fermilab Chief Research Officer Joe Lykken. “Fermilab’s expertise in quantum physics and cryogenic engineering is world-class, and combined with our experience in conventional computing and networks, we can advance quantum science in directions that not many other places can.”

As part of a number of grants to national laboratories and universities offered through its Quantum Information Science-Enabled Discovery (QuantISED) program, DOE’s recent round of funding to Fermilab covers three initiatives related to quantum science. It also funds Fermilab’s participation in a fourth initiative led by Argonne National Laboratory.

For a half-century, Fermilab researchers have closely studied the quantum realm and provided the computational and engineering capabilties needed to zoom in on nature at its most fundamental level. The projects announced by the Department of Energy will build on those capabilities, pushing quantum science and technology forward and leading to new discoveries that will enhance our picture of the universe at its smallest scale.

“Fermilab is well-versed in engineering, algorithmic development and recruiting massive computational resources to explore quantum-scale phenomena,” said Fermilab Head of Quantum Science Panagiotis Spentzouris. “Now we’re wrangling those competencies and capabilities to advance quantum science in many areas, and in a way that only a leading physics laboratory could.”

The Fermilab-led initiatives funded through these DOE QuantISED grants are:

Large Scale Simulations of Quantum Systems on High-Performance Computing with Analytics for High-Energy Physics Algorithms

Lead principal investigator: Adam Lyon, Fermilab

The large-scale simulation of quantum computers has plenty in common with simulations in high-energy physics: Both must sweep over a large number of variables. Both organize their inputs and outputs similarly. And in both cases, the simulation has to be analyzed and consolidated into results. Fermilab scientists, in collaboration with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, will use tools from high-energy physics to produce and analyze simulations using high-performance computers at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. Specifically, they will simulate the operation of a qubit device that uses superconducting cavities (which are also used as components in particle accelerators) to maintain quantum information over a relatively long time. Their results will determine the device’s impact on high-energy physics algorithms using an Argonne-developed quantum simulator.

Research Technology for Quantum Information Systems

Lead principal investigator: Gustavo Cancelo, Fermilab

One of the main challenges in quantum information science is designing an architecture that solves problems of massive interconnection, massive data processing and heat load. The electronics must be able to operate and interface with other electronics operating both at 4 kelvins and at near absolute zero. Fermilab scientists and engineers are designing novel electronic circuits as well as massive control and readout electronics to be compatible with quantum devices, such as sensors and quantum qubits. These circuits will enable many applications in the quantum information science field.

MAGIS-100 – co-led by Stanford University and Fermilab

Lead Fermilab principal investigator: Rob Plunkett

Fermilab will host a new experiment to test quantum mechanics on macroscopic scales of space and time. Scientists on the MAGIS-100 experiment will drop clouds of ultracold atoms down a 100-meter-long vacuum pipe on the Fermilab site, and use a stable laser to create an atom interferometer which will look for dark matter made of ultralightweight particles. They will also advance a technique for gravitational-wave detection at relatively low frequencies.

This is a joint venture under the collaboration leadership of Stanford University Professor Jason Hogan, who is funded by grant GBMF7945 from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Rob Plunkett of Fermilab serves as the project manager.

Other participating institutions: Northern Illinois University, Northwestern University, Stanford University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Liverpool

Fermilab was also funded to participate in another initiative led by Argonne National Laboratory:

Quantum Sensors for Wide Band Axion Dark Matter Detection

Lead principal investigator: Peter Barry, Argonne

Researchers are searching high and low for dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up a quarter of our universe. One theory proposes that it could be made of particles called axions, which would signal their presence by converting into particles of light, called photons. Fermilab researchers are part of a team developing specialized detectors that look for photons in the terahertz range — at frequencies just below the infrared. The development of these detectors will widen the range of frequencies where axions may be discovered. To bring the faint signals to the fore, the team is using supersensitive quantum amplifiers.

Brighton water treatment plant out of compliance with EPA standards for 3 consecutive years,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/brighton-in-violation-of-epa-drinking-water-standards-for-3-consecutive-years-according-to-report,"BRIGHTON, Colo. -- We knew the water in Brighton was expensive, now - it turns out - it could be dangerous, too.

The same city that could see its mayor recalled over sky-high water bills now admits it was out of compliance with EPA water treatment standards for 3 years.

The water scandal continues to mystify even some who sit on the current council.

""The residents don't trust the city,"" said councilman Matt Johnston. ""I, as a city council representative, do not trust our city.""

The latest issue to surface is an EPA summary which concludes Brighton had ""Significant/Category 1"" violations for 12 consecutive quarters.

A city spokeswoman said late Monday those violations are for treated discharge that goes back into the river, not the drinking water.

But, Brighton's former city manager said late Monday that the reverse osmosis treatment facility also supplies Brighton with drinking water, so any violation at the plant should be concerning.

""Someone's at serious risk if the plant is that out of compliance,"" said former city manager Philip Rodriguez, who was fired in the midst of this scandal back in July. ""Either Brighton or its neighbors downstream.""

The city told Denver7 on Tuesday those issues were resolved and the treatment facility is now in compliance.

""We cannot say that 100% for sure all of our water is safe,"" Johnston said. ""We can't say that.""

And, in fact, just last week the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment required Brighton to send a letter to residents warning them about a dangerous back flow issue that could impact the drinking water supply.

For homeowner's like Jeremy Torgerson, it's mind-boggling.

""You don't want to cook with it, give it to your kids, your dog or anything,"" Torgerson said. ""I don't know how many more punches the residents have to take from their own city before we finally decide that we've had enough.""

The ongoing scandal has resulted in a flood of problems at city hall including the discovery of a $70 million fund from possible water billing overcharges and the subsequent firing of the city manager.

And now – there will be a recall election of the current mayor who insists the water is safe.

""The water here in Brighton is safe,"" said Mayor Ken Kreutzer. ""I drink it. My children drink it. My grandson drinks it. This is another gross exaggeration.""

But Johnston and others, like Torgerson, are no longer going with the flow. They insist city hall is corrupt.

""I'm tired of the backroom,"" Johnston said. ""It's time for the public to know everything about our water system - if it's safe, if it's clean, where the money's at and what it's being spent for.""

And while the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment hasn't issued a boil order, Johnston believes it's only a matter of time.

""This is a pre-boil warning type of scenario,"" Johnston said.

""The city government no longer functions,"" Torgerson said. ""This a basic function of a utility department to make sure the water that goes out is safe. They overcharge, and now we have to drink bottled water.""

Johnston says those who are sick should be particularly cautious.

""They're going through chemotherapy, and they do not know if they should be boiling their water at this point,"" Johnston said."
Dudley encourages the Fed to help sway the 2020 election against Trump,https://www.cnbc.com,['Jeff Cox'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/dudley-encourages-the-fed-not-to-play-along-with-trumps-trade-war.html,"William C. Dudley, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Former New York Fed President Bill Dudley is calling on the central bank not to help President Donald Trump fight his trade war with China.

In a sharply worded commentary to his one-time colleagues, Dudley urged Fed officials not to lower interest rates simply as a backstop while the president continues his tit-for-tat tariff battle with the Chinese that has escalated in recent days.

""Central bank officials face a choice: enable the Trump administration to continue down a disastrous path of trade war escalation, or send a clear signal that if the administration does so, the president, not the Fed, will bear the risks — including the risk of losing the next election,"" he wrote in a post on the Bloomberg News site.

Dudley went so far as to suggest the Fed could — and should — try to influence the next election against Trump.

""After all, Trump's reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed's independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,"" he wrote. ""If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.""

A Fed spokesman said the central bank does not use politics as a guide for its decisions.

""The Federal Reserve's policy decisions are guided solely by its congressional mandate to maintain price stability and maximum employment. Political considerations play absolutely no role,"" the official said in a statement.

Some economists criticized Dudley's statement as inappropriate for a former central banker.

""We fear that the opinion column ... is likely to prove counterproductive for the current Fed leadership, which we are confident had no hand in the production of the opinion piece and has had to deny immediately that 'political considerations' play any part in policymaking,"" Krishna Guha, head of global policy at central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment."

""Website is being updated. There has been no change to our policy,"" a State Department official said in a statement. Asked whether the listing would be added back to the website, the official reiterated that the site is being updated.

It is unclear when exactly the listing for the territories, which was once included as one of the ""countries and other areas"" under the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, was removed. It was active until at least February 2019, according to an archived version of the page. The State Department unveiled its modernized website in June 2019, and the link for the Palestinian Territories now redirects to a message about that modernization.

""Welcome to state.gov. We recently modernized our website. Part of this modernization was to reduce the number of pages on the current state.gov website by not moving items that are in existence on our archive sites.

However, as we’ve learned, stability in the cryptocurrency market doesn’t last long. According to Google Trends, interest in Bitcoin has been declining since 2017. Looking at data from recent months, we can even identify a trend similar to that of early 2017.

Still, the question remains – where did the money that catalyzed Bitcoin’s surge in 2019 come from? Rumors and internet conspiracies circulate, suggesting that inside information leaked from Facebook about the launch of its Libra cryptocurrency and created a trend change before the announcement and the associated hype.

When it comes to altcoins, the downtrend seems to have been halted this week as Binance announced the launch of a digital currency lending system, with its first two products being BNB and USDT. Surprisingly, users will be able to lend ETC, which explains its price increase. Wanchain also stood out this week, gaining more than 100% and occupying the 88th spot on the list of the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin has maintained its dominance, and it’s still too early to talk about a change in the trend with respect to the altcoin markets, as Bitcoin hasn’t yet completed its move which began at the beginning of the year.

The trading volume is declining, and investors fear this trend will continue. Of course, there may also be those who are already plotting another move behind the scenes. Events such as Telegram’s coin launch, a recession, or the Bitcoin halving could certainly send Bitcoin’s price to new heights. The future won’t be boring, that’s for sure.

Meanwhile, the Kleiman v. Wright case is also seemingly coming to an end, as a judge ruled against Wright, who might have to pay 500,000 BTC to the brother of an old business partner. The sum is currently worth upwards of $5 billion, and almost half of that might need to be used to pay taxes, which could impact Bitcoin’s price in the short term.

Altcoins Comprise Only 10% of the Crypto Market, Not 30%. According to a new study, the relative share of all altcoins in the overall cryptocurrency market isn’t 30%, but merely 10%.

Weill Family Foundation announces public-private partnership with Energy Department on artificial intelligence,https://www.cnbc.com,['Riya Bhattacharjee'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/weill-foundation-announces-public-private-partnership-with-dept-of-energy-on-artificial-intelligence.html,"The Department of Energy and the Weill Family Foundation on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding for a new public-private partnership which will use the agency's artificial intelligence capabilities for biomedical research.

Former Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill and Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC's ""Closing Bell "" in an exclusive interview that the partnership aims to improve the diagnosis of brain diseases and neurological disorders, which would result in more effective treatment.

""As one looks at science and the development of new science, especially AI and computing, you really need to have partners to make things work."" Weill said. ""It's too expensive for anybody to try to do it by themselves.""

The partnership between the federal government and the Weill Family Foundation, involves Lawrence Livermore, Lawrence Berkeley and Argonne National laboratories, and was announced during a roundtable on DOE-fueled artificial intelligence at Lawrence Livermore Lab in Livermore, California.

The Department of Energy is currently home to the fastest supercomputers in the world.

The partnership aims to have new computers ready by 2022 that would run 15 times faster than current speeds.

""It will really break the logjam, especially as it related to neurodegenerative diseases,"" Weill said. ""And with everybody doing better, with the cancer research and with cardiovascular research, people are going to live longer. And we are all going to get these neurodegenerative diseases over time. And what we are working on is to prevent that because it would just be too costly.""

Perry said in the next 18 to 24 months, the department will have computers coming on board that will be between 50 to 100 times faster than today's computers. ""The improvement in health care, particularly in brain science, is going to be monumental, it's going to be world changing,"" Perry said.

Weill added it was important for the U.S. to beat China in this field.

When asked about current U.S.-China trade relations, Weill said it was important for the United States and China to figure out a way to get along with each other. ""With the two countries partnering for the future, I think we will end up with a better world, a safer world."""

(Aug. 26) AP, AP

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump over the weekend didn't waste a spare moment to make headlines while in France for the G-7 summit.

At the gathering in Biarritz, France, which ended Monday, Trump suggested his wife, first lady Melania Trump, knew North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, skipped a meeting on climate change and even floated the idea of holding the G-7 at his Florida resort in 2020.

Here is a round-up of Trump's weekend in France:

Trump only leader not at G-7 climate meeting

The president on Monday skipped out on a meeting on climate, biodiversity and oceans, that all other world leader attended.

Trump's seat was the only empty chair at the meeting.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the president had other scheduled meetings ""so a senior member of the administration attended in his stead.”

In addition, the president has reportedly told aides that the meeting of world leaders has focused too intensely on climate and other environmental issues.

Hours later, Trump said during a press conference that his first priority is to maintain the United States' wealth and not trade it for climate initiatives.

""It's tremendous wealth,"" Trump said. ""I'm not going to lose that wealth. I'm not going to lose it on dreams and windmills, which, frankly, aren't working too well.""

CLOSE President Donald Trump dismissed concerns about climate change at the G7 summit in France Monday, saying he's ""not going to lose"" America's wealth ""on dreams"" and ""windmills."" He skipped a session on the topic earlier in the day. (Aug. 26) AP, AP

Trump floats his Florida golf resort as possible location for next year's G-7

Trump said Monday that his golf resort in Doral, Florida, is a top contender to host next year's G-7 summit. The U.S. is hosting next year's conference and the host city for the summit has not yet been chosen.

The president touted Trump National Doral Miami, a golf resort and hotel, for its location and ""incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants.""

When confronted with ethical questions about using his properties for official business, Trump brushed them aside.

He claimed, without evidence, that he is losing billions of dollars each year in the White House.

""Probably it'll cost me anywhere from three to five billion dollars to be president,"" Trump said. ""The only thing I care about is this country – couldn't care less, otherwise I wouldn't have done it.""

'Right man for the job': Trump talks trade with Boris Johnson at G-7 summit in France

Trump says Melania Trump knows Kim Jong Un 'well.' The two have never met.

Trump suggested Monday that his wife knew North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ""extremely well.""

""Kim Jong Un — who I’ve gotten to know extremely well; the first lady has gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she’d agree with me — he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential,” Trump said Monday during a news conference.

The only issue: Melania Trump and Kim have never met.

The White House later clarified the president's remarks.

“President Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim — and while the First Lady hasn’t met him, the President feels like she’s gotten to know him too,"" Grisham said in a statement.

Are Trump and Iran going to meet?

French President Emmanuel Macron expressed hope to set up a meeting between Trump and Iranian leaders in the ""coming weeks."" His comments came after Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif unexpectedly arrived Sunday in France during the G-7 summit.

Macron said that he sensed Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was willing to meet with Trump.

'A slap in the face': Trump's ethanol waivers are sparking rebellion in farm country

Tensions between the U.S. and Iran have continued to increase over the past several weeks. Both countries claimed to shoot down each other's drones in recent weeks. In addition, the U.S. and its allies condemned Iran’s seizure of foreign ships traveling through the Strait of Hormuz.

On Monday, Trump didn't commit to a meeting but said he had ""good feelings about Iran.""

However on Tuesday, Rouhani said that he will only be willing to meet with Trump if the U.S. lifts their sanctions on the country.

“Without the U.S.’s withdrawal from sanctions, we will not witness any positive development,” Rouhani said.

Sens. Blumenthal and Klobuchar Call on Justice Dept. to Investigate Ticketing Industry: Exclusive,https://www.billboard.com,['Dave Brooks'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/8528501/ticket-industry-investigation-doj-senators-letter,"Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., holds up her hand to speak as she shares a note with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., right, during a Senate Judiciary Committee markup meeting on Capitol Hill on Sept. 13, 2018 in Washington, DC.

Democratic law makers say the 2010 Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger was ""bad for consumers"" and want the consent decree extended.

Two Democratic U.S. senators are asking the Department of Justice to open an investigation into ticketing, saying they have ""serious concerns that online ticket markets are not working for American consumers.""

While the letter from Sens. Richard Blumenthal of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota asks assistant attorney general Makan Delrahim with the DOJ's antitrust division to look at overall competition in the ticketing business, the letter is squarely aimed at one company: Live Nation. The concert promoter merged with Ticketmaster in 2010 and has operated under a DOJ consent decree, set to expire in July, that bars Live Nation from withholding concerts and tours from buildings that don’t use Ticketmaster, or retailiating when venues go with a competitor.

""The consent decree has been criticized as ineffective, and there have been disturbing reports that Live Nation has flouted its conditions,” the letter reads, saying the soon-to-expire deal -- negotiated between Live Nation’s attorneys and former assistant attorney general Christine Varney -- leaves ""Live Nation’s dominance virtually unchallenged.”

Blumenthal and Klobuchar want the DOJ to ""investigate the state of competition in the ticketing industry"" and potentially extend the consent decree past July 2020, a move Live Nation would likely oppose. The requested anti-trust inquiry comes at a time when senators and presidential candidates are calling for investigations of large tech companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook for monopolistic business practices with Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris arguing the tech giants should be broken up.

""The Department of Justice should act to reinvigorate competition in the ticket market to help consumers,” reads Blumenthal and Klobuchar's five-page letter, calling for the DOJ to ""enforce the terms of the Ticketmaster-Live Nation consent decree, including the anti-retaliation merger conditions” and ""not hesitate to seek appropriate remedies to ensure compliance with the merger conditions.”

Live Nation’s compliance with the 2010 decree has been under investigation for several years, amid complaints from competitors about the company’s dominance in live music, sources tell Billboard. DOJ officials have never charged Live Nation with violating the consent decree and aren't expected to before the decree expires next year. Without any formal charges that Live Nation broke the agreement, it's unlikely DOJ officials would be able to convince a judge to find Live Nation in contempt of the agreement, or to extend the consent decree any further, sources tell Billboard.

Critics of the consent decree said its enforcement mechanism is weakened because Live Nation is allowed to prioritize tours for venues that use Ticketmaster, just as AEG tries to do with its tours. That makes proving that Live Nation retiliated against a venue increasingly difficult, although several promoters and competing ticketing companies have met with DOJ officials to express their concerns.

The 2010 deal also required Ticketmaster to license its technology to competitor AEG to create its own rival ticketing system, although AEG’s former CEO Tim Leiweke ended the license and pursued an agreement with Outbox, Cirque du Soleil’s ticketing system and later with Veritix, owned by Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. The agreement also required Ticketmaster to spin off ticketing firm Paciolan to a company owned by cable giant Comcast and ticketing companies like Eventbrite, Ticketfly and SeatGeek who have won clients from the Ticketmaster, but no company has come close to challenging Ticketmaster’s dominance in live entertainment.

That’s brought increased scrutiny to Ticketmaster and a series of critical reports, cited by the senators in their letters, from groups like the American Antitrust Institute and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, as well as media reports about the company’s adherence to the decree and growing business in the secondary market.

Blumenthal also wants the DOJ to ""conduct an investigation into the state of competition in the ticketing marketplace"" looking at ""the effects of past consolidation and an assessment of how the available antitrust enforcement tools may be used to help restore competition.""

Live Nation declined to comment for this story."

The State Department on Monday announced the political scientist Peter Berkowitz as the head of policy planning, a post that puts him in charge of long-term strategic thinking for the department.

Berkowitz, who was already working in the Office of Policy Planning, will replace his former boss, Kiron Skinner, who was dismissed earlier this month over concerns about her management style.

Story Continued Below

The announcement came in an internal email to select State Department officials on Monday morning, according to one of those officials.

Berkowitz, who has taught both constitutional law and political philosophy, came to the State Department from Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is the author of four books on subjects ranging from conservatism and progressivism to the ethics of Nietzsche.

Under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Department of Policy Planning — which has historically operated as the State Department’s internal think tank — played a key role in the day-to-day management of the department.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who works closely with a team of special envoys, has returned it to its traditional role of churning out papers and proposals on long-range strategic issues.

Department of Energy Announces $21.4 Million for Quantum Information Science Research,https://www.energy.gov,[],,,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-announces-214-million-quantum-information-science-research,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $21.4 million in funding for research in Quantum Information Science (QIS) related to both particle physics and fusion energy sciences.

“QIS holds great promise for tackling challenging questions in a wide range of disciplines,” said Under Secretary for Science Paul Dabbar. “This research will open up important new avenues of investigation in areas like artificial intelligence while helping keep American science on the cutting edge of the growing field of QIS.”

Funding of $12 million will be provided for 21 projects of two to three years’ duration in particle physics. Efforts will range from the development of highly sensitive quantum sensors for the detection of rare particles, to the use of quantum computing to analyze particle physics data, to quantum simulation experiments connecting the cosmos to quantum systems.

Funding of $9.4 million will be provided for six projects of up to three years in duration in fusion energy sciences. Research will examine the application of quantum computing to fusion and plasma science, the use of plasma science techniques for quantum sensing, and the quantum behavior of matter under high-energy-density conditions, among other topics.

Fiscal Year 2019 funding for the two initiatives totals $18.4 million, with out-year funding for the three-year particle physics projects contingent on congressional appropriations.

Projects were selected by competitive peer review under two separate Funding Opportunity Announcements (and corresponding announcements for DOE laboratories) sponsored respectively by the Office of High Energy Physics and the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences with the Department’s Office of Science.

A list of particle physics projects can be found here and fusion energy sciences projects here, both under the heading “What’s New.”

In an editorial, Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, said as president he would seek a moratorium on approving mergers of major media corporations, more funding for “non-profit civic-minded media” and moves to prevent Facebook and Google from siphoning off advertising revenues from news organizations.

Sanders also said he would limit the number of stations that large broadcasting corporations can own in each market and nationwide, and require media corporations to disclose whether their merger proposals would involve “significant” journalism layoffs.

“Today, after decades of consolidation and deregulation, just a small handful of companies control almost everything you watch, read, and download,” Sanders said in a Columbia Journalism Review editorial published on Monday.

“Given that reality, we should not want even more of the free press to be put under the control of a handful of corporations and ‘benevolent’ billionaires who can use their media empires to punish their critics and shield themselves from scrutiny.”

The proposal comes after Sanders earlier this month linked his criticism of Amazon.com Inc, which he has attacked for its tax breaks and wage policies, to what he said was unfair coverage of his campaign by the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon owner Jeff Bezos. The Post has denied that Bezos influences news coverage.

In the column, Sanders made a reference to the Post and to Walt Disney Co television properties.

“News outlets owned by Disney and Jeff Bezos may happily tout Disney films and Bezos’s plans for space exploration, but we cannot count on them to consistently and aggressively cover workers’ fight for better wages at Disney- or Bezos-controlled companies,” he said.

Sanders, a prominent progressive leader, frequently criticizes big tech firms and corporate influence. He is a top-tier contender among more than 20 candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in November 2020.

Sanders decried job losses in the U.S. journalism industry, citing studies that found 1,400 communities have lost newspapers in the last 15 years and newsrooms have lost 28,000 employees since 2008.

“One reason we do not have enough real journalism in America right now is because many outlets are being gutted by the same forces of greed that are pillaging our economy,” Sanders wrote.

Before mergers were approved, he would require that employees be given the opportunity to purchase media outlets through employee stock-ownership plans. He also would block any mergers or deregulations that would disproportionately affect people of color and women, he said."
Trump claims he has 'absolute right' to order US companies out of China under 1977 law,https://www.cnn.com,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],08-24-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/24/politics/trump-china-trade-war-emergency-economic-powers-act/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump claimed he has the ""absolute right"" to ""order"" US companies to stop doing business with China that would involve using his broad executive authority in a new and unprecedented way under a 1977 law.

On Friday, China unveiled a new round of retaliatory tariffs on about $75 billion worth of US goods, the latest escalation in an on-going trade war that's putting a strain on the world's two largest economies. In response, Trump wrote on Twitter later Friday: ""Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China including bringing ...your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.""

When leaving the White House for the G7 summit in France, Trump told reporters, ""I have the absolute right to do that, but we'll see how it goes."" He later explained that he was referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and in a Friday tweet wrote: ""For all of the Fake News Reporters that don't have a clue as to what the law is relative to Presidential powers, China, etc., try looking at the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Case closed!""

Trump's latest comments again raise questions as to how far the President's authority goes under the IEEPA . In May, Trump threatened to slap Mexico with punitive tariffs unless it slowed the passage of migrants from Central America to the US. The IEEPA, according to the Congressional Research Service, has never been invoked to impose tariffs, and Trump ultimately drew back at the last minute.

The IEEPA, passed in the wake of Watergate and Vietnam, gives Trump ""broad authority to regulate a variety of economic transactions following a declaration of national emergency,"" according to an analysis by the CRS.

Those presidential powers can be used ""to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat....to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.""

Under the IEEPA, the President has to consult with Congress before invoking his authority and, after declaring a national emergency, send a report to Congress explaining why.

This authority has been used frequently; there have been 54 national emergencies, 29 of which are ongoing. In the first use of the IEEPA, during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, President Jimmy Carter imposed trade sanctions against Iran, freezing Iranian assets in the US, according to CRS.

Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas and a CNN legal analyst, told CNN in May that what Trump wanted to do under the law with Mexico may have been within the authority given to the White House by Congress -- though it might not have been what Congress ever intended.

""The idea behind these authorities is that the President is better situated to make those kinds of determinations than Congress, especially when they're time-sensitive,"" Vladeck told CNN at the time. ""So I think the President's conduct may well be within the letter of the law here. But, as with the National Emergencies Act, I very much doubt this kind of exercise of the authority conferred by the statute is what Congress had in mind.""

On Saturday, Vladeck again weighed in, tweeting: ""One of the enduring phenomena of the Trump era is going to be the list of statutes that give far too much power to the President, but that many didn't used to worry about—assuming there'd be political safeguards. Today's entrant: The International Emergency Economic Powers Act.""

Under the law, though, Congress can end an emergency with a joint resolution.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who has mounted a longshot bid against Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, called it ""outrageous"" that a US President would tell US companies how to conduct business."
Proposed 836 extension gets slammed by EPA: ‘unacceptable adverse secondary impacts’ to the Everglades,https://www.miamiherald.com,[],,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article234428567.html,"Conflicts of the proposed Dolphin/836 Expressway extension with the Everglades restoration plan Celeste De Palma, Director of Everglades Policy of Audubon Florida, talks about conflicts of the proposed Dolphin/836 Expressway extension Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK Celeste De Palma, Director of Everglades Policy of Audubon Florida, talks about conflicts of the proposed Dolphin/836 Expressway extension

Federal environmental regulators have joined critics of Miami-Dade’s proposal to run a major freeway through wetlands, saying the plan to construct the Kendall Parkway poses “substantial and unacceptable adverse secondary impacts to the Greater Everglades.”

In a letter last week to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency said a six-lane toll in West Kendall would produce direct impacts to 350 acres of freshwater wetlands in the Bird Drive Basin, an area that’s key to guaranteeing drinking water for Miami and the Florida Keys. The EPA considers the area an “aquatic resource of national importance.“

The questions from the EPA are only the latest hurdles for a project that already under fire from legal challenges, political disputes and forecasts that traffic improvements would be limited.

The letter was sent in response to a permit application to build over the wetlands by Miami-Dade Expressway Authority, or MDX, the county toll agency that proposed the roadway.

In the Aug. 23 letter, the EPA said that MDX proposal came up short of analysis on several fronts: There was not sufficient information on alternatives to minimize environmental impacts. The agency had failed to show that the project complies with environmental regulation that would allow for the degradation of wetlands. The EPA also asked MDX to explain if it had considered the effects from potential induced development in the areas that surround the proposed highway.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in the midst of reviewing MDX’s application to build over protected wetlands. Public comments closed on Aug. 23. The Corps will make the final decision on issuing a permit.

Javier Rodriguez, the MDX director, downplayed the letter during a meeting of the board Tuesday, only the second since a Florida judge reinstated the government agency after a new state law dissolved it for a new toll board called the Greater Miami Expressway Agency. The law, signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and backed by Miami-Dade Republicans in Tallahassee, is suspended pending an appeal of the Aug. 9 lower-court decision that declared the legislation unconstitutional.

Rodriguez said the MDX can provide EPA administrators the information needed to answer questions raised by the regulator. “They basically asked for information. We have that information,” Rodriguez said. “Our study effectively addresses all the concerns they have.”

The EPA letter draws the latest fault line in a highway debate that has divided some of Miami-Dade’s most prominent Republicans. On the one side is county Mayor Carlos Gimenez, the MDX’s appointed chairman who has led the charge to win county approval of the highway and tried to rally public support behind the $1 billion effort.

On the other is U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who got his political start in Miami and touted the EPA’s letter in a Twitter post over the weekend all but declaring the 836 project dead. “Without EPA concurrence,” Rubio wrote, the Army Corps “will not approve #CleanWaterAct permits for #KendallParkway construction in Bird Road Basin.”

Gimenez questioned the confrontational role his fellow Republican has taken toward the 836 extension while not objecting to a trio of new toll roads approved by the Florida legislature this year for Florida. “He’s very focused on the Kendall Parkway, but he’s not focused at all on hundreds of miles of highway running through environmentally sensitive land,” Gimenez said during a break in the meeting. Rubio’s office had no immediate comment.

Bird Drive Basin was once part of the Shark River Slough, the main artery for water flow in the Everglades. It’s used to recharge the region’s shallow Biscayne aquifer, the only drinking water source for communities in Miami-Dade and Miccosukee Tribe. It’s also home to native animals, wading birds and rare plants.

“Freshwater wetlands are essential to the region because they provide important water quality and wildlife benefits, and serve as a filtration system that protect bodies of water,” Jeaneanne Gettle, Director of EPA’s Water Division in Atlanta, wrote in the letter.

Because of its key location and the functions that it serves, Bird Drive Basin is part of the Everglades Restoration Plan, and was earmarked for restoration work to reestablish water flow south through the river of grass. Much of that land is already owned by the South Florida Water Management District and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Miccosukee also own land acquired to restore the tribe’s historic homelands.

Environmentalists and a developer sued MDX and Miami-Dade, arguing the project would violate the county’s growth management plan. They warned that allowing the road to get so close to the Everglades would encourage more suburban sprawl and development that could endanger protected wetlands.

South Florida water managers and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection had already raised red flags over the lack of details about the impact of the road on natural resources, water supply and flood control."

Reed asks U.S. Justice Department to investigate Cuomo over refusal to fix Thruway,https://buffalonews.com,['Harold Mcneil'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://buffalonews.com/2019/08/27/tom-reed-cuomo-road-seneca-nation-thruway-money/,"Rep. Tom Reed is asking U.S. Attorney General William Barr to investigate Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo over the state's lack of action in repairing a crumbling three-mile stretch of the Thruway on the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation in Erie and Chautauqua counties.

Reed, who was joined Tuesday by Chautauqua County Executive George M. Borrello outside the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York in Buffalo, told reporters that Cuomo is holding the traveling public hostage in the governor's dispute with the Seneca Nation of Indians over casino gaming revenues. A portion of the road runs through territory owned by the Senecas.

Cuomo last week vowed not to fix the road because it might give the Senecas an excuse not to pay $255 million in casino revenues the governor says they owe the state and local governments.

""I don't want to give them a reason to say New York breached the agreement by coming onto I-90 when they had no right to come onto I-90. That could actually jeopardize our position on the revenues,"" Cuomo is reported to have said during an Aug. 20 news conference in Wilson.

Reed Tuesday said that is a tacit admission by the governor that exacting political revenge is the motivation behind not repairing the stretch of the I-90 between Exits 57A and 58, even though the U.S. Department of Transportation has allocated millions of dollars for the repairs.

""This is an unrelated matter that does not need to be mixed up with the traveling public safety on that interstate, and so we are asking the Department of Justice to investigate this potential misuse of dollars that have been rightfully allocated to this interstate at the federal level, but have not been deployed to fix this road,"" Reed said.

""To put the traveling public at risk is just wrong. It's time to fix that road (and) make sure that our public safety is paramount,"" he added.

Reed, a Corning Republican, said the Democratic governor's statement contradicts a statement made earlier this month by Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said the Thruway issue is independent of the dispute with the Senecas.

Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to the governor, issued a statement Tuesday in response to Reed's allegations.

""Weaponizing law enforcement to score dumb political points may be what the congressman's buddy, the president, does, but it doesn't mean it's right,"" Azzopardi said.

""He should stop with the cheap stunts, do his job, represent his constituents and demand that the Senecas pay their fair share under the arbitration they agreed to,"" Azzopardi added.

Meanwhile, Borrello, on Tuesday, said he has heard from numerous motorists who travel the stretch of road who have experienced broken tie rods and other damage to their vehicles, as well as losing control of their vehicles.

""The fact that they are paying for the right to have their cars damaged and risk their lives is absolutely unacceptable,"" Borrello said.

""This is something that has been ignored largely by the governor for the last three years, at least. And now we're talking about it again,"" Borrello added.

Meanwhile, Reed said he wants the U.S. Department of Justice to not only look into potential misuse of powers he alleges may have been committed the governor regarding the Thruway issue, but also the potential misappropriation of federal funds.

""If that money, tens of millions of dollars, has come to the state, has been duly appropriated and authorized by the federal government, where are those dollars? Where are they sitting? Have they been applied to other sources?"" said Reed."
United States Department of Defense Increases Deployment of Rekor Technology,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-states-department-defense-increases-113000911.html,"Expands use of Rekor’s proprietary vehicle recognition software to enhance existing camera networks following successful initial engagement

COLUMBIA, MD / ACCESSWIRE / August 27, 2019 / Rekor Systems, Inc, (REKR) (‘Rekor”) a Nasdaq company focused on bringing smarter, faster, cost-competitive solutions to the worlds of public safety and customer experience, announced today it has received a purchase order from the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide an additional 200 camera licenses for the Company’s vehicle recognition system. The DoD has now doubled its total camera licenses from Rekor, having originally purchased 200 licenses to use the Company’s machine-learning enabled vehicle recognition system in May of this year.

“We believe that both the initial selection and the rapid subsequent second purchase by the DoD confirms what we’ve long known about our technology - that it is the most robust vehicle recognition system on the market and a critical tool to support the important work of the world’s preeminent defense department,” said Robert A. Berman, President and CEO of Rekor. “Our solutions are easy to integrate, highly scalable and very cost efficient. By deploying our software within their existing infrastructure, our customers, including the DoD, can markedly enhance the functionality of their existing IP cameras by adding the most powerful vehicle recognition system in the world. What’s more, it’s all done without sacrificing any of the functionality of the existing system or the need to purchase new, expensive hardware.”

Rekor’s software enables automatic license plate and vehicle recognition through virtually any IP camera. Its industry-leading artificial intelligence-based solutions can be hosted locally or in the cloud. Enabled by machine learning from its robust and growing database covering over 70 countries, Rekor’s software can identify in real time vehicle license plate data, color, make, model and body type.

Rather than buying expensive cameras that take weeks or months to ship and install, Rekor’s software can be deployed to any existing IP camera immediately. This can represent a potential savings of tens of thousands of dollars per camera, as well as greater flexibility to expand or decrease usage as needed without large capital expenditures on hardware. It also eliminates the need for two separate cameras - one for lice plate reading functionality, one for general surveillance recording - as Rekor’s solution can be used to collect license plate data and information such as the make, model, and color of a vehicle using the same camera that provides surveillance monitoring.
