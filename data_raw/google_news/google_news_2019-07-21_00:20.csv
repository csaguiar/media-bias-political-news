Opinion | How Democrats Defeat Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Frank Bruni'],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/opinion/sunday/trump-squad-democrats-2020.html,"According to a May analysis by Catalist, a data-analysis firm, 89 percent of the Democratic vote gain in 2018 was from swing voters . That’s just one set of numbers, one way to slice the pie, but it does raise questions about the progressive insistence that partisan turnout and a surge in new voters, attracted by bold policy positions, is the path to victory in 2020.

There’s something else funky about that insistence — about the theory that a more progressive Democratic nominee would get all the votes that Hillary Clinton did in 2016 plus ones from people who stayed home in disaffection and much of the left-wing spoiler Jill Stein’s share. A more progressive nominee might lose some of the votes that Clinton did get. Who’s to say that the math, in the end, would be all that favorable?

But that hasn’t stopped the leftward lunge of leading contenders for the Democratic nomination, several of whom want “Medicare for all” and many of whom support the decriminalization of illegal border crossings.

That puts them on shaky ground. Polling has shown that when voters are told that Medicare for all would mean an end to private insurance or an increase in taxes, support for it drops below 40 percent.

And according to a Politico/Morning Consult survey published a few days ago, 51 percent of voters support the sweeping raids by ICE that the president trumpets, while just 35 percent oppose them. That suggests that anything that smacks of open borders — which is how President Barack Obama’s secretary for homeland security, Jeh Johnson, described Democratic presidential candidates’ positions in a recent op-ed essay in The Washington Post — puts those candidates at odds with public opinion. Voters see them answering Trump’s extremism with extremism of a different kind.

Which isn’t entirely wrong. Reeling from the ugliness of his actions and words — which are meant to make them reel — Democrats want to repudiate him as forcefully as possible. But that can lead to a reaction that’s neither smart politics nor good policy.

Nancy Pelosi knows this. It’s why she hasn’t been talking up the Green New Deal, single-payer insurance or impeachment, and the suggestion that this makes her some squishy centrist pushover — some musty relic from a timid era — is bunk. She has her eyes on the most meaningful prize, one she pursued successfully in the midterms: Democratic victory. And she can see that in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll published a little over a week ago, just 21 percent of registered voters said that there was enough evidence for Congress to begin impeachment hearings."
Trump met a lot of refugees and seemed to learn about their crises for the very first time,https://www.vox.com,['Jul'],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.vox.com/2019/7/20/20701802/donald-trump-nadia-murad-yazidi-uighur-rohingya-refugees-iraq-china-myanmar,"In a meeting with victims of religious persecution on Wednesday, President Donald Trump repeatedly appeared to be unaware of many of the world’s most pressing humanitarian crises.

Trump met with more than two dozen survivors of religious conflict, a few of whom told their stories — and made impassioned entreaties for aid — directly to the president. As he asked questions of his guests, the president seemed to reveal a stark lack of familiarity with the fundamental details of problems faced by Rohingya in Myanmar, Uighurs in China, and Yazidis in Iraq — groups in crisis that his own administration has established positions and policies on.

On multiple occasions, Trump asked refugees among the group where the conflicts they were fleeing were taking place.

Mohib Ullah, a Rohingya man who had escaped violence in Myanmar, explained that he was staying in a refugee camp in neighboring Bangladesh and asked the president what his plans are to help his beleaguered people. Trump replied by asking, “And where is that, exactly? Where?”

It was unclear if Trump was referring to the country that Ullah had fled or was staying in, but Ullah repeated that he was staying in Bangladesh, and Sam Brownback, the US ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, attempted to intervene by explaining that Bangladesh is “next to Burma [an older term for Myanmar]” and that “the Rohingya have been run out.”

The president replied, “Thank you, appreciate it,” and moved on without ever answering Ullah’s question.

The Trump administration’s official position is that Myanmar has engaged in “ethnic cleansing” of the Rohingya, a long-persecuted Muslim minority group, and it has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on its military leaders for their human rights abuses.

In fact, just one day before Trump’s meeting, the administration announced new sanctions barring military leaders from Myanmar from entering the US because of their extrajudicial killings of Rohingya. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the new sanctions were being levied because he and the rest of the administration “remain concerned that the Burmese government has taken no actions to hold accountable those responsible for human rights violations and abuses, and there are continued reports of the Burmese military committing human rights violations and abuses throughout the country.”

Trump, however, did not mention these sanctions to Ullah, and based on his questions, did not appear to be overly familiar with the conflict between the Rohingya and the government and military of Myanmar in the first place.

Trump also seemed almost entirely unacquainted with the oppression of Uighurs, China’s predominantly Muslim minority.

When Jewher Ilham, a Uighur woman, said that millions of her people have been locked up in “concentration camps” and that she hadn’t seen her detained father since 2013, Trump again replied as if he was hearing about the crisis for the first time.

“Where is that? Where is that in China?” he asked.

After Ilham explained that Uighurs live in western China in the Xinjiang province, Trump proceeded to ask her how long her father had been gone, even though Ilham had told him in her introduction.

After a brief back-and-forth about how often Ilham communicated with her father, Trump declared, “That’s tough stuff,” and moved on.

China treats its entire Uighur population as a national security threat and has established one of the most high-tech and invasive surveillance regimes in the world to regulate it. The Pentagon has described the mass detainment of Uighurs as “concentration camps,” and they have been a major point of tension between the US and China as they navigate trade talks — Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly asked the US remain silent on the camps should the Trump administration like its trade talks to with China to be successful.

The president also had an awkward exchange with Nadia Murad, a Yazidi refugee from Iraq who escaped captivity by ISIS. Trump again did not appear to pay close attention to her testimony, asking Murad where her family members were right after she’d told the president they had been killed.

Trump tried to steer the conversation toward the topic of ISIS no longer being in Sinjar, a town that has long been the home to the Yazidi ethnic and religious minority, but Murad explained that ISIS wasn’t the issue. Instead, she explained Yazidi refugees are afraid to return because of security and political concerns.

“You had the Nobel Prize?” Donald Trump learns of Yazidi activist Nadia Murad. Here’s how the interaction unfolded pic.twitter.com/DE3exTAm7N — The National (@TheNationalUAE) July 18, 2019

“Now there is no ISIS, but we cannot go back because Kurdish government and the Iraqi government, they are fighting each other who will control my area,” she said. “And we cannot go back, if we cannot protect our dignity, our family.”

“But now ISIS is gone. Now it’s Kurdish and who?” Trump asked.

Murad again explained that security forces are of concern to her people. There have been reports of skirmishes in the Yazidi homeland as the Iraqi government works to retake control from militias and the remnants of US-backed Kurdish forces.

After Murad elaborated on safety concerns, Trump pivoted, asking her about the Nobel Peace Prize she was awarded in 2018 — Murad was given the prize for her advocacy for the Yazidis. The group was attacked by ISIS in 2014; several thousand were killed, and more than 3,000 others were taken as slaves, including sex slaves.

The activist told the president she was given the prize for speaking out about her time as a slave, and her escape from bondage, as well as her work on behalf of the thousands of Yazidi women raped by ISIS troops.

“Let me look; we’re going to look,” Trump responded.

Ultimately the timing of the meeting, intended to project an image of the Trump administration’s dedication to protecting refugees persecuted for their religions, was rather ironic. Immediately afterwards, the president attended a rally and whipped up xenophobic anger at perhaps the most prominent refugee in American politics, herself a US religious minority. And the next day, Politico reported that security officials in the Trump administration are considering cutting refugee admissions “to nearly zero” next year."
Donald Trump Will Guarantee Bail for A$AP Rocky,https://www.tmz.com,[],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.tmz.com/2019/07/20/donald-trump-will-guarantee-bail-asap-rocky/,"TMZ

Well this is a twist ... Donald Trump just said he's personally guaranteeing bail for A$AP Rocky if Swedish authorities release him ... meaning the President would be on the hook if Rocky skips out.

It's a bizarre turn in the case. Trump just tweeted, ""Just had a very good call with @SwedishPM Stefan Lofven who assured me that American citizen A$AP Rocky will be treated fairly. Likewise, I assured him that A$AP was not a flight risk and offered to personally vouch for his bail ...""

Trump didn't use the word, but it sounds like he's saying he's willing to become a guarantor on Rocky's bail application.

As we reported, a judge ruled Friday A$AP is a flight risk and therefore can't be let out of jail while the case grinds on.

So, he's now spoken to the Swedish Prime Minister who really promised nothing ... especially if he views what's going on as fair. As we reported, A$AP has been jailed for more than 2 weeks and not a single criminal charge has been filed against him. Prosecutors say they need another week to investigate -- even though any lawyer out of school for a year could process this one quickly, since there's video -- and they convinced a judge to hold Rocky in custody while they figure it out.

And, by the way, prosecutors blew it by sending out a press release saying they plan to indict him ... so why the charade of pretending the investigation is continuing? When we contacted them they told us they mistakenly put that info in the press release and then removed it. The mistake was clearly just that they played their hand.

The reality is this ... Trump and his State Dept. have already made a full court press to get Rocky out and it fell on deaf ears. Good that he's trying, but Swedish authorities up to this point have been immovable.

As we reported, Kanye called Trump Friday and made a plea for the President to get involved."
Trump-loving Miss Michigan Kathy Zhu dethroned after old ‘racist’ tweets surface,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/20/trump-loving-miss-michigan-kathy-zhu-dethroned-after-old-racist-tweets-surface/,"A Trump-loving beauty pageant winner was stripped of her Miss Michigan title over the content of her social media.

The Miss World America contest “accused me of being racist, Islamaphobic and insensitive,” tweeted Kathy Zhu, who is Asian-American.

Zhu, the president of College Republicans at the University of Michigan, told the Detroit Free Press that the two now-deleted tweets in question were a comment on World Hijab Day and a statement citing statistics related to black deaths caused by other black people.

She said that Miss World America should be more specific and clearly define what “insensitive” means, as she does not believe anything she posted was insensitive. That didn’t stop what she sarcastically referred to a “the tolerant left” from blasting her on social media.

Miss World America did not comment despite repeated attempts to contact the organization, the Detroit Free Press said.

Zhu’s dethroning came days after President Trump held a “social media summit” at the White House to applaud right-wing social media provocateurs and complain about big tech’s handling of conservative voices online."
It’s time to break up DHS.,https://slate.com,['Fred Kaplan'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/aoc-dhs-break-up.html,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images and Win McNamee/Getty Images.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got at least one thing right this week: The Department of Homeland Security should be abolished.

Ocasio-Cortez proposed breaking up DHS in a radio interview with New Yorker editor David Remnick, after which several Republicans began hammering her for the idea. “Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney exclaimed to a reporter. “Moronic, stupid, naïve, and dumb,” GOP strategist Karl Rove sputtered on Fox News.

It’s unclear why Dick Cheney’s daughter and George W. Bush’s former White House deputy chief of staff should find AOC’s suggestion so outrageous. A Democrat, then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, first proposed creating DHS in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, to show that his party could get serious about terrorism too—and then-President George W. Bush initially opposed the idea, saying that it would just pile on another layer of bureaucracy. That proved to be an understatement.

Bush finally relented after the 9/11 Commission concluded that the attacks happened, in part, because the FBI and the CIA hadn’t shared intelligence about the hijackers’ movements prior to the attack. This overstated the case, but suddenly consolidation became a popular nostrum to our problems, and in 2002, Bush signed Lieberman’s idea into law.

The organizations that didn’t consolidate—the CIA and FBI, the culprits that mishandled intelligence about al-Qaida in the first place—elevated their counterterrorism units, redirected their focus, and strung new lines of communications between them. Meanwhile the Department of Homeland Security subsumed 22 agencies from eight federal departments—with a combined budget of $40 billion (back then) and a payroll of 183,000 employees—into one hydra-headed, crossbred, poorly conceived monstrosity.

It wasn’t just the size that was the problem: Most of these agencies had been performing distinct functions; shmooshing them together wouldn’t necessarily make them more cohesive or efficient. In fact, it made each component less effective. Several of those agencies had been headed by officials with the standing of Cabinet secretaries, who could focus laser-like on their specific domains and had the clout to request direct access to the president. This is no longer true. The Secretary of Homeland Security, even a very good one, has the time and bandwidth to focus on maybe two or three of the department’s 22 areas. The other areas are now handled by undersecretaries or assistant (or deputy assistant) secretaries—people with less clout and less access, leaving issues less attended.

The place is a well-known mishmash unable to attract top talent in the upper tiers, where policy is made, and unable to retain top talent in the middle tiers, where operations are managed.

Here’s one example: In the early 1990s, when the U.S. government started addressing cybersecurity, the Defense Department created a specially staffed joint task force for “computer network defense.” It had bureaucratic clashes with similar but separate units in the Air Force and the National Security Agency, but those in charge were beginning to figure out how to work together.

DHS is unable to attract top talent in the upper tiers, where policy is made—and unable to retain top talent in the middle tiers, where operations are managed.

Then, after 9/11, it was decided that DHS would be responsible for defending the nation from cyberattacks (though the Pentagon and the NSA would remain in charge of protecting defense networks). The system of interagency arrangements, which had slowly been evolving, fell apart. DHS lacked the resources and know-how for its mission. During the early Obama administration, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano signed a memorandum of understanding allowing the DHS and NSA to work together in crises, but it was sabotaged by a DHS deputy who opposed any plan that helped turn the internet into a “war zone.” (The deputy was a few years late on trying to stop that development.)

DHS has probably also had a deleterious effect on protecting security and civil liberties on the southern border, the main topic of Ocasio-Cortez’s concerns. Before 9/11, border matters were handled by the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Services, which the DHS fused into a new agency, Customs and Border Patrol.

Customs and the INS were run as fairly professional law enforcement agencies, with varying degrees of laxity or fervency, depending on the times. Under a more normal administration, CBP might still operate in that manner. But lassoed into a political department and run by a handpicked operative, it has turned into an enforcement squad for Trump’s obsessively anti-immigrant agenda. Even under Trump’s orders, would the competent bureaucrats of the old Customs Service have herded children into cages? Maybe. But they might have handled things in a more professional fashion because it would have been an independent agency following its own rules and codes, rather than a subset of a super-agency run by a political appointee.

Bureaucratic routines and regulations sometime serve a laudable purpose.

It’s very hard to turn back the clock to 2001 and dissolve DHS into its once separate components, especially since most people don’t remember or even knowthat it wasn’t always this way. But maybe we should try. Republicans talk about dissolving federal agencies all the time. As Ocasio-Cortez put it in a clarifying tweet: “Discussing reorganization shouldn’t be out of the question.”"
U.S. State Department says concerned by reports of Chinese interference in South China Sea,https://www.reuters.com,"['Nandita Bose', 'Min Read']",07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-southchinasea/us-state-department-says-concerned-by-reports-of-chinese-interference-in-south-china-sea-idUSKCN1UF0EM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Saturday it is concerned by reports of China’s interference with oil and gas activities in the South China Sea, including Vietnam’s long-standing exploration and production activities.

“China’s repeated provocative actions aimed at the offshore oil and gas development of other claimant states threatens regional energy security and undermines the free and open Indo-Pacific energy market,” the State Department said in a statement.

Vietnam on Friday accused a Chinese oil survey vessel and its escorts of violating its sovereignty and demanded that China remove the ships from Vietnamese waters.

Vietnam and China have for years long been embroiled in a dispute over the potentially energy-rich stretch of waters in the South China Sea.

On Wednesday, two U.S.-based think tanks reported that Chinese and Vietnamese vessels had engaged in a standoff lasting several weeks near an oil block in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone. Neither Beijing nor Hanoi have directly confirmed or denied the reports.

“The United States firmly opposes coercion and intimidation by any claimant to assert its territorial or maritime claims,” the State Department said.

“China should cease its bullying behavior and refrain from engaging in this type of provocative and destabilizing activity,” it added.

The State Department also pointed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s comments earlier this year when he said, “by blocking development in the South China Sea through coercive means, China prevents ASEAN members from accessing more than $2.5 trillion in recoverable energy reserves.”

The State Department also said that China’s growing pressure on ASEAN countries to accept provisions that seek to restrict their right to partner with third party companies or countries further reveal its intent to assert control over oil and gas resources in the South China Sea.

“China’s reclamation and militarization of disputed outposts in the South China Sea...including the use of maritime militia to intimidate, coerce, and threaten other nations, undermine the peace and security of the region,” it said."
Thousands Freed From Prison Custody As DOJ Implements Sentencing Reform Law,https://www.npr.org,['Carrie Johnson'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/19/743502961/thousands-freed-from-prison-custody-as-doj-implements-sentencing-reform-law,"Thousands Freed From Prison Custody As DOJ Implements Sentencing Reform Law

Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET

More than 3,100 people will leave Bureau of Prisons custody starting Friday, part of what Justice Department officials call ""a truly monumental effort"" to comply with the First Step Act, a criminal justice law passed by Congress last year.

Most of the offenders being freed have been convicted of drug-related crimes and have been living in halfway houses across the United States in preparation for their release, acting BOP chief Hugh Hurwitz told reporters at a news conference in Washington.

About 900 of the inmates are subject to detention by local authorities or immigration officials, and their fate will be up to states or the Department of Homeland Security, he said.

The Justice Department announced that 250 more inmates who are elderly or terminally ill have transitioned into home confinement or compassionate-release programs since President Trump signed the law last December.

Those programs existed in some form before the First Step Act, but advocates for prisoners and their families said they were used only sparingly and now are somewhat easier to access.

""The department intends to implement this law fully and on time, with the goal of reducing crime, enhancing public safety and strengthening the rule of law,"" said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen.

Authorities also unveiled a new risk assessment tool designed to identify prisoners who could benefit from prison programming that would allow them to win credits that count toward early release under the law.

Inmates will be reassessed every six months under that new program.

In a joint statement, Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said they would ""vigilantly"" review the new risk assessment system.

""It's critical that the assessment does not disproportionately designate minorities as having a higher risk of reoffending,"" the senators said.

Questions about implementation

The Justice Department enlisted a think tank, the Hudson Institute, to assist with the assessment effort. But that decision has come under fire from key Democrats in Congress.

""The Hudson Institute and its leadership have opposed sentencing reform, opposed the First Step Act's reforms, and authored an article entitled 'Why Trump Should Oppose Criminal Justice Reform,' "" as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and subcommittee chairwoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., said earlier this year.

""We are concerned that the selection of a biased organization lacking requisite expertise may reflect a lack of intent to diligently and effectively implement the bipartisan criminal justice reforms,"" they said.

Advocates seeking to overhaul the federal system welcomed news Friday that the Justice Department is moving ahead to implement the First Step Act. But they said they have ongoing concerns about funding and oversight, and they want Congress to hold the administration accountable.

Attorney General William Barr has been the subject of criticism that he holds outdated views about crime and punishment from the earlier era when he served as attorney general.

""There's a lot of skepticism over whether this Justice Department is going to fully implement the law,"" said Inimai Chettiar, legislative and policy director for the Justice Action Network.

""We definitely believe that Congress needs to step in and ensure that this is happening and to also fully fund the law because the only way that these recidivism reduction programs are going to be effective is if they are fully funded.""

Still, groups that work with inmates and their families said that whatever its failings, the First Step Act is making a difference.

""Every day of freedom is important,"" said Kevin Ring, president of the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. ""We're happy for the families who get to welcome home their loved ones a few weeks or months early."""
"For 50 Years Since Apollo 11, Presidents Have Tried to Take That Next Giant Leap",https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/us/politics/apollo-11-anniversary-presidents.html,"WASHINGTON — At his star-spangled Independence Day extravaganza this month, President Trump singled out Gene Kranz, the legendary Apollo flight director. “Gene,” the president said, “I want you to know that we’re going to be back on the moon very soon — and someday soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars.”

What could be more American than vowing to go to the moon and beyond on the Fourth of July? For Mr. Trump, it was a chance to channel his inner John F. Kennedy, who first made the moon the nation’s goal — to make the sort of bold promise that appeals to his own sense of greatness and to wrap himself in a part of Americana akin to baseball and apple pie.

But Mr. Trump is the 10th president since Kennedy to put his stamp on the space program and the latest to aim for the stars with more brio than blueprint. After the Apollo program ended, other presidents promised to go back to the moon — or send humans to Mars or even land astronauts on asteroids. None did, unwilling or unable to obtain the financing necessary, and it remains uncertain whether Mr. Trump will, either.

As the nation on Saturday celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, the story of presidents and space exploration in the subsequent five decades is one of fascination, frustration and futility, an unrequited romance as star-struck chief executives dreamed of recapturing the magic of Kennedy’s moonshot without summoning the resources or the national will that made it possible in 1969, almost six years after his death."

Twenty years ago today, on July 20, 1999, Space.com went live for the very first time.

That's right, we're 20 years old!

Twenty years ago, Bill Clinton was president of the United States and it had been 30 years since Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins made their epic Apollo 11 moonshot. The space shuttle was the world's only reusable spacecraft.

Today, we have private space planes and spacecraft (from Virgin Galactic and SpaceX, etc.) and reusable rocketships (SpaceX and Blue Origin). Meanwhile, the International Space Station continues its role as humanity's foothold in orbit as the Hubble Space Telescope, Mars rover Curiosity and countless other robotic missions keep extending our reach across the final frontier with every day ... and Sol.

Here's 3 Free Posters for NASA's Apollo 11 Anniversary (and Space.com, Too!)



Tariq Malik, Space.com Editor in Chief (Image credit: Space.com/Jeremy Lips)

There have been tragedies, too, as we mourned those lost on NASA's Columbia and Virgin Galactic's VSS Enterprise, as well as in the pursuit of spaceflight. And while humanity may not be as far in space as we at Space.com would like (like Mars, for example), you have to admit: It's an exciting time to be space fan.

NASA is now aiming to return astronauts to the moon by 2024, and private spacecraft from SpaceX, Boeing, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and others seem truly poised to begin regular tourist and crew flights to space. It seems the Space Age future of science fiction is closer than ever.

And at Space.com, we're both thrilled and thankful.

Thrilled because it feels like the world is poised on another giant leap in space, one fueled by both government agencies and private companies, that would lead to another Apollo 11-like moment. And because today, the public has more access to space than ever before. Astronaut photos, videos from space, even the sounds of Mars, can be found with just a click in a way we only hoped for when the lights went on at Space.com.

We're thankful because of you, the reader. Your passion, dedication and thirst for everything space is what KEEPS the lights on Space.com. It allows our team to pursue the research, interviews, conferences and launches to bring you something amazing every day. And for that we thank you. It's been a blast.

Full disclosure: Twenty years ago, I was not at Space.com. When this site was founded by news anchor Lou Dobbs and Rich Zahradnick (Neil Armstrong was on our board), I was completing a degree in Print Journalism (I liked newspapers, still do!) with a minor in Astronomy at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. But, it turns out, I was still writing about space.

By sheer coincidence, my first space story was about the 30th anniversary of Apollo 11 and Buzz Aldrin, who put his moon boot print in cement at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda to mark the occasion. Since I first joined Space.com in 2001, I've seen so much more: rockets and astronauts leaving Earth and returning, too; cars landing on Mars and scaling mountains; spacecraft visiting the edge of the solar system as others leave it altogether.

I even met Elmo at a shuttle launch. Twice.

What an amazing 20 years it's been. I can only imagine what the next 20 years will bring, and what my 10-year-old daughter (who's seen two launches and built a Saturn V rocket and Lunar Lander) will have seen by then.

Thank you for helping make it all happen as we tell humanity's space story.

And don't forget: Keep looking up!

Sincerely,

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has failed to bring 'swagger' back to the State Department and America is paying the price,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Brett Bruen'],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-hasnt-restored-state-department-opinion-2019-7,"He came in promising to restore some swagger to the step of America's diplomats. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spent a lot of time on swagger, his own. Little effort has been made to lift up others.

Our country's first line of defense at outposts around the world remains dangerously diminished and damaged. Even more concerning for our national security, such arrogance and ambition have proven quite costly for our influence abroad.

When Pompeo came on board, replacing the former Texas oil executive Rex Tillerson, the State Department was still suffering from a condition I call: Post-Tillerson Stress Disorder.

The Texas oil executive's management reforms wreaked havoc through the halls of the Harry S. Truman Building. So even though Pompeo was a former congressman from the outer extremities of the political spectrum, he was still seen as an improvement.

Pompeo promised to lift the debilitating hiring freeze and look after his people. A new ""professional ethos"" was written up, emphasizing respect and integrity. Unlike his predecessor, Pompeo spent time with families when he visited embassies. Just the fact that he held meetings and traveled regularly was an improvement.

Sure, his constant talk about swagger seemed a bit silly at first. But, my former colleagues told me, ""At least he will put us back at the big-kids table."" Many believed his promises of renewed hiring, reversing deep cuts to programs, and providing some modicum of support for those who serve.

The hiring hasn't gotten back to prior levels. Budgets continue to be slashed. Worst of all, Foreign Service families aren't getting the help they desperately need.

The State Department has not provided ongoing care for those injured by the serious sonic attacks in Cuba and China. Pompeo has also callously chosen not to restore funding for the care required for children of diplomats with special needs.

Then came the shutdown. That was the moment he really lost support, according numerous current diplomats with whom I remain in contact. They were so outraged we organized a call with journalists to shed light on their predicament, an unprecedented move for the normally press-shy diplomatic corps.

Americans serving overseas with their families bore some of the worst impacts from the extended period without pay. Unlike federal workers in the US, diplomats posted abroad could not pick up gigs on the local market. They don't have a support network of friends and family nearby. They wanted to hear their secretary at least acknowledge their predicament.

Instead, Pompeo ignored their plight. Making matters worse, he chose to bring his wife on a several-nation trip at the height of the shutdown. He even asked American diplomats working without pay to staff his wife, possibly in violation of federal regulations.

My former colleagues told me they were absolutely livid. It was an unnecessary and inappropriate burden on those serving abroad.

Then come the policy problems. Pompeo has by most measures mismanaged the North Korea account, failing to win Pyongyang's trust and teeing up solutions for three presidential-level engagements. The coalition to support a tougher stand on Iran has failed to materialize. Pompeo's aggressive saber-rattling on Venezuela was unhelpful.

Without question, selling Trump's policies can be a tall order. But his predecessors Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice managed to apply some delicate diplomacy to navigate turbulent waters in the wake of former President George W. Bush's deeply unpopular decisions, from Guantanamo to Iraq. This balancing act seems to be absent from Pompeo's State Department.

It's easy to dismiss the bombastic Pompeo as a natural byproduct of the Trump era. But bear in mind he is now what passes for a brake on bad ideas in the cabinet. He is literally what stands between us and another unwise war.

The trouble with swagger is that it soon wears off. It also really wears on people, when not grounded in substance.

America is paying a high price for the pompousness of Pompeo. Many foreign leaders have just stopped listening to him. Turkey's recent acquisition of a Russian missile system is just the latest example.

From what I hear, a good portion of his own department has lost confidence in his leadership. Career employees continue to flee, including a more than 30% decline in the percentage of senior Foreign Service executives who are African American, according to a recent report.

Lastly, despite all the bravado, the secretary has yet to deliver a single major foreign-policy victory for the administration. I think it's beyond time to dial back on the arrogance. He would be well served to channel President Teddy Roosevelt's advice of speaking softly while carrying a big stick.

Brett Bruen was the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a career American diplomat. He now runs the crisis-communications agency the Global Situation Room and teaches crisis management at Georgetown."

DHS via Storyful

WASHINGTON – A U.S. lawmaker described 'unacceptable' border detention facilities while meeting with a U.S. citizen who was in Customs and Border Patrol custody for hours on Friday.

Rep. Nannette Barragán, D-Calif., had been on a congressional tour of facilities on the southern U.S. border when the delegation stopped at the Ursula Detention Center, a Border Patrol processing and detention center near McAllen, Texas.

Barragán told USA TODAY she had been walking around the facility looking for people who looked like they wanted to talk. She spotted one woman by a fence in the facility so Barragán knelt down to talk to her.

The woman told Barragán she was traveling from Ecuador along with her 13-year-old daughter, a U.S. citizen.

“I was shocked,"" said Barragán, who took took pictures of the girl's passport. Barragán said the document stated the girl was born in New York.

The congresswoman added she was ""in shock about why there was an American citizen being detained in one of these facilities.”

In a statement to USA TODAY, Customs and Border Protection said ""the daughter had crossed the border from the U.S. to meet her mother and they were then apprehended crossing back into the U.S. illegally.""

CBP added the mother and her daughter were held ""in custody at the Centralized Processing Center for about five hours and were released two hours after they were processed.""

The mother was provided a ""Notice to Appear,"" or a document with instructions to appear before an immigration judge for a hearing, CBP said.

Barragán had brought greater scrutiny to the girl's situation after tweeting a picture of the her passport on Friday afternoon.

Later on Friday, Barragán announced the girl and her mother had been released from Border Patrol custody after she and other congressional Democrats started pressuring the Department of Homeland Security to release the girl and her mother.

""It was a lot of calls and talking to people,"" Barragán told USA TODAY. “We’ve seen (the Border Patrol) take action when members inquire"" and ""start asking lots of questions.""

Barragán told USA TODAY the conditions in the detention center were ""unacceptable,"" with areas ""filled with women and children."" In a tweet, Barragán noted how kids had so little in the facility that they were using their Mylar blankets to make hair ties.

Barragán said the mother of the girl most of all feared being separated from her child, alluding to the Trump administration's controversial ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy that had resulted in the separation of migrant children from their families.

""Don’t take my daughter away, don’t separate her from me,"" the mother told Barragán.

The Trump administration's border detention facilities have drawn increased scrutiny after a Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report found that children in Border Patrol detention in the Rio Grande Valley were held in unsafe and unsanitary conditions. Acting Department of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan told a congressional panel on Thursday that more resources were needed to address the situation at the border, as well as changes to immigration laws to discourage migration.

"E.P.A. Won’t Ban Chlorpyrifos, Pesticide Tied to Children’s Health Problems",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/climate/epa-chlorpyrifos-pesticide-ban.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took a major step to weaken the regulation of toxic chemicals on Thursday when the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would not ban a widely used pesticide that its own experts have linked to serious health problems in children.

The decision by Andrew R. Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, represents a victory for the chemical industry and for farmers who have lobbied to continue using the substance, chlorpyrifos, arguing it is necessary to protect crops.

It was the administration’s second major move this year to roll back or eliminate chemical safety rules. In April, the agency disregarded the advice of its own experts when officials issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, a known carcinogen. Agency scientists and lawyers had urged the E.P.A. to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

In making the chlorpyrifos ruling, the E.P.A. said in a statement that the data supporting objections to the use of the pesticide was “not sufficiently valid, complete or reliable.” The agency added that it would continue to monitor the safety of chlorpyrifos through 2022."
Many USDA workers to quit as research agencies move to Kansas City: ‘The brain drain we all feared’,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/07/18/many-usda-workers-quit-research-agencies-move-kansas-city-brain-drain-we-all-feared/,"

Two research agencies at the Agriculture Department will uproot from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City in the fall. But many staffers have decided to give up their jobs rather than move, prompting concerns of hollowed-out offices unable to adequately fund or inform agricultural science.

About two-thirds of the USDA employees declined their reassignments, according to a tally the department released Tuesday. Ninety-nine of 171 employees at the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency, will not move. At the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio in scientific funding, 151 of 224 employees declined to relocate.

Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, warned that the hemorrhage of employees will devastate ERS and NIFA. “This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Payne said.

Workers who agreed to move must do so by Sept. 30, although USDA has not established permanent office space and has not said whether the agencies will be located on the Missouri or Kansas side of the Kansas City area. Workers who were asked to move but declined “will be separated by adverse action procedures,” per letters the employees received in June.

The department expects relocation numbers may “fluctuate” until the Sept. 30 cutoff, according to a statement provided by USDA. “These anticipated ranges were taken into account in the department’s long-term strategy, which includes both efforts to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA’s work.”

Tim Cowden, president of the Kansas City Area Development Council, which advocated for the relocation to Kansas City, said in a statement that “just over 36 percent of those given the option to relocate have accepted, which is very strong for any HQ relocation. We remain committed to working with all USDA employees interested in relocating to KC.”

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.), along with Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) and Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), was an early supporter of the move to Kansas City. Cleaver said in a statement he empathized “with not wanting to uproot your family.” But if the move “has to happen,” he said, “then Kansas City is the best place in America for these agencies’ new home,” because it can “fill the void with competent and qualified individuals.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told The Washington Post, “This kind of staff loss will completely gut the ERA and NIFA, and will ultimately prevent the USDA from conducting critical research that helps grow the food our families eat.”

Sonny Ramaswamy, the NIFA director from 2012 to 2018, said he was aware of $50 million in grants, slated to be distributed over the next three months, for research areas identified as priorities in the 2018 farm bill. Those grants would have funded studies into subjects as diverse as disease-resistant cotton in Mississippi and hail-damaged corn in Nebraska.

Now, that science is “not going to happen,” Ramaswamy said, because the planned move has disrupted the agency. A senior NIFA scientist familiar with the grants, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, confirmed that these grants are on hold and in danger of never being distributed.

NIFA, when fully staffed, employs about 400 people. As it becomes more diminished, the agency’s ability to review grant proposals, manage awards or hold grant recipients accountable is threatened, Ramaswamy said. He predicted tens of millions of dollars in grant funding will be in jeopardy. Most money earmarked for NIFA grants, if unspent, returns to the Treasury Department.

Katherine Smith Evans, the ERS administrator from 2007 to 2011, reviewed a list of employees who are leaving. Four of five economists working on bees and pollination at ERS have left or will leave, she said. Ten of 12 economists working on trade and international development have retired, already left or plan to do so. None of the farm finance and tax experts will remain with the agency. “I agree with people who say it will take 10 years to recover,” Smith Evans said.

Gale Buchanan, the USDA chief scientist and undersecretary for research, education and economics in the George W. Bush administration, said employees face “an almost impossible task” by trying to do their jobs with reduced numbers.

The decision process, he said, has been flawed. “I could live by whatever blue-ribbon committee recommended to do to address some of the concerns the secretary had,” Buchanan said. But, he added, “you don’t just pull an idea out of the air and, for some political reason, make a decision.”

The agencies were understaffed even before Tuesday’s tally of those who will not relocate. Employees at the agencies quit in large numbers before the department issued reassignment letters. In early June, vacancy rates at the agencies were about 20 to 25 percent.

“Both agencies already have experienced significant losses of skilled personnel, beginning back when the proposed move was announced,” Payne said. “The percentage of employees moving is even smaller when the denominator is the full staff level.” During fiscal year 2018, ERS had 320 employees. Unless a wave of new hires fills the deserted desks, by this fall, ERS will be half the size it was two years ago.

When Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the relocation in August, he said it would “provide more streamlined and efficient services.” A cost-benefit analysis released by the department in June suggests moving to Kansas City will save as much as $300 million over 15 years.

An organization of economists, the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, disputed the projected savings; the move may cost taxpayers money, the group said, because the analysis overestimated the expense of retaining the agencies in the capital and did not calculate the value of lost research.

Ocasio-Cortez confronted Acting Homeland Security Secretary McAleenan about images of her ""violent rape"" from a secret Facebook group. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – After a week fielding racist attacks from President Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about the whereabouts of Border Patrol agents who threatened her in a secret Facebook group.

The intense and personal line of questioning Thursday happened as McAleenan appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to testify about his role in separating migrant children from their families and worsening conditions at the migrant detention centers along the southern U.S. border.

He was also asked several times about a secret Facebook group of current and former Border Patrol agents that contained more than 10,000 members and included posts mocking migrants and the deaths of children in custody and suggesting harm to Democratic lawmakers. After the group's existence was revealed by a ProPublica report, McAleenan announced DHS was investigating the ""disturbing"" and ""inexcusable"" posts.

""Did you see the posts planning physical harm to myself and Congresswoman Escobar?"" Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., asked McAleenan. ""Yes,"" he answered. ""And I directed an investigation within minutes of reading the article.""

""Did you see the images of officers circulating Photoshopped images of my violent rape?"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""Yes I did,"" McAleenan responded.

McAleenan did not specifically say whether those Border Patrol agents were still on the job after Ocasio-Cortez, a freshmen lawmaker known for her progressive policies and large following on social media questioned whether they were still ""responsible for the safety of migrant women and children.""

He said several agents have been put on administrative duties while the investigation continues, saying ""I don't know which ones correspond to which posts and we've ordered cease and desist orders to dozens of more.""

McAleenan shot back after Ocasio-Cortez asked about whether the separating of children and families led to a ""dehumanizing culture"" within Customs and Border Protection. ""We do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP,"" he said touting that the agency, ""rescues 4,000 people a year"" and is ""committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with.""

He said the posts were ""unacceptable"" but ""I don't think it's fair to apply them to the entire organization or that even the members of that group believed or supported those posts.""

The hearing came after days of President Trump attacking Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshmen Democratic lawmakers, all women of color who are critical of his administration and its policies.

CLOSE President Trump says he ""felt a little bit badly"" about the chants of ""send her back"" that erupted at his North Carolina rally. USA TODAY

It started Sunday when Trump sent a series of tweets suggesting Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., should ""go back"" to where they came from.

The House passed a resolution condemning the racist comments on Tuesday as the president faced widespread criticism over the remarks, which he doubled down on at the White House and on Twitter throughout the week.

He singled out the four women Wednesday evening during a rally in North Carolina and his supporters started chanting ""send her back"" as the president brought up Rep. Omar, who is originally from Somalia and became one of the first two Muslim women in Congress when she was elected in the 2018 midterms. Omar is a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Trump distanced himself from the chants on Thursday, saying, ""I disagree with it"" and ""I wasn't happy with that message.""

"After census debacle, White House to knock out senior Commerce official",https://www.politico.com,"['Nancy Cook', 'Margaret Harding Mcgill']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/18/white-house-earl-comstock-out-1600269,"Commerce policy director Earl Comstock clashed with Trump administration officials on a number of policy issues. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo White House After census debacle, White House to knock out senior Commerce official Senior Trump aides have sparred with the policy director for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over the census, 5G and other issues.

The White House is pushing a top aide to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross out of the Trump administration, the first round of house-cleaning after the 2020 census debacle and clashes over tech policy.

In recent months, Commerce policy director Earl Comstock has angered Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, White House lawyers, members of the National Security Council and officials at the National Economic Council, according to five current and former administration officials. The irritation extends to the highest staff level of the White House, several officials stressed, citing both Comstock’s handling of the 2020 U.S. census’s citizenship question and the internal debate over spectrum policy as key areas of disagreement.

Story Continued Below

One former administration official said he could not think of anyone who “had pissed off as many senior White House officials” as Comstock, who critics allege often tried to exceed his own authority as a top Commerce policy staffer. Comstock also clashed with officials across federal agencies, according to one administration official.

While officials said the process of forcing out Comstock through a firing or resignation is underway, the date of his actual departure remains unclear. He was at the agency until the end of the day on Wednesday.

The White House referred questions about Comstock to the Commerce Department. A Commerce spokesperson said “there is no truth to these rumors. Earl Comstock is an instrumental and valuable member of the Commerce team. He has a keen understanding of the functions of the federal government and has spearheaded multiple departmental initiatives as the deputy chief of staff for policy. Earl will continue to work tirelessly on behalf of the Secretary, the Department of Commerce and the American people.”

As Mulvaney has sought to exert greater control over federal agencies, Comstock’s performance has come under far greater scrutiny — similar to how the White House also has paid close to attention recently to top officials at the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services.

Comstock’s role in failing to put the citizenship question on the U.S. census was just the latest high-profile blow for him, since it’s an issue the president cares about deeply — adding to widespread views inside the White House that Commerce is not effectively executing the president’s agenda.

Administration officials said Comstock’s eventual departure is not necessarily a foreshadowing of Ross’s own tenure in the Cabinet — though the president has been frustrated over the past year with his Commerce secretary’s negotiating prowess in trade talks and the census question.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/1311/1155968404_6058082603001_6058083404001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

And Commerce officials don’t see Ross, an 81-year-old investor and longtime friend of the president, leaving imminently despite months of speculation and ongoing sparring with lawmakers. “He likes doing the job,” said a personal familiar with Ross.

Comstock, who acted as Ross’s sherpa during the confirmation process, clashed with other Trump administration officials on a number of policy issues, including spectrum and net neutrality.

A feud among Trump's advisers over 5G wireless — a technology crucial to U.S. competition with China over the future of the internet — spilled into public view in March, when Commerce raised concerns that FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's effort to free up more 5G airwaves for the wireless sector would interfere with the government's use of nearby airwaves for weather forecasting. The White House ultimately sided with the FCC in that debate.

But that did not end the internal infighting. Pai accused the department of “blocking our efforts at every single turn” during a Senate oversight hearing in June. He said the relationship between his agency and Commerce has deteriorated since David Redl abruptly resigned his post as head of Commerce’s NTIA in May.

Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with support from NASA, has raised concerns that using 24 GHz airwaves for 5G services could degrade weather forecasting systems’ ability to make predictions. The FCC concluded its auction of the airwaves in May.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in June warned Ross that a senior adviser “may be placing personal animosity ahead of our country's 5G goals.” Ross responded by saying officials had reached a “workable compromise” — an assertion the FCC denied. The issue also arose in a House hearing Tuesday on spectrum policy.

Comstock has not been in lock-step with the FCC in other policy areas. Early in his tenure at Commerce, he quietly opposed the FCC’s repeal of Obama-era net neutrality regulations by backing a congressional effort to restore the rules. The one-time Republican Senate staffer believes telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon need firm oversight, and had previously challenged the Obama-era rules in court because he did not believe they went far enough in reining in broadband providers.

Pentagon contractor threatened to murder Rep. Frederica Wilson over vaccine bill: DOJ,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/19/pentagon-contractor-threatened-to-murder-rep-frederica-wilson-over-vaccine-bill-doj/,"An anti-vaxxer from Maryland who works as a cybersecurity contractor for the Department of Defense was charged this week for “threatening to murder” Florida Congresswoman Frederica Wilson — after she introduced a bill requiring all public schools to vaccinate their students in exchange for federal funding.

Darryl Varnum, 42, of Westminster, allegedly left a voicemail with Wilson’s office, which included the “violent threats,” according to DOJ officials.

Wilson’s name is not actually listed in the criminal complaint — only “Person #1” — but sources tell the Daily Beast that she is the individual authorities are referring to.

“I will f—ing come down and kill your f—ing ass,” Varnum allegedly said on his voicemail.

“And you’re a congressperson,” he added, according to the Daily Beast. “That is fine. I hope the f—ing FBI, CIA and everybody else hears this shit.”

Varnum, at one point, told Rep. Wilson to “get the f–k out” of the Unites States — saying this is “America.”

“I’ll tell you what I’ll come down to Miami bitch. I’ll f–k you up,” he allegedly told the Democratic lawmaker. “Like the Cubans don’t even know.”

Varnum’s temper tantrum reportedly stemmed from Wilson’s introduction of The Vaccinate All Children Act, which would require all public schools to vaccinate their students in order to get federal funding.

The Pentagon contractor has been vocal in the past about his anti-vaxxer beliefs — posting regularly on Facebook.

“Holocaust has begun!” he said in June after Wilson introduced the All Children legislation. “I’m done with this bulls–t. Time to step up or ship out!”

Varnum later commented on the post, telling users: “All of our guns are next. Been trying for years!”

He followed up the message with another FB status a minute later, saying: “WAKE UP AMERICA!”

“Wake up in prison,” a user replied Thursday, calling Varnum a “weirdo.”

The senior cyber systems engineer is employed by Sealing Technologies Inc., according to his LinkedIn page. Federal officials said he’s “currently working at the Defense Information Systems Agency Headquarters.”

Varnum was indicted this week after being arrested on July 8. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, if convicted."
"Eugene Scalia, Trump's pick to head the Labor Department, scares worker advocates to death",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Irina Ivanova'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eugene-scalia-trumps-labor-secretary-scares-worker-advocates-to-death/,"Workers' rights groups and Senate Democrats are objecting to the nomination of Eugene Scalia to head the Labor Department, pointing to his career as a lawyer defending big business.

Scalia led the charge against a proposed rule that would have required 401(k) plan managers to act in the best interests of their investors.

He also worked to weaken parts of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill and Clinton-era rules designed to prevent repetitive stress injuries at work.



President Donald Trump's move this week to tap attorney Eugene Scalia to head the U.S. Department of Labor is causing worker advocates to sound the alarm. Scalia, whose father is late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, is a career corporate lawyer most of whose professional life has focused on representing big companies in their fights with consumers, employees or government regulators.

The National Employment Law Project noted that Scalia ""has spent his entire career fighting for big businesses and against working people,"" while the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute called Mr. Trump's choice ""another fox-guarding-the-hen house selection that defines the Trump cabinet."" And prominent Senate Democrats have stated their opposition to Scalia's nomination.

Coming from a White House avowedly in favor of eliminating a host of government regulations, Scalia's nomination is no great surprise. But what does that actually mean for U.S. workers?

Legal winners and losers

""Labor secretaries have a lot of power when it comes to enforcement,"" said Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor in the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations. ""The labor secretary has tremendous influence on how the law is enforced, whether the law is enforced, which laws are favored and which laws aren't,"" she said.

Some states are raising the minimum wage because Congress won't

Take overtime work. Currently, an employer can avoid paying an employee one-and-a-half times their hourly pay by classifying that worker as a manager, unless that worker earns under $23,660 annually. For the last five years, the Labor Department has been working to raise the pay level at which workers draw overtime rates, with the exact pay thresholds changing depending on the administration. (President Obama's labor department aimed for a level of $47,700; the current proposed rule puts it at $35,300.)

""Glorified internships""

One area worker advocates are concerned about is apprenticeships. Mr. Trump made these programs a cornerstone of his economic policy when he was inaugurated, but two and a half years later, the program has barely gotten off the ground. ""Not a single apprenticeship program has been created under the program, nor a single person trained,"" Politico reported.

One way to speed that up that the government has proposed is by creating more industry-sponsored apprenticeships and curtailing the need for Labor Department approval. Currently, the government certifies the training programs to make sure they meet standards of pay, training and minimal benefits.

""These have been the hallmark of post-secondary education for people who are not interested in getting or can't get a bachelor's degree,"" Schurman said. Without certification, ""I predict that the apprenticeship would simply become just another form of glorified internship.""

President Trump signs executive order on apprenticeship programs

Tip pools and safety rules

Scalia's biography on the website of law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, where he is a partner, offers hints of what laws might fall out of favor if he were confirmed. For example, he has represented Walmart and other large employers in opposing a law requiring the businesses to spend a certain portion of their payroll on health care, and in another case against corporate whistleblowers who say they were fired.

After an orca at SeaWorld killed its trainer in 2010, meanwhile, Scalia defended the amusement park against new federal safety rules, arguing that ""the company has no more responsibility to protect its trainers than the NFL has a duty to combat on-the-field injuries,"" according to Mother Jones. Scalia also represented casino Wynn Las Vegas in a case that found that a business can force employees to share their tips with a pool of workers that the employer chooses.

In the 1990s, Scalia led the opposition to federal regulation that aimed to ensure better physical working conditions for employees. The so-called ergonomics rule required employers to warn their workers about repetitive stress injuries and to fix workplace conditions that led to frequent injuries. Scalia argued that the rule was based on ""junk science"" and ""quackery,"" writing in an op-ed that it would ""force companies to give more rest periods, slow the pace of work and then hire more workers.""

Dollars and cents

Several news reports have noted Scalia's zeal as a litigator, including a Bloomberg profile that appeared halfway through the Obama presidency. ""Suing the Government? Call Scalia!"" stated the piece, which detailed his role in blunting the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that followed the housing bust.

How Dodd-Frank changed Wall Street

""He was at the center of the industry effort to undo Dodd-Frank in the back rooms, and in terms of intimidating regulators and overturning important parts of it, he had a lot of success,"" recalled Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, a group that supports the law.

""Most of the rules that were costing industry a lot of money, he was the lead on trying to overturn them,"" Stanley added.

Scalia also led the charge to roll back the so-called fiduciary standard. That rule, which originated at the Labor Department, would have required managers of a 401(k) to act in the best interests of their clients, instead of steering them into higher-fee funds that are more profitable for the fund managers.

With the fiduciary rule now repealed, middle-class investors are left with little guidance on their 401(k)s except ""buyer beware."" With many other rules potentially on their way out, the new advice could be: Beware of the boss."

""Foreign influencers are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to inflame hot button issues in the United States,"" the new DHS warning says. ""They don’t do this to win arguments; they want to see us divided.""

According to the warning, foreign interference usually follows certain patterns.

First, foreign agents identify a divisive issue to target -- though likely not an issue as silly as whether pineapple is an appropriate pizza topping.

""No matter how you slice it, Americans disagree on the fruit topping,"" the DHS document notes with a pun.

Department of Homeland Security

After targeting a controversial issue, foreign agents then make sure social media accounts are in place, often reusing or renaming accounts ""to pollute those debates with bad information and make our positions more extreme by picking fights, or 'trolling' people online,"" according to the DHS warning.

The ""most extreme version of arguments on both sides of an issue"" often then become framed ""as legitimate information sources,"" pushing them ""into the mainstream"" and carrying them to larger audiences, the DHS warning says.

The final step of foreign interference is for agents to take what started in cyberspace and turn it into something ""very real, with Americans shouting down Americans because of foreign interference,"" DHS warns.

""In the past, Kremlin agents have organized or funded protests to further stoke divisions among Americans. They create event pages and ask followers to come out,"" according to DHS.

DHS offered this example: If the ""war on pineapple"" was a more serious issue, a foreign agent might tell unwitting followers to ""JOIN YOUR FELLOW PIZZA LOVERS AT THE TOWN CENTER TO MARCH FOR PINEAPPLE!""

Nevertheless, in its warning on Wednesday, DHS made clear -- in jest -- that: ""To date, we have no evidence of Russia (or any nation) actively carrying out information operations against pizza toppings.""

Russia's wide-ranging interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, from stealing and releasing thousands of Democratic National Committee emails to waging disinformation campaigns online, has U.S. authorities bracing for what could happen in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.

Russian President Vladimir Putin not only wants to ""weaken"" the United States in the years ahead, but he also wants to keep his grip on power, according to Suzanne Spaulding, a former senior official at DHS who helped lead U.S. efforts to mitigate Russian cyber operations.

""He doesn't want [Russian citizens] to see ... the United States and liberal democracy as something they should long for. So what he wants to portray to them is democracy in chaos,"" Spaulding said Friday at the annual Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado.

And when it comes to cyber-operations against foreign adversaries, Russia ""is practicing jiu jitsu,"" trying to use the First Amendment and American free speech ""against us,"" Spaulding said.

Ellucian Banner security flaw highlighted by Education Department,https://www.insidehighered.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/07/19/ellucian-banner-security-flaw-highlighted-education-department,"The U.S. Department of Education has warned of “active and ongoing exploitation” of a security flaw in Ellucian’s Banner system that may have given hackers access to student data such as grades, financial information and Social Security numbers.

A security alert, published Wednesday by the department’s Office of Federal Student Aid, said 62 colleges and universities using Banner had already been targeted. The alert indicates that criminals have been “scanning the internet looking for institutions to victimize” and drawing up lists of colleges to target.

Institutions that have transitioned to Banner 9, the latest version of Ellucian’s enterprise resource planning system, are not thought to be affected. But users using older versions of two Banner modules called Web Tailor and Enterprise Identity Services could be vulnerable.

According to Ellucian’s website, more than 1,400 institutions worldwide use Banner to manage student grades, staff payrolls, course schedules, admissions and student financial aid, among other tasks. Web Tailor and Enterprise Identity Services can be used by system administrators to get access to sensitive data protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

The student aid office encouraged institutions that have not recently upgraded Web Tailor or Enterprise Identity Services to do so and to contact the FSA incident team to determine whether there has been a data breach. Ellucian published a patch on May 14 that fixed the security flaw but has not shared how many institutions have installed it.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology described the Banner security flaw as an “improper authentication vulnerability” that enabled attackers to take over users' sessions when they attempted to log in. Depending on the administrative privileges of the user, and the way data are organized by individual institutions, attackers could use this access to move laterally through administrative systems and access sensitive information. Attackers could also potentially manipulate this information, perhaps changing personal information or grades, dropping students from their courses or denying them student financial aid.

According to FSA, affected institutions reported that attackers used the security flaw to manipulate admissions and enrollment systems and create thousands of fake student accounts over the space of a few days. “Some of these accounts appear to be leveraged almost immediately for criminal activity,” the office said.

Josh Sosnin, chief information security officer at Ellucian, said in an emailed statement that there is no connection between the security flaw and the generation of the fake student accounts. “Ellucian has confirmed internally that the two issues outlined in the Department of Education report are separate, unrelated issues,” he said. “There is no connection between these two issues and Ellucian has communicated this to the Department of Education.”

If your campus uses Banner/Ellucian as a SIS, I hope you install updates in a timely manner. So far 62 campuses have reported they were affected by exploitation of a vulnerability in the product by ""criminal elements."" Patch was released May 14. #emchat https://t.co/SwIkZvdZaN — Dr. Liz Gross (@lizgross144) July 18, 2019

Institutions being targeted by bots that submit fraudulent admissions applications are “an industry issue and not specific to Ellucian or Banner,” said Sosnin. He added that Ellucian’s customer service employees are “standing by to help” customers with questions about patches or updates.

Why the FSA office is reporting on the Banner security flaw two months after it was patched by Ellucian is unclear. It is also not clear how the flaw was discovered, though the NIST advisory links to a document suggesting that it may have been identified as early as December 2018 by Joshua Mulliken, a member of IT staff at the University of South Carolina.

In a GitHub post, Mulliken outlines a “disclosure timeline” indicating that Ellucian took several months to address his concerns. Mulliken said via email that he was the first person to identify the security flaw.

""Ellucian has not been proactive in ensuring that its customers understand the seriousness of CVE-2019-8978,"" said Mulliken. ""Several institutions have reached out to me today and informed me that the had deferred updating for some time. The official messaging was not able to convey the urgency required, which more than likely contributed to the current situation.""

Scott Shackelford, professor of law and cybersecurity program chair at Indiana University at Bloomington, said it is not uncommon for organizations to take several months to release patches addressing security issues, particularly if they “don’t think it’s particularly troublesome.”

Moving forward, Shackelford encouraged colleges and universities to pay attention when companies release updates and install them “as quickly as possible.”

“This really boils down to basic cyberhygiene,” he said. He encouraged institutions to limit the number of users with administrative privileges for Banner and other enterprise resource planning software.

Both Shackelford and Emory Roane, privacy counsel at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization that tracks data breach disclosures and advocates for consumer data protection, said it could take weeks before more information about the data breach is made public.

Depending on where institutions are located and what type of data were affected, there are different reporting requirements for disclosing breaches, said Shackelford. In Georgia, for example, there is no state-enforced timeline for reporting data breaches, he said. Roane would like to see that change -- he thinks the U.S. should move closer to Europe’s 72-hour disclosure requirement under the General Data Protection Regulation.

Without disclosures, it is difficult to determine how serious the Banner data breaches are, said Shackelford.

Charlie Moran, senior partner and CEO of Moran Technology Consulting, described the breach as “bad, but only for a small number of schools.”

Most of the 1,400 institutions using Banner have already made the transition to Banner 9 modules, said Moran. “Most schools moved to Banner 9 this past year in a forced march because of a major software change that Ellucian was forced to make, so there are not a lot of schools running this old software,” he said."
Prosecutors weighed DOJ policy blocking indictment of a sitting president in closing Trump hush-money probe,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Kevin Johnson', 'Kristine Phillips', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/18/justice-department-weighed-rule-not-charging-president-ending-trump-hush-money-case/1769339001/,"CLOSE President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid money to women to be quiet about alleged affairs with Trump during his 2016 campaign. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors' decision to end an investigation into hush money payments to women claiming affairs with Donald Trump relied at least in part on long-standing Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.

The Justice Department told a federal judge on Monday that it had ""effectively concluded"" its investigation into efforts to silence the women in the final months of the 2016 campaign, but did not explain why it had done so. Prosecutors have said the payoffs violated a federal law that restricts campaign donations.

A person familiar with the case, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, said it was unclear whether prosecutors made a determination that they had sufficient evidence to bring a case against Trump or anyone other than his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who pleaded guilty last year. But the Justice Department's opinion that a president cannot be indicted factored into the decision to end the probe, the person said.

Federal prosecutors had repeatedly placed Trump at the center of the effort to silence pornographic actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal during the chaotic run-up to the 2016 election. Last year, they alleged in a court filing that Cohen had orchestrated illegal hush-money payments ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. And it revealed in unsealed court records on Friday that Trump participated in phone calls about the payments to Daniels.

The judgment by federal prosecutors in New York to take no further action in the wide-ranging inquiry tracks a decision earlier this year by former special counsel Robert Mueller, who cited the same Justice Department policy when he declined to make a determination about whether Trump's efforts to derail that investigation amounted to a crime.

The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded in 2000 that ""a sitting President is constitutionally immune from indictment and criminal prosecution."" That view has never been tested in court but is binding on federal prosecutors.

As in the Mueller inquiry, which outlined 10 instances in which Trump sought to thwart the special counsel's inquiry, documents revealed Thursday put then-candidate Trump in middle of a frantic effort to fend off damaging disclosures about his personal conduct just a month before the 2016 election.

In the documents, the FBI described a series of conversations in the days after a leaked Access Hollywood outtake showed Trump boasting about grabbing women by the genitals about preventing Daniels from airing her own claims of having had an affair with Trump years earlier.

Authorities laid out a timeline of emails, text messages and phone calls – some involving Trump himself – that ""concerned the need to prevent"" Daniels from going public with her story.

Trump denied knowledge of the payments after they became public. But the FBI told a judge it had obtained telephone records showing he participated in some of the first conversations about the scheme, which prosecutors have said violated federal campaign finance laws.

Federal prosecutors said in court filings last year that Cohen orchestrated payments to Daniels and McDougal, ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. The documents unsealed Thursday offer the first clear account of the extent of Trump's involvement in that effort, as the Republican nominee's campaign floundered just weeks before the election.

Ultimately, it was Cohen – not Trump – who was charged and convicted for the scheme. He is serving a three-year sentence in federal prison related to tax evasion and the hush-money scheme that amounted to illegal campaign finance violations. He also pleaded guilty to Congress about efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign.

""Cohen's commission of two campaign finance crimes on the eve of the 2016 election for president of the United States struck a blow to one of the core goals of the federal campaign finance laws: transparency,"" prosecutors asserted prior to Cohen's sentencing.

In the same document, however, prosecutors indicated that Cohen was acting on behalf of Trump who they then-described in gauzy law enforcement vernacular as ""Individual 1.""

""The investigation is over,"" Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said Thursday. He declined to address whether the current Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president blocked any further action contemplated by New York prosecutors.

The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

But from a federal prison in upstate New York, Cohen continued to claim that his conviction should not mark the end of an investigation that has long shadowed the White House.

""I and members of The Trump Organization were directed by Mr. Trump to handle the Stormy Daniels matter; including making the hush money payment,” Cohen said in a statement Thursday. “The conclusion of the investigation exonerating The Trump Organization's role should be of great concern to the American people and investigated by Congress and the Department of Justice.”

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the unsealed documents bolstered Cohen's assertions.

""The inescapable conclusion from all of the public materials available now is that there was ample evidence to charge Donald Trump with the same criminal election law violations for which Michael Cohen pled guilty,"" Schiff said.

Feds Say Former VA Employee Used Vets’ Ailing Kids to Scam Millions,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Lachlan Markay', 'Seamus Hughes']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/feds-say-former-va-employee-used-vets-ailing-kids-to-scam-millions?source=politics&via=rss,"A Department of Veterans Affairs employee used a network of shell companies to steal millions of dollars from a VA program to provide health services to children of veterans who are suffering from a debilitating spinal condition, federal prosecutors say.

The Justice Department lodged 23 federal criminal charges late last year against Joseph Prince, a former Veterans Affairs employee who prosecutors say used his position to steer almost $20 million in taxpayer money to companies run by family members and associates. Those companies then provided huge kickbacks to Prince, his wife, and other family members, the government alleges.

The previously unreported criminal case appears set to go to trial in Colorado in November. Prince has pleaded not guilty. An alleged co-conspirator, Roland Vaughn, initially did the same, but recent federal court filings indicate he is set to change that plea to guilty at a hearing early next month. Neither of their attorneys responded to requests for comment on the case.

Before he was fired late last year, Prince worked at a VA facility in Denver, where he oversaw a program that provides health benefits to the families of Vietnam and Korean War veterans with children who suffer from spina bifida, a debilitating spinal birth defect. Part of Prince’s job entailed counseling those families about the treatment options available to them through the VA. Prosecutors say he exploited that position of trust to steer patients to seven different home health agencies that subsequently kicked back money to Prince and his family.

The scale of the alleged fraud was extraordinary, according to data filed by federal prosecutors in search warrant affidavits. Of the $25.2 million the VA paid to home health agencies through the spina bifida program from June 2017 through June 2018, $18.9 million, or 75 percent, was paid to the seven companies implicated in the indictment against Prince.

Prince’s alleged scheme involved selling VA patients on home health services offered through the department’s spina bifida program. Certain services can be performed by family members and others without medical training provided they register with the VA ahead of time. Those services include basic assistance with daily tasks such as meal preparation and home care, but home providers can also be certified by medical professionals to help with bladder and bowel care often required for spina bifida patients. They can then submit invoices for services provided for reimbursement at a preset hourly rate.

According to the indictment, Prince sold patients on the benefits of doing that home health work themselves and recouping the hourly payments that the VA provided. He even allegedly encouraged them to falsely inflate the number of hours they worked, and falsely told some that there were minimum hourly billing requirements.

Prince then referred the patients to one of seven home health companies, assuring them that the companies could secure them the best reimbursement rates and assist with VA red tape. One of those companies was run by Prince’s wife. Others had reached pre-arranged deals with Prince under which he would steer them VA patients in exchange for referral fees. In many cases, Prince even sent patients prepopulated VA forms with his preferred home health agency.

Prince vouched for the companies’ track records even though, according to prosecutors, none were run by medical professionals. He used terms like “preferred,” “handpicked,” and “vetted,” and promised that the companies would assist with the red tape and would take the smaller fees than their competitors off of VA reimbursement checks.

In fact, the companies were taking huge premiums—paying home health caregivers between $16 and $20 per hour while filing for VA reimbursement at hourly rates between $86 and $141.

When patients found out about that discrepancy, they were livid. After receiving a regular statement of benefits from the VA, one beneficiary referred to a Prince-affiliated agency wrote to Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI) in April 2018. “Our daughter is in the Spina Bifida Program,” the unnamed parent wrote, according to documents filed in court. “The program has a provision to provide health care for her at home for the rest of her life. We were told that we would be paid for this. We signed a contract with a company that would take care of getting us paid, but they didn’t tell us that they got to keep 82% and pay us 18% for doing all the work. This is highway robbery.”

The scheme was extremely lucrative for both Prince and the home health agencies with which he worked. Prosecutors say his wife’s Advantage Home Health Agency alone received more than $4.3 million in VA payments as part of its work for the spina bifida program. Three agencies owned by Prince’s half-sister received more than $7.1 million.

Together, all seven agencies kicked back roughly $1.5 million to Prince individually, according to the indictment, and hundreds of thousands more to members of his family.

Some of the money went directly into Prince’s bank account, while some was paid to a consulting firm he owns. He used the funds to buy a house and a car, pay down student loans, fund plastic surgery procedures (for whom it’s not clear), and even to donate to his and his wife’s church, according to documents filed by federal prosecutors.

In an emailed statement, the church said Prince “has not been associated with our congregation for quite a while,” but that “we are saddened to learn of these allegations, and our prayers are extended to all who may have been victimized by the crime alleged.”

Prince was arrested last summer after an investigation by the FBI and the VA inspector general's criminal investigations division. The evidence against him appears to be considerable, due in large measure to the official record of his time at the VA. Because he worked in a call center, all of Prince’s phone conversations were recorded. And his emails were preserved as required under the Federal Records Act. Federal prosecutors have amassed an evidentiary record consisting of at least 6,000 printed pages and 1,414 audio files.

“Evidence at trial will include the testimony of numerous witnesses, including VA employees, at least 16 caregivers… as well as the playing of recorded phone calls between Mr. Prince and the beneficiaries, which will be time consuming,” according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have also filed more than 40 federal seizure notices on the bank accounts of those involved in the scam, hoping to get back nearly $3.2 million taken by Prince and his associates.

During questioning after his arrest, Prince denied any wrongdoing, and said “he thought he was providing more benefit to the beneficiaries and caregivers by sending them to companies that were going to pay them more for the same services.”

Privately, his tone was far different. The FBI recruited the owner of one of the implicated home health agencies to conduct a monitored phone call with Prince, during which he admitted receiving kickbacks from the agencies to which he referred patients. “It may not be” legal, Prince admitted.

“All it takes is one person to say something and that’s the end of it for everybody,” he added. But “everything is fine if nobody finds out.”"
U.S. Air Force to begin transferring space situational awareness data to Commerce Department,https://spacenews.com,['Caleb Henry'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://spacenews.com/u-s-air-force-to-begin-transferring-space-situational-awareness-data-to-commerce-department/,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Commerce Department is “imminently” close to receiving a repository of satellite and space debris tracking data from the Air Force, a Commerce official said Wednesday.

Kevin O’Connell, director of the Commerce Department’s Office of Space Commerce, said the repository, called the Unified Data Library, is the first step in the transfer of some space situational awareness responsibilities as requested by the White House last year.

President Donald Trump, in signing Space Policy Directive 3 in June 2018, directed the Defense Department to give the publicly releasable portion of its space situational awareness data to the Commerce Department.

O’Connell said there is a growing urgency for the Commerce Department to begin handling that responsibility, driven particularly by the deployment of megaconstellations that could add thousands of new satellites in low Earth orbit.

“We had an approach that served us well for decades,” O’Connell said July 17 during a panel organized by the International Astronautical Congress here. “That approach won’t serve us well for the next decade, or the decades to come, given even our most modest expectations about the space economy.”

Satellite operators have relied on the U.S. Air Force for notifications when other satellites or debris are on a possible collision course. The White House wants the military to shed that responsibility so it can focus on “maintaining access to and freedom of action in space,” according to Space Policy Directive 3.

As the Commerce Department prepares to carry that mantle, it is looking to commercial companies to play a big role, O’Connell said.

The Commerce Department issued a request for information to industry in April that received 42 responses, O’Connell said. That response rate led the department to extend the comment window until the end of July, he said.

“I’m amazed at what’s come back,” O’Connell said. He estimated another 20 responses will likely come in before the process is completed.

O’Connell said companies not traditionally associated with the space industry, such as those involved in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and machine-to-machine communications, are presenting ideas on how to improve space situational awareness.

“We are going to get to work with some of these companies when we get access to this iteration of the Unified Data Library,” he said.

O’Connell said the Commerce Department has had extensive conversations with U.S. allies about their participation in the department’s new responsibilities. The Unified Data Library will be their first opportunity to get involved, he said.

The Commerce Department has not finalized the framework for handling its new responsibilities. George Nield, the former FAA associate administrator for commercial space transportation, suggested the government initiate a civil space traffic management pilot program as soon as possible.

“Ideally, this would be a whole of government effort with participation by interested stakeholders who are industry, academia and the international community,” Nield said during the panel. “Initial activities could take advantage of existing hardware, software and observations.”

Nield said the purpose of the pilot program would be to measure the new system against what the Air Force currently provides.

The Commerce Department is making progress bringing commercial and allied stakeholders together, O’Connell said, which he described as promising, though not at the level Nield suggested.

“We are seeing that kind of discussion,” O’Connell said. “It’s probably not as ambitious as a pilot, but it’s what is being done today.”

Members of the Satellite Industry Association are developing policy suggestions as well, according to Therese Jones, the trade group’s senior director of policy. She said the association, whose members include spacecraft operators such as Intelsat and Spire, as well as commercial space situational awareness companies AGI and ExoAnalytic Solutions, want to work on sharing data and improving data quality, among other things.

“I would encourage everyone to think not as much about prescriptive technical solutions as I would suggest thinking about what sort of outcome you want from whatever technical solution is currently at hand,” she said."
Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area,https://www.npr.org,['Merrit Kennedy'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/07/17/742519999/future-of-key-farming-research-uncertain-as-2-3-of-usda-staff-say-they-wont-move,"Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

Two vital research agencies at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are hemorrhaging staff as less than two-thirds of the researchers asked to relocate from Washington to the Kansas City area have agreed to do so.

When U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the planned new location of the research agencies last month, he said it ""will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders"" and ""increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture.""

But groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists call it a ""blatant attack on science"" that will ""especially hurt farmers, ranchers and eaters at a particularly vulnerable time.""

The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA's Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, said the relocation ""has resulted in catastrophic attrition at USDA's top research agencies.""

""Evidence suggests that the relocation of these agencies is an attempt to hollow out and dismantle USDA science that helps farmers and protects our food supply,"" the union added.

The USDA gave employees until just before midnight on Monday to notify their employers whether they planned to accept the relocation.

On Tuesday, a USDA spokesperson told NPR that at ERS, 72 employees accepted relocation and 99 declined or did not respond. At NIFA, the spokesperson said 73 accepted and 151 declined or did not respond. That means the total number that accepted is about 36% of those reported.

The USDA spokesperson said that these numbers may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the date employees are expected to report to the area, and employees can change their statuses until then.

They added that the USDA is working ""to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA's work.""

Last month, the USDA said that of the 644 jobs in the two agencies, 544 would be relocated and 100 would remain in the D.C. area. The numbers reported on Tuesday by the USDA do not appear to account for some 150 positions that the USDA initially announced would be relocated.

The department did not immediately respond to explain the difference, though the employees' union has reported high rates of ""retirements, employees securing new jobs, and employees choosing to be terminated."" A statement last month from three Democratic senators said that ERS had a vacancy rate of 20% and NIFA had a vacancy rate of 26.4%.

NIFA provides grants for research on agriculture-related science, and the ERS conducts research and analysis on topics such as outlooks on major crops and livestock, how much food is going to cost and whether U.S. households will be food secure.

It's not yet clear whether the research agencies will be located in Kansas or Missouri, according to The Kansas City Star.

Lawmakers from both states, including Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, have supported the move. ""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" the Republican said, as NPR's Frank Morris reported.

An ex-employee of ERS recently told Morris that ""efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale."" He said the way the agency is run has become increasingly partisan, and he resigned after the surprise announcement about relocations.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee told Morris.

Some of ERS' recent studies, as Morris noted, may be politically uncomfortable for the Trump administration:

""ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.""

Perdue said last month that the move would save the USDA some $300 million. That number has been met with skepticism by some analysts. The Agricultural & Applied Economics Association estimated the relocation would actually cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million, partially due to the lost value of the research from staffers who decide not to move."
Homeland Security has gutted programs aimed at stopping WMD terrorism,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-07-17/times-investigation-homeland-security-gutted-programs-aimed-at-stopping-wmd-terrorism,"The Trump administration has quietly dismantled or cut back multiple programs that were created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to help detect and prevent terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction, a Times investigation has found.

The retreat has taken place over the last two years at the Department of Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block potential chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

The changes, not previously reported, were made without rigorous review of potential security vulnerabilities, The Times found, undermining government-wide efforts aimed at countering terrorist attacks involving unconventional weapons, known as WMD.

More than 30 current and former Homeland Security employees and contractors voiced concern that the changes — including the cancellation of dozens of training exercises and the departure of scores of scientists and policy experts — have put Americans at greater risk.

“What we had done in the past was analytically based: Where are the threats? Where can we get the most return on the taxpayers’ investment for security?” said Paul Ryan, who until mid-2017 helped lead Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was merged with another office last year.

“We’re not as secure as we were 18 months ago,” said Ryan, a retired Navy rear admiral.

The cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, who has been appointed by President Trump to successive posts at Homeland Security, a long-troubled department that has seen waves of leadership changes and policy upheaval since 2017.

McDonnell declined through a Homeland Security spokeswoman to be interviewed for this report, and the department did not answer written questions submitted on June 27.

On July 15, the spokeswoman, Ruth Clemens, emailed a three-sentence statement, saying that the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads, “is focused on preventing WMD terrorism by working with federal, state, and local partners across the nation.”

It also said, “some programs were realigned or restructured to better address threats, remove bureaucratic redundancy, and fully align with [Trump’s] National Security Strategy.”

Trump pledged in that 2017 document to “augment measures to secure, eliminate, and prevent the spread of WMD and related materials … to reduce the chance that they might fall into the hands of hostile actors.”

Among the programs gutted since 2017, however, was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” whose specialists conducted dozens of drills and assessments around the country each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing “dirty bomb.”

Another Homeland Security unit, the Operations Support Directorate, had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The directorate participated in less than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year, according to internal Homeland Security documents.

Experts at Homeland Security’s National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center had worked with counterparts throughout the federal government to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

The center has been reduced to a shell: Its leadership is out and its staff has shrunk to three positions from about 14.

A separate Homeland Security component, the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

Also cut back was the use of specialized, mobile detection units to help protect large public events from nuclear and radiological threats. The deployments have helped train local and state responders for a potential emergency.

For the first time in years, Homeland Security did not send a unit to protect the NCAA Final Four college basketball championship in April in Minneapolis or to an annual hot air balloon festival last fall in Albuquerque.

Homeland Security also has halted work to update a formal “strategic, integrated” assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks.

The assessment had previously analyzed millions of potential WMD threat scenarios. Under a directive President George W. Bush signed in 2007, the assessment is supposed to be updated at least every other year to provide objective guidance for the government’s purchases of detection-related technologies and medications for use following an attack.

“These risk assessments are how we stay ahead of the game,” said a former Homeland Security official, one of many who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing a security clearance or other retaliation. “If we don’t keep updating those assessments, then we essentially lose the little bit of focus that we have on the problem and we really risk a strategic surprise.”

The risk assessments provide “an understanding of where to make investments that are targeted to reduce the risk of terrorism,” a current Homeland Security official added. If effective detection technologies are not put in place and if the right medications are not procured for the nation’s emergency stockpile, “that’s putting people at risk,” the official said.

Overall, more than 100 scientists and policy experts specializing in radiological and nuclear threats have been reassigned or left to take jobs unrelated to their expertise, The Times found, undermining the department’s ability to protect the nation from devastating attacks.

Similar turmoil has unfolded among those who had specialized in countering such biological threats as airborne spores of anthrax.

In the worst biological attack in U.S. history, letters laced with powdered anthrax spores were sent through the U.S. mail soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Five Americans were killed and 17 others were infected. In July 2008, an Army scientist, Bruce E. Ivins, killed himself after he learned he was about to be indicted for the anthrax deaths.

Current and former Homeland Security officials warned in interviews that cutting back training around the country could erode readiness among those who would first confront a WMD terrorism attack.

“You keep the country safe by empowering state and local first responders who are out and about 24/7, 365 [days a year],” said one former Homeland Security official.

“The real thing could happen tomorrow with no warning,” another former official said. “And the only practice our defenders are going to have is through these ‘red team’ studies and actual exercises. That activity is necessary to ensure even basic competence.”

The changes have undermined the U.S. government’s multi-agency commitment since 2006 to build and maintain a “global nuclear detection architecture,” according to the present and former officials.

The goal, specified in legislation, was a layered network — from locations overseas to inside U.S. cities — to detect and assist the seizure of radiological or nuclear materials that could be wielded by terrorists.

McDonnell has become a formidable figure at the Department of Homeland Security since Trump named him director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in early 2017. In May 2018, the president promoted him to be an assistant secretary of Homeland Security, heading the new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

Trump signed the legislation that formally merged the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was responsible for reducing the risk of radiological and nuclear terrorism, with the Office of Health Affairs, which had run BioWatch, the nation’s system for detecting potential airborne biological terrorism threats.

McDonnell has used broad discretion over the last two years to shift priorities and policies regarding WMD terrorism. Some of the changes are at odds with priorities authorized by formal presidential directives and by legislation enacted into law, The Times found.

The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center, for example, was established in 2006 under Bush, and affirmed by legislation signed by President Obama in 2010, to help counter smuggling of nuclear materials that could be used in an attack. It has now been effectively gutted.

Separately, the presidential directive that Bush signed in 2007 required Homeland Security to update the integrated assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks “not less frequently than every two years.” The directive remains in force, along with two related mandates, but the update is incomplete and is more than two years overdue, The Times found.

Michael Grossman, who collaborated with Homeland Security specialists during his six years as chief of the Los Angeles County sheriff’s anti-terrorism section, said any slippage in attention to the WMD threat concerns him, in part because regaining readiness would take time.

“If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready,” he said.

Current and former Homeland Security officials said they have struggled to grasp McDonnell’s rationale for cutting back training and other efforts intended to improve readiness, detection and tracing. They cited instances when specialists were removed from their areas of expertise in apparent retaliation for raising concerns about his policies.

Although the mobile detection units were deployed 70 or more times a year in response to requests from state and local officials, for example, McDonnell told subordinates he wants them used chiefly to support other Homeland Security operations and agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard.

Those agencies already have nuclear-detection equipment and procedures in place, according to congressional testimony and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

In 2016, Customs and Border Protection deployed specialized equipment to scan almost 100% of the cargo bound for and arriving at U.S. ports of entry, for example. It uses 1,400 giant radiation portal monitors to scan vehicles and cargo at land-border crossings, seaports, airports and mail facilities, the GAO reported that October.

Trump has repeatedly vowed to prevent terrorists from gaining access to unconventional weapons. In December, he said the “efforts will require close collaboration with and support to” the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency, based in Vienna.

But McDonnell has disbanded the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with the IAEA to help ensure dangerous nuclear material is seized overseas before it could be smuggled into the United States.

An IAEA official said “numerous” collaborations with Homeland Security over the years had bolstered nuclear security worldwide but that the joint efforts had come to a near-standstill.

“We hope that they would join in again,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

The Homeland Security division had participated in exercises with other IAEA member nations and helped generate “guidelines and best practices” that were adopted by 42 nations, according to one of McDonnell’s predecessors.

“This strategic partnership will continue to serve as a force multiplier for nuclear security efforts for years to come,” Huban A. Gowadia, then director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, told the House Homeland Security Committee in February 2015.

To aid the collaborations, Homeland Security embedded a specialist at IAEA headquarters for several years. McDonnell eliminated the position.

Asked about the now-canceled position, an IAEA spokesman said in an email that the specialist had assisted member states “in strengthening their efforts to detect nuclear and radioactive material.”

Officials participating in a program known as Securing the Cities, which was intended as Homeland Security’s last layer of defense against radiological or nuclear terrorism, also have raised concerns.

Securing the Cities was supposed to fortify defenses in five major urban areas — greater Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Long Beach; New York City and nearby Newark, N.J.; Chicago; and Houston.

Overall, Homeland Security has provided the cities with training assistance and direct financial grants totaling about $145 million for detection equipment from 2007 to mid-2018. (The Los Angeles-Long Beach area was made part of Securing the Cities in 2012.)

But a GAO report dated May 13 described “confusion and uncertainty” among city officials participating in the program. According to the report, the chaotic circumstances have arisen, in part, because McDonnell has said he wants Homeland Security to reduce its participation and let other federal agencies play a larger role.

The GAO report said, however, that the agencies McDonnell had cited — the FBI and the National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the Energy Department — didn’t intend to do so.

Homeland Security officials told the GAO “that they have not conducted any studies or analyses that would justify making changes to the program,” the report states.

“We asked, `Why are you making changes and what are these changes going to look like?’” David Trimble, the supervising analyst for the report, recalled in an interview. “The details were very light. [Homeland Security] couldn’t really provide us a road map of where they were going. We found no analysis behind it.”

McDonnell’s overall objectives are unclear.

According to congressional budget experts, $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for his office — went unspent. The unspent funds reflect indecision surrounding the shifted priorities and staff departures, current and former Homeland Security officials said.

On Dec. 18, dissatisfaction at the changes erupted at an “all-hands” staff meeting convened by McDonnell and attended by Kirstjen Nielsen, then-Homeland Security secretary, along with scores of subordinates from the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

A supervisor, responsible for ensuring that operational expenditures are based on validated needs, stood and voiced concerns about McDonnell’s leadership and asked Nielsen to intervene, according to people who were in the room.

McDonnell sat silently and did not respond.

Soon after, Nielsen’s office instructed a personnel official, Sharon M. Wong, to conduct a “workplace climate assessment” to elicit opinions from current and recent staff members. Many of those who spoke with The Times said they also shared their misgivings with Wong.

One official said he had raised concerns about McDonnell’s efforts to install BioDetection 21, a controversial nationwide system intended to replace BioWatch for detecting airborne infectious agents such as anthrax. The replacement technology McDonnell is backing failed repeatedly in field testing sponsored by Homeland Security scientific staff.

The Times disclosed the test results and McDonnell’s support for BioDetection 21 in February, prompting a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation that is ongoing.

In early May, after Nielsen resigned, Wong submitted her results to the office of the acting Homeland Security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, according to people familiar with the matter. The results have not been released publicly.

Although morale at Homeland Security has long ranked lowest of all federal departments, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office had routinely scored much higher, according to surveys conducted by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.

In 2014, the office ranked 11th among similar “subcomponent” offices. Last year, it ranked 415th — last among its peers."
Daily on Energy: The EPA’s curious response to massive coal plant closure,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/daily-on-energy-the-epas-curious-response-to-massive-coal-plant-closure,"Subscribe today to the Washington Examiner magazine and get Washington Briefing: politics and policy stories that will keep you up to date with what's going on in Washington. SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue!

THE EPA’S CURIOUS RESPONSE TO MASSIVE COAL PLANT CLOSURE: The Trump administration is seeking to reassure coal industry allies that it was not the driving force behind a decision by a utility Thursday to shut down a massive Indiana coal plant.

The Environmental Protection Agency issued a statement Thursday night saying it “did not seek retirement” of a 1,300 megawatt coal unit run by American Electric Power, and affirming that EPA “supports power generation from all sources of energy.”

Environmentalist critics of the administration and even allies said EPA’s response was unusual, given the agency’s past role in filing a legal case against AEP that ultimately concluded in the utility deciding to close the coal plant.

Ohio-based AEP will retire the Rockport coal unit by 2028, which would be the largest single coal plant to be retired since 2010. The unit has existed since 1984.

“This is truly bizarre and bend-over-backwards craven,” John Walke of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) told me. “I have never seen anything like this in my 25 years as a Clean Air Act attorney. It's just political simpering to make sure it’s known the Trump administration does not agree with a company's own decision to retire a coal unit it owns.”

How the story begins: The story with the Rockport coal plant began in 2007, when AEP reached a deal with the George W. Bush administration EPA, several northeastern states, and environmental groups including NRDC to settle allegations that the utility expanded the plant without obtaining proper permits and installing pollution control equipment. AEP denied the allegations, and the courts did not decide on its innocence or guilt.

The so-called consent agreement has been revised 5 times since 2007, with AEP as part of the initial iterations, committing to install pollution control technologies. The Trump administration inherited the case when it took power in 2017.

AEP changes course: In May, the parties agreed to one last change to the agreement. Rather than continuing to install expensive pollution control equipment, AEP decided it would be less costly to simply retire the plant.

Judge Edmund Sargus of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio signed off on the agreement Thursday, permitting AEP to retire the coal plant.

Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for AEP, told me the utility decided to retire the coal plant for economic reasons, as it transitions to cleaner fuel sources. She said the Trump administration EPA, as a party to the consent decree, signed off on the changes.

“The consent decree was agreed to by all the parties,” McHenry said. “The administration’s position on coal and fuel diversity has been very clear. We still have coal. We still believe in fuel diversity. But for this coal unit, it makes sense for us to retire it.”

The decision comes as AEP aims to reduce coal use from nearly half its electricity mix to 27% by 2030, while cutting its carbon emissions 80% by 2050.

""Our investments are focused on renewable generation and advanced technologies that enhance service for our customers,"" AEP CEO Nicholas Akins said in a statement Thursday.

So why is EPA making this a big deal? EPA spokesman Michael Abboud clarified to me that the agency, by issuing its statement distancing itself from AEP’s decision, is not “registering opposition” to the utility’s move to close the coal plant. He said the agency sought to counter “inaccurate reporting” that he said was “conflating” EPA’s role in the decision, as if the agency mandated it.

To Walke, that’s beside the point.

“This is what the company wanted,” he said of AEP retiring the plant. “You can’t stop them.”

Jeff Holmstead, a Trump administration ally and attorney with the firm Bracewell, which represents coal-burning utilities, said that EPA’s statement seemed like it was meant to give the agency political cover.

“The EPA under this administration does not want anyone to believe the agency is forcing the closure of coal plants,” Holmstead told me. “The EPA’s statement just reflects the fact that our president has been very pro-coal and they don't want to be accused of undermining that.”

NEW YORK ANNOUNCES LARGEST OFFSHORE WIND CONTRACT IN US HISTORY: New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced Thursday that his state awarded the nation’s largest offshore wind agreement as part of an aggressive plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and expand renewable energy.

New York selected Danish power company Orstead and Norway-based oil and gas giant Equinor to build two wind projects off the coast of Long Island, totaling 1,700 megawatts, enough to power more than 1 million homes in the state. The projects will become operational within the next five years.

“With this agreement, New York will lead the way in developing the largest source of offshore wind power in the nation,” said Cuomo, a Democrat.

The announcement continues growing momentum for the young U.S. offshore wind industry, which has lagged that of Europe, where the energy source is cheap and has benefited from subsidies.

So far, Block Island, a small 30-megawatt wind farm off the Rhode Island coast that can power 17,000 homes, is the nation's only offshore project. Utility Dominion Energy began construction this month on a second offshore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia.

CUOMO ALSO SIGNS NET-ZERO EMISSIONS BILL: Cuomo made the offshore wind announcement after he signed a law passed by the state legislature last month requiring New York to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 across all sectors of the economy.

The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, considered the most aggressive climate legislation in the country, would require New York to cut its emissions 85% below 1990 levels by 2050, and offset the remaining 15% through methods such as carbon capture.

Its net-zero emissions by 2050 target is a state-level version of what many Democratic nominees for president have called for at the federal level.

As part of its goal, New York would have to obtain 70% of its electricity from renewables by 2030 and use entirely carbon-free power by 2040. The offshore wind project will help meet that goal.

New York currently gets about 60% of its electricity from carbon-free sources, mostly from hydro and nuclear power.

New York’s net-zero bill also applies to harder-to-decarbonize sectors such as transportation, buildings, and industrial facilities.

TRUMP SAYS US SHOT DOWN IRANIAN DRONE OVER STRAIT OF HORMUZ: The U.S. military shot down an Iranian drone threatening a U.S. warship in the Strait of Hormuz, President Trump said Thursday.

The U.S. took action amid escalating tensions with the Middle East country, and continued jostling in the Strait of Hormuz, a 21-mile-wide waterway linking the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. About 18.5 million barrels of oil travel through it daily, accounting for approximately 30% of the world's sea-traded oil. The U.S. has imposed strict sanctions on Iran’s oil exports.

Trump announced that the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer “took defensive action” and “immediately destroyed” the drone, which he said came too close for comfort to the ship.

“This is the latest of many provocative and hostile actions by Iran against vessels operating in international waters,” Trump said at a press conference.

A statement issued by Chief Pentagon Spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman used more careful language, which stopped short of claiming the drone was shot down or destroyed. “A fixed wing unmanned aerial system (UAS) approached Boxer and closed within a threatening range,” Hoffman said. “The ship took defensive action against the UAS to ensure the safety of the ship and its crew.”

Iran denies its drone was shot down: Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi mocked the accusation on Friday, and a spokesman for the Iranian military called the U.S. version of events “delusional and groundless,” according to CNN.

“We have not lost any drone in the Strait of Hormuz nor anywhere else,” Araghchi tweeted . “ I am worried that USS Boxer has shot down their own UAS by mistake!”

BIPARTISAN GROUP RELEASES BILL TO BOOST RENEWABLES ON PUBLIC LANDS: A bipartisan group of more than two dozen House members introduced legislation Thursday to boost renewable energy development on public lands.

The Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act would streamline permitting of wind, solar, and geothermal energy on public lands. It establishes a revenue-sharing mechanism from the energy production that seeks to ensure a fair return among relevant stakeholders, including the state and counties hosting the development.

About 15% of the revenues will be used to help speed the processing of permit applications and reducing a backlog of renewable energy permits on public lands.

""This bipartisan bill will cut red tape standing in the way of developing renewable energy across America's public lands,” said Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, the lead co-sponsor of the bill with Democrat Mike Levin of California.

House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva of Arizona and top Republican Rob Bishop of Utah also co-sponsored the bill, an unusual alliance given their usual feuding over energy issues.

“Supporting all energy resources such as wind, solar, and geothermal ensures a reliable and affordable domestic energy supply while supporting well-paying American jobs,” Bishop said.

BISHOP RECONSIDERS PLAN TO RETIRE IN 2020: Bishop may not retire in 2020 as originally planned, he told reporters Thursday.

""I was surprised at the number of people who are asking me to reconsider it, and in deference I need to do that,"" he said, in comments reported by Politico and E&E News.

Bishop, 68, had indicated before winning re-election in 2018 that he planned to retire instead of running for a tenth-term in 2020.

But Bishop now says he will officially announce a decision on whether to run again July 29 in Utah. Bishop is a supporter of Trump’s agenda to expand energy development on public lands, and was influential in pushing the president to shrink the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante national monuments in Utah.

Bishop has served two of his terms (four years) as chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, which oversees public lands policy and the Interior Department. This is his first two-year term as ranking member. GOP House rules limit chairs and ranking members to six years atop a committee, so Bishop could not serve in those positions again if he were to run and win in 2020.

Treasury yields clinch weekly decline after Fed officials hint at rate cut in July,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/19/us-bonds-traders-consider-a-fed-rate-cut.html,"U.S. government debt yields rose on Friday but notched weekly declines as fixed-income traders snapped up bonds in anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut later this month.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP)

The House on Wednesday voted to hold Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt for failing to provide documents related to the Trump administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, escalating the fight between Democrats and the White House over congressional oversight.

The 230-to-198 vote along party lines came one day after the House approved a resolution condemning President Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority congresswomen.

After a string of legal defeats, Trump last week abruptly retreated from his efforts to add the question to the census, announcing that he will instead order federal agencies to provide the Commerce Department with records on the numbers of citizens and noncitizens in the country.

But lawmakers continue to demand answers about the motivations behind the administration’s 19-month effort to ask about citizenship status on the decennial survey. In May, new evidence emerged suggesting that the question was crafted specifically to give an electoral advantage to Republicans and whites. The Trump administration has said it needs the information to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.

Barr and Ross wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) earlier Wednesday saying they “strongly oppose” the resolution and asked her to postpone the vote so they could continue working through a legally mandated process toward a compromise.

“By taking this action, the House is both unnecessarily undermining inter-branch comity and degrading the constitutional separation of powers and its own institutional integrity,” the two Cabinet members wrote.

In a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called the vote “ridiculous” and said it was “yet another lawless attempt to harass the president and his administration.”

“House Democrats know they have no legal right to these documents, but their shameful and cynical politics know no bounds,” she said.

Ross said in a statement that the vote was a “PR stunt” and that Democrats “made every attempt to ascribe evil motivations to everyday functions of government.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec defended the department’s efforts and said that “holding the Attorney General in contempt for working in good-faith with Congress marks a new low for Speaker Pelosi’s House of Representatives.”

The impact of the contempt vote is largely symbolic. Those found in criminal contempt are normally referred to the Justice Department for prosecution; in this instance, the Justice Department would not prosecute itself.

During Wednesday’s floor debate, Republicans cast Democrats’ holding of the vote as merely a political show.

“We may be in July, but it’s Groundhog Day all over again,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. Pointing to the contempt vote, a Democratic resolution on impeachment and Tuesday’s resolution condemning Trump’s racist remarks aimed at four minority Democratic congresswomen, McCarthy said Democrats are consumed with passing measures “attacking Trump” while voters are more concerned with kitchen-table issues.

Rep. Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) defended the administration’s efforts to inquire about citizenship, contending that asking such a question is “standard operating procedure” in other countries, including Canada and Australia. “Knowing who is in our country should not be controversial,” she said.

Some Democrats responded by arguing that the administration’s efforts were part of a broader pattern of seeking to dilute the power of minority voters. Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.) said the push for the citizenship question was “disturbing” because “it’s in a context of voter suppression that’s all across America.”

“Asking the citizenship question on the census is part and parcel of that scheme to discourage minority voting in America, to frighten immigrant communities,” Connolly said.

Others, such as Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), said the battle was about congressional oversight of the executive branch, noting that the Trump administration had “already lost” the policy battle in the courts.

“They lost because their justification was ‘contrived,’ according to Chief Justice Roberts,” Raskin said, adding: “This is about congressional power.”

Trump’s order came after the Supreme Court ruled that the administration cannot move forward on adding the question without providing a solid justification for its plan.

In their letter, Barr and Ross wrote that their departments had made “significant efforts” to accommodate Congress’s requests, and they disagreed that they had tried to obstruct lawmakers’ inquiry. They claimed that the “limited materials still at issue are subject to a number of legal privileges that have been upheld in the pending litigation, as well as the president’s assertion of executive privilege.”

“There is no information to hide; there are institutional integrities to preserve,” they wrote.

In April, the Oversight Committee authorized its chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), to issue subpoenas for a deposition of John Gore, principal deputy assistant attorney general, and to Barr and Ross for documents related to the 2020 Census decision. But the Justice Department said it would not comply with the subpoena for Gore to testify about the question, and the administration has vowed to stonewall all House subpoenas.

In an interview Wednesday morning on Fox Business Network, Ross maintained that the administration will push ahead on gathering citizenship data through other means.

“Well, I think it’s just gamesmanship on their part,” he said of the continued opposition by Democrats. “They know we’re going to come much closer to the answer than we ever have before, because with the president’s executive order, we’re having much better access to federal documents than we ever had before.”

Wednesday’s vote is only the latest attempt by House Democrats to force the administration to submit to congressional oversight. Last month, the House voted to seek court enforcement of subpoenas for Barr and former White House counsel Donald McGahn.

A move by the House to hold a sitting attorney general in contempt of Congress is rare but not unprecedented: In 2012, the Republican-led House voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt over his failure to provide material in the probe of Operation Fast and Furious, a federal government program targeting gun trafficking by Mexican cartels.

Oakland’s lawyers believe DOJ got involved in suit against NFL for political reasons,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com,['Posted Mike Florio'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/07/19/oaklands-lawyers-believe-doj-got-involved-in-suit-against-nfl-for-political-reasons/,"Getty Images

The Trump administration is possibly trying to help the NFL. Or, possibly, it’s trying to hurt Oakland.

Daniel Kaplan of TheAthletic.com reports that there’s a belief within the city’s legal team that the Department of Justice has butted in to the antitrust lawsuit challenging the relocation of the Raiders as retaliation against Oakland for Major Libby Schaaf’s criticism of President Trump.

“Oakland is not this particular administration or this president’s favorite city,” an unnamed source close to the city’s legal team told Kaplan. “And the mayor has been outspoken in her criticism of the current administration. But [it] wouldn’t surprise me that that was a factor.”

The DOJ filed a “statement of interest” arguing that Oakland can’t recover lost tax revenues and lease revenues through the antitrust lawsuit. If accepted, the argument wouldn’t kill the case, but it would limit the potential recovery.

“The reason why it’s kind of bizarre is that this little argument they make is really not particularly substantive; it doesn’t get rid of the case,” the unnamed source tells Kaplan. “So you wonder why, other than for political reasons, why would they file something that’s so totally stupid?”

I’m personally more inclined to think — and this is speculation, but when has that ever stopped me? — that it’s not an attack on Oakland but a favor to the NFL, which would further confirm the notion (partly speculation, partly informed) that something significant has happened behind the scenes to dramatically reverse the relationship of antagonism that existed between the President and the NFL.

From complaints about the concussion rules to taking credit for the league’s dramatic dip in ratings to a profane attack at an Alabama rally against players who protest during the playing of the national anthem to relentless criticism of the league’s handling of its anthem policy, President Trump was a major thorn in the league’s side until he suddenly wasn’t, dropping a low-hanging red-meat issue that would have been very easy to keep raising through the mid-term elections, and beyond.

So, yes, something happened. Maybe it was as simple as the public “thank you” from Commissioner Roger Goodell to the President regarding a fairly obscure business issue in Canada."
Treasury Department targets senior Hezbollah operative with sanctions,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/treasury-department-targets-senior-hezbollah-operative-with-sanctions/,"The Trump administration is targeting a senior Hezbollah operative with sanctions in what the White House says is an unprecedented use of economic pressure.

The Treasury Department announced Friday morning it's designating Salman Raouf Salman for acting on behalf of the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which the administration says is responsible for the planning, coordination and execution of terrorist attacks and for undermining the security of Lebanon. The State Department is also offering $7 million for information that leads to his capture.

""This administration will continue to target Hezbollah terrorists who plot horrific murderous operations and indiscriminately kill innocent civilians on behalf of this violent group and its Iranian patrons,"" said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, in a statement. ""We are targeting Salman Raouf Salman, who coordinated a devastating attack in Buenos Aires, Argentina against the largest Jewish center in South America 25 years ago and has directed terrorist operations in the Western Hemisphere for Hezbollah ever since.""

The White House insisted in a briefing with senior administration officials Friday that the action is not related to the Iranian drone the U.S. says it shot down in the Strait of Hormuz Thursday. The president announced on Thursday that a U.S. warship had destroyed an Iranian drone it believed was threatening a U.S. vessel. Iran, however, has denied losing one of its drones, suggesting the American vessel might even have blown one of the U.S. military's own drones out of the sky

One senior administration official tamped down talk of war during a briefing with reporters, emphasizing the ""president has been clear"" he wants the administration to handle things through ""diplomatic channels"" and has no interest in wars in the Middle East.

Asked if both sides are taking baby steps to get back to the table, a senior administration official said, ""the president has been frank that he is willing to talk to them when they are ready."" An official said it was ""up to Iranians"" whether they're any closer to talks.

EPA announces new program designed to clean up Great Lakes,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Mary Kilpatrick', 'Mkilpatrick Cleveland.Com']",07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2019/07/epa-announces-new-program-designed-to-clean-up-great-lakes.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio — EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler visited Cleveland Friday to announce a new program designed to help remove trash from the Great Lakes and its shores.

The Trash-Free Great Lakes grant program will provide about $2 million in grants to clean up waste along Great Lakes beaches, shorelines, harbors and rivers. The money will also support trash and litter prevention efforts in the Great Lakes, as well as educational projects.

""We are here today because the health of the Great Lakes is a top priority for President Trump and his administration,” Wheeler said during a news conference along Lake Erie. “We are committed to protecting and restoring one of America’s greatest natural resources.”

The program is part of the EPA’s Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which the Trump administration proposed cutting from $300 million to $30 million earlier this year. The administration less than a month later reversed course and supported fully funding the GLRI.

State and local agencies, tribes and non-profits can begin applying for Trash-Free Great Lakes grants in October. Applicants will find out they received grants in February. The program could pay for up to 12 grants — potentially enough to support two large projects and 10 smaller projects. The program could award grants up to $500,000.

The lake’s annual harmful algal bloom is forecasted to be more severe than last year, but on par with 2017. The bloom affects Toledo to the islands, contaminating drinking water, and turning it pea green. The size of the annual spread depends on how much rain falls on Northeast Indiana, Southeast Michigan and Northwest Ohio between March and July and how much phosphorus runs off farms into the Maumee River which feeds into the lake.

Wheeler said the EPA has recently announced $14 million in grants to help reduce nutrients, which include phosphorus, in the Great Lakes.

“We also recognize that marine litter is just one of the challenges facing the future of the Great Lakes,” he said.

Before announcing the trash cleanup program, Wheeler joined U.S. Rep. Dave Joyce, of Chagrin Falls, aboard the EPA’s largest research vessel, the Lake Guardian, and heard from scientists about their work studying the Great Lakes.

The EPA each year surveys all of the Great Lakes, once in the spring and once in the summer. In addition, the agency studies the dead zone in Lake Erie annually.

The agency also annually spends an intensive period studying one of the Great Lakes, rotating each year between each of the bodies of water. This year, it’s Lake Erie’s turn.

Wheeler and Joyce surveyed how the vessel sampled water and mud samples in Lake Erie. The scientists said they’ve seen areas in the lake that appear to have lots of mayfly boroughs, a positive indicator of the lake’s health. The officials also saw the equipment the scientists used to take photographs and film underwater, to see, for example, how many invasive mussel species there are. One instrument, a sled constructed using snow mobile parts, is dragged along the lake floor to take videos of the lake bottom.

Scientists are also studying naturally occurring manganese levels, a metal found in Lake Erie’s sentiment. The metal can unbind from sentiment in low oxygen areas, creating foul-smelling, yellow water, that’s expensive to treat. Scientists are trying to come up with a model to predict these spikes in manganese for water treatment plants.

Wheeler, an Ohio native and a graduate of Case Western Reserve University, remarked that he believes he’s the only EPA administrator to go swimming in the Great Lakes.

“I’ve been swimming in Lake Erie and I want to make sure that future generations can continue to go swimming in Lake Erie,” he said during the news conference."

"Donald Trump is not America's first racist president, but hopefully he'll be our last",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Paul Brandus', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/17/donald-trump-racist-president-hates-what-makes-america-great-column/1743525001/,"CLOSE

Why does Trump hate the things that make our country great? And how do the rest of us get beyond this hatred and ignorance?

It was amusing at the start of the great racist tweet controversy to hear the media asking, “Is President Donald Trump a racist?” We are well beyond such questions.

“I am the least racist person you have ever met,” he has said on numerous occasions. If you were living solo on a deserted island and he showed up, that might be true, but for everyone else, it’s just another one of his delusional claims. In fact, I have met the president myself, and he’s off by one word. He is not the least racist person I’ve ever met — he is the most.

Trump supporters reading this will probably get upset and melt like snowflakes.Yet since October 1973, when Richard Nixon’s Justice Department sued Trump and his father Fred for barring blacks from their apartment buildings, it has been known that the president is a racist — and a congenital one at that.

Trump racism goes back decades

The least racist person you have ever met? You don’t know the history of the Central Park Five (Trump called for the death penalty for the accused teens), or the history of blacks who worked at his casinos (fine paid for discrimination, and much more) in Atlantic City.

The least racist person you have ever met? “Laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control,” he said in a 1997 Playboy interview.

The least racist person you have ever met? Mexicans? “they’re rapists.” White supremacists waving swastikas in Charlottesville? “very fine people on both sides.” On and on and on.

Before we move on, here’s my favorite. Remember when Trump (you know, the least racist person you’ve ever met) said that Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS” and that many African nations were “s---hole countries?”

One country he has singled out is Nigeria; he said once Nigerians have seen the United States, they would never “go back to their huts.”

His base loves this stuff, but guess what? The joke’s on them. According to Trump’s own Census Bureau, Nigerian immigrants are far better educated than white Americans. For instance, 17% of Nigerians who are here have a master’s degree; just 8% of whites do. And 4% of Nigerians who are here have a Ph.D. Just 1% of whites do.

Holding these figures down are lesser educated white folks like Trump himself and his relatives. None of them have an advanced degree — though Tiffany Trump, a second-year law student at Georgetown, may be the first to earn one.

Racism from Andrew Johnson to FDR

Americans have survived racist presidents before. Woodrow Wilson, a southerner, opposed postwar Reconstruction because ""the dominance of an ignorant and inferior race was justly dreaded."" He opposed giving blacks the right to vote, claiming “it was a menace to society,” and as president he oversaw the re-segregation of the federal government. He lived in the White House a century ago.

Calvin Coolidge signed an immigration bill aimed at keeping out “the yellow peril” — i.e. Asians, along with Africans and Arabs. “America must be kept American,” he said in 1923.

Trump's tweets: Bullies told me to go back to my country. At first it silenced me, now it spurs me on.

And everyone knows that after Pearl Harbor was bombed, Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, leading to the forced relocation of 117,000 Japanese Americans from the West Coast to inland internment camps. FDR’s defenders pointed out that we had just been bombed by Japan and were at war.

But few know that in 1925, Roosevelt wrote that “Japanese immigrants are not capable of assimilation into the American population...Anyone who has traveled in the Far East knows that the mingling of Asiatic blood with European and American blood produces, in nine cases out of ten, the most unfortunate results.”

FDR led us through the Great Depression and World War II. He was one of our greatest presidents. Yet those words cannot be ignored.

Visions of racial superiority

There are other examples — Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was probably the worst of all — but you get the idea. American history is dotted with presidents who harbored visions of racial superiority.

But not in the modern era, at least not to the degree that we have seen with Trump. He went from bad to worse just the last few days with his attacks on ""The Squad"" -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar, D-,Minn., Ayanna Pressley D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., all young freshmen congresswomen of color. And then he doubled down Monday, saying they hate America?

Actually, Trump seems to hate America himself. After all, he has complained about several amendments to our Constitution. He has complained about our system of checks and balances, our judicial system, our free press, people who are different than him.

Why does he hate the things that make our country great? And how do the rest of us get beyond this hatred and ignorance?

Donald Trump is not our first racist president. Let us hope, however, that he will be our last.

For many Americans, traveling abroad is the best solution to escape the suffocating temperatures of July and August.

Relaxed work hours and schools on summer vacations also allow for more time to plan and embark on extended getaways.

But many popular tourist destinations, including countries that have traditionally had friendly relations with the U.S. and its citizens, might not be as safe as you assume.

On Thursday, a travel advisory was issued for people traveling to Peru, which is hosting the Pan American Games from July 26 to August 11, 2019, and Parapan American Games August 23 to September 1.

U.S. citizens are being warned to be aware major events are a prime opportunity for thieves and other criminal elements to prey upon unsuspecting tourists.

Cummings asks if DOJ guidelines kept Trump from being prosecuted,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jeremy Herb', 'Kara Scannell']",07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/19/politics/cummings-cohen-trump-payments/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The House Oversight Committee is asking federal prosecutors in New York whether the Justice Department's policy against indicting a sitting President played any role in the decision not to indict President Donald Trump for his role in directing Michael Cohen to arrange hush-money payments to women alleging affairs during the 2016 campaign.

House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, sent a letter to Deputy US Attorney Audrey Strauss Friday after the Southern District of New York revealed in a letter Thursday they had it had concluded its investigation into whether anyone else would be charged in the campaign finance scheme that Cohen pleaded guilty to last year, which was one part of Cohen's three-year prison sentence he's now serving.

Federal search warrants released Thursday detailed how Trump and his allies scrambled in the final weeks of the campaign to arrange hush-money payments. The documents are the first time that federal authorities have identified Trump by name and spelled out in his involvement in the hush-money scheme.

""If prosecutors identified evidence of criminal conduct by Donald Trump while serving as President -- and did not bring charges as they would have for any other individual -- this would be the second time the President has not been held accountable for his actions due to his position,"" Cummings wrote. ""The Office of the President should not be used as a shield for criminal conduct.""

An spokesman from the Southern District of New York declined to comment on the letter. Sources have previously told CNN that as a part of the Justice Department, its prosecutors follow department guidelines.

Treasury Department bureaucrats risk jumpstarting Islamic State resurgence,https://thehill.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/453525-treasury-department-bureaucrats-risk-jumpstarting-islamic-state,"It has now been 21 months since Kurdish forces, backed by U.S. Special Forces and U.S. air support, moved into Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State. Earlier this month, I spoke at a Rojava Centre for Strategic Studies conference in Amudeh, Syria, exploring the Islamic State’s enablers, after which I had the opportunity to visit Raqqa as the local administration’s guest.

To enter Raqqa is to be overwhelmed by destruction. Thousands of former residents remain in tents at a camp alongside the road outside Ayn Issa. Most would like to return to their homes just 45 minutes’ drive away, but Raqqa remains largely destroyed. Driving into town requires passing the shells of apartment buildings stretching miles. Local authorities have given a face lift to Naim Square, where the Islamic State executed prisoners and mounted their heads, and rebranded it Freedom Square. The buildings facing the square, however, remain bombed out.

There are signs of life in the center of town: wedding dresses, children’s toys, and sweets sold in shops surrounded by rubble. Children played soccer in a stadium once used as the Islamic State’s chief prison. Graffiti on the stadium wall cursed the Islamic State and expressed love for Taylor Swift Taylor Alison SwiftPoll: Michelle Obama most admired woman in the world Treasury Department bureaucrats risk jumpstarting Islamic State resurgence Warren signs Taylor Swift's Equality Act petition MORE. Unexploded ordnance slows recovery, as workers clear rubble by hand, and tempers are short. The biggest obstacle to Raqqa’s recovery, however, lies in Washington rather than Syria: The U.S. Treasury Department has been sitting on the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) waiver for the Syrian Democratic Council for four years.

Opposition groups in Syria can be an alphabet soup of acronyms but, in short, the Syrian Democratic Council is the umbrella organization for pro-American Syrian Kurdish militias like the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the all-female Women’s Protection Units (YPJ), and the Syrian Democratic Forces.

When I first visited northeastern Syria in January 2014, U.S. diplomats had refused to talk to the Syrian Kurdish opposition out of deference to Turkey. The United States reconsidered its position due to both Kurds’ effectiveness against the Islamic State and Turkey’s double-dealing on terrorism. The United States began talking to the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), the political wing of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in December 2015, and almost immediately, the SDC applied for a U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) waiver so that they could hire American companies to participate in reconstruction and so that they could spend their own money in the United States. The SDC does not ask for handouts: one of the biggest differences between my most recent trip and my first is that the oil derricks between Qamishli and the Tigris River are now operating but absent a waiver, the SDC cannot legally spend money in the United States or elsewhere.

It is unclear whether inertia or a misguided strategy motivates OFAC to sit for years on the pending SDC waiver: The group is pro-Western and cooperates closely with Washington. The Treasury Department previously granted the Syrian National Council, the political arm of the Free Syrian Army, a waiver even though extremists and terrorists have infiltrated the Free Syrian Army. In contrast, U.S. military members in Syria trust the SDF more than local partners in Iraq or Afghanistan; there has not been a single instance of SDF men or women turning on American mentors.

The Treasury Department’s inaction not only handicaps diplomacy but also undercuts U.S. strategy.

Isolating Syrian President Bashar al-Assad remains a core U.S. interest. The Kurds dislike Assad: He voided citizenship papers Kurds need for school and employment, and imprisoned Kurdish activists. However, given Turkey’s support for Islamist radicals and its anti-Kurdish ethnic cleaning in areas of Syria the Turkish army occupies, Syrian Kurds fear Turkey more. Simply put, Treasury’s failure is pushing pro-American Kurds back toward Assad.

Numerous diplomats castigate the Iraqi government for its failure to reconstruct Mosul after it was damaged first by Islamic State conquest and then its liberation. Diplomats fear frustration could fuel Islamic State resurgence. The same is now true with Raqqa, where frustration is palpable. The only difference is that if Raqqa erupts, the blame will not be on a foreign government, but on the glacial pace of the U.S. government’s own bureaucracy.

Report: EPA delays proposed fuel economy plan until September—or later,https://www.greencarreports.com,"['Eric C. Evarts', 'Eric C. Evarts - Contributor', 'Bengt Halvorson - Senior Editor']",,,,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1124123_report-epa-delays-proposed-fuel-economy-plan-until-september-or-later,"The EPA's plans to freeze fuel economy and emissions standards have been put on hold until at least Labor Day, sources familiar with the plans told Bloomberg earlier this week.

Last August, the EPA released its long-anticipated proposal to unwind the steadily rising fuel-economy standards put in place in 2012 under President Obama, in part to combat growing emissions of carbon dioxide, which contributes to climate change.

The plan proposes to freeze those fuel economy increases at 2020 levels through 2026, requiring cars and trucks to average about 37 mpg, rather than increase them to 47 mpg by 2025 as current law requires.

In days after Donald Trump was elected President, automaker lobbyists met with the President-elect to lobby for loosened standards, arguing they need a single national standard, not one that accommodates California-compliant states separately and different compliance rules between the EPA and NHTSA.

Under federal law, California has been allowed to set stricter emissions standards. Yet the standards have never been as unified before as they are under the current law.

This isn't the first time that the timeline has changed. Early this year, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler revealed in a Bloomberg interview that the agency expected to release the new rules by April. After receiving a lot of negative comments on the proposal, especially from some unexpected quarters, Wheeler announced in April that the proposal would be revised and targeted a new release for June. The revised proposal was expected to require small increases in fuel economy through 2025.

Now both automakers and the Governors of 23 states, including some red electoral bastions and several purple battlegrounds that President Trump relied on in his election, have released public letters opposing the freeze in standards. California, with 17 other states, has sued the EPA over the proposal's plan to rescind its EPA waiver, and to attack its future right to set its own standards.

If the standards are frozen, that lawsuit would likely move forward in court and lead to years of division in state standards and uncertainty for automakers. Since automakers are already developing cars for the 2023 model year and beyond, that uncertainty would certainly be costly,

With the President already starting to campaign for the 2020 election and parties on almost all sides opposed to the proposal, the summer delay could lead to an even longer delay."
"Controversial agency relocation slammed as attack on science by lawmakers, employees",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/agriculture-usda-blm-move-dc-climate-trump-protests-science-e8e534ec12fc/,"Employees and Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on the Trump administration’s plans to relocate hundreds of positions within two agencies outside of Washington, D.C. — a move some see as an effort to clamp down on science.

While the planned moves of both the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and parts of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) differ in their scope and rationale, resistance to both plans has shaped up similarly.

Critics are expressing concern over the motivations behind the efforts, which would lead to a mass-exodus of agency experts unwilling to relocate. This would spur a science brain drain in line with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on reports and research from within his own government.

“These decisions… are meant to displace seasoned scientists and regulators who have honorably served Republican and Democratic Administrations alike,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) in a statement to ThinkProgress responding to both the BLM and USDA relocation plans. Van Hollen sits on the Interior and Environment Appropriations subcommittee.

Responsible for administering public lands, BLM has become a battleground under the Trump administration as the White House has rolled back the boundaries of national monuments and advocated for fossil fuel drilling on U.S. acreage.

Now, the bureau is sparking controversy again. Administration officials confirmed this week that the overwhelming majority of BLM positions in D.C. are set for relocation. Around 84% of BLM staffers will be asked to relocate by the end of next year to areas outside of the nation’s capital, mostly to western states.

That announcement comes a month after Secretary Sonny Perdue mandated that over 500 USDA employees move en masse to Kansas City — located in both Missouri and Kansas — by Sept. 30, and gave them a deadline of July 15 to respond.

In the case of BLM, the Interior Department (DOI) plans to concentrate many of the positions in Grand Junction, Colorado, in addition to a range of western states stretching from Arizona to Alaska. Joe Balash, DOI assistant secretary for land and minerals, called the decision “demonstrably cost-effective” in a July 16 letter to Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), ranking member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and Environment.

The Trump administration argues that the move would both cut expenses and shift workers closer to the public lands they focus on, an argument supported by many Republicans including Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), who sits on the Natural Resources Committee.

But Democrats immediately raised objections. Udall said he had “serious reservations” about the move, as did his subcommittee counterpart in the House, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN). Democrats in both chambers of Congress indicated this week that they feel the plan is largely an effort to push out the D.C.-based senior staff who do not want to relocate.

Many of those employees are experts in their field, including scientists. “It’s a way for them to get rid of a lot of professional staff here in Washington,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) in a statement.

Many BLM employees are already located in other parts of the country and support for moving the bureau has been somewhat bipartisan over the years. But the latest push for relocation by the Trump administration coincides with a heated clash between USDA and its employees.

Given until this past Monday to make their decision, scores of USDA workers have opted out of moving. Of the employees with the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), more than half declined to relocate, according to Politico.

ERS workers in particular argued that the move would disrupt their work and efforts to publish important scientific reports. NIFA, meanwhile, is responsible for grant funding that touches climate, economic, and agricultural work that uses D.C. as a home base.

Many USDA employees have also argued that the move is politically motivated. ERS has recently released reports critical of Trump’s escalating trade war with China and its impact on farmers.

Experts also worry the move is a warning shot with implications for climate science. An investigation by Politico last month found that USDA has repeatedly sought to bury studies showing the danger of climate change. That report noted that some scientists see the ERS move as a foreshadowing of wider repercussions for research that doesn’t align with the administration’s broader “energy dominance” agenda.

USDA workers have fought through their union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), to dispute the move, but the department has rejected those efforts. Moreover, there is concern that other departments could face similar moves, like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, both of which are under DOI’s jurisdiction.

But Democrats asserted that they are looking into measures to combat the relocations, emphasizing that the move could be costly to taxpayers in addition to dramatically shifting the wealth of knowledge offered by current government staffers.

Lawmakers indicated they might seek to halt the relocation by blocking its funding in the upcoming appropriations bill that covers both the DOI and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A group of senators, including Van Hollen, have meanwhile introduced legislation to keep ERS and NIFA in the D.C. metro area, a move that was made before the BLM move was announced.

“This Administration is acting to undermine the subject-matter experts at many of our federal agencies,” said Van Hollen, who added that his office would “continue to use every tool available to push back against these actions.”

This article has been updated to note that only USDA would be impacted by the Senate legislation due to timing."

The Trump administration cannot point to another example of a treasury secretary intervening in a congressional request to release taxpayers returns, according to a Treasury Department letter released by a Democratic senator on Thursday.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has repeatedly blocked House lawmakers’ demands that the Internal Revenue Service turn over six years of President Trump’s personal and financial tax returns, a battle that is headed to federal court.

Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, received the Treasury memo after blocking the president’s nominees to the department because it was not answering his questions about the fight over the president’s tax returns.

[House Democrats sue Trump administration over president’s tax returns]

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) has demanded Trump’s returns under Section 6103(f) of the tax code, which states that the treasury secretary “shall furnish” tax returns requested by certain congressional bodies.

“We are not aware of whether a previous Treasury Secretary has directly responded to a section 6103(f) request before,” states the four-page memo, written by Justin W. Sok, senior adviser in the Treasury Department’s Office of Legislative Affairs.

But Treasury’s memo also argues that the administration is also unaware of any other requests for tax records that elicited strong objections from the chair of the Finance Committee, a position held by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa.), or “presented such serious constitutional questions” as the one by House Democrats.

The memo may give ammunition to Democrats who have contended that Mnuchin has gone to extraordinary lengths to shield Trump’s personal financial records.

It also says the Trump administration cannot cite a prior instance in which the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel weighed in on a congressional request for private tax returns, although in at least one instance the OLC has given advice on congressional access to tax returns related to a subcommittee request. OLC provided an opinion to Mnuchin that has formed the basis for his denial of the records.

In a statement, Wyden said the letter “confirms that the Treasury Department has diverged from standard procedures in this case,” arguing that it reveals the “unprecedented process” by which the requests for Trump’s returns have been denied. Wyden said he will now allow the president’s nominations to the department to proceed through the Senate.

House Democrats filed a lawsuit earlier in federal court seeking access to Trump’s tax returns, accusing the administration of an “extraordinary attack” on Congress in preventing the disclosure of his records.

Trump refused to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential campaign in a break with decades of precedent. He has told advisers that he is willing to take the fight to the Supreme Court. He has publicly argued that the tax returns were an issue in the 2016 election but that they should no longer be of concern because he won.

Democrats have cited both the law and an internal IRS memo that says Congress must be given the returns unless the president invokes executive privilege, which he has not.

But in its June memo, the Treasury Department argues that the Democrats’ request for Trump’s returns are unlike any other prior request.

“The vast majority of disclosures to congressional committees under section 6103(f) consist of statistical studies, compilations, and other data products . . . provided for statistical purposes,” the Treasury memo states. “The requests for this information do not identify specific taxpayers.”

Steve Rosenthal, a legal expert at the Tax Policy Center, said the memo “confirms there has been a special process for reviewing requests related to President Trump.”

However, even some critics of Mnuchin’s decision say it is understandable that he played a role. “The conclusion Secretary Mnuchin reached is wrong. But, that said, I don’t think there’s anything wrong about the treasury secretary playing a role in the decision,” said Daniel Hemel, a legal expert at the University of Chicago."
