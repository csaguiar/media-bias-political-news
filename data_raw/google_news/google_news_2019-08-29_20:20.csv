The Trump team is now lying about lying,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/29/politics/donald-trump-kayleigh-mcenany-stephanie-grisham/index.html,"(CNN) On Wednesday night, Trump reelection campaign press secretary Kayleigh McEnany did an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo . It was, uh, contentious. But one part of the back-and-forth between the two really -- and I mean really -- stood out. Here it is:

CUOMO: You don't think this President has lied to the American people?

MCENANY: Let me finish, Chris.

CUOMO: You--

MCENANY: No, I don't think the President has lied.

CUOMO: --have to answer that question, first.

MCENANY: I don't think the President has lied.

CUOMO: He has never lied to the American people?

MCENANY: No, I don't think the President has lied.

That exchange comes hard on the heels of a Washington Post interview with White House communications director Stephanie Grisham in which she said this of President Donald Trump's lies:

""I don't think they're lies. ... I think the President communicates in a way that some people, especially the media, aren't necessarily comfortable with. A lot of times they take him so literally. I know people will roll their eyes if I say he was just kidding or was speaking in hypotheticals, but sometimes he is. What I've learned about him is that he loves this country and he's not going to lie to this country.""

So. Here we are. Or, here we are again. After all, White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway made this same argument in the earliest days of Trump's presidency, when she told NBC's Chuck Todd this about the false claim that Trump's inauguration drew the largest crowd ever: ""You're saying it's a falsehood. And they're giving -- Sean Spicer, our press secretary -- gave alternative facts.""

Make no mistake about what is happening here. This is lying about lying. Plain and simple.

Let me prove that -- anecdotally and with bigger data.

First, an example from just the last few days. During a press conference at the G7 on Monday, Trump was asked about his previous claim that there were phone calls being exchanged by top-level US and Chinese aides over a possible end to the trade war. Here's how he responded:

""You've had many calls over the last 24 hours but certainly over the last 48 hours. We've had many calls, not just one. This isn't one. And these are high-level calls. They want to make a deal.""

""Though Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin insisted there had been 'communication,' aides privately conceded the phone calls Trump described didn't happen they way he said they did.

""Instead, two officials said Trump was eager to project optimism that might boost markets, and conflated comments from China's vice premier with direct communication from the Chinese.""

So, the Chinese vice premier said in a statement that he hoped they could find a way to have a ""calm"" negotiation, and Trump turned that into ""many ... high level calls."" So, that's a lie.

The simple fact is that Trump -- in his presidency and in his life before politics -- has never put any value in facts or truth. Trump is far more interested in creating the reality he prefers -- whether or not that comports with established facts. Let's remember that this is a man who impersonated a non-existent staffer in the Trump organization -- John Barron! -- to chat up gossip tabloids in New York City about his own love life.

That willingness to say whatever serves his interests at the moment trickles down. In his businesses. And in the White House. If the boss has no qualms about lying, then why would anyone underneath him worry about it?

In fact, Trump's behavior actually disincentivizes telling the truth. Because he lives in a fantasy world of his own creation, anyone unwilling to play along in that world is castigated, dismissed as insufficiently loyal to him and the broader administration. Lying to support Trump's lies, then, is a survival technique.

Which doesn't excuse it. There is NO way that McEnany, Grisham or Conway truly believe that Trump never lies. The evidence is simply overwhelming. But like Spicer and Sarah Sanders and so many other Trump surrogates that have come before them, they are choosing adherence to the President over adherence to the truth. Their unwillingness to acknowledge that Trump is a serial prevaricator -- or to, at a minimum, avoid strongly defending the idea that he never lies, ever, is complicity in those lies.

Trump's assault on truth -- and the very idea that capital ""F"" facts exist -- will linger in politics (and our culture) long after he and those who serve him are gone. And that is a very, very bad thing."

""Let's see what the end product is; that's what you have to judge it by,"" Trump said."
"DOJ watchdog says James Comey broke FBI policy by keeping, leaking Trump meeting memos",https://www.cnn.com,"['David Shortell', 'Katelyn Polantz', 'Jeremy Herb', 'Sara Murray']",08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/29/politics/james-comey-ig-report/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey violated agency policies when he retained and leaked a set of memos he took documenting meetings with President Donald Trump early in 2017, the Justice Department's inspector general said in a report released Thursday.

Comey set a ""dangerous example"" for FBI employees in an attempt to ""achieve a personally desired outcome,"" the report states.

However, the IG found ""no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.""

The inspector general's office referred the findings of its report to the Justice Department for potential prosecution earlier this summer. Prosecutors declined to bring a case, the report says.

CNN has previously reported that the Justice Department prosecutors didn't believe there was evidence to show Comey knew and intended to violate laws on dealing with classified information.

The seven memos, which offer up stark examples of Trump's early attempts to disrupt a federal probe into his inner circle, became a catalyst for the special counsel investigation when the contents of one first appeared in The New York Times. Comey testified in a 2017 Senate hearing that he had sent documents to a friend, Columbia University law school professor Daniel Richman, and directed him to share the substance with a reporter. Trump has blasted Comey as a ""leaker"" for Comey's actions.

""Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General's Report. He should be ashamed of himself!"" Trump tweeted Thursday.

In one of the most consequential memos -- the one which Comey asked Richman to detail to a reporter -- Comey described a one-on-one meeting he had with Trump in the Oval Office where the President suggested he scuttle the federal investigation into Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser.

""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go,"" Comey recalled Trump saying, according to a copy of the memo.

Comey on Thursday noted the report's concluding there was no classified information given to the media.

""I don't need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a 'sorry we lied about you' would be nice,"" he tweeted . ""And to all those who've spent two years talking about me 'going to jail' or being a 'liar and a leaker'—ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president.""

Keeping memos private

Part of Comey's breach of FBI protocol came in how he kept the memos private, among his personal property, the report says. Comey had kept four of the seven memos he wrote in a safe at his home, and had not told the FBI he kept them there after his firing. He eventually handed them over to the special counsel's investigation in June 2017.

""Department policy states that employees may not, without agency permission, remove records from the Department -- either during or after employment,"" the inspector general wrote. ""The FBI policies are no different.""

The inspector general said it interviewed 17 witnesses, including Comey and Richman, to produce its report.

Though the IG found that none of the classified information that Comey shared outside the FBI made it into the press, dulling some of the sharpest barbs from Trump, the report concludes with steep criticism for the former FBI chief.

""In a country built on the rule of law, it is of utmost importance that all FBI employees adhere to Department and FBI policies, particularly when confronted by what appear to be extraordinary circumstances or compelling personal convictions,"" the report states. ""Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a Special Counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure. What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.""

Flynn eventually pleaded guilty in late 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's ambassador -- one of the earliest sets of charges to stem from special counsel Robert Mueller's office.

Comey has said that Richman, a former prosecutor, had been providing him legal advice since he was fired.

This is not the first time the inspector general's office has criticized Comey. In a report released last summer, some of Comey's actions throughout the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server were called ""extraordinary and insubordinate.""

The inspector general made a subtle reference to that past report in the one released Thursday. ""We have previously faulted Comey for acting unilaterally and inconsistent with Department policy,"" the report says.

CNN reported last year that the inspector general's office had also questioned a number of close associates of Comey's from outside of the FBI that he had shared some of the memos with, in addition to Richman.

According to the report, Comey emailed four of the memos to his personal attorney Patrick Fitzgerald in the days following his firing.

In one of the memos, Comey had crudely redacted a paragraph that discussed foreign affairs with a marker and an index card, the report says. Comey told investigators that he redacted the parts of the memo because it was ""utterly unrelated to what I was seeking their advice and counsel about."" He said he did not consider the section he redacted to be classified.

Fitzgerald forwarded the email with the attached memos days later to David Kelley and Richman, who were both also serving then on Comey's legal team.

Separately, Comey had also messaged Richman a photo of the memo on the Oval Office meeting on his cell phone.

Copies of the memos that were produced to Congress last year contained classification markings showing that four had been designated ""secret"" or ""confidential."" The other three memos did not have markings indicating they contain classified information.

The FBI began the process of reviewing the classification of the memos on June 1, in the days after the existence of the memos first became public knowledge and following multiple congressional requests to the FBI for the memos.

Final classification of the documents was made by Bill Priestap, then the chief of the FBI's counterintelligence division, after a review by the division's law unit.

Priestap told the IG's office that the review process was ""done very carefully"" and under ""usual practice.""

The unit chief who presented recommendations for Priestap on June 6 told the IG's office that Priestap ""had a few questions"" but did not ""question the decisions"" about classification designations that she had recommended to him.

Comey disputed the ""secret"" classification of one of his memos, which detailed a conversation with then White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, the day after the FBI designated it as such.

An FBI agent had brought the memos, which had been recently classified, over to Comey's house so he could review them before his testimony, and Comey pointed out the ""secret"" designation to the agent, saying that it was incorrectly marked and should have been marked classified, the agent told IG investigators.

Comey later told IG investigators that he thought the classification designations seemed ""reasonable,"" though some appeared ""overly conservative.""

Comey told investigators from the inspector general's office that he did not remember discussing classification of the memos with anyone at the FBI and that it had never occurred to him to put them through a classification review to confirm his belief that they contained no classified information, according to the report.

The report shows how Comey shared the memos after he would write them with only a very small group of senior FBI officials. Typically, Comey would give the original copy of each memo that he wrote to his chief of staff, James Rybicki, who would keep them in locked drawer in his desk, Rybicki said.

In interviews, top officials at the FBI including deputy director Andrew McCabe and McCabe's special counsel, Lisa Page, described why Comey limited the memos to a ""very, very small group.""

Comey's ""objective in keeping the [number of] people exposed to [the memos] incredibly small was an effort to insulate the core team, who was doing the Russian investigation,...from knowing any of this, so that it didn't, ultimately, impact...their investigative steps...,"" Page told investigators.

Republican leaders on Capitol Hill were quick to seize on the report and tie its findings to the narrative that top law enforcement officials at the FBI and Justice Department had worked against Trump.

""Today's report is a disappointing reminder that the former FBI Director put partisanship and personal ambition over patriotism and his legal obligations to the American people,"" Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, said. ""His actions were disgraceful and part of a wider effort within the Obama Justice Department to undermine President Trump.""

Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham called it ""a stunning and unprecedented rebuke of a former Director of the FBI.""

The DOJ inspector general's office is also said to be nearing the release of another hotly anticipated report -- this one probing the origins of the Russia investigation and the FBI's use of covert surveillance methods.

CNN reported last month that federal investigators in Inspector General Michael Horowitz's office had conducted more than 100 interviews as part of the review. Its release is not expected until September at the earliest -- after the release of the Comey report.

Allies of the President, including Graham, have predicted that the FISA report would be ""ugly and damning."" Last week, Graham vowed to bring Horowitz before his committee to publicly testify on the investigation, which the President has nicknamed ""Spygate.""

MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell retracts story on Trump finances after Trump lawyers threaten to sue,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lawrence-odonnell-apology-retraction-msnbc-host-story-on-president-trump-finances-after-lawyers-threaten-to-sue/,"MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell on Wednesday retracted his story about supposed Russian ties to President Trump's finances and apologized for reporting it — just as Mr. Trump's lawyer demanded. O'Donnell said, however, he still doesn't know whether or not the story is true.

His public pull-back unfolded quickly in the opening minute of ""The Last Word,"" where 24 hours earlier the cable news host said a source had told him that Deutsche Bank documents showed that Russian oligarchs had co-signed a loan application for Mr. Trump.

O'Donnell reported the story, based on a single source he did not identify, even as he couched it with the qualifier ""if true"" and admitted it had not been verified by NBC News.

Mr. Trump's lawyer, Charles Harder, had written to NBC Wednesday afternoon, saying the story was false and defamatory and threatening legal action if it wasn't disowned. Harder said the story could have been disproven with an internet search.

O'Donnell quickly tweeted that he made an ""error in judgment"" reporting the story.

""We don't know whether the information is inaccurate,"" he said later on the air. ""But the fact is we do know it wasn't ready for broadcast and for that I apologize.""

He later apologized on air, saying the story ""wasn't ready for broadcast."" NBC News has not said whether or not O'Donnell faces disciplinary action.

In court Tuesday, Deutsche Bank had revealed that it possessed some of Mr. Trump's tax returns that had never been released to the public, leading to speculation about what information those documents contained.

When he initially reported on the supposed co-signing of the loans on Tuesday, O'Donnell said ""that would explain, it seems to me, every kind word that Donald Trump has ever said about Russia and Vladimir Putin, if true, and I stress the 'if true' part of this.""

The episode exhibited a stunning lack of rigor for a news organization. In a letter to Susan Weiner, NBC Universal's general counsel, and Daniel Kummer, the company's senior vice president for litigation, Harder called O'Donnell's statements ""false and defamatory, and extremely damaging.""

Harder said Mr. Trump was the only guarantor of the loans in question.

The erroneous reporting only helped provide ammunition for Mr. Trump's frequent attacks on the media. Early Thursday the president dubbed the host ""crazy Lawrence O'Donnell"" in a series of tweets, calling O'Donnell's reporting ""the most ridiculous claim of all.""

""Totally false, as is virtually everything else he, and much of the rest of the LameStream Media, has said about me for years. ALL APOLOGIZE!"" Mr. Trump added.

The president's two eldest sons also took to social media to lambast the TV host.

This was a reckless attempt to slander our family and smear a great company. Apologies are not enough when the true intent was solely to damage and cause harm. As a company, we will be taking legal action. This unethical behavior has to stop. @Lawrence @MSNBC https://t.co/i4X6CcdkCm — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) August 29, 2019

""This was a reckless attempt to slander our family and smear a great company. Apologies are not enough when the true intent was solely to damage and cause harm. As a company, we will be taking legal action. This unethical behavior has to stop,"" tweeted Mr. Trump's son Eric.

His brother, Donald Trump Jr., echoed his calls, saying O'Donnell had ""totally fabricated"" his reporting.

The episode is a blow to MSNBC, which has built powerful ratings with a prime-time lineup of liberal commentators Chris Hayes, Rachel Maddow and O'Donnell and is a comfortable home to Trump opponents. Many nights, it is the second most-watched cable network, behind only Fox News Channel, whose lineup of conservative hosts appeals to the president's supporters.

But it also shows the inherent tension in the business model of building programming on news networks that are not necessarily run by journalists.

O'Donnell has been hosting ""The Last Word"" since 2010 and has been an MSNBC analyst since 1996. The Harvard College graduate was an aide to the late New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and an executive producer on the NBC entertainment series ""The West Wing."""
Trump’s Unprecedented Fight to Withhold Information,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Kerry W. Kircher', 'Former House General Counsel']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/house-needs-its-subpoena-power-against-trump/596857/,"Under these circumstances, the House has to keep fighting, including by suing civilly to enforce its committees’ subpoenas. During the period that I served in the Office of General Counsel, only two House-subpoena cases ended up in court: Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers (during George W. Bush’s presidency) and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder (during Barack Obama’s presidency). I worked on both. These cases provide some guidance on how the current suits will likely unfold, at least at the lower-court level.

In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi was speaker, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to testify about, and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten to produce records relating to, the White House’s firing of an unusual number of U.S. attorneys. The Bush White House directed Miers not to appear and Bolten not to provide records, claiming that senior White House aides were absolutely immune from congressional subpoenas (the same claim the Trump White House now makes with respect to McGahn). Ultimately, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued to compel compliance.

U.S. District Judge John Bates, a Bush appointee, ruled in 2008 in the Miers case that senior White House aides are not immune from congressional subpoenas, that Miers had to appear before the committee but could raise privilege objections in response to specific questions, and that Bolten had to either produce the documents subpoenaed or provide to the committee a log of the documents as to which he claimed privilege. Bates also indicated that if further disputes ensued regarding specific privilege objections, he would help resolve them. Miers and Bolten appealed. But shortly thereafter, President Obama was sworn in, and the parties settled: The Judiciary Committee took Miers’s testimony and Bolten produced some, although not all, of the subpoenaed documents.

Kia Rahnama: What Congress can do when Trump appointees defy it

In 2011, when John Boehner was speaker, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform subpoenaed Attorney General Eric Holder for documents that concerned “Fast and Furious,” an undercover Justice Department law-enforcement operation that went awry and resulted in the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. After months of back-and-forth and the production of a small number of documents to the committee, Holder claimed that the remaining documents were protected by a common-law privilege little understood outside legal circles, known as the deliberative-process privilege. As before, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued, this time to compel compliance with certain specific aspects of its document subpoena.

In 2013, U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson, an Obama appointee, ruled that the House had standing to sue. On the merits, however, the case dragged on for several more years—because of the volume of documents at issue, because Jackson allowed the Justice Department to assert new privileges as the case proceeded, and because she concluded that the deliberative-process privilege had some constitutional roots. Ultimately, the committee obtained many, although not all, of the documents it had sought."
"James Mattis says he had ""no choice"" but to leave Trump administration",https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-mattis-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-leave-trump-administration/,"Former Defense Secretary James Mattis said he had ""no choice"" but to leave his job leading the nation's military following President Trump's controversial comments about some the United States' oldest and closest allies.

""I had no choice but to leave,"" Mattis told The Atlantic in a wide-ranging interview. ""I want people to understand why I couldn't stay. I've been informed by four decades of experience, and I just couldn't connect the dots anymore.""

He went on, ""Let me put it this way. I've written an entire book built on the principles of respecting your troops, respecting each other, respecting your allies. Isn't it pretty obvious how I would feel about something like that?""

Mattis quit as defense secretary after Mr. Trump ignored his advice and ordered U.S. troops out of Syria. In his resignation letter, Mattis referred to his strongly held ""views on treating allies with respect,"" an apparent reference to Mr. Trump's complaints about the value of bedrock alliances like NATO.

""One core belief that I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,"" Mattis wrote. He also warned against closeness with countries such as Russia and China.

""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues,"" he added.

Angered by the blunt letter, the president moved to push Mattis out earlier than he had planned to leave.

Mattis, however, kept to his military-bred stoicism, refraining from launching an all-out attack on Mr. Trump in one of his first interviews since leaving the Pentagon.

""You don't endanger the country by attacking the elected commander in chief. I may not like a commander in chief one fricking bit, but our system puts the commander in chief there, and to further weaken him when we're up against real threats — I mean, we could be at war on the Korean Peninsula, every time they start launching something,"" Mattis said.

North Korea remains a concern for the former military chief. Mattis found the president's nonchalant approach to dictator Kim Jong Un and Mr. Trump's persistent downplaying of North Korea's nuclear capabilities particularly troubling.

""Any Marine general or any other senior servant of the people of the United States would find that, to use a mild euphemism, counterproductive and beneath the dignity of the presidency,"" Mattis said.

But Mattis contends that the current political environment is not because of Mr. Trump alone. Instead, he blames outside forces that elected him to office.

""We've got to address the things that put him there in the first place,"" Mattis said."
Ukraine's New Parliament Approves Top Cabinet Officials,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-08-29/ukraines-new-parliament-approves-top-cabinet-officials,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speaks to newly elected Ukrainian parliament deputies during parliament session in Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, Aug. 29, 2019.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's president on Thursday urged lawmakers to help liberalize the economy and pursue integration into Europe as the newly-elected parliament swiftly approved his appointees for top government jobs.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comedian elected president in April, told parliament that the public expects lawmakers to help return Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and settle the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.

Facing a hostile parliament after his landslide victory, Zelenskiy called a snap parliamentary election in July that gave his Servant of the People party the parliament majority. The party takes its name from the popular television sitcom in which Zelenskiy played a high school teacher propelled into the presidency.

Like Zelenskiy, a newcomer in politics, none of the Servant of the People lawmakers have previous experience in parliament. Many Ukrainians, who have grown tired of the old elites they see as corrupt and inefficient, see it as an advantage.

The Verkhovna Rada on Thursday quickly named Oleksiy Honcharuk, 35, as the nation's new prime minister. In his speech in parliament, Honcharuk pledged to focus on encouraging economic growth, raising living standards and combating corruption.

""No one will be allowed to steal in the new government,"" he said.

Some observers saw Honcharuk as a creature of oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi, who owns the television station that aired the sitcom that made Zelenskiy a star. Honcharuk has been reportedly close to Andriy Bohdan, Zelenskiy's chief of staff, who had close ties with the oligarch.

""Honcharuk is a technical figure, who will convey the interests of the group of people linked to Kolomoyskyi and Bohdan,"" said Volodymyr Sidenko, an analyst with the Razumkov Center, an independent Kiev-based think tank. ""These people will now play a key role in distributing financial flows.""

Sidenko noted that Honcharuk will face a tough task of introducing unpopular measures that Ukraine's Western investors expect the government to take to shore up the economy.

""The new prime minister will have to do dirty and unpopular work, reducing state subsidies and social assistance as required by the International Monetary Fund and other Western lenders,"" Sidenko said.

The lawmakers also quickly approved other Zelenskiy's appointees for top jobs.

Ivan Bakanov, who directed Zelenskiy's campaign, was named the chief of Ukraine's Security Service, the SBU.

Dmytro Razumkov, who served as Zelenskiy's campaign adviser and later became the leader of his party, was elected parliamentary speaker.

The Rada also approved the new foreign minister, Vadim Pristaiko, who previously served as Ukraine's ambassador to Canada and later its envoy to NATO.

Speaking to lawmakers, Pristaiko pledged to push for settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where fighting between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have killed more than 13,000 people since 2014.

""We need peace and stability,"" he said.

Andriy Zahorodniuk, who was named defense minister, pledged to streamline the military and free it of graft.

""Everyone knows that they steal in the army,"" he said. ""People have grown tired of those problems.""

Two of the members of former President Petro Poroshenko's Cabinet kep their jobs — Interior Minister Arsen Avakov and Finance Minister Oksana Markarova.

Markarova is a technocrat, while Avakov helped Zelenskiy win by speaking out about Poroshenko's alleged attempts to buy voters' support before the election.

Volodymyr Fesenko of the Penta Center think tank said Zelenskiy wants the new Cabinet to speed up liberal economic reforms, but is aware of the challenges.

""President Zelenskiy wants the new parliament and the new Cabinet to serve as instruments to achieve quick reforms,"" Fesenko said. ""The new Cabinet will inevitably face a dilemma of how to conduct swift reforms without a further plunge in the already low living standards that could provoke a social explosion."""
US still to grant any Huawei trade licences,https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49495887,"Image copyright Getty Images

US officials have not granted any licences to trade with blacklisted Chinese firm Huawei, despite receiving more than 130 requests, Reuters says.

The US restricted companies from selling to the electronics giant in May, citing national security concerns, which have been dismissed by Huawei.

President Donald Trump said last month that some exemptions would be allowed.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

One industry source suggested to the BBC that a lack of clear guidelines from the Trump administration is to blame for the current standstill.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US is locked in a trade tariff battle with China

William Reinsch, a former US commerce department official, claims that officials are ""afraid"" to make a decision.

""Nobody in the executive branch knows what Trump wants and they're all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,"" he told Reuters.

A spokesman for the commerce department insisted that requests concerning Huawei were ""ongoing"".

The US recently added a further 45 businesses associated with Huawei to an export blacklist.

It is the latest in a string of mixed signals from the president, who said this week that crucial trade talks with China would resume ""very shortly"".

His surprise announcement came after the the US revealed that it would be adding trade tariffs to $550bn (£449bn) worth of Chinese imports.

Huawei is the world's second-largest smartphone marker behind Samsung Electronics, but it has so far failed to make a dent in the US, where it currently holds less than a 1% market share.

The company has laid off more than 600 of its US staff since it was blacklisted by the US.

The US Department of Justice has claimed that its close ties with the Chinese government open it up to the the risk of its equipment being used to spy on other countries.

Huawei's future in the UK is also up for debate, with an announcement revealing whether it should be excluded from the rollout of 5G mobile networks by the end of the year.

Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan told the BBC that she hoped the government ""could do something by the autumn""."
What Jeffrey Goldberg gets wrong about Jim Mattis,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/what-jeffrey-goldberg-gets-wrong-about-james-mattis,"The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg has published a thoughtful profile on former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. But lamenting Mattis' refusal to directly criticize President Trump, Goldberg misses the key point: America won't rise or fall on the partisan rancor of the moment, or on Trump's unpredictability, but rather on the endurance of its best values.

Goldberg fails to recognize that Mattis must put America's long-term interests first. Mattis' condemnation of Trump's leadership would only stoke the partisan fires. It would win no moral battles. Such battles can only be won when those fires are denied fuel.

Goldberg loses this point in the smoke of his disgust for Trump.

And it's odd that he does, because Goldberg doesn't get complete silence from Mattis on Trump's leadership. Asking the retired four-star Marine about Trump's May 29 tweet thanking Kim Jong Un for insulting Joe Biden, Goldberg gets Mattis' clear response: ""Any Marine general or any other senior servant of the people of the United States would find that, to use a mild euphemism, counterproductive and beneath the dignity of the presidency.""

Mattis is right, of course, and his words carry a deeper condemnation of the president than at first apparent. But that's not enough for Goldberg. Apparently, he wants a rant. ""While discipline is an admirable quality,"" Goldberg says, ""in my conversations with Mattis I found it exasperating, because I believe that the American people should hear his answer to this question: Is Donald Trump fit for command? He should answer the question well before November 3, 2020. Mattis is in an unparalleled position to provide a definitive answer.""

No, Mattis should not join the partisan battle over Trump's leadership. He is right to preserve the honor and apolitical credibility of the civilian-controlled military. Mattis knows that these institutions cannot sustain simply on formality and expectation; they require action and example.

The roots of this understanding are found in something Goldberg and Mattis discuss: the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. There, the Roman emperor observed, ""thou mayest observe that the life of a citizen is happy, who continues a course of action which is advantageous to his fellow-citizens, and is content with whatever the state may assign to him.""

Mattis rightly believes that his choice to preserve the honor of the military and of putting the nation before all else is advantageous to his fellow citizens. And as he was content to serve before, so too is he now content to endure criticism for his silence.

Goldberg misses this, asking, ""Don’t you have a duty to warn the country if it is endangered by its leader?""

Mattis deflected. He knows the nation's institutions guard against the imperfections of its leader. And again, he knows that his warning, if offered, would only enrage one side and excite the other. It would achieve no American victory.

As Marcus Aurelius references Plato, ""For thus it is, men of Athens, in truth: wherever a man has placed himself thinking it the best place for him, or has been placed by a commander, there in my opinion he ought to stay and to abide the hazard, taking nothing into the reckoning, either death or anything else, before the baseness of deserting his post.""

For Mattis, it's ultimately — and rightly — about duty."
Huawei ban: More than 130 US companies blocked from selling to Chinese tech giant,https://www.independent.co.uk,['Anthony Cuthbertson'],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/huawei-ban-us-china-trade-war-trump-phone-latest-a9082166.html,"The US government has not granted any companies licenses to sell goods to Huawei, amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China.

More than 130 applications have been made to the US Commerce Department, Reuters reported.

The revelations come despite President Donald Trump claiming that some companies would be allowed to sell to the Chinese tech giant after it was added to the Entity List.

The standstill coincides with mixed messages from Trump in the US-China trade war, which have dimmed hopes for prompt decisions on license applications to sell to Huawei, the world's top producer of telecoms equipment.

That has raised the possibility of billions of dollars of lost sales for chipmakers, software companies and others in Huawei's US supply chain.

""Nobody in the executive branch knows what (Trump) wants and they're all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,"" said William Reinsch, a former Commerce department official.

Last week, Trump vowed to raise tariffs on $550 billion in Chinese imports, hours after China imposed new levies on $75 billion in US goods. Then he softened his tone towards China at the G7 leaders' meeting over the weekend, saying he thought the world's two largest economies would reach a deal to end the tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hammered growth.

The current number of license applications, not previously reported, far exceeds the 50 or so that US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross disclosed receiving in July.

A spokesman for the Commerce Department said: ""The interagency process, weighing license requests concerning Huawei and its non-US affiliates, is currently ongoing.""

Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has called for the United States to remove the company from the so-called entity list and put an end to what it called ""unjust treatment.""

Huawei, the world's second largest smartphone maker, was placed on the list because of US national security concerns in May, when trade talks with China broke down. Sales of US goods are mostly banned to companies on the list, unless suppliers obtain special licenses, which must overcome tough scrutiny.

The United States says the company can spy on customers and has sought to convince allies to exclude it from 5G networks. Huawei denies the allegations.

Seeking to lure China back to the negotiating table in late June, Trump promised President Xi Jinping that US companies would be allowed to make some sales to Huawei, a gesture welcomed by US chipmakers and software companies. Huawei spent $11 billion on US components from US firms such as Intel Corp, Qualcomm and Micron Technology last year.

Government officials urged US companies to apply for licenses following Trump's pledge of relief, saying exports to Huawei of non-sensitive items that are readily replaced by foreign competitors would be permitted. Ross and Trump in July promised timely responses.

One of the sources noted that the review process was not delayed, pointing to the complexities of interagency consultation.

But the only relief seen by Huawei thus far was the extension in August of the temporary general license, which gives US companies a small exception to repair and maintain Huawei's existing handsets and networks.

China expert Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute said a breakthrough in US-China trade talks could spur license approvals for Huawei as soon as next month.

The two trade teams are due to meet in September in Washington, but no specific dates have been disclosed.

According to three Commerce department officials, many of the licenses requests have been reviewed by other agencies such as the Departments of State and Defense.

However, no standards have yet been set and no responses have been issued as officials await a green light from Ross and the White House, according to three people familiar with the process.

The United States has a case pending against Huawei over allegations Huawei violated US sanctions on Iran.

Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou has been detained in Vancouver since December on US bank fraud charges for misleading banks about the company's Iran business. Trump has at times asserted that Huawei and Meng could be included in a grand US-China trade deal.

In response to the trade ban, Huawei has developed its own mobile operating system that it claims is 60 per cent faster than the Android OS that Huawei phones currently use.

"Gen. Mattis shoots, quite effectively, across Trump’s bow",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/gen-mattis-shoots-quite-effectively-across-trumps-bow,"A few key sentences from a Wall Street Journal piece by Gen. Jim Mattis, the former secretary of defense, serve as a not-so-veiled, but oh-so-important, warning to and about President Trump.

If Trump won’t listen, the rest of us should both listen and act responsibly to find a reasonable alternative to reelecting this president.

Mattis’ essay, an adapted excerpt from a forthcoming book, makes an impassioned case against unilateralism of the sort Trump practices.

“Nations with allies thrive, and those without them wither,” Mattis writes. “Alone, America cannot protect our people and our economy. At this time, we can see storm clouds gathering. … A leader must display strategic acumen that incorporates respect for those nations that have stood with us when trouble loomed. Returning to a strategic stance that includes the interests of as many nations as we can make common cause with, we can better deal with this imperfect world we occupy together. Absent this, we will occupy an increasingly lonely position, one that puts us at increasing risk.”

Contrast that with the abominable isolation of Trump at last weekend’s G-7 summit, where he unpopularly and wrongly carried water for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, ignored other leaders’ pleas to back off his trade war with China, defended North Korea’s recent missile tests, and in general acted like the caricature of the “Ugly American” brought to quite unwelcome life.

Likewise, Mattis offered concerns about our civic culture: “Currently our own commons seems to be breaking apart. What concerns me most as a military man is not our external adversaries; it is our internal divisiveness. We are dividing into hostile tribes cheering against each other, fueled by emotion and a mutual disdain that jeopardizes our future, instead of rediscovering our common ground and finding solutions. ... We all know that we’re better than our current politics. Tribalism must not be allowed to destroy our [American constitutional] experiment.”

Obviously, Trump feeds this harmful tribalism, not by mistake but with relish.

What is most disturbing, though, is that Mattis is writing books and columns rather than still serving at the Pentagon. His essay included one brief nod as to why that happened.

“When my concrete solutions and strategic advice, especially keeping faith with our allies, no longer resonated, it was time to resign,” Mattis wrote.

This is a delicate way of putting it. The reality is that Mattis resigned because Trump announced, with virtually no consultation, that he would snatch defeat away from one of the most impressive victories in the history of the United States military by withdrawing the small but lethal contingent of American troops from Syria, just as the Islamic State was being wiped out.

Trump subsequently reconsidered after Mattis already had resigned, but Trump’s on-again/off-again commitment to the effort has left our Kurdish allies in the lurch.

While Trump likes to claim he eradicated ISIS, the truth is that ISIS is now reconstituting because Trump took the boot off the throat. Meanwhile, as the Kurds are overwhelmed with a crisis of 60,000 enraged jihadis/ISIS supporters (wives and children and other relatives of the fighters) penned up in porous “camps” in eastern Syria, the biggest victors in the rest of that country are the brutal dictator Bashar Assad and his backer, Putin.

Jim Mattis was one of the most effective generals and defense secretaries in U.S. history. For him to be writing instead of leading is a sign of an inept, unstable presidency.

Marines, Mattis wrote, “expect you to have done your homework, to have mastered your profession. Amateur performance is anathema.” Diplomatically and militarily, unfortunately, our current administration is dangerously amateurish."
"Facing farmer anger, Trump scrambles Cabinet to brainstorm on biofuel policy: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/facing-farmer-anger-trump-scrambles-cabinet-to-brainstorm-on-biofuel-policy-sources-idUSKCN1VC1RN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.

Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry. However, his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting on for re-election in 2020.

Trump met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They presented options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

One proposal that was discussed and was advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was rescinding seven or eight of the 31 waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals, but Trump was yet to make a final decision.

The sticking point is a technical proposal to redistribute projected volumes that could be exempted in the future through the annual biofuel mandate from 2020 onwards. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.

David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels.

“As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers won’t be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story,” Fialkov said.

The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible; and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The final one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump’s EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and billionaire Carl Icahn.

U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to a slump in crop prices and exports shrinking following Trump’s trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about the refinery waivers.

‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.

Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.

On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in the fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed.

“Enough is enough,” Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. “We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions.”

Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.

On Thursday, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.

Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market."
Nigeria has backed down and lowered visa fees for Americans after a US visa hike,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/africa/1698117/nigeria-reduces-visa-fee-for-americans-in-response-to-trump/,"It’s taken just a day for the Nigerian government to respond to the Trump administration’s latest visa clampdown measure on Nigerians.

It has reduced visa fees for Americans traveling to Nigeria from $180 to $150 in response to the US embassy’s introduction of a “reciprocity fee” for Nigerians. The US embassy claims the new reciprocity fee, ranging from $80 to $303 and only to be paid for approved visas, has been introduced to “eliminate that cost difference” between visa application fees for both countries.

The move was in line with a Trump executive order in 2017 for the US secretary of State to, among other things, adjust fee schedules “to match the treatment of United States nationals” by other countries. The US embassy claimed it has been in talks with Nigerian authorities for 18 months to align visa fees.

For its part, Nigeria’s government says the decision to lower visa fees for American applicants was taken months ago but was not implemented given the transition in government. (Nigeria’s president Buhari only inaugurated a new cabinet last week after winning reelection for a second term in February).

It’s unclear if the new visa fee reduction for American applicants to Nigeria will also see the US Embassy revise its reciprocity fee structure for Nigerians.

Some international business people and tourists from countries including the United States have long complained about the high expense of Nigerian visas and the difficulty of obtaining them. The Buhari government has targeted improving this with programs including visa-on-arrival for business people and potential investors. Yet, Nigerians also face challenges with the US visa application process, which is renown for its intensive paperwork (even for short stay visas) and involves daunting consular interview sessions that often end in vague reasons for application rejections.

The quick reaction from Nigerian authorities is a change of tack from earlier measures by the Trump administration to clamp on Nigerian visa applications. In May, the US suspended a visa waiver program for Nigerian applicants and has reportedly considered issuing visas for shorter validity periods in response to the high rates of Nigerian nationals overstaying visas.

The Federal Reserve’s Job Isn’t to Help Trump — or to Hurt Him,https://www.barrons.com,['Randall W. Forsyth'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/donald-trump-federal-reserve-trade-war-51566950641,"Text size

The policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to promote maximum employment and stable prices. That is what Congress has mandated, period.

This bears repeating, because the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York thinks it’s actually the job of the central bank to oppose Executive Branch policies with which it takes issue.

In a Bloomberg opinion piece, Bill Dudley argues the Fed should not “enable” the policies of President Donald Trump, which will he says will produce an “economic disaster.”

Leave aside the arguments over policy for a moment. Consider instead the Constitutional question of an unelected agency of government officials working to thwart the policies of elected officials.

Like him or not, Trump was duly chosen by Electoral College as the 45th President of the United States. As such, he is empowered to carry out the functions and duties as the head of the Executive Branch, as articulated by the U.S. Constitution, subject to the checks and balances provided by the Legislative and Judicial branches.

The Fed, meanwhile, is run by unelected officials, some of whom are nominated by the executive and confirmed by the legislative branch. Others are selected solely by private citizens answerable to no one else.

The Fed is a creation of Congress, which can change its structure, aims, or operating procedures. And similar to Supreme Court justices, members of the Fed’s Board of Governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Fed governors serve 14-year terms, while the chair has a four-year term (coincident with his or her term as governor.) The 12 Fed district bank presidents are chosen by the banks’ own board of directors, with no legislative oversight.

Monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, comprising the seven Fed governors, with the Fed Board Chair also chairing the FOMC, plus five of the 12 Fed district chairs. The Fed presidents rotate every year, except for the New York Fed president, which is a permanent member, in recognition of New York’s status as the nation’s—and arguably the world’s—financial capital. The New York Fed president also is the FOMC vice chair, further cementing the post as first among equals.

Leave aside the anachronistic structure of the Fed, cobbled together over a century ago. Defenders say it is designed to provide independence for the central bank. Critics argue it makes it unaccountable, resulting in campaigns to “audit the Fed” and its decision making, which the central bank has adamantly opposed.

That’s not to say the Fed has avoided being drawn into the political realm, sometimes legitimately, more often not.

During World War II, the entire aim of the U.S. government was to support the war effort. That included the Fed, by facilitating the financing of the wartime deficit by pegging bond yields. By the early 1950s, that mandate to cap interest rates caused inflation. That led to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which freed the central bank to raise rates as needed to control inflation.

The need to raise interest rates produced other conflicts between the Fed and other branches of government, most notably during the 1960s, when spending on the Vietnam War and the Great Society stirred inflation. President Lyndon B. Johnson literally manhandled then-Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin for hiking rates then.

Richard Nixon, who blamed his loss in 1960 in part on a sluggish economy resulting from tight Fed policy, installed the malleable Arthur Burns as his Fed Chairman after his 1968 presidential victory. Burns dutifully pursued stimulative policies to help ensure Nixon’s reelection, which provided the inflationary tinder for the explosion in oil prices, and the subsequent steep recession of 1973-74.

In more recent years, Alan Greenspan famously made certain to get along with both Republican and Democratic administrations (although George H.W. Bush blamed him for his reelection loss in 1992.) His successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, fared less well: The former didn’t get a third term under Barack Obama, while the latter wasn’t reappointed to a second term.

Jerome Powell got the nod from Trump, who nonetheless has stepped up his criticism of the central bank to unprecedented levels. Trump blasted the Fed for raising rates last year and its reluctance to lower them this year. While the central bank trimmed its federal funds target range one-quarter percentage point, the president has called for a cut of a full percentage point. That’s despite the Fed having achieved its aforementioned policy mandates, with unemployment at 3.7%, a half-century low, and inflation running a few tenths shy of its 2% target.

Fears of recession mainly stem from a global slowdown in manufacturing, which arguably stems mainly from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. In his speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy confab last week, Powell acknowledged the impact of trade. “While monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,” he said. But, he added, “we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” opening the way for another rate cut in September.

Dudley, by contrast, suggests the Fed opt not to do that. “Officials could state explicitly that the central bank won’t bail out an administration that keeps making bad choices on trade policy, making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions,” he wrote.

Even more radically, Dudley contends that Trump’s attacks on the Fed puts the presidential election within the central bank’s purview.

“After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,” he writes. “If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”

This is shocking, coming from a person who used to be one of the top three monetary-policy officials in the U.S. Dudley, moreover, came to the New York Fed from Goldman Sachs, where he was their chief Fed watcher, so he was no neophyte when it comes to the intersection of policy and markets. That also made him just one of the many former Goldman types to ascent to high government posts, such as Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary during the financial crisis.

An independent central bank means one able to meet its clearly defined policy goals—not to pursue its own agenda to thwart policies of other branches of government.

That would be tantamount to a coup d’etat.

Donald Trump Jr. Campaigns for Dr. Greg Murphy,https://www.witn.com,[],,,,https://www.witn.com/content/news/Donald-Trump-Jr-Campaigns-for-Dr-Greg-Murphy-558631081.html,"Donald Trump Jr. was in New Bern Monday night to campaign for 3rd District Congressional candidate Republican Dr. Greg Murphy.

Trump Jr. said, ""We win this seat, we use it, we keep going forward and win North Carolina in 2020, we're gonna win the presidency.""

Trump Jr. was sounding confident as he spoke to the crowd of supporters gathered at the private campaign event for Murphy.

Murphy says, ""It's great to have the executive branch supporting those of us who are going to be in the legislative branch.""

The campaign stop is one of two Trump Jr. and conservative commentator Kimberly Guilfoyle made in North Carolina Wednesday, both for congressional candidates. The first stop was in Charlotte.

Guilfoyle says, ""We want to make sure that we have winners that are going to support the president and stand shoulder to shoulder with the president.""

The visit to eastern Carolina comes less than two weeks before election day for the 3rd Congressional District seat.

Voters are choosing between Murphy, Democrat Allen Thomas and two third party candidates, to replace the late Congressman, Republican Walter Jones.

Murphy says, ""You know, It's a low turnout, that's what a special election is, but I think folks have really responded to our message.""

Trump Jr. is urging voters to head to the polls and get their friends to do the same, as early voting continues for another week. He says, ""Make sure you turn up. When you do, we win and winning is so much better than losing, right?""

Those who aren't registered to vote in this special election can still do so if you vote early. You will have to bring an ID and a bill with your name and address on in to register. Early voting will continue until September 6th when polls close at 7:00 p.m.

Election day is September 10th.

U.S. weekly jobless claims increase slightly,https://kfgo.com,['Midwest Communications Inc.'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://kfgo.com/news/articles/2019/aug/29/us-weekly-jobless-claims-increase-slightly/932105/,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits rose moderately, pointing to sustained labor market strength despite slowing economic growth.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 215,000 for the week ended Aug. 24, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.

Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations. The Labor Department said only claims for the Virgin Islands were estimated last week.

The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 500 to 214,500 last week.

Layoffs have remained low despite a protracted trade war between the United States and China, which is crimping economic growth by undercutting business investment and manufacturing.

But the pace of job growth has been slowing since 2018. The government estimated last week that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade.

According to economists at JPMorgan, this meant that job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. The government will publish the revised payrolls data next February.

Still, the pace of employment gains remains well above the roughly 100,000 jobs needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Sustained labor market strength is supporting the economy through strong consumer spending.

For now, that is helping to calm concerns of a recession, which were fanned by a sell-off on Wall Street and an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 22,000 to 1.70 million for the week ended Aug. 17. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dipped 250 to 1.70 million.

The continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which August's unemployment rate will be calculated. The four-week average of continuing claims was little changed between the July and August survey periods, suggesting the jobless rate could hold steady at 3.7%.

David Koch’s spirit is alive and well in the White House cabinet,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1694132/david-kochs-spirit-lives-on-in-the-white-house-cabinet/,"David Koch was no friend of US president Donald Trump. The businessman and conservative icon, who died today at age 79, made little secret of his dislike of the president or his policies—his tariffs, the travel ban, and almost everything else about him.

So they surrounded him with their allies instead.

The sons of Koch Industries founder Fred Koch, David Koch and his brother Charles were born into extraordinary wealth. For decades, they used their billions to wield political influence, supporting a sprawling network of conservative nonprofits closely aligned with their mission—right-wing libertarianism. The crux of this, as Charles Koch once put it, was a desire for “economic freedom”—with as little power in the hands of centralized government as possible. In short, he wrote, “big governments are inherently inefficient and harmful.”

The brothers favor minimal government “intrusions,” encompassing conservative economic policies such as minimal taxation and free trade, as well as more liberal, anti-interventionist social policies. Many of their main areas of concern have closely aligned with Koch Industries’ business interests, ushering in candidates who deny climate change, were likely to promote fossil fuel use, and support environmental deregulation.

They did this through organizations like Americans for Prosperity, which supported the establishment of the Tea Party movement, while concealing the identities of other, more media-shy, conservative donors.

When it came to Trump, who rose to political power on the heels of the Tea Party movement, their enthusiasm was much more muted. But while they may not like Trump’s style, and have publicly refused to donate directly to Trump’s campaign, the brothers’ influence is apparent in the president’s choice of advisors, including official counselor Kellyanne Conway. The president’s cabinet remains a who’s-who of Koch affiliates. Their nearly $900 million budget for the 2016 election seems to have had the desired effect.

Koch may be dead, but many of his preferred political figures—and, by extension, his preferred policies—continue to thrive in the highest positions of power. Here’s how.

Vice President Mike Pence

During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-trusted Trump advisor and the high-powered arch-conservative Steve Bannon expressed concerns that a potential Pence president would be “a president that the Kochs would own.” This pretty much sums up the long-held loyal relationship between Pence and the Kochs, which dates back to his time as an Indiana congressman in the early 2000s. Though a channel for the their influence in the White House, Pence differs from David Koch in his anti-choice evangelical position.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry

The Koch brothers are above all petrochemical magnates, so there is arguably no cabinet position more important than energy secretary. Perry, who once studied animal husbandry and has in the past actually recommended abolishing the energy department, might not be the most qualified for the job. But he is an important representative of the Koch’s interests at the country’s most important table. A climate change denier, Perry has been pushing for more fossil fuel and has called attempts to replace them with renewables “immoral.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

Formerly nicknamed the “congressman from Koch,” Pompeo is a member of the Wichita, Kansas, business community—the Kochs’ home base. He made the jump into politics thanks almost entirely to the Kochs’ support. He has, in fact, received more money from the brothers than any other single individual. Pompeo has shown his gratitude toward his donors by favoring environmental deregulation on energy production, and by defending his benefactors in the public arena, including an op-ed unsubtly titled “Stop Harassing the Koch Brothers.”

Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross

The billionaire investor was a close personal friend of David Koch’s. He was photographed with the late financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein at a dinner party at his home in 2010. (Koch was among Epstein’s personal friends.) Ross and his wife later attended Koch’s 2016 holiday party.

Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao

Chao is the wife of Senate leader Mitch McConnell, and a regular guest at Koch donor events. As secretary of labor under US president George W. Bush, Chao spoke at the 2002 annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Koch Industries is a longtime member of ALEC’s corporate board. She was also a fellow of the Heritage Foundation, a think-tank closely tied to the Koch brothers’ political ambitions.

Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos

Trump appointed the billionaire and charter school advocate as education secretary in 2017. Her family has close ties to the Koch brothers’ political fundraising, donating millions in 2016 to super-PACs, including the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Action Fund. Devos is a regular attendee at the Kochs’ biannual donor meeting, and is a financial backer of Koch-affiliated groups such as Americans for Prosperity, and the George Mason University-based Mercatus Institute. In October 2018, the education secretary met privately with members of the Koch-funded group Youth Entrepreneurs at a Koch Industries office in Wichita, Kansas."

Myanmar's KBZ Bank hires legal powerhouse Williams & Connolly after holding company was implicated in UN report,https://www.cnbc.com,['Brian Schwartz'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/29/myanmar-kbz-bank-hires-williams-connolly-for-potential-legal-trouble.html,"One of the most lucrative private banks in Myanmar has hired a legal powerhouse after its holding company was implicated in a scathing United Nations report that blasted the country's military.

Kanbawza Bank has tapped Williams & Connolly, a U.S.-based law firm, to be the company's legal representatives in case U.S. sanctions arise from the U.N.'s fact finding mission. The report accuses Myanmar's military of having ties to a litany of businesses and that those dealings have led to extensive human rights abuses. The U.N. called for a criminal investigation into KBZ Bank's parent company, KBZ Group, for allegedly funding a border fence that has prevented Rohingya Muslims from returning to Myanmar after fleeing the country in 2017.

The firm sent a letter to the bank's CEO, Michael DeNoma, earlier this month and it describes the agreement between the two parties, including a $250,000 retainer.

""Williams & Connolly LLP will provide legal services to you in connection with potential US legal issues and sanctions matters which may arise out of an August 5, 2019 UN Human Rights Council Report on Myanmar,"" David Aufhauser, a partner in the firm, wrote. Aufhauser was previously a managing director and global general counsel at investment bank UBS.

The bank's new hire was discovered after CNBC reviewed foreign lobbying registration forms, with one of the documents describing other responsibilities that may involve having to reach out to members of President Donald Trump's administration, congressional lawmakers and the U.N. itself.

""Additional services will potentially include providing advice regarding legal consequences of the report, providing advice on lobbying and public relations issues related to the representation, lobbying U.S. government officials in the Executive Branch, Congress,and/or the United Nations, and discussing the matter with U.S. or international media organizations,"" the exhibit reads.

The U.N., Aufhauser and KBZ Bank did not return requests for comment.

The effort by KBZ Bank to retain a marquee legal team suggests there are internals fears of severe backlash after the U.N. report, especially from foreign governments such as the U.S. The bank itself has always been held in a high regard around the world.

The Milken Institute, a economic think tank based out of California, described KBZ Bank in a 2017 study as a firm that dominates the Myanmar market.

""Among the privately owned banks, the so-called 'Big Three' dominate the market,"" the study says. ""Combined, Kanbawza Bank (KBZ), Ayeyarwady Bank (AYA), and Co-operative Bank (CB) control about two-thirds of all loans, two-thirds of all deposits, and more than 50 percent of all bank branches in the country.""

Italy inches toward new govt as Trump backs Conte's return as PM,https://www.reuters.com,"['Gavin Jones', 'Min Read']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-5star/italys-5-star-opposition-clash-over-potential-cabinet-roles-idUSKCN1VH0QT,"ROME (Reuters) - The two parties trying to form a new Italian government made progress toward a coalition deal on Tuesday, cheering financial markets as well as U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he hoped Giuseppe Conte would be reinstated as prime minister.

The role of Conte has been a sticking point in the negotiations between the 5-Star Movement, a member of the outgoing coalition, and the opposition Democratic Party (PD), which has been resisting his reappointment.

“Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Conte,” Trump said on Twitter. “A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister.”

After setbacks early on Tuesday the roller-coaster talks between the anti-establishment 5-Star and the center-left PD appeared to be back on track later in the day, with upbeat comments from both sides prompting a strong market rally.

Italian 10-year bond yields fell to three-year lows, and the spread between German Bunds narrowed to below 182 basis points, the tightest since May 2018.

Tensions persist and surprises are possible, however.

Late on Tuesday, a PD source said talks were still at risk of failure over the post of deputy prime minister, saying 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio was insisting on retaining that role in a new coalition despite strong opposition to this from the PD.

Even if a deal were struck, it would need to survive an online vote of 5-Star party members, the party said in a blog post. Many of its rank and file are hostile to the PD and have used social media to urge Di Maio against doing a deal.

Investors, though, are betting that Italy will avoid snap elections, fearing they would be won by Matteo Salvini’s hard-right League party, which would put Rome on a collision course with the European Union over expansionary government spending.

“Our work is continuing in a fruitful way,” the PD’s Senate leader Andrea Marcucci told reporters in brief comments after an evening meeting with 5-Star officials.

Deputy PD leader Paola De Micheli said the two sides had “analyzed points for the basis of a common program”, while 5-Star’s Senate chief Stefano Patuanelli reported a “good climate” and said contacts would continue on Wednesday.

The parties are due to report back to President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday from 1400 GMT. If no deal has been sealed he will name a caretaker government and call elections.

Conte, who belongs to no party but is close to 5-Star, resigned last week after League chief Salvini declared his 14-month coalition with 5-Star was dead, seeking to trigger elections and capitalize on his surging popularity.

The move has not gone to plan, as 5-Star and the PD seek to form a coalition of their own, pushing the League into opposition.

FIGHT OVER JOBS

Earlier on Tuesday the PD/5-Star talks seemed to have run into trouble, with the two sides fighting over key jobs as well as being at loggerheads over Conte’s role.

The PD accused 5-Star of undermining the formation of a new cabinet by demanding the interior ministry for Di Maio. 5-Star denied this, and the parties canceled a scheduled meeting.

The PD says Di Maio is insisting on keeping the role of deputy prime minister that he held in the outgoing government, something it considers unacceptable if Conte is to stay on as premier.

It remains to be seen if the exchanges are merely tactics to secure the upper hand in negotiations over cabinet jobs, or whether they have the potential to scupper an accord between the two parties which have always been bitter adversaries.

The picture is complicated by deep internal divisions in both parties, each one split between leadership factions that want a deal and others that would prefer to risk an election.

Di Maio was absent at the start of an evening meeting of all the 5-Star lawmakers. The great majority favors an accord with the PD rather than a snap election which would probably see many lose their seats less than 18 months into this parliament.

Meanwhile Salvini continues to demand elections, and is likely to be disappointed by Trump’s endorsement of Conte, especially as the populist League chief has always expressed his admiration for the U.S. president.

Opinion polls suggest the League has lost 3-7 percentage points since collapsing the government, though it remains easily the most popular party, followed by the PD and 5-Star."
Kentucky AG: Labor Cabinet hasn’t secured coal mining bonds | The State,https://www.thestate.com,"['The Associated Press', 'Martin Crutsinger', 'Ap Economics Writer']",,,,https://www.thestate.com/news/business/national-business/article234520787.html,"Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear says the state's Labor Cabinet hasn't secured the necessary bonds from coal companies that would cover wage payments to miners if their employer unexpectedly shuts down.

State law requires performance bonds from certain companies in business for less than five years. Beshear says 1,000 miners are working for coal companies that haven't paid the bond.

His ministry said about 1,000 people of Slovenian origin live in Venezuela of which around 100 were expected to ask for resettlement in Slovenia. The government expects to spend at least 200,000 euros ($222,880.00) for the process this year.

""(This) repatriation is...mostly a logistical and integration challenge. We need to ensure a safe exit from the crisis area and establish acceptable conditions for life in Slovenia,"" the ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters.

President Trump may think he’s keeping Chinese negotiators guessing with his whiplash-inducing remarks about the U.S.-China trade war.

But he’s not fooling anyone here.

More than a year into the deepening commercial conflict, Chinese officials and analysts say they’ve got a handle on the tweeter-in-chief and are no longer fazed by his unpredictable initiatives.

“There is a lot of fatigue with President Trump’s ‘art of the deal,’ ” said Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization and an adviser to China’s cabinet.

“It’s like a roller coaster. Buenos Aires, Osaka, Shanghai. He says one thing one day, then hits the world with a surprise the next day,” Wang said, referring to the sites of high-level, if ill-fated, negotiating sessions. “The more they deal with him, the more they figure him out.”

At the Group of Seven leaders’ summit in Biarritz, France, this weekend, Trump brushed aside complaints that his habit of swerving between tough talk and a salesman’s hype was damaging the global economy.

“Sorry! It’s the way I negotiate,” he told reporters Monday. “It’s done very well for me over the years. It’s doing very well for the country.”

It hasn’t, however, produced a deal that would commit China to make the structural changes in its state-led economy that the administration has been seeking for more than a year.

Trump has announced tariffs that by Dec. 15 will cover almost 97 percent of the Chinese merchandise that American companies import, according to economist Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

By depressing demand for Chinese goods, U.S. tariffs have cost 3 million Chinese factory workers their jobs, according to Trump, and put pressure on Chinese President Xi Jinping to make a deal.

Trump’s claim to have the upper hand at the negotiating table does not appear to have convinced the Chinese.

“They’ve decided Trump is a vacillating guy who can’t figure out what he wants and gets spooked every time the stock market goes down or someone accuses him of not being tough,” said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy in Beijing. “Although there are problems in China, they believe they have their economy under control, more so than Trump. They think he is more vulnerable to a slowdown and that they can afford to wait him out.”

[Trump retaliates in trade war by demanding companies cut ties with China ]

By early May, the two sides had completed 90 percent of a deal involving major Chinese purchases of American farm, industrial and energy products as well as enhanced protections for foreign companies’ technology and trade secrets, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this summer.

But the trade war between the world’s economic superpowers appears to have entered a dangerous new phase this month, with new rounds of retaliatory tariffs and a demand from Trump that U.S. companies stop doing business with China.

That has caused alarm across the globe, with fears that the war could help tip leading economies such as Japan and Germany into recession and create new head winds for the American economy. China’s growth rate has, meanwhile, slowed to its lowest rate in three decades.

Chinese officials were initially mystified by Trump’s unconventional style, and Xi is said to have faced criticism for underestimating Trump’s resolve to tackle China’s trading practices.

But emerging last week from this year’s Communist Party confab at the beach resort of Beidaihe, China’s leadership appears to have decided to hunker down.

“What’s the point of calling Xi Jinping ‘a good friend’ and ‘a great leader’ but still increasing tariffs?” asked Yao Xinchao, a trade professor at the University of International Business and Economics. “He’s a 70-ish-year-old man but speaks like a 7-year-old kid. We just can’t listen to what he says now. I think Chinese leaders have realized this, too.”

Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at the Renmin University, shares a similarly disdainful view. “He is a real estate developer; he is a profiteer in the eyes of the Chinese people,” he said.

[‘Protectionist bullying’: China denounces Trump administration’s latest tariff hikes ]

But the bottom line remains that China, which is experiencing a marked economic slowdown, wants a deal.

“The trade dispute between China and the U.S. should be resolved through dialogue and consultations,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday, adding that the United States’s “maximum-pressure approach hurts both sides and is not in the least constructive.”

“We hope that the U.S. can exercise restraint, return to reason, and demonstrate sincerity in order to facilitate further consultations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefits,” Geng said.

The question now is how the two sides find a way out of the standoff.

Wei Jianguo, a former vice minister of commerce, said Trump’s efforts to browbeat countries such as Canada, Mexico and Japan into making a deal will not work with China.

“We have seen and understand Trump’s style,” Wei said. “If he thinks he can secure an advantage for the U.S. and wear China down by exerting various kinds of extreme pressure, he’s dreaming. It’s impossible.”

[With the U.S.-China trade war escalating, Trump arrives at G-7 with a list of grievances ]

The longer this pattern continues, the more China becomes concerned that any deal won’t stick.

“Now China understands him thoroughly and knows that inconsistency is his nature,” said Wang, of Renmin University. “Even if an agreement is signed, he may not implement it well. But, without an agreement, he does this over and over again, which is also very annoying.”

Many analysts expect the dispute to continue to at least November, when the two leaders are likely to meet at a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Chile.

Xi, meanwhile, confronts domestic political challenges that likely reduce his willingness to make concessions under foreign pressure. The authorities in Beijing face a growing crisis in Hong Kong, where protests aimed at preserving the city’s special status continue, and are preoccupied by preparations to celebrate in early October the politically charged 70th anniversary of the Communist Party’s takeover of China.

Buhari kept the petroleum portfolio for himself, as in his first term, and appointed Timipre Silva as the junior minister, who is widely expected to manage the portfolio on a day-to-day basis.

Silva, a former governor of Bayelsa state in the southern Niger Delta oil production heartlands, replaces former ExxonMobil executive Emmanuel Kachikwu who was the country’s main representative at OPEC meetings.

Nigeria, which has Africa’s biggest economy, remains heavily reliant on crude oil sales despite efforts by Buhari to boost non-oil revenues since he first took office in 2015. Oil receipts account for about 90% of foreign exchange and low oil prices helped to push the country into recession in 2016.

The move to assign portfolios comes six months after Buhari won a presidential election and nearly three months after his second term began. The time taken to appoint ministers caused jitters amongst investors and threatened growth prospects.

Zainab Ahmed, who became finance minister in September last year after her predecessor resigned, retained the position with additional responsibilities for the budget and national planning.

The cabinet of 43 ministers faces a long list of challenges including tepid growth following Nigeria’s emergence from recession in 2017, high unemployment and galloping inflation that has hit the poorest people in a nation of 190 million people, most of whom live on less than $2 a day.

And security forces have been stretched as they try to tackle Islamists waging a decade-long insurgency in the northeast, banditry in the northwest and clashes between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities over dwindling arable land in central states.

“The core objectives of this administration are to improve security, achieve diversified, inclusive economic growth and fight corruption,” Buhari told his cabinet at the swearing in ceremony.

The ministry of power, housing and works - created to address challenges related to the country’s ailing electricity and transport infrastructure when Buhari first took office in 2015 - was broken up.

Babatunde Fashola, a former governor of commercial hub Lagos state who headed that super ministry in the first term, was named minister for housing and works.

Sale Mamman, a businessman and former ministry of works official, was given the power portfolio. His task will be to tackle a poor electricity supply that holds back everything from manufacturing to education, while addressing spiraling debts that have crippled the power sector and held back investment.

“We have seen an exodus of the more capable and technocratic ministers and in their place there are politically connected replacements,” said Malte Liewerscheidt, vice president at Teneo Intelligence.

He said some of the new entrants were stalwarts in Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party, who appear to have been rewarded for helping him to win February’s election, while others were part of a bid to solidify the party’s base in some parts of the country ahead of elections in 2023.

“There are no real surprises here. The potential for positive change is rather limited,” said Liewerscheidt."
Kentucky AG: Labor Cabinet hasn't secured coal mining bonds,https://www.beaumontenterprise.com,[],,,,https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/Kentucky-AG-Labor-Cabinet-hasn-t-secured-coal-14399929.php,"Kentucky AG: Labor Cabinet hasn't secured coal mining bonds

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear says the state's Labor Cabinet hasn't secured the necessary bonds from coal companies that would cover wage payments to miners if their employer unexpectedly shuts down.

Beshear, a Democrat running for governor, announced on Thursday that his office examined records of Kentucky companies that should be required to pay the bonds. State law requires performance bonds from certain companies in business for less than five years. Beshear says 1,000 miners are working for coal companies that haven't paid the bond.

Some Kentucky miners were left with bounced paychecks after one coal company, West Virginia-based Blackjewel, filed for bankruptcy on July 1. Some of those miners are protesting the lack of payments by blocking a coal shipment sitting on railroad tracks in Harlan County."
Trump shifts disaster fund money over to illegal immigration fight,https://www.ajc.com,['Jamie Dupree'],,,,https://www.ajc.com/blog/jamie-dupree/trump-shifts-disaster-fund-money-over-illegal-immigration-fight/QMbnkpThDOoFsyD0vj34cN/,"With marine interests in the U.S. closely watching the track of Tropical Storm Dorian, the Trump Administration has moved to shift money out of FEMA's disaster relief fund and into federal efforts to deal with a surge of illegal immigrants along the border with Mexico, prompting complaints from Democrats.

In all, $271 million is being moved around inside the Department of Homeland Security budget to deal with the need for more immigrant detention beds, as well as money for immigration hearings.

“The Trump administration’s plan to divert money away from FEMA at the start of hurricane season to continue its efforts to separate and jail migrant families is backwards and cruel,"" said Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer.

""Once again, this administration is endangering America by moving funds away from emergency management for their extremist border agenda,"" said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR).

""As hurricane season approaches, is this really in the best interest of THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?"" tweeted Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-MI).

$155 million is coming out of the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund - all part of the effort to funnel more money to detention and hearing facilities used to process migrants detained by authorities.

""This is massively irresponsible,"" said Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL).

Money is also being shifted out of the Coast Guard and other accounts inside the Department of Homeland Security, in order to bolster efforts by the White House to house - and then deport migrants.

""This realignment of resources allows DHS to address ongoing border emergency crisis by alleviating the surge along the Nation’s Southwest Border while minimizing the risk to overall DHS mission performance,"" the department noted in a written statement.

The move comes as the number of people detained after illegally crossing the southern border has dropped in recent months, after it surged over 144,000 in the month of May, dropping back to 82,000 in July.

“This is beyond insensitive,” said Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) of the decision to move money out of FEMA and into illegal immigration efforts. “It's reckless.”

"U.S. emoluments clauses are the real ‘America First’ policy, but Trump ignores them",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Jamie Raskin', 'A Democrat', 'Represents Maryland S District In The U.S. House Of Representatives', 'Serves On The Judiciary', 'Oversight Committees. He Is An Emeritus Professor Of Constitutional Law At American University S Washington College Of Law.', 'August At Pm']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/28/whats-trumps-idea-america-first-g-cash-flowing-his-golf-resort/,"

President Trump speaks at the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz, France, on Monday. (Markus Schreiber/AP)

Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, represents Maryland’s 8th District in the U.S. House of Representatives and serves on the Judiciary and Oversight Committees. He is an emeritus professor of constitutional law at American University’s Washington College of Law.

President Trump thinks he has found the perfect site for the 2020 Group of Seven summit: the Trump National Doral golf resort. “We haven’t found anything that’s even close to competing with it,” he said from this year’s G-7 gathering in France.

His choice wasn’t exactly astonishing, considering that since he took office, Trump has visited his business properties at taxpayer expense 362 times; there have been 630 visits to Trump properties by at least 250 Trump administration officials, including White House staff members, Cabinet members and agency employees; and visits to Trump properties have been made by 111 officials representing 65 foreign governments, all according to a report from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

But if the public has grown wearily conditioned to expect Trump’s use of the government as an instrument of self-enrichment, we should also remember that the framers of the U.S. Constitution foresaw the potential for this kind of abuse of public office for private gain and did everything in their power to prevent it.

Alexander Hamilton, in the Federalist No. 72, warned that a day might come when a president treated the government as a get-rich-quick opportunity: “An avaricious man, who might happen to fill the office, looking forward to a time when he must at all events yield up the emoluments he enjoyed, would feel a propensity, not easy to be resisted by such a man, to make the best use of the opportunity he enjoyed while it lasted.”

[Trump is getting payments from foreign governments. We have no idea what they are.]

The framers wrote the foreign emoluments clause — the original and true “America First” policy — in Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution, to prevent the president and other federal officials from accepting, without congressional consent, “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” And they wrote the domestic emoluments clause in Article II, Section 1, Clause 7, which authorizes a fixed presidential salary that may be neither increased nor reduced by Congress during a president’s term, and which specifies that the president “shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.”

A G-7 summit at Trump Doral would violate both clauses, as it would mean huge payments to a Trump resort from both foreign government guests attending and participating federal agencies.

Trump’s ongoing use of the presidency as a for-profit enterprise contrasts sharply with the understanding of his predecessors. Take, for example, one of Trump’s heroes, President Andrew Jackson, one model for Trump’s vindictive brand of nationalism. When the government of Colombia presented Jackson with a ceremonial gold medallion, he described the gift as “most gratifying,” but understood that he could not keep it without congressional consent and promptly turned it over to Congress, which directed him to deposit it with the State Department.

In 1840, President Martin Van Buren reported a gift from the imam of Muscat (later Oman) of two Arabian horses and saddles, four cashmere shawls, a case of rose oil, a Persian carpet and a box of pearls; Congress made him deposit these objects with the National Institute Gallery and sell the horses. President Abraham Lincoln took care to disclose gifts of two elephant tusks and a sword from the king of Siam (later Thailand), which Congress directed him to deposit with the Interior Department.

These presidents joined all the others in internalizing the basic logic of the foreign emoluments clause: that in a nation that fought a revolution to break free of foreign domination by monarchical power, and whose Constitution commits us to the sovereignty of “We the People,” our elected officials are prohibited from pocketing payments, big or small, of any kind, from foreign rulers seeking political influence and leverage with our government.

It is only Trump — the president who dusted off “America First,” the mantra of anti-Semites and isolationists in the 20th century, and redeployed it for immigrant-bashing and impetuous trade wars in the 21st — who refuses to accept the honest-to-goodness America-first policy spelled out in our Constitution by American revolutionaries in the 18th. He has reaped hundreds of thousands, if not millions, from foreign governments patronizing his properties. Yet he has never asked for Congress’s consent for any of it, as the Constitution requires.

[Congress isn’t just a co-equal branch. We’re first among equals.]

The framers wanted to guarantee that the president would conduct government business with undivided loyalty to the American people and only in pursuit of the national good. And it is Congress’s prerogative to decide that a particular gift or payment poses no threat of corruption, and to allow it. (If Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen sent Trump a book about the history of Greenland, I might be persuaded to vote to let him keep it.) But that choice, in all cases, belongs to the representatives of the people, not the president — as James Madison insisted in the Federalist No. 10, “No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity.”

Since taking office, Trump has continuously pocketed large sums of money, not mere trinkets, including from foreign states and monarchs. Ever since his inauguration, when he chose not to divest himself of his business interests and the Trump Organization hired a “director of diplomatic sales” to recruit foreign government contracts for its hotels, dignitaries have been spending freely at Trump properties. Foreign governments have also handed out lucrative regulatory benefits to Trump business entities abroad. In 2017, the Associated Press reported that the Chinese government “granted preliminary approval for 38 new Trump trademarks” shortly after Trump was inaugurated.

According to one report, when an organization linked to Saudi Arabian lobbying interests spent about $270,000 at the Trump hotel in Washington early in his administration, Trump didn’t report it. In 2018, a delegation accompanying Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stayed at the Trump International Hotel in New York City, and the hotel’s quarterly revenue got a sudden boost. There’s no official accounting of these payments, but Trump’s 2015 campaign remark is instructive: “Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them?”

[The game was rigged in Ivanka Trump’s favor. How did her brand manage to fail?]

Given human nature, I doubt Hamilton would have been surprised at all by Trump’s subsequent determination to aggressively resist the U.S. intelligence community’s finding, and all the supporting evidence, that Salman was almost certainly involved in the brutal assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Paradoxically, it’s almost certain that Trump knows he’s violating the Constitution because he has essentially admitted it. He gave away the game when the Trump Organization sent checks this year and last, totaling about $343,000, to disgorge what are described as profits from foreign government spending at Trump hotels.

He clearly seeks our absolution in return for this honor-system emolument rebate to the government, but it all amounts to sleight of hand: The Constitution doesn’t prevent the president only from taking profits from foreign government payments, it prevents him from taking any foreign government payments unless he obtains Congress’s consent first. He has not obtained congressional permission to keep either the net profits or the gross proceeds collected from various governments that have paid for Trump hotel stays and thrown parties at his clubs and restaurants. Nor has he accounted for what he has received and from whom, an act of omission that advertises his contempt for Congress and keeps us in the dark about the extent of his moneymaking while he’s clocked in as president. As Reuters recently reported, “The governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Thailand and the European Union got the green light” from the State Department “to rent a combined eight units in Trump World Tower and followed through with leases” without congressional approval.

The president’s lawyers say the emoluments clause applies only to gifts or compensation in exchange for official acts, not to private business transactions, arguing that the clause “is not a blanket prohibition on commercial transactions with foreign governments by businesses in which the official has a financial interest.” But this pinched interpretation clashes with the text of the Constitution, executive branch norms and judicial analysis. In a 1993 opinion, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel emphasized that “the language of the emoluments clause is both sweeping and unqualified,” and cited a 1970 Government Accountability Office decision that stated that the Constitution’s drafters “intended the prohibition” on accepting emoluments “to have the broadest possible scope and applicability.” In an April opinion, Federal Judge Emmet G. Sullivan analyzed the “text, structure, adoption, historical interpretation, and purpose of the Clause, as well as Executive Branch practice,” and rejected the claim that it does not apply to business payments to the president.

The issue, in any event, is the president’s appalling self-dealing. And it is Congress, which has ultimate authority over emoluments, and which must act to redeem and restore the constitutional design. The framers sought to sweep away the corruption inherent in monarchy and feudalism, systems of personal privilege for the few and inequality for the many. The same section of Article I containing the foreign emoluments clause provides that the United States shall grant “No Title of Nobility.” We have no royals here, and our elected officials must always remain the faithful servants of the people, not the agents of tyrants from nations still hungry for their own democratic revolutions; nor should elected officials, including and especially the president, use their position to line their own pockets with foreign tribute or taxpayer money. The framers gave us the America-first policy we need. Trump is shredding it."
Attacks by US extremists lead to push for anti-terror laws,https://www.ktuu.com,['Andrew Selsky Associated Press'],,,,https://www.ktuu.com/content/news/Attacks-by-US-extremists-lead-to-push-for-anti-terror-laws-558670651.html,"A white man opens fire at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, targeting Mexicans and killing 22 people.

(AP Photo/John Locher, File)

The two mass shootings and a presidential tweet put a spotlight on the idea of ""domestic terrorism,"" adding momentum to a debate about whether such attacks should be classified and tried in the same way as crimes against America by foreign extremist groups and their supporters. A Republican senator and a Democrat in the House of Representatives are drafting bills to do that while some Republicans call for a left-wing group to be designated a terrorist organization.

""Domestic terrorism is in our backyard and we need to call it and treat it under the law the same as other forms of terrorism,"" said U.S. Sen. Martha McSally, an Arizona Republican who intends to introduce legislation when Congress returns in September.

McSally's proposal would allow federal law enforcement to charge suspects with acts of domestic terror and add punishments for those crimes, including the death penalty.

Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, introduced legislation on Aug. 16 that he says is a ""very high priority.""

""The goal is to put domestic terrorism at the same level of priority as ISIS- or al-Qaida-inspired terrorism, since Americans on American soil now are just as likely, if not more likely, to die at the hand of a domestic terrorist motivated by some hateful ideology like white supremacy,"" Schiff said in a telephone interview.

Separately, two Republican senators are calling for an anti-fascist movement known as antifa to be designated as a domestic terrorist organization. The push comes after clashes between white supremacists and antifa in Portland, Oregon, which drew a tweet from President Trump suggesting domestic terrorism designation for antifa but not the white supremacists. Such a designation does not currently exist.

While a push to rethink what should be deemed terrorism gains some momentum, it has sparked concerns about infringement of constitutional rights. It's also not clear whether the debate will be embraced in a bipartisan way, though McSally said this week that her bill has received ""a lot of positive feedback ... from both sides of the aisle.""

Schiff said he hopes for ""bipartisan support for an effort to put the full weight of the federal government behind the prosecution of people committing these hateful acts of domestic mass terror.""

Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas is working on ""legal mechanisms"" that would enable domestic terrorist organizations to be treated like those on the State Department's list of foreign extremist groups, his spokeswoman Maria Jeffrey said in an email.

Cruz and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, introduced a resolution on July 18 condemning antifa, and calling for it to be designated as a domestic terrorist organization.

As antifa activists prepared to square off against far-right demonstrators in Portland, Oregon, on Aug. 17, President Donald Trump tweeted that ""major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an 'ORGANIZATION of TERROR.'""

Currently, only foreign groups can be labeled terrorist organizations. The U.S. State Department maintains that list , currently comprising 68 groups — none of which is white supremacist. It is a crime for a person in the United States to knowingly provide ""material support or resources"" to a foreign terrorist organization.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, said he doesn't believe Congress should enable the executive branch to designate groups as domestic terrorists.

""I wouldn't trust this administration to exercise such power in an unbiased and judicious manner,"" Merkley said.

The Anti-Defamation League says antifa hasn't been accused of any murders, and that there is no comparison between the loosely organized movement and the white supremacist groups it sometimes clashes with. Antifa uses ""unacceptable tactics"" but rejects racism, while white supremacists use more extreme violence to intimidate minorities, the ADL said.

Schiff denounced Trump's tweet as ""a disservice to our efforts to combat domestic mass terror.""

""I see it as the same destructive political posturing we've come to expect from the president, that would argue white supremacists' hate is not the problem, antifa is the problem,"" Schiff said.

Mary McCord, who used to lead the Justice Department's National Security Division, said labeling domestic groups as terrorist organizations would infringe on First Amendment rights such as freedom of expression. Instead, she advocates making domestic terrorism a federal crime, which would enable prosecution for providing material support. Such support could include providing funds, a safe haven or weapons.

The most common international terrorism charge is providing material support, accounting for nearly half of federal terrorism-related prosecutions since Sept. 11, 2001, McCord said.

Schiff said his bill would allow the prosecution of providing material support to a domestic terrorist.

Jeanne Theoharis, a political science professor at Brooklyn College who has written several books on civil rights, worries about such a provision.

""What material support does is allow for going after people whose beliefs and associations are well outside the mainstream,"" Theoharis said. ""It provides a way for the government to go after people whose politics they don't like.""

Trump is either trolling everyone or thinks he's like a god,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/21/politics/erratic-trump-god-complex/index.html,"(CNN) There's been a change in President Donald Trump . He used to say he had accomplished more than any other President, a debatable claim. But now he's using messianic language about himself .

That was after he quoted a conspiracy theorist who described him, literally, as being like the King of Israel and said Jews ""love him like the second coming of God"" - -- also known as the Messiah.

Then Trump joked in front of a group of veterans about giving himself the Medal of Honor -- an award that recognizes the highest levels of military valor.

The Times wasn't arguing that the idea of buying Greenland was a bad one but that Trump's decision to go diplomatically nuclear with Denmark -- a tiny country that has been a steady military ally -- over a perceived slight involving a real estate offer that wasn't even officially made is surreal.

And that's the point. Trump's reality -- where countries can be bought and sold and where it's worth spending a day rhetorically fighting Denmark -- is different from other people's.

His amazingly thin skin, his combative foreign policy, his complete rejection of diplomacy, his demand for complete loyalty all come at a very real public cost.

He continues to pursue nuclear talks with a regime run by an infantile strongman with whom he feels he has a good relationship despite most diplomats saying he has enabled anti-US propaganda.

His paranoia about a deep state and a witch hunt out to ruin his presidency has threatened American confidence in the justice system and the intelligence community.

His supreme belief in his negotiating ability has alienated American allies and brought the country into a trade war with China that increasingly threatens the world economy.

His inability to back down led to the longest partial government shutdown in US history.

There's been a historic level of turnover in his Cabinet as he turns hot and cold and then either discards top aides very publicly or is abandoned by them.

And the misstated facts and outright lies he spreads seem to be increasing and not decreasing during his time in the White House. CNN's Daniel Dale counted 84 false claims emitted from the President either by tweet or by mouth last week. That was, according to Dale, a record during the last six weeks. Trump's all-time record came just before the 2018 midterms, so stay tuned for more from Trump as the presidential campaign heats up.

It is not just his inability to use facts, however. Everything becomes about him. Even during his trip to El Paso to comfort the victims of gun violence, he bragged about this size of his rally there months before and criticized the city's mayor as a RINO

Either he's trolling everyone, saying outlandish things to get a rise or, as some psychiatrists viewing him from afar have argued for some time, he may be becoming delusional.

As far as the Constitution is concerned, it might not matter what his mental state is. The mechanism to remove a President from office for unfitness is the 25th Amendment, which requires a mutiny of his Cabinet, large portions of which aren't filled by permanent officials. He's in office and surrounded by people who never publicly disagree with him.

But just because he is President and there's little or no chance he'd ever be removed does not mean there's not cause for concern when he starts sounding like he has a God complex.

His former communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who was fired by Trump and was then a surrogate for him, has fully turned on the President and is encouraging fellow Republicans to do the same."

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)

Taking their cue from red states that regularly banded together to sue the Obama administration, Democratic attorneys general began challenging the Trump administration in court the first month President Trump took office, starting with the travel ban.

The litigation by coalition has continued unabated, with at least six multistate lawsuits filed against Trump policies in August alone, most prominently against the president’s attempt to deny green cards and visa extensions to foreign nationals seeking public assistance.

Those August suits brought the total to 87 multistate legal actions in the 31 months since Trump took office, according to a database compiled by Marquette University political scientist Paul Nolette.

The litigant states tend to be the same in most cases, among them California, New York, Washington, Connecticut, Illinois, Hawaii, Vermont, Massachusetts and Colorado, along with the District of Columbia.

The figures surpass the 78 multistate suits against President Barack Obama in eight years and the 76 against President George W. Bush during his two terms, according to Nolette.

The most frequent state litigants against Obama included Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and North Carolina.

The Democratic litigants are finding greater success against Trump than the Republicans did against Obama, said Nolette, with 40 victories and nine losses under their belt, a success rate of 82 percent. Winning, in Nolette’s database, includes completed cases as well as cases still being appealed.

Their most dramatic recent win came when the Supreme Court halted the administration’s plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.

The figures present only a partial picture of Trump’s record in court as hundreds of cases have been brought by advocacy groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, environmental organizations like the Sierra Club and civil rights activists such as Lambda Legal.

Overall, according to a Washington Post count, the Trump administration has been on the losing end of at least 85 federal court decisions, many of which are being appealed.

The GOP attorneys general still have plenty to brag about in their battles against Obama: They chalked up 40 wins and 25 losses, a success rate of about 62 percent, with six cases still pending, Nolette said.

Their highest profile victories were securing an injunction from a Texas judge halting Obama’s deferred 2014 action program (DAPA) designed to protect millions of immigrant parents in the country illegally from being deported, and a ruling from another Texas judge that would effectively wipe out President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

Nolette said in an interview that he had not yet calculated Bush’s won-lost record but he believed it was about the same as Obama’s.

The proliferation of multistate suits, Nolette said, represents a fundamental shift in the constitutional order.

Presidents, faced with divided government and gridlocked Congresses, have resorted more to unilateral executive decisions and agency action to change policy.

Both are more vulnerable to court challenges than acts of Congress and that encourages states to litigate.

“It’s a good indication of how much the partisan battle has shifted from what ostensibly is supposed to be a democratic institution, Congress, to institutions further outside the public eye,” he said.

Indeed, attorneys general such as California’s Xavier Becerra and New York’s Letitia James, both Democrats, along with Texas’s Ken Paxton, a Republican, have used the litigation to significantly raise their national profiles, taking on roles historically reserved for members of Congress.

Multistate litigation also provides greater opportunity for forum shopping. Despite the protestations of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. (“We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges”) partisan litigators have good reason to believe they will fare better in judicial circuits with more judges appointed by presidents of their own party.

Lawsuits against Trump administration policies, for example, have thrived in the federal courts within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, particularly in California, Montana and Washington, where Democratic appointees have been in the majority for many years, an advantage shrinking as new Trump appointees join their ranks.

Republican attorneys general prefer the 5th Circuit, which includes Texas, where they believe they get more sympathy from the large number of Republican appointees.

They chose Texas for the Affordable Care Act litigation, just as Democrats chose New York and California as the main battlegrounds over the census."

Former Gov. John Hickenlooper clearly is not going to be the Democratic presidential nominee to run against Donald Trump. Some are prompting him, as the most recognizable name, to run for the U.S. Senate against Cory Gardner despite seeming little in his experience or temperament that fits into a legislative position.

His best prospect for a job post-election, should Democrats succeed in ousting the sitting president, is a Cabinet position in the next administration — perhaps interior secretary (though environmentalists will disagree here). His best move politically would be to work hard for the eventual nominee and hope for the best.

What about us, Chase Bank?

Last week, Chase Bank announced it is forgiving all credit card debt for Canadian customers. Chase closed all Canadian credit card accounts in March 2018, so rather than collect the payments that are legitimately owed, Chase just decided to forgive all those loans.

Who will pay for this magnanimous act? We will, in the form of higher interest rates and higher fees. I think we should cut up our Chase credit cards and send them to Chase with a note stating that we want to be treated the same as our northern neighbors.

A price too high to pay?

Re: “Protections for endangered species weakened by order,” Aug. 13 news story

The Trump administration has again displayed its core values by announcing a revision of the successful Endangered Species Act, with a healthy nod to industry. “Economic costs” are now a key factor in determining whether or not a species receives protection, thus placing the almighty dollar in a judgmental position on the sanctity and diversity of life in an interdependent ecosystem.

This precarious situation of deciding “who stays and who goes” based on financial interests is bound to be a blind and disastrous bargain. But the Trump administration continues to scorn even the most basic of environmental science.

Epstein’s fate

Re: “Epstein’s apparent suicide is unfathomable,” Aug. 12 commentary

I am not a believer in an afterlife, but in the case of Jeffrey Epstein, I’ll make an exception. There should be no escape. Guilt, shame and penitence for eternity seems fair.

Dangerous decision on scooters

Re: “Death raises safety concerns,” Aug. 13 news story

I honestly can’t imagine what Denver’s “study” process was that resulted in continuing to allow hundreds of electric scooters to be operated in our city. I realize the recent death occurred after the review, but there were hundreds of injuries and, based on my observations, the fatality was inevitable.

I live downtown, and what I have never seen is a rider wearing a helmet — not one. I have seen some responsible, lawful riders. But what I have seen many times is scooting the wrong way on streets and bike lanes, zooming along sidewalks, slaloming around pedestrians, zipping across streets midblock, etc.

So Denver recommends a helmet, and the companies take a break from counting cash to say safety is good, and provide tutorials or offer a helmet? Thank you both for your caring and commitment to public safety.

What is the G7? Here's the History of the Conference,https://time.com,['Julia Webster'],,,,https://time.com/5657375/what-is-g7/,"Heads of state are meeting on Saturday for a two-day summit in the southern French city of Biarritz. President Emmanuel Macron is this year’s host and wants the meeting to focus on fighting inequality and protecting biodiversity and climate.

Here’s everything you need to know about the conference of world leaders.

What does G7 stand for?

G7 stands for “Group of Seven” industrialized nations. It used to be known as the G8 (Group of Eight) until 2014 when Russia was excluded because of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

Why was G7 created?

The G7 was created more than four decades ago as an annual gathering of political leaders to discuss and exchange ideas on a broad range of issues, including global economy, security and energy.

France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany formed the Group of Six in 1975 so that the noncommunist powers could come together to discuss economic concerns, which at the time included inflation and recession following an OPEC oil embargo. Canada joined the following year. Russia eventually joined in 1998 — and its inclusion was meant as a signal of cooperation between East and West after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991.

The G7 is an informal bloc and takes no mandatory decisions, so the leaders’ declarations at the end of the summit are not binding.

Which countries are members of the G7?

The group includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, France and Italy. Together, the G7 countries represent 40% of global GDP and 10% of the world’s population.

The European Union has been involved in G7 work since 1977, and is represented at the summit by the President of the European Commission (the E.U.’s executive branch) Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. The E.U. has gradually been included in all political discussions on the agenda despite not having official member status.

This would have been Juncker’s last G7, as he is soon to be replaced by his successor, Ursula von der Leyen, following the European elections that took place in May. However, on Monday it was announced that Juncker will not travel to Biarritz for the summit since he needs to continue his recovery after having had emergency surgery at the weekend.

Why was Russia kicked out of the G8?

Russia was kicked out of the then G8 in 2014 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine, which was seen by leaders as a “violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.

President Barack Obama and other world leaders announced in a joint statement, titled The Hague Declaration, in March 2014 that they would cancel that year’s planned meeting in Sochi, Russia.

“Under these circumstances, we will not participate in the planned Sochi summit,” the statement said. “We will suspend our participation in the G8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G8 is able to have a meaningful discussion.”

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, a few days before his departure for the summit, Donald Trump said Russia should be allowed to re-join the G7 group. “I think it’s much more appropriate to have Russia in. It should be the G8 because a lot of the things we talk about have to do with Russia,” he said.

Next year it will be the turn of the United States to host the G7.

What’s the difference between G7 and G20?

They have similar names and similar functions. While the G7 mainly has to do with politics, the G20 is a broader group that focuses on the global economy. It’s also known as the “Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy” and represents 80% of global GDP.

It gathers leaders from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the European Union.

Founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998, the G20 started off as a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors. However, as a response to the financial crisis of 2008, the G20 was upgraded to head of state level in an inaugural summit in Washington, D.C.

This year’s G20 was chaired by Japan. The 2019 Osaka summit was the 14th meeting of the G20, held on 28-29 June 2019.

"The executive branch's job is to enforce laws, not make them",https://thehill.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/457996-the-executive-branchs-job-is-to-enforce-laws-not-make-them,"The Trump administration unveiled two controversial sets of regulations last week. One narrows the eligibility criteria for legal immigrant status. The other eases protections for threatened and endangered species. Both policies face legal challenges.

People can legitimately debate whether these rules make sense as a matter of policy and politics. The environmental regulations arguably do more to protect big business than animal species, while the new immigration regulations make it even harder for migrants to remain in the United States legally.

As a personal matter, judges might like or dislike these outcomes. But as a professional matter, some judges believe that, under the Constitution, only Congress has the express power to make laws — not agencies that answer to the president. These judges tend to be ideologically conservative. Will that crowd join progressives to criticize the new regulations, albeit for different reasons?

Not likely.

The argument against agency lawmaking was articulated most recently by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. He wrote the dissenting opinion in Gundy v. United States, a case involving lawmaking by the attorney general regarding the national sex offender registry. Gorsuch eloquently argued that lawmaking power belongs to Congress, and for good reason. Unlike career bureaucrats within the executive branch, Congress is democratically accountable to the people if they wind up making bad laws. Executive branch officials are supposed enforce the law, not create it. This is because — with the exception of the president — the people get no say in hiring and firing those in the executive branch.

To be sure, President Trump Donald John TrumpAdvocate calls for fundamental shift in criminal justice system Shame on Europe at the G-7 Senate GOP pledges to oppose any efforts to 'pack' Supreme Court MORE campaigned on aggressive elimination of federal regulations — which is a longstanding GOP objective — and has held to this promise. Proponents of deregulation argue that the federal administrative bureaucracy is bloated and inefficient, and that regulation of free markets is bad for businesses and bad for the economy. Everyone does better if the markets are allowed to function unimpeded by bureaucrats who wind up blocking progress and innovation.

That’s a fine position to take, of course — so long as what is good for the goose is also good for the gander. The problem with the conservative argument against lawmaking by agencies is that it’s often — and conveniently — abandoned once an agency does something that conservatives like politically.

Department of Commerce v. New York involved lawmaking by the Department of Commerce regarding the contents of the U.S. Census form. The Constitution gives the power to implement the Census to Congress — not the president. Congress handed that power off to the secretary of Commerce in a statute called the Census Act. Although this is what Congress did in the statute challenged in Gundy — to Gorsuch’s chagrin — he said nary a peep about the hand-off of legislative power in the Census Act.

Conservatives cannot have it both ways. Either delegation of lawmaking power by Congress to the executive branch is constitutionally acceptable or it is not.

One might argue that deregulation is taking regulations off the books, so it doesn’t involve lawmaking, and is less constitutionally objectionable. But that’s not what the Trump administration’s environmental and immigration regulations do. They make new laws.

Let’s start with the Endangered Species Act. It provides that “the Secretary shall by regulation . . . determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species.” That language is the “hand-off” of legislative power from Congress to the secretary of the Department of Commerce, whom today happens to be Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossHillicon Valley: Court delays ruling against Qualcomm | Google asks employees not to talk politics at work | Facebook releases early emails discussing Cambridge Analytica | Bannon to release anti-Huawei film Bannon to release anti-Huawei film 'Claws of the Red Dragon' Trump administration announces deal to avert tariffs on Mexican tomatoes MORE.

The statute then gives Ross a bunch of factors to use in deciding whether a species is endangered or threatened, including habitat destruction, overutilization of the species for commercial or other purposes, disease or predation, inadequate regulations or “other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.”

The agency’s regulations add new factors to this list, including the requirement that a threatened species must become endangered “within the foreseeable future.” For that determination, the agency must now consider factors like “threat-projection timeframes, and environmental variability.”

The immigration regulations are no less constitutionally objectionable. The Immigration and Nationality Act gives the secretary of Homeland Security the power to “establish . . . regulations” to implement the statute. (Again, that’s the “hand-off.”) The statute also states that “any alien who . . . is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible,” and provides a list of factors for use in deciding if someone is a “public charge,” including age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education and skills.

Once again, the agency’s new regulations add new factors to this list, defining “public charge” to also capture “any alien who receives one or more public benefits,” including federally-funded benefits such as housing assistance and Medicaid.

Handing off legislative power to agencies is not considered unconstitutional under current Supreme Court case law, and there are good reasons for tolerating the practice.

But if conservative judges are going to complain about them, they should do so across-the-board. The leaders of the agencies involved in these rulemakings were never on the ballot for the offices they hold. Voters who don’t like these laws cannot go to the polls and fire them. This is precisely why Gorsuch and other conservative judges have balked at lawmaking by agencies. It messes with the separation of powers.

The question for conservatives is this: If either of these laws were to reach the Supreme Court, would Gorsuch kvetch that this particular lawmaking by executive branch agencies is constitutionally objectionable? Or would he stay silent — as in the Census case — leaving us to wonder whether his constitutional purity is contingent on conservative ideology and politics?

Because if it’s the latter, then we might have politicians on the Supreme Court after all.

Venezuela’s Guaidó names shadow cabinet to help oust Maduro,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Scott Smith', 'August At Pm']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/venezuelas-guaido-names-a-shadow-cabinet-to-oust-maduro/2019/08/28/7ab98f1c-c9c0-11e9-9615-8f1a32962e04_story.html,"Venezuela’s National Assembly President Juan Guaido speaks during an extraordinary session to discuss the country’s humanitarian crisis in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, Aug. 27, 2019. (Ariana Cubillos/Associated Press)

CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó named a new shadow cabinet on Wednesday, launching the latest phase of his campaign aimed at forcing President Nicolás Maduro from power.

The new team — including heavyweight opposition figures Leopoldo López and Julio Borges — will be dedicated to preparing for a transitional government and new elections, said Guaidó, who claimed presidential powers in late January as head of the National Assembly, saying Maduro’s election last year was a fraud.

Guaidó has since gained support from more than 50 nations, named several foreign ambassadors to represent him abroad and appointed a board to oversee U.S.-based Citgo refineries, Venezuela’s most valuable foreign asset.

But the opposition leader has yet to wrest power from Maduro after seven months of trying.

Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, a geopolitical risk analyst who teaches at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said Guaidó’s so-called interim government functions more tangibly outside of Venezuela than at home.

“The shadow cabinet is relevant, however, in terms of shoring up domestic belief that the transition continues — despite its painfully drawn-out timeline,” Lansberg-Rodriguez said. “Any movement signals advancement to a certain extent.”

Guaidó said he’s calling on his political mentor López to serve as general coordinator, though López has lived in the Spanish ambassador’s home in Caracas for protection since launching a failed military uprising with Guaidó on April 30.

Opposition lawmaker Borges, who lives in exile in Colombia, will oversee Guaidó’s foreign relations, and other members of his team will deal with economic development, asset recovery and human rights.

For his part, Maduro rejects Guaidó as a puppet of the U.S. government, which he says is bent on exploiting Venezuela’s vast oil wealth. Despite the South American country’s deepening crisis, the socialist leader remains in office with support from the Venezuelan military and nations including Cuba, Russia, China and Turkey.

NSE profit falls 82pc on sluggish trade,https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke,['More This Author'],08-29-2019,2019,8,https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/NSE-profit-falls-on-sluggish-trade/2560-5252926-psnqrxz/index.html,"By BUSINESS DAILY

The decline in trading at the Nairobi bourse has hurt earnings of the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), which plunged 82 percent from Ksh133 million ($1.3 million) as at June 2018 to Ksh24 million ($240,000) in the first half of this year.

The NSE says that bond turnover in the first six months was only Ksh78 billion ($780 million) compared to Ksh108 billion ($1.08 billion) reported in the same period last year, limiting the firm’s ability to collect fees from transactions.

Equity trading levies declined by 28 percent from Ksh259 million ($2.5 million) last year to Ksh187 million ($1.8 million) in the six months.

“The decline in the equity turnover was a result of low domestic demand which saw an increase in asset allocation towards the fixed income assets,” NSE chief executive Geoffrey Odundo said Wednesday.

So bad is the activity at the equites market that the NSE counter is trading at Ksh11.4 ($0.11) a share near its 52-week low of Ksh10.6 ($0.10).

As the revenues declined, NSE was faced with higher costs as a result of restructuring pushing administrative costs from Ksh277 million ($2.7 million) to Ksh339 million($3.3 million).

“NSE reviewed its administrative costs leading to a one off staff restructuring cost of Ksh52 million (502,000). This is not expected to recur in the second half of 2019,” Mr Odundo said.

The bourse hopes for a saving grace in the derivatives market launched in July as well as return of foreign investors who may feel that a reduction of interest rates in the US Federal Reserve makes frontier markets such as Kenya worth the risk.

The NSE said it will increase interaction with investors in the second half as it tries to attract players to the Nairobi bourse.

The bourse will also leverage the 16 companies that have joined its Ibuka programme with a hope of making new listings.

The NSE recently lost KenolKobil which was bought by French firm Rubis Energies and has delisted while National Bank of Kenya is in the process of being acquired by KCB.

Express Kenya has also made attempts to leave the bourse."
